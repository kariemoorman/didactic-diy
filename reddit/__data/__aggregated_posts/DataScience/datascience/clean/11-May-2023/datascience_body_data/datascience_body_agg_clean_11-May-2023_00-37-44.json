economic pressure fear openai model go to become fancy ms office plugin go day of open research innovation however specific of deal tell different story to understand what go on need to peek behind curtain of tough business of machine learn find sam altman just orchestrate coup of decade to appreciate well why some three dimensional chess go on let first look at sam altman backstory let go stellar rise back in sam altman found loopt part of first ever yc batch raise total of in funding company fail to gain traction seven year into business loopt basically dead in water to shut down instead of cave manage to sell startup for to fintech company green dot investor get money back personally make from sale by yc standard pretty unimpressive outcome however people take note fire between ear burn hotter than of most people hot in fact paul graham include in essay about five founder who influence most list young sam altman next to steve job larry sergey from google paul buchheit creator of gmail adsense go on to describe strategic mastermind whose sheer force of go to get whatever want sam altman play hand well parley new connection into raise from peter thiel other to start invest within four year e money in addition paul graham make successor president of yc in within one decade of sell first startup for grow net worth to mind bending rise to circle of most influential people in silicon valley today ceo of openai one of most exciting impactful organization in all of tech however openai rocket ship of ai innovation in dire straight openai bleed cash back in openai kickstarte with in donation from famous donor such elon musk money long go in openai project revenue of at same time spend roughly hence company lose over last year alone probably not outli year openai headquarter in san francisco stable of employee of mostly machine learn rockstar hence salary alone probably come out to roughly pa in addition to high salary compute cost stupendous consider cost to train once likely cloud bill in very healthy nine figure range well where leave today before microsoft investment of openai receive total of over its lifetime with in fund burn rate of eight year of company history not take genius to figure out run low on cash reasonable to think openai sit on chatgpt other great model not just lease make killing yes no openai project revenue of for however unlikely pull off without significantly increase cost well here some reason why tough business of machine learn machine learn company distinct from regular software company on outside look feel similar people create product use code on inside thing very different to start off machine learning company usually way less profitable gross margin land in range much low than of saas business which high on one hand massive compute requirement thorny datum management problem drive up cost on other hand work itself sometimes resemble consult more than resemble software engineering everyone who work in field know training model require deep domain knowledge load of manual work on datum to illustrate latter point imagine unspeakable complexity of perform content moderation on chatgpt output openai scale usage of gpt in production need large team of moderator to filter label hate speech slur tutorial on kill people name alright alright alright machine learning hard openai already chatgpt work get to worth something foundation model become commodity in order to monetize gpt any of other model openai go two different route first pick one more vertical sell directly to consumer for example become ultimate copywriting tool blow jasper copyai out of water not go to happen reason for include to support mission of build competitive foundational ai tool huge burn rate need to capture one more very large vertical fundamentally need to re brand themselves diverge from original mission likely scare most of talent away need to build out sale marketing team such step fundamentally change culture inevitably dilute focus on research second option openai to keep what monetize access to model via api introduce pro version of chatgpt step in direction approach its own challenge model like gpt defensible moat just large transformer model train on very large open source dataset example last week andrej karpathy release video of code up version of gpt in afternoon nothing stop google stabilityai huggingface from open source own gpt result gpt inference become common good melt openai profit down to tiny bit of nothing in scenario also very hard time leverage branding to generate return since company integrate with openai api control interface to customer likely end up capture all of value argument make general problem of foundation model high fix cost lack of differentiation end up make akin to steel industry to sum up not way to sustainably monetize model not want probably should not build up internal sale marketing team to capture vertical need lot of money to keep fund research without get bogge down by detail of specific product development what should microsoft deal openai microsoft announce extension of partnership with investment on monday at point microsoft invest total of in openai moreover new vcs in on deal by buy up share of employee want to take some chip off table however astounding size not only extraordinary thing about deal first off ownership split across three group microsoft hold vcs another openai foundation control remaining of share openai start make money profit distribute differently across four stage first early investor probably khosla venture reid hoffman foundation get money back with interest after microsoft entitle to of profit until of funding repay initial funding repay microsoft remain vcs each get of profit continue until another pay out to microsoft vcs respectively once aforementioned money pay to investor of share return to foundation which regain total control over company what mean absolutely crazy openai manage to solve all of its problem at once raise boatload of money access to all compute need on top of solve distribution problem now access to microsoft sale team model integrate into ms office product microsoft also benefit heavily play at forefront ai brush up tool openai exclusive partner to far compete in bitter cloud war against aw synergy not stop openai well github aubsidiary of microsoft e g likely benefit heavily from partnership continue to develop github copilot deal create beautiful win win situation not even good part sam altman team at openai essentially manage to place giant hedge openai not manage to create anything meaningful enter new ai winter microsoft pay for party however openai create something in direction of agi whatever look
