  "hi how is it going for a long time i have been very perplexed as to why the poisson and exponential pdf are what they are all the textbooks just say here is the pdf integrate it to get the cdfthere you go but why the number e i am trying to really understand intuitively the exponential family of distributions from the ground up for example i fully understand the binomial from the viewpoint of combinations it is the different orderings of a string of is and is essentially weighted by their probabilities of occurring then you add up all the orderings where there are k is and that is px k i want to get that same intuition for the poisson and exponential distribution any good videos or books or articles",
  "so basically i have worked on a data science project with a professor in cannada and we got good results in a medical dataset and got a good auroc of and we published the paper for it and got selected but what surprised me was the professor never went through my code and just gave suggestions and tips to do improve the model but is not this a lot riskyeveryday i am scared that some person would go through my code and invalidate my entire results based on some simple error which could have been corrected if there were proper code reviews fast forward months i got a job in a data science company as an intern and he told me to develop self supervised model for their image dataset and i did that and it good kind of okay results and he told me to move on to another project still there was no code reviews or code checks do people in data science just blindly trust each others code i feel managers should at least give a look through to see if we taking the correct data split or if the model is correct or if there is any data leakagethere is a lot of red flags in trusting the auroc results blindly is this a norm or maybe its just for me moreover most of the data scientists in the company do not even write proper documentation and for interns like me its such a pain it took me weeks to understand their entire training repo data science people should talk with the data engineers and take some of their methods and practices",
  "hey everyone i just started a new role as a data analyst i have been loving the work and am so excited and passionate about this career field one thing i am starting to think about now is future wise what direction i want to take my career in i have been interested in modeling but still think there is a lot for me to explore before investing into a specialization right now meanwhile i have been thinking about starting a master is programs currently i am thinking about statistics applied math or cs in your experiences what did those programs help you with in your data science career specifically do they all give you more or less the same equal footing or would some programs be more set for a specific route within ds vs another i have also been looking at ds master is programs but heard maybe it is still best to avoid those for now is it better to hold off until a specific team or function requires me having a master is thanks",

  "hi all i have been using pandas for my data and it is been great up to a point and i was wondering if anyone dealt with the following stumbling blocks and perhaps had any advice i am collecting and analyzing data on a material i have several serial numbers each unique serial number corresponds to a unique sample of this material the serial number serves as the key ie is set as an index in my dataframe this has worked beautifully until i tried to organize by serial number data that requires multiple rows for example one datapoint like the mass of the sample only needs one row to express and so it corresponds nicely with the index but what can i do when a dataset needs multiple rows like for example the transmission of light at various wavelengths in my mind the way to do this was to place this series dataset within a list dftransmission effectively nesting that series into a single row this seems to work nicely until i save and load the dataframe as csv at which point the formatting gets all messed up and i can not easily pull the nested dataset out for plotting or any other operations because the nested dataset now has a nested index and pandas inserts a line break n between every datapoint after loading anyone have any good ideas on how to organize such a dataset nicely so that it corresponds to the serial number index but can still be used for one dimensional and n dimensional datasets at the same time my spectral data also needs to be compatible with loc and filters so that i can conveniently plot subsets of the spectrum based on wavelength filters",

  "in the ever evolving world of insurance data is the key to success the insurance industry relies heavily on data to make informed decisions about risk assessment pricing and customer engagement with the advent of data driven technologies the insurance industry is increasingly adopting dataops practices to optimize their data driven processes and improve decision making dataops refers to the set of practices and technologies that organizations use to manage their data operations in a more efficient and effective manner it involves a combination of people processes and tools that enable organizations to collect process and analyze data in real time in this blog we will explore some of the most impactful dataops use cases in the insurance industry and how they can help organizations optimize their operations claims prediction one of the most significannot applications of dataops in the insurance industry is the prediction of claims by leveraging data from various sources such as historical claims data demographic data and weather data organizations can develop predictive models that can help them identify high risk areas and predict the likelihood of claims in a specific area this information can then be used to adjust the pricing of insurance policies and to optimize the allocation of resources for claims management lifetime value prediction dataops can also be used to predict the lifetime value of a customer this is an important metric for insurance companies as it helps them to determine the cost of acquiring new customers and the expected return on investment by analyzing customer data such as demographic information purchase history and engagement levels insurance companies can develop predictive models that can help them to estimate the lifetime value of a customer influencing customer behaviour dataops can also be used to influence customer behavior by analyzing customer data insurance companies can identify patterns in customer behavior that can help them to optimize their engagement strategies for example by understanding which channels are most effective for reaching a specific customer segment insurance companies can target their marketing campaigns more effectively and drive customer engagement personalizing marketing strategies and targeting specific customer groups dataops can also be used to personalize marketing strategies and target specific customer groups by analyzing customer data insurance companies can segment their customers based on various demographic behavioral and psychographic characteristics this information can then be used to tailor marketing campaigns to specific customer segments resulting in more effective engagement and higher conversion rates detecting and mitigating risk in real time dataops can also be used to detect and mitigate risk in real time by analyzing real time data from various sources such as social media news outlets and weather data insurance companies can identify emerging risks and take proactive measures to mitigate their impact this can help organizations to respond quickly to changing conditions and minimize the impact of potential risks on their operations detection of fraudulent claims finally dataops can be used to detect fraudulent claims by analyzing claims data in real time insurance companies can identify anomalies and potential fraud this information can then be used to investigate claims and prevent fraudulent activity from occurring conclusion in conclusion dataops has the potential to transform the insurance industry by enabling organizations to make more informed decisions optimize their operations and improve customer engagement by leveraging data from various sources insurance companies can gain a competitive advantage and drive growth in a rapidly changing market whether you are an established insurance company or a start up dataops can help you to achieve your goals and stay ahead of the curve ismile technologies dataops managed services enable organizations to collect process and analyze data in real time allowing them to make informed decisions about risk assessment pricing customer engagement and more with our expertise and cutting edge technologies insurance companies can optimize their data driven processes increase efficiency and stay ahead of the competition schedule your free assessment today",
  "hi everyone i have recently been offered a data scientist position at my current company but i was told that i would be working exclusively on the google cloud platform gcp and that it will not be necessary to code in python i have spent the past year learning about data science models and programming and i am concerned that all of that knowledge will not be put to use in this new role i always thought that a data scientist would be in front of their jupyter notebook so i am worried that this is a cheap data scientist position my main question is is it standard for data scientists to work solely on cloud computing platforms like gcp and is it common to not code in python i would love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this thanks in advance for your help",

  "in my job as a data scientist i use deep learning models regularly to classify a lot of textual data mostly transformer models like bert finetuned for the needs of the company sentiment analysis and topic classification are the two most common natural language processing tasks that i perform or rather that is performed downstream in a pipeline that i am building for a company the other day someone high up with no technical knowledge was telling me during a meeting that we should be harnessing the power of chatgpt to perform sentiment analysis and do other various data analysis tasks noting that it should be a particularly powerful tool to analyze large volumes of data coming in both in sentiment analysis and in querying and summarizing data tables i mentioned that the tools we are currently using are more specialized for our analysis needs than this chat bot they pushed back insisting that chatgpt is the way to go for data analysis and that i am not doing my due diligence i feel that ai becoming a topic of mainstream interest is emboldening people to speak confidently on it when they have no education or experience in the field after just a few minutes playing around with chatgpt i was able to get it to give me a wrong answer to a very easy question see below for the transcript it spoke so confidently in it is answer even going as far as to provide a formula which it basically abandoned in practice then when i pointed out it is mistake it corrected the answer to another wrong one the point of this long post was to point out that ai tool have their uses but they should not be given the benefit of the doubt in every scenario simply due to hype if a model is to be used for a specific task it should be rigorously tested and benchmarked before replacing more thoroughly proven methods chatgpt is a really promising chat bot and it can definitely seem knowledgeable about a wide range of topics since it was trained on basically the entire internet but i would not trust it to do something that a simple pandas query could accomplish nor would i use it to perform sentiment analysis when there are a million other transformer models that were specifically trained to predict sentiment labels and were rigorously evaluated on industry standard benchmarks like glue",

  "i just started my first job at an asset management firm after my masters months ago recently been contacted by the team lead in a large tech company he is interested in my past research work i published two papers out of my masters and wants to have me in his new team i am unsure if taking this offer is the right move and my current role data scientist at a small ppl asset management firm they are setting up a new quant trading stat arb strategy and hired me as part of a new team i took this offer because i am interested in a quant researcher role but could not get in one of those big quant trading firms so i am trying to use this position as a stepping stone to better places the problems are the actual job is nothing like what i was told during interview of the job are ad hoc admin tasks like preparing monthly fund performance reports booking trades done by their manual trader for their other non quant funds fixing the trader is excel formulas and helping non tech staff run some python scripts i am even officially in their operation team now this frankly is not what i expected this firm has a weak tech foundation they are just starting to do quant trading so i understand that they do not have any existing infrastructure what worries me more however is that they have no experienced developer neither the only developer here has less than yoe i am afraid the project will quickly become a hell of technical debt this firm is not very quantitative neither the only real quant here has a straightly business background and received no formal math training beyond first year calculus and no phd ofc he does have solid year yoe as a quant trader which is what really matters the quant work i got to do is alright the strategy they are developing sounds promising to me as a layman if nothing else at least i learned something about finance i am unsure how this experience in a small fund will be valued when i enter the job market again overall i think it all comes down to me not feeling enough growth opportunity quant research is one exciting opportunity that aligns with my technical interest but i do not want to overly confine myself in that narrow space the quant industry is so competitive that i do not even know if i can get a next job if i can not stay in quant the other option for me is a data scientist role in other sectors but then i am now spending of my day doing work that adds zero transferable data skill to my profile i am however aware that my worldview has become too academic after spending the extra years in school for my master so maybe all this is normal in the workspace and i am just being unrealistic the other role data scientist at a large tech company employees the team lead there promised a salary higher than my current role which is alright but not yet although i think it will be at best a raise if i take into account of bonus probably i will get paid more overall if i can stay where i am for a full year from what i heard this company is building a new team to make use of the tb is of service usage data they have collected mainly for marketing optimization this team is more mature with a functional tech stack and experienced data scientists and engineers the team lead said this will be an opportunity for me to gain experience in being a full stack data scientist i have a friend currently working in this company and he said the job is just like what was on paper i will not be wasting of my time doing admin work like where i am my main concern here is essentially the opposite of if i stay in my current role i am afraid that taking this offer would mean the door to quant research is completely closed for me honestly i think as a data scientist going for quant related roles is the fastest way to reach my financial goals and i wish to keep that door opened as much as possible and summing up my question is which role can give me better career opportunity down the road please knock some sense into me thanks",

  "i am a year old social sciences grad considering a return to academia and i am very interested in applying ml methods as part of a phd research proposal at the intersection of political science public policy and development studies more specifically i would like to assess the value provided by ml methods as part of a mixed methods approach to research with the aid of one or several case studies with significannot attention paid to methodological and epistemological concerns engaging with the work of forerunners in the field such as lakoff zadeh sartori and david collier as such applying ml methods would be a significannot portion of my research but definitely a minority specific algorithms of interest would be determined by the case studies in question and what i am capable of competently applying but would likely centre around regression classification and text analysis once upon a time i had basic but fairly solid statistical skills along with more rudimentary technical skills in sql r and to a lesser extent python but these have unfortunately atrophied to the point of non existence after years in a non technical data science adjacent role i therefore have a pretty steep hill to climb in terms of foundational skills before i could even submit my research proposal i am currently brushing up on algebra calculus and statistical skills before pushing in to the unknown most likely via the mitx micromasters in data development and economics and or in data science however the sheer scope and complexity of the content i need to cover combined with working a full time job and the fact that a phd position is by no means guaranteed at the end of it i am provisionally interested in oxford or lse is pretty disheartening as a result i am interested in exploring low code no code options such as knime and dataiku i would also welcome alternative suggestions for data prep and model build to reduce the barrier to entry i would really value any input on whether these would be fit for purpose specifically will the choice of algorithms available fit my needs how low code are they exactly in practice will i need to plug in significannot amounts of my own code do they provide sufficient guidance or hand holding to build models of sufficient quality for a top tier phd program keeping in mind that building the ml models would only be a relatively small portion of my research i certainly would not expect this to be the case if it was a purely quantitative thesis to take some basic examples would they flag if my variables were collinear heteroskedastic etc thanks for reading i would really value any input happy to provide some more details on my somewhat vague research proposal if that would be helpful or of any interest",

  "i once watched a video where someone argued that michael jordan had ruined basketball as a person whose only notions of basketball come from space jam this surprised me was not the guy the best out there how could someone who is best in his field ruin it after hearing the argument out though i began to understand what the video was really getting at to them michael jordan had ruined the field because he was so good a sport that was once full of diverse personalities and strategies then turned into multiple teams trying to produce their own michael jordan copycat with copycat moves and copycat strategies i am not well versed enough in basketball to know how right or wrong that guy was but this concept that something could ruin an entire field simply by being too good stuck with me and all these years later i consistently think about it while doing my job as a data scientist and the more gpt x and chatgpt advance the more this concept haunts me i have been working in this field for years during the first years the job was exciting every new problem required extensive research on my part looking for papers datasets implementations implementing my own stuff experimenting comparing the results that was the biggest part of my job yeah i still had to do some software engineering stuff here and there but i felt like i had a well defined and specialized role at my company even in the nlp field the variety of technologies i had to work with was a lot of fun sometimes i used rnns sometimes embedding based similarity functions sometimes more classic approaches and then towards the end it was transformer after transformer but at least i still had to finetune them myself over the past few months and years this has started to change however gpt and were promising but were more of a proof of concept than anything realistically usable but with is and chatgpt is latest performance it feels like nlp is becoming more and more standardized i would not call it a solved field far from it but sadly unless you work for a big tech company i think the days of exploratory research type work in the nlp field are over even in academia the latest nlp papers i have seen come out of prestigious universities went from actual engineering mathematical advances to look if you engineer the prompt like this it works better sometimes and now with the exploding popularity of chatgpt any random lambda would come to the conclusion that if you need to use ai chatgpt is the answer now some of you may already be thinking but hold on with my finetuned transformer i get a increase in accuracy over out of the box gpt the thing is even if you can it does not really matter i really doubt the sales team of your company is gon na pay much attention to your pleas to give you months to work on a product rather than minutes because yes that is the increase in productivity we are dealing with what took me months a few years ago only takes minutes now the range of problems i can apply nlp too has also increased as out of the box gpt works well enough not to require a dataset for more general tasks and the results are either comparable or even better in the span of a year nlp went from my favorite ml field to one i never see myself working in again if given the choice and while a lot of non nlp fields are for now untouched by the exploding popularity of the gpt family i am afraid that what happened to the nlp field will be replicated in other fields and that in a few years only super specialized issues will not have a solution somewhere in the form of a ridiculously big model accessible via an api key provided by a big tech company and even if was open source the sheer size of it makes it close to impossible to realistically train for anything less than the biggest of tech companies out there even finetuning it would be a challenge i am not saying the job of data scientist will disappear in fact i would say it will be asked more than ever since boomers who do not understand what the title actually implies will want some in their company but we will not be doing nearly as much actual data sciency stuff as we did in the past instead we will have to become even bigger software engineer data analyst devops project manager hybrids than we already were the only exception is for people who either work in big tech companies or on very specialized problems that require an in house model it is not that much of a problem for people who like the roles i listed above but for people like me whose enjoyment came out of the exploratory side of the job i believe the future to be bleak",

  "i knew that i wanted to do something data related or computer science based for a long time but unfortunately my undergrad major was completely unrelated to ds i self taught myself python r while working a marketing job and was suuper fortunate to get into a ds da master is program at one of the ivy league schools i worked to learn a ton about best data practices tools had ds co ops generated a ton of material for my github etc obviously just finishing a master is program is not enough to enter ds so my career counselor recommended me to take a data analyst job at a low maturity company use your skills to upgrade the way they use data become a data rockstar and you will get all kinds of doors opened in no time spoiler i did not become a data rockstar i landed a marketing analyst position at a large insurance company and long story short this job is just a mess my boss is a lifer that recently celebrated years in the same position at the same company and got promoted to manager right as i joined of my work is shuffling around excel sheets making ugly because the style is regulated powerpoints another is attending useless meetings that she sets up for me to hear what conversations are happening around here is making sense of the broken spss code that someone wrote for her years ago the rest of the time is allocated to using power bi sql and r to pull data from various sources and create reports for the internal stakeholders nothing at my job is googlable because all of the processes are either created by someone from years ago or my manager herself each process can require up to little steps of moving data between million excel spreadsheets populated with billion formulas making it impossible to comprehend or even load the documentation she provides me with is always incorrect incomplete forcing me to ask for her help as it would take me many hours to figure this out myself when i try to do things my way she gets clearly upset and sometimes starts micromanaging me making us miss a ton of deadlines just for the sake of making everything look perfect according to the internal standards i spend a ton of time outside of work hours the last one to leave the office every single day trying to make time for extra ds projects but the amount of high priority tasks i get assigned is too overwhelming the most technical thing i have done is used vdi to automate an r script that imports a bunch of files anti joins them and outputs certain distributions into an excel doc but that was a one time project i told my manager that i enjoy coding the most and she promised to land me a coding heavy project with the ds team however i followed up times throughout a month and she ended up telling me that the person who asked for help decided to leave the company jeez i wonder why i get so much stress from a seemingly easy job no one seems to care that everything is weeks past due or indefinitely undelivered because i am trying so hard to get a chance to make an impact and have at least something i can use when applying for ds roles after hitting that year mark i am afraid that the advanced skills i acquired are slowly fading away and i am learning a lot of bad habits from my manager what would you recommend in my situation to stay on the right track i usually work through my lunch breaks too i know i know but i had an idea of maybe using that time to read a stats book or something ds related any suggestions any advice is appreciated edit the reason i put ivy league school is because a couple of months ago my manager gave me an impossible task i asked for a suggestion on how to better approach this task and she responded with well i am not the one with the master is degree from the ivy leagues i got so butthurt from this because i have not brought it up once since joining the company lol tldr want to break into ds through low maturity analytics job but feeling like it has a negative effect on my career potential tips",

  "how should i go about forecasting estimates i am building a custom forecast using quickbooks and hubspot is api my x axis of my chart consists of the following data actual revenue expected x deal probability x deal value revenue new deal probability x deal value my y axis is each month my question is i want to track revenue from closed deals but the final of the closed deal as you can see i am tracking the first in expected i thought about using estimates as that income is guaranteed within the next months but invoices do not exist for them yet so for income where i know is guaranteed for x day of the month this is not tracked in quickbooks the issue with using estimates is as soon as the invoice is made the estimate total does not go down so i can not go the estimate route because it will create duplicate income i suppose i can track this manually but the whole goal is automating this any ideas sorry if i explained poorly edit i could only update the actual at the end of the month then not include revenue in the expected potentially but then that would not catch all my smaller transactions and it would always be off or so",

  "hello my friends i am a last semester undergrad mathematics student and now that i will no longer be enrolled in college the thought of my future as a mathematician has been haunting me as you know the mathematical life can be very lonely and i only have a couple of friends and professors to whom i can talk about mathematics so i wanted to hear some advice from fellow experienced stem wokers who can give me some insight to give some context i also have a degree in electronic engineering and in my mathematical journey i have been very focused on model theory and logic but lately after finishing my thesis i discovered that maybe the academia life is not for me so i have taken two courses on actuarial mathematics and mathematical finance which i enjoyed a lot in engineering i only liked the signal processing dynamical systems machine learning courses which was one of the reasons why i decided to double major in math right now i feel that life as an academic is not what i am looking for in life specially in the country i live in and that my love for mathematics has been more of a love for challenges and learning new things rather than mathematics by itself and i am very passionate about solving problems and mathematics has become sort of a drug giving me dopamine rushes every time something clicks or every time i solve a problem so that is why i am looking or advice in jobs that have a deep mathematical component that offers challenges every day and that evolves constantly that also offers good payment and work life balance so far these are my options with their pros and cons quant mathematical finance pros i love the deep and complex structure of the stock market and i feel that it has rich mathematical problems stochastic calculus pde is programming etc it also offers great payment and looks like a very active lifestyle cons i do not like that the main purpose is money driven i have also heard that it is extremely time consuming and that the there is not much work life balance data analyst data miner pros i love programming it also offers rich mathematical techniques and can be applied to a vast number of scenarios i like that it is not tied to a specific industry because pretty much every enterprise needs data analysis in today is world cons i have read that the day to day work is very different from the theory and you end up being an advisor to the sales team on a company that expects you to do magic with their data i also feel that climbing up the salary ladder takes longer actuary pros great payment great work life balance from what i have read there are not a lot of actuaries cons the need to take so many exams certifications to increase salary position work becomes very monotone and i feel that you are tied to the insurance market spreadsheet boring life programmer software developer pros fantastic salary you can find home office work in usd already have experience programming high demand for software developers cons not very math focused it depends a lot on what you are programming i see programmers as digital construction workers i would love some machine learning math related programming but i would die f boredom developing web pages and that sort of stuff can you guys share some of your experiences in these fields how do you see each career in the future do you have any other recommendations for me thank you so much in advance i really need guidance and different opinions before taking such an important decision cheers",

  "i recently stumbled upon a job that is as close as it gets to being a dream job for me a data scientist position in a physics related setting considering that i have a phd in physics where i mostly did machine learning even the subfield of physics matches reading through the job offer i got pretty confident that i was a really good match fitting almost everything they needed plus some more of my own strengths etc so obviously i applied there is the usual upload your resume basic information etc then the website brings me to a new page where they ask a few basic questions which i answer truthfully and in a positive way until i reach do you have any experience with federated learning the real answer is no i do not and that is what i clicked being honest and all but i realise that clicking no means being automatically rejected filtered away without a chance of defending myself in front of a human recruiter i would say no but that the concept does not sound so daunting and that i have proven track at fast adaptation and learning which means i am likely to very quickly pick it up but there is no human recruiter in front of me and in that way i can not emphasise on all the technical and non technical aspects that would be my strengths for that job which leads to a mediocre candidate with some experience at that specific skill has a higher chance that an almost perfect match which is only lacking in that area meaning i am getting rejected from a dream job without a chance to even defend that i am a very good match so of course i am thinking of simply lying the next time sure the lie may get discovered by the recruiter later on in the process but then i at least have a chance at arguing or defending my way in anticipating the comment about learning federated learning sure i can do that but the next job is going to ask for a different skill and then another different one etc and some of these skills are sort of hard to actually justify an experience on when you do not have the infrastructure multiple servers for federated learning what do you all think",
  "i recently finished my bachelor is last year and have decided to apply for a masters in data science abroad which will take some time to prepare which brings me to my dilemma some backstory during the pandemic apologies if i brought unpleasant memories i started my self taught journey in data science which involved watching a lot of tutorials reading articles which somewhat gave me the jist of what algorithms and fundamentals statistics pythonsql are in the line of work i watched some courses on statistics to try actually understand some concept like probability and especially harmonic mean lol learnt sql but never got to know how i would use sql to actually get data from a database anf use it for modeling years later i honestly do not even know what am doing anymore i wake up log in to kaggle find an interesting dataset formulate a problem that might need solving no matter how ridiculous it is and do some analysis or build a model and by the end of the day i contemplate whether what am doing is enough to actually land a job in the coming years do not get me wrong but i actually am very interested in the field with a all the blogs and multiple youtubers around providing information on what data science is all about i end up questioning the very name of the field what the actual is data science feels like i have been doing nothing in the past few years jus lol i have made some models with which i am proud of especially a food recommendation system that i ended up presenting as my finals projectin addition i read a lot of threads in the sub of what employers are looking for during interviews and realize that there is so so much i still do not fully understand apologies for the rant but today is jus one of those days that i question my efforts in the field id really like to get some advice on how to continue on",

  "newer to ds work and am looking for some direction on approaches i am trying to estimate the impact of an event upon a customer satisfaction metric for both the general population and specific segments the event is assumed to have heterogeneous effects due to the nature of the customer base impacted customers in some regions more than others and was not part of an experimental study i have tried using arima time series modeling based upon the metric fitting on the time period prior to the event predicting after the event and comparing the predicted values to the actual ones however arima does not appear to be appropriate due to limited data there appears to be monthly seasonality as well as seasonality related to the day of the week since the customer satisfaction metric is an aggregation from scores provided by individuals i have also tried using individual scores pre event as training and using individual scores given post event as test fitting traditional classification models to the training set and making predictions on the test set to estimate the difference between the expected versus actual customer metric i have taken the training scores and predicted test scores and calculated the aggregated metric for those records as the expected aggregate value and separately calculated the aggregated metric over the training scores and actual test values for the actual aggregate value however this method gives me a larger than actual estimated impact regardless of whether or not i balance the classes during training this modeling approach tends to predict one customer rating more frequently than the others i have also done some reading into causality libraries modeling approaches like econml dml but i am not sure how helpful cate would be here since my metric of interest is an aggregation any suggestions",
  "a while back my close colleague at work had an interview with sr director of analytics or maybe just a director i forgot for data related opening he was asked to describe what would he do with data points representing months say month of january through march i confirmed with my colleague that it was not month or days data it was just literally data points for example sales revenue for those months my hunch at that time was either the person smoked something or he blew the interview on purpose as the recruiter told him the very next day as they decided to promote from within i did try to think a variety of ways to derive meaningful reference based on numbers but eventually i told my colleague that most likely the interview was fake i guess i want to know from different perspective whether you can actually use data points in a meaningful way for business any taker update as suggested the company he interviewed with was big in telco",
  "hi guys i am a junior in an undergrad bs data science program at a small christian university in the midwest i have been searching for a summer internship in data science data analytics since september and have had no luck i have reached out to people in my network and those of my family and professors wherever possible and i have visited my university is career center several times for resume revisions and have adopted the various strategies they have suggested i have submitted somewhere in the ballpark of applications in the last months and i have been ghosted by most recruiters of the applications i received callbacks for interviews and of those only resulted in a follow up interview for this last position i was well prepared and felt that i performed well in both interviews but alas i finally received yet another rejection letter last week i am frustrated and disappointed to say the least i understand that these numbers are pretty typical in the current tech job market and other redditors frequently call it a numbers game while merely continuing a barrage of new applications may work for new graduates and recently laid off junior positions i am fighting against time since i am looking for a summer internship that ends before i resume classes in the fall at this current rate i would have to submit another applications to get a chance of even one more interview which is incredibly time consuming the job search process wore me out months ago i am discouraged and exhausted and it takes valuable time away from actually practicing my skills and learning new topics on top of that it already feels too late my academic advisor told me in october to try to have something figured out by the end of december since many internship positions would already be filled beyond that point it is now february if my odds were bad months ago it is only going to get worse i am kind of at my wits end i also am approaching the point where i need to have some concrete summer plans so i can coordinate schedules with family and friends not just i am looking for an internship because that does not seem to be panning out here are a few of my options go back to the summer camp where i worked for the last two years pros i already have friends there and i am guaranteed a job if i apply i will also be on the west coast which is where i want to be cons the pay is little more than a volunteer stipend i will not have much opportunity to develop tech skills or otherwise advance my career stay at home for the summer i could split my time between learning through online moocs and potentially look for a low skill job such as administrative assistant or data entry or a gig like doordash pros i can live with my family for free i will also be on the west coast and will have the flexibility to pursue my outdoor hobbies while working on tech skills the wage floor is also pretty high in my state cons there is no guarantee that i can find a job especially for something that only lasts the summer when employers may be wanting something more permanent it also feels kind of humiliating that i failed to find a job in my industry look for internships in adjacent fields that involve data i have seen this suggested to people looking to make a career switch but i am not sure if these exist or if they will work for me i also will not have the mentorship in ds da that i am specifically looking for what factors should i take into consideration when i look at my options for this summer is there anything else as far as career development that i should also think about i am also wondering if the current scarcity of tech positions is homogeneous across the industry ds does not seem as attractive as it was a few years ago and now i feel unsure about all of my career academic choices to date first i feel like ds was hyped up to more than it was when i first started college as a freshman and now it seems that a lot of people on the internet also think that it is now on the decline it also seems to be the consensus that the best path into ds is through a more established undergrad program in cs math or stats rather than a ds degree because they tend to be so broad in nature that you learn a little bit about many topics but nothing sufficiently in depth to be useful unfortunately that seems to be my experience i do not feel like i am learning anything in classes so i am taking time outside of class to work on kaggle learn courses and the andrew ng coursera ml course if i could go back in time i would have gone into cs and started at a different university i am not particularly fond of my university or the midwest i long to be back on the west coast and it is a long story of how i ended up here but suffice it to say that the reason i am still here is because i am on a full tuition scholarship which i would lose if i transferred elsewhere but i can not go back in time i am a junior and should be graduating in two more semesters after this semester so i had been okay with sticking it out under the assumption that i could get a decent job when i graduate and move back to the west coast but i am at the point where i question if any of that is true second i am not even sure anymore if this is really what i want to do in my senior year of high school i became really interested in finance and ds seemed like the perfect way to join my long standing interest in tech with what a growing interest in math which sidenote may have died after i took intro to linear algebra i like to think it was just a bad professor and my new interest in business topics in the last semester or so i have clarified my long term goals and want to break into the ml field and eventually become an mle however in working with scikit learn and other ml frameworks in kaggle learn courses it feels dull and i am just doing it because i have gaps in my knowledge i do not really find myself loving it is this normal i know it is preferable to work on my own projects rather than repetitive activities but i still do not feel that i know enough skills to work on my own projects i often wonder if i would be better off in a more standard cs track towards become an swe or backend web dev but there is huge gaps in my knowledge there as well and if i switch majors i will probably have to take an extra semester or two because my current ds requirements do not include any of the dev networking or security classes i guess to summarize i went into this degree track with certain expectations and everything has turned out to be a disappointment i am not sure what to do anymore because although i am willing to work hard it is difficult to maintain the motivation to do so when i am not sure if everything i am doing is mere futility thanks for taking the time to read through all this and i appreciate any advice feedback you may have",

  "tl dr i explore a hypothetical scenario where widget makers of varying experience are compared according to defect rate over a year window to make things comparable accounting for the experience problem i inquire whether using a weighted moving average is a good strategy for balancing the problem of experience out or whether there is a better technique solution to employ and the scenario assume you were to look at the historical performance of several widget makers who manually produce widgets these widget makers could be active employees at present or left at some point during the window you want to compare the historical performance of the widget makers in terms of defect rate over the last years my definition of defect rate is simply the total number of defects number of widgets produced inclusive of defects some makers have decades of experience while other makers only have year of experience minimum required for this analysis the original data is by year let is assume maker a who started their career over a decade ago made widgets over the entire window maker b has years of experience but was let go sometime before maker c was recently hired and worked all of to make things more intuitive hopefully and comparable i converted the table from calendar years to years of experience within the time window so year does not necessarily translate to it is simply represents the first year worked in that time window see table below and maker year a b c and their defect rate is recorded over the last years for example maker a produced widgets of which were defective in the first year of the time window then produced widgets in which were defective year and so on note that demand could be variable for widget production simply looking at the defect rate above my calculations show maker a would have an overall defect rate of b would have and c would have the problem i see is less experience penalizes more heavily than more experience so if this were a bar graph the worst performers would likely always be the least experienced and that may not be very fair or informative and at worst hiding poor performers with a lot of experience so this implies that some sort of smoothing or weighting is needed in order to make things more comparable i was wondering if it made sense to use a weighted moving average my weighted average would look like the following and each year of the window has an arbitrary weight associated to it for this example we want to downweight that first year and gradually increase weights later on and year weight and i obtain the sum of the product of each year is weight by the maker is defect rate for each year they worked divided by the sum of the weights for the length of time that the maker worked clarifying this last part maker a is denominator would be the sum of all weights b would be the sum of weights and c would be only the year weight using the weight and formulas mentioned i show that a has a weighted average defect rate of b has and c has suggesting that b is producing more defects relative to their experience compared to the other two this results make some intuitive sense to me as b continued their career with a higher rate of defects relative to a my concern is that weighting is arbitrary and that this method might cause an inverse problem from the one i was originally attempting to solve giving too much leniency to the inexperienced and overly penalizing experience i understand there is no perfect answer here but wondering if this is a sound approach or there are better more intuitive ways to approach this tia",

  "and sam altman might have just pulled off the coup of the decade microsoft is investing into openai there is lots of frustration in the community about openai not being all that open anymore they appear to abandon their ethos of developing ai for everyone free of economic pressures the fear is that openai is models are going to become fancy ms office plugins gone would be the days of open research and innovation however the specifics of the deal tell a different story to understand what is going on we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning we will find that sam altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade to appreciate better why there is some three dimensional chess going on let is first look at sam altman is backstory let is go a stellar rise back in sam altman founded loopt and was part of the first ever yc batch he raised a total of in funding but the company failed to gain traction seven years into the business loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down instead of caving he managed to sell his startup for to the fintech company green dot investors got their money back and he personally made from the sale by yc standards this was a pretty unimpressive outcome however people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people so hot in fact that paul graham included him in his essay about the five founders who influenced him the most he listed young sam altman next to steve jobs larry and sergey from google and paul buchheit creator of gmail and adsense he went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted and sam altman played his hand well he parleyed his new connections into raising from peter thiel and others to start investing within four years he ed the money in addition paul graham made him his successor as president of yc in within one decade of selling his first startup for he grew his net worth to a mind bending and rose to the circle of the most influential people in silicon valley today he is the ceo of openai one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech however openai the rocket ship of ai innovation is in dire straights openai is bleeding cash back in openai was kickstarted with in donations from famous donors such as elon musk that money is long gone in openai is projecting a revenue of at the same time they spent roughly hence the company has lost over the last year alone this is probably not an outlier year openai is headquartered in san francisco and has a stable of employees of mostly machine learning rockstars hence salaries alone probably come out to be roughly pa in addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous considering it cost them to train once it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine figure range as well so where does this leave them today before the microsoft investment of openai had received a total of over its lifetime with in funding a burn rate of and eight years of company history it does not take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash it would be reasonable to think openai is sitting on chatgpt and other great models can not they just lease them and make a killing yes and no openai is projecting a revenue of for however it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significannotly increasing their costs as well here are some reasons why the tough business of machine learning machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies on the outside they look and feel similar people are creating products using code but on the inside things can be very different to start off machine learning companies are usually way less profitable their gross margins land in the range much lower than those of saas businesses which can be as high as on the one hand the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs on the other hand the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data to illustrate the latter point imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on chatgpt is outputs if openai scales the usage of gpt in production they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech slurs tutorials on killing people you name it alright alright alright machine learning is hard openai already has chatgpt working that is got ta be worth something foundation models might become commodities in order to monetize gpt or any of their other models openai can go two different routes first they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers they could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow jasper or copyai out of the water this is not going to happen reasons for it include to support their mission of building competitive foundational ai tools and their huge burn rate they would need to capture one or more very large verticals they fundamentally need to re brand themselves and diverge from their original mission this would likely scare most of the talent away they would need to build out sales and marketing teams such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research the second option openai has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via api introducing a pro version of chatgpt is a step in this direction this approach has its own challenges models like gpt do have a defensible moat they are just large transformer models trained on very large open source datasets as an example last week andrej karpathy released a video of him coding up a version of gpt in an afternoon nothing could stop google stabilityai or huggingface from open sourcing their own gpt as a result gpt inference would become a common good this would melt openai is profits down to a tiny bit of nothing in this scenario they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns since companies that integrate with openai is api control the interface to the customer they would likely end up capturing all of the value an argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the steel industry to sum it up they do not have a way to sustainably monetize their models they do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals they need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development so what should they do the microsoft deal openai and microsoft announced the extension of their partnership with a investment on monday at this point microsoft will have invested a total of in openai moreover new vcs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table however the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal first off the ownership will be split across three groups microsoft will hold vcs another and the openai foundation will control the remaining of shares if openai starts making money the profits are distributed differently across four stages first early investors probably khosla ventures and reid hoffman is foundation get their money back with interest after that microsoft is entitled to of profits until the of funding is repaid when the initial funding is repaid microsoft and the remaining vcs each get of profits this continues until another and are paid out to microsoft and the vcs respectively once the aforementioned money is paid to investors of shares return to the foundation which regains total control over the company what this means this is absolutely crazy openai managed to solve all of its problems at once they raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need on top of that they solved their distribution problem they now have access to microsoft is sales teams and their models will be integrated into ms office products microsoft also benefits heavily they can play at the forefront ai brush up their tools and have openai as an exclusive partner to further compete in a bitter cloud war against aws the synergies do not stop there openai as well as github aubsidiary of microsoft e g will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop github copilot the deal creates a beautiful win win situation but that is not even the best part sam altman and his team at openai essentially managed to place a giant hedge if openai does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new ai winter microsoft will have paid for the party however if openai creates something in the direction of agi whatever that looks like the value of it will likely be huge in that case openai will quickly repay the dept to microsoft and the foundation will control of whatever was created wow whether you agree with the path openai has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation based you have to give it to them this deal is an

  "hi all i am trying to find the best multidimensional combination of parameters for an application based on a given metric by using bayesian optimisation to search the parameter space and efficiently find the most optimal parameters with the fewest number of evaluations the model gives some sets of parameters some that it has a high prediction of the metric and others it has high uncertainty about these outputs per cycle are then experimentally validated and the accumulated results fed back into the model to get a better set of parameters for the next iterations for a total of about iterations data points total the search space is large and there are a limited amount of iterations that can be performed because of this i need to evaluate several surrogate models on their performance within this search space i need to evaluate the search efficiency how quickly can each one find the most optimal candidates eg one will take cycles the other other etc and the theoretical proportion of the search space that each model can search given the same data eg of the search space given experimentally validated data from the search space i am using the botorch library to build the bayesian optimisation model i also already have a set of real world experimental data from different cycles from the first model i tried i would like to know how to go about evaluating these models for the search efficiency and design space uncertainty any thoughts are welcome thanks",

  "and number of parameters gpt vs gpt the rumor mill is buzzing around the release of gpt people are predicting the model will have trillion parameters that is a trillion with a t the often used graphic above makes gpt look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live ending encounter with a bowling ball sure openai is new brainchild will certainly be mind bending and language models have been getting bigger fast but this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models llms let is go training trillion parameters the creation of gpt was a marvelous feat of engineering the training was done on gpus took days and cost in compute alone training a parameter model on the same data using gpus would take years to avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much larger so where is this rumor coming from the source of the rumor it turns out openai itself might be the source of it in august the ceo of cerebras told wired from talking to openai gpt will be about trillion parameters a the time that was most likely what they believed but that was in so basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned things have changed a lot since then to understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model deciding the number of parameters the enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an llm only once in practice the available compute budget how much money will be spent available gpus etc is known in advance before the training is started researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model but there is a catch most research on neural networks is empirical people typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters with llms we can not do that training gpt models would set you back roughly a billion dollars not even the deep pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money therefore researchers need to work with what they have either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones this process can very noisy and the community is understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years what people used to think about scaling llms in a team of researchers from openai released a paper called scaling laws for neural language models they observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude so far so good but they made two other observations which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly to scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size to be exact their analysis showed when increasing the model size the dataset only needs to be increased five times full model convergence is not compute efficient given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer hence it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size and that is what people did the models got larger and larger with gpt gopher megatron turing nlg just to name a few but the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise read on to learn why what we know about scaling models today it turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions so every time the model size doubles the number of training tokens should double as well this was published in deepmind is paper training compute optimal large language models the researchers fitted over language models ranging from to over parameters to assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from tokens the findings allowed them to estimate that a compute optimal version of gpt should be trained on roughly tokens that is more than the data that the original model was trained on to verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data their model called chinchilla has parameters and is trained on tokens hence it is five times smaller than gpt but trained on almost five times the data chinchilla outperforms gpt and other much larger models by a fair margin this was a great breakthroughthe model is not just better but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier so what will happen what gpt might look like to properly fit a model with parameters open openai needs a dataset of roughly tokens given gpus and using the calculus from above it would still take roughly years to train the model so here is what gpt could look like similar size to gpt but trained optimally on more data multi modal outputting text images and sound output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails regardless of the exact design it will be a solid step forward however it will not be the token human brain like agi that people make it out to be whatever it will look like i am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release such exciting times to be alive if you

  "we combined image captioning using clip and image generation using the hugging face stable diffusion model to create an image de identifier modeled after the game of telephone imafake all you have to do is upload an image convert it to a caption then convert that caption to an image with a few clicks you can also play with the parameters of the diffusion model depending on how gnarly you want your resulting image to be and caution they can get rather gnarly but that is what makes it fun thoughts and your own generated images welcome",
  "this post is really a few questions with some context from a beginner in machine learning this past semester i had taken a course at my uni on deep learning where we had done weekly assignments in python related to different models with the primary use of sci kit learn i have always been a fan of lower level languages and disliked abstraction so this inspired me to work on my own library but related to mathematics in a broader sense that also includes machine learning methods and techniques the source code being all in c formal installation with cmake language binding for python with easy installation using pip a binding for r and some decent documentation and samples to get running this led me to start using the project for some machine learning work in my research lab the project is still very small with limited functionality but has proven useful as a lightweight tool for some of the work we do in the lab i have grown curious how i can take my project to the next level to my naive understanding and brief week experience sklearn serves as a tool with prebuilt models for a variety of machine learning methods while tensorflow acts as building blocks primarily for creating neural networks is this fair to assume also sklearn i have noticed is written mostly in python while projects like tensorflow and torch utilize c and c to a much greater degree how do these projects provide efficient computations for end users wanting to make use of the library i am familiar with the concepts of threading but not in a cross platform sense with some previous worked with tools like openmp opencl opengl and a bit of cuda but not in an applicable sense my project so far does not deal with image or video related data so i am unsure of how the use of gpu exploitation could serve purposeful in my case what methods and perhaps tools do lower level projects like tensorflow use to be a fast and efficient tool while also being portable i understand these projects have an abundance of developers and brilliant brains contributing but any insight or references will be greatly appreciated and help me wrap my head around the idea of creating a fast efficient and cross platform library also reinventing the wheel is not a concern this served as a great project for learning an array of topics in my free time aside from just mathematics",
  "dear all i have been building a codon optimizer translating amino acids to dna codons using the transformer model attention is all you need i have been training it on million tokens as the image shows the loss is stuck and very stable at even after epochs see figure a when i use the model for interference i see that it does a lot right how ever it seems not possible for it to find the eos token figure b shows my inference with the bold tokens showing the desired length it goes all the way untill it reaches the maxlen constraint the average length of the translated sequence is tokens and a maximum of tokens my questions how can i stimulate the model to find the eos since the length of the source is always the same length as the target can i hard code the eos would this help do i have enough tokens to train on or should i get more if you need more information i can provide it thank you for helping me out greetings from the netherlands daan and"
