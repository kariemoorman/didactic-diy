  "datascitest transfer student here trying to decide whether to apply for data science at uci or computer science with intentions to minor in stats the main difference is that the data science major has more classes on stats while the computer science degree seems objectively better on paper and more flexible for the purpose of job prospects the other thing that is bothering me is that computer science is inherently more competitive to apply for right now and i am wondering how much that should affect my decision any advice helps hey everyone im a student seeking an entry level data scientist role and would love to get some suggestions for my resume and ways to improve further and im currently learning pyspark and aws any other skills that i should focus on too and link to my resume shopcell hi friends im currently applying to omsa and have taken of the micro master classes i currently work in a role that does not do much with data and i want to start on the data science ladder it seems like most data analyst jobs are either just data entry that pay hr or they require a master is or years of experience is there something in the middle that i am not finding should i search something other than data analyst i want to start building experience now while i complete the masters rather than wait til i am done and make a huge jump in industry shastaslacker i am trying to transition from civil engineering to data science i enrolled in a master last fall it is a part time program and i am still working full time in the engineering construction industry i am trying to make the jump as quick as possible i am thinking this next quarter i might take less courses and focus on industry certs and kaggle projects i feel like most of my school work so far has been too theoretical and not while it is great knowledge i have littler experience with projects that would actually add value to a company what are your thoughts would you rather hire someone with less course work complete and more projects theofficialrapa hello i will be graduating from a prestigious university in june with a bs in physics but i want to transition into the field of data science i have experience with computational physics projects but nothing purely computer science any chance of me landing a job in data science or will i need a masters to transition thanks for the help strikethatsaythis my post was flagged so i am reposting it here hi everyone i am hoping you can help me figure out which of these career options will get me closer to breaking into the data science field i have a background with over years of experience in digital marketing and currently work in marketing operations i would say this is my business domain understanding marketing and the data related to it i recently graduated with a masters in data science so i am trying to make an internal move at my company to get me closer to a mashup of marketing analytics data science given that my data analyzing experience has been mainly in my grad program i am not sure if i have a shot at an analytics or data scientist role at the company here are the options i am considering option a data role in marketing operations this role would be working in preparing the data for modeling it is intentionally left vague because the jd and job title are customizable it stops short of including data modeling in the jd i have been offered this role and have to decide in days if i want it but i am not sure if this will get me closer or further away from my goal option apply to other internal roles there are other roles in marketing analytics or data science but i am not sure if qualify for them the marketing analytics roles are requiring years of experience in analysis the data scientist role focuses on nlp which is an area that i enjoy doing in my program this role requires years of nlp which i would qualify for if it includes my time in my grad program if i try for these options this would mean i would have to pass up option to go for option any advice is greatly appreciated soggypeanut tldr fancy way of listing data management as a skill on resume hi all i am going to apply for new jobs soon and i am making my resume is there other fancier way of saying my old job had me doing wouldata management tasks i want to maybe list it in the skills section if possible what i actually did was that i worked with a team of clinicians environmental scientists and at their institution they had an internal database so one of my responsibilities was querying the data from the database and prepping the data for analysis also no one else on the team knew how to access the data so i was tasked to extract all the data format it and convert them into csv files this way my team could also access the data if needed so in essence i did a lot of tasks that would fall under data management imo what is a good way to put this onto my resume forbiscuit what do you exactly want to do with data science forbiscuit definitely remove the skills barplots because you do not want to discount your abilities nor exaggerate them what does a in machine learning mean organize your skills section into scripts data and visualization libraries soft skills is accuracy truly the best metric to use for your project maybe score is better and you describe where you identified gaps are in your project and how you would course correct forbiscuit the best way to know what the job titles entail is by reaching out on linkedin to the companies you are interested in and seeing what they do i can guarantee you that data analyst is not a data entry job that pays hr and some also pick those jobs up to simply automate the process and make money on the side while doing the main job but data analysis is definitely a good starting point but the title differs between each company for example amazon calls it business intelligence engineer apple calls them analysts meta calls them data scientists forbiscuit data science is a competitive field you should try your best to complete as much as possible while doing the projects as well because there are others like you in the field who are trying to transition into data science and have projects and expertise to demonstrate their experience it would help if you can identify exactly which domain of data science you want to work in since you have been doing engineering construction have you considered econometrics based projects related to construction industry in general for example running a model to identify factors that encourage house purchase material cost increase forbiscuit do you know which field of data science you wish to work in for example engineering advertising product analytics research this will help provide you a better answer some you can do by applying directly or doing bootcamps or may require you to actually pursue a masters forbiscuit what is the size of the company in option preparing the data for modeling sounds like data engineering work but if your passion is marketing analytics which is more than just nlp such as running experimentation a b tests customer segmentation and ltv analysis then i would recommend finding analysts jobs within the marketing department or narrow your keyword to specific activities you want to do experimentation is really popular in the job market and given your yoe it is worth exploring datascitest i guess that is the question that i need to answer i am thoroughly interested in the field as a whole but it is difficult to decide what i want to do because i simply have not experienced any of it besides what a small portion of data analytics is thanks for your reply i will take off the bars in the skills section and also organize it a bit more other than these points do you think the resume is fine i will be updating it further with time but wish to prioritize applying and learning more skills shastaslacker yeah i was just looking for data on construction spending nationwide i was hoping to find a data set that showed construction spending by government agency or by sector water power transportation etc i was not impressed with what i found i think large companies would probably have some very interesting data that could be gleaned from their monthly construction schedule updates and pre construction vs post construction budgets but i doubt that information would be shared outside the company theofficialrapa i am not sure yet but i think i would be open to almost anything as long as it is interesting research or engineering would probably be on the more interesting end but advertising or product analytics for a cool company i would not be opposed to what is in my range of possibilities without getting a masters strikethatsaythis thanks for your response the company is a large enterprise would you say option is going the wrong way the offer was positioned as a step in that direction and would give me a holistic view their words not mine of preparing the data and eventually transition into modeling since the two teams work closely together it is still in marketing ops so it is working with marketing data but it sounds like your best advice is to go for option and apply for a marketing analyst role most of the ones i have seen are interesting to me forbiscuit this is my opinion but i would recommend pursuing computer science for your bachelors as it will help provide you with incredibly strong foundation in addition you do not want to start with a terminal degree data science is more of an interdisciplinary degree and may be terminal for some programs making it harder for you to pursue phd in the future as you lack specialization you can always pursue a masters in data science as your terminal degree but cs as a foundation will enable you to be integrated into more data science oriented roles and face slightly less competition in the long run when competing on data related roles such as machine learning engineering need a masters in cs with specialization in ml ai or data engineering you can immediately jump into this from cs major forbiscuit focus on doing more projects and utilize better metrics also explore a niche set of activities for the jobs you are interested in instead of doing cv nlp ml and spreading yourself thin focus on one field and just do many projects for it ideally utilize metrics that you can use to translate into if you wish to go into tech experimentation forbiscuit research or engineering would probably be on the more interesting end but advertising or product analytics for a cool company i would not be opposed to do you have the slightest idea how little that narrows it down range of possibilities will be slim at the moment considering layoffs existing masters students experienced candidates job hunting maybe explore any entry level data job like data analyst and develop your skills from there datascitest this seems like a good opinion and aligns with what i have had in the back of my head but worded much better de and ml are both fields i am becoming more and more interested in thank you theofficialrapa haha fair enough thanks for the advice",

  "shadowylurking honestly i think you are better off reading books than looking for content content can be what you look for when you have a specific problem fahadrizvi i absolutely hate linkedin now all anyone cares about is likes and followers it is quite literally like any other social media platform at this point purplebrownupdown i feel like most ds posters do not have much of a portfolio they talk about being kaggle grand masters and such but i have no clue how good they actually are at the same time it is not like ds work in private industry applauds open source work passionatepossum linkedin in one big corporate circle jerk one third of the posts there are from companies trying to attract attention to their products and i guess that is okay and it might even be informative to see what others are working on as long as they go easy on the bullshit the next third is from recruiters that is the only reason i am on linkedin so that i can find a job quickly should i need it but they can be extremely annoying one of them actually called my company pretending to be someone else to get past our secretary and then trying to poach me but i guess it works otherwise they would not do it and the last third is by asshole like this guy who just love to hear themselves talk trying to make themselces sound a lot more important than they actually are ignore and block them trying to find interesting people to follow in linkedin is like trying to find silence in a disco it is the wrong place to do it jbcraigs my main question is who should you follow for quality content not tarry singh or siraj raval and the likes for sure sososhibby better off searching github is than linkedin to find someone to follow for data science mostexiti googled his name could not find anything about him his phd thesis the university from where he graduated or where he is working he has google scholar page with a fake university email address and a bunch of suspicious worthless papers his page even attributes to him a paper from that means he may have written it before he was before lol he is definitely a fraud muchdiscussionnot him he appears on my feed as well never talks about anything worthwhile just buzzword laden posts no actual papers or algo related posts i unfollowed him after he started posting random thought leader garbage i follow bojan tunkuz s\u00e9bastien raschka chip hyuen mainly and they always talk about interesting new developments in ds apart from that i have also followed the profiles if the head of ai in meta and google do not recall their names sorry they rarely post but when they do its worth reading own linkedin is a place for intellectual masturbation tskdecibel hate the word freshers danielbaldielocks follow me i post zero content therefore i can say with absolute confidence that of my content is top quality amds i have curated a list of ml blogs that post really good content a lot of the authors in the list are also active on linkedin and twitter in particular i recommend you a lot of the authors in the list are also active on linkedin and twitter in particular i recommend you andrej karpathy chip huyen chris albon eugene yan sebastian raschka vicki boykis nyquant also annoying most all of the connection requests are from either random students who are told to network recruiters looking to earn a commission by placing people into your company vendor sales people looking to sell something request either have no message or pretending fake interest in your profile cwhzz twitter linkedin sovindi that is of linkedin there is no point taking the posts from that platform seriously tarehman i have a linkedin for the same reason i have a socket wrench set because it is a useful tool for some things also like a socket wrench set i do not spend hours a day looking at it for fun that is have a linkedin and keep it up to date but do not bother with the social network part moist i do not think i would ever trust a wouldata scientist who dresses like a klm flight attendant on their profile picture on a more serious note i keep to following real people who i know irl on linkedin i may not be following the most ground breaking trends in data science but i prefer that than being bombarded with all the useless influencer type of crap out there glcrdns kdnuggets post in linkedin sometimes there are interesting articles pythonhack einblick updates are looking pretty legit i use their python code blocks as a scratch pad issamnone there are none you can follow for quality contebt suspiciouslivingfollow twitter more than linkedin i would say and of course verify who you follow its always good to do a bit of research q rka i first used to see his posts and never liked it at all just another views farmer also how often do you notice people claim to have read someone is book and they found it good by mentioning the author chunkychapstick i follow chris albon vboykis and kareem carr on twitter captmartelo my main question is who should you follow for quality content no one kevindotjohnson when you see someone uses the word fresher they can be flushed straight into a toilet magicpeanut my management oh okay so you know azure so you are a data scientist but right now we need data hernanl anyone who quotes themselves with a picture of their post is not worth any attention whatsoever im connected with recruiters and people with real jobs in my city nearby only all the rest is a waste i am officially now old i have never heard of a fresher is this just a person that is fresh out of graduate school so synonymous derogatory terms to call your teammates new employees newbie inexperienced or and i am just spit balling here junior data scientist data analyst is this guy just saying you should hire entry level positions because they become good workers yea that is how careers work you start shit then get better then you get old and manage people ta da innocentnot chatgpt write a linkedin post that i got a job thanks to linkedin post exciting news everyone i am thrilled to announce that i have landed a new job and i have linkedin to thank for it thanks to the power of this incredible platform i was able to connect with a wide range of professionals in my industry and beyond from sharing valuable insights to engaging with thought provoking discussions linkedin has been an invaluable resource for me throughout my career journey and now thanks to my network and the opportunities available on linkedin i have secured a fantastic new role that i cannot wait to dive into i am thrilled to be joining such a dynamic and forward thinking team and i am confident that this new role will be an incredible opportunity for me to grow and develop both personally and professionally i am so grateful for the support and guidance that i have received from my network on linkedin and i look forward to continuing to connect and collaborate with all of you in the future thank you for being a part of my journey and i cannot wait to see what the future holds linkedinsuccess newjob careergrowth looks familiar r linkedinlunatics alreadytakenfor what i am seeing around linkedin most headhunters are bot as well bot hunting for bots thepasttenseofdraw do not use boomer work facebook kellzmost of what we have in tech right now are mostly influencers not people with actual knowledge of tech just to gain followers likes and engagement just to boost their egos it is best you focus on yourself more and gain knowledge from materials you get online especially e books dr null twitter is actually a decent source for information i created something for my personal use where i fetch new tweets daily from some of the folks who post actual education content i have a yaml file with username and category of what these users post jujufoxy honestly i do not use linkedin for quality contents to follow it is primarily for networking and job seeking so just use it for the main purpose there are literally infinite amount of great contents out there for more than what you are able to learn due to limited time that we have thedataguyos saw this guy post notice that a ton of these posters are coincidentally recruiters career coaches i have decided most of their stuff is bullshit of course they are going to sell push ideas that help them get people hired for their paycheck dzyang if you are looking on linkedin you are looking at the wrong place outside of research papers and textbooks i would say twitter blogs especially the technical blogs at a faang like such as uber and github maybe youtube at the intro level i started using li only for networking and not using it for consuming content li content has become so stale these days but seeing cringe like this on my feed irritates me a lot so a few days back i went ahead and decluttered li by unfollowing some and then for a couple of days i mindfully removed connections or unfollowed people who post sht like this on my tl and also people who like comments on sht like these now my tl is almost clean i still clean it everyday lol bobdope this may not even be a real person captainable i can recommend the book deep learning by ian goodfellow yoshua bengio it is much better than linkedin posts use github for content lol kantgeek this guy post about data science and its well grounded in literature or practice none deleted singularity you need to first create the hunger for the hunger you need to create the need take any topic and think what problems are open in this domain study those problems this is where data and visualisations collide think of how you can visualise the problem using the data boom there you have it once done you think do you really need ai to solve it not every problem is an ai problem both may have some interesting approaches and the more you read about them the more you will get to know instead of following people follow the problems grimpilsama whats engagement farming raharth run skthewimp legend colibriweiss agree i do not know the answer but this is a big problem on all social media too many profiles like these on linkedin the platform is becoming more like ig its all me me me clicketrie i have been posting on li for years i have got followers and i started my first data science job doing econometric time series and forecasting in for me i have made crazy valuable friendships there and built an amazing network i do not know that i am there to read more this is how you do ds posts cause at this point it would be quite boring what linkedin has been useful for is seeing which new packages i need to try or what techniques were no longer using in industry because they have been found to have issues and for me it is really an opportunity to share my work and make friends in the space it is not for everyone but linkedin has improved my life wafflesrrrrbetter people take linkedin seriously bobdope i have a fake linked in profile but it is just for spying on people what is the point of what this person is doing linkedin is just corporate simping aside from it acting as a resume i have found it pretty useless nobody linkedin is as stupid as facebook now prestodigitarium it is pretty simple do not follow people on linkedin not linked in any book recommendations just follow the authors of those book and top minds at big tech for data science i think i have only followed andrew ng stanford professor author of the famous coursera ml course and jeff dean tensor flow map reduce top mind at google for data engineering the dame but i also follow a couple of people with title of staff engineer at big tech robbindebank i thought i was on r linkedinlunatics bryptobrazy it is social media for adults who love to tell everyone they have started a new position as a recruiter at xyz and they are really good at microsoft word linkedin influencers are some of the most boring people on earth which is why they are on linkedin cyclicdombo what is the point of people making fake accounts and farming engagement on linkedin seems like a lot of effort for no reason bannedbutbackbaby it is embarrassing i thought it was weird people posted social justice complaints on there like oh shit what if your boss sees this and takes it as an insult but then people continue to use it to complain about in office commuting low pay etc it is so easy to lose a job opportunity or respect by your entire network by posting complaints funkyfreshjeff idk i love linkedin landed me a great job agreed the posts are all garbage though nothing worthwhile to read on there what is the last the other third is people like me who just want to know their coworkers clients customers backgrounds before working with them and never post anything mental tarry singh or siraj raval snake oil salesmen of the year mental he has google scholar page with a fake university email address and a bunch of suspicious worthless papers his page even attributes to him a paper from people like him will destroy the sanctity of google scholar as well everyday we are a bit closer to the doomsday i cannot stand linkedin at all even the valuable data science posts make me feel annoyed linkedin just cultivates a condescending culture mental i follow bojan tunkuz s\u00e9bastien raschka chip hyuen mainly and they always talk about interesting new developments in ds yes these are nice people to follow purplebrownupdown sebastian seems like the real deal he posts work and a lot of open source stuff bojan does not not really sure how useful his stuff is or what his reputation is thoughts sovindi i think i saw literally the exact same words from a different linkedin account it is a professional circlejerk network caedro social masturbation by pretending to be intellectual messier_ reading this has given me intellectual orgasm bobdope remove intellectual and i agree bobdope i think it is an indian thing same goes for agree to end a post stating something obvious yaswanthbangaru that ai not heisenbergs uncertainty principle thank you certainly bookmarked the only suggestion from the peanut gallery would probably be to mark blogs that are partially fully paywalled but your list is amazing as it is anyway so that is just the icing on a cake nyquant even more annoying when actually accepting a request to connect from a student because why not being in a good mood today they actually do not follow up with any message so it is all about scoring connection counts sad waste linkedin is mostly for being headhunted solvermax until a couple of years ago i would have disagreed the linkedin groups i subscribed to were good with lots of useful and interesting content then they got taken over by massive amounts of self promotion and political opinion as terrible as twitter is linked is now worse soldierducky yes it is also where hiring managers seek out content and would drop dms for interviews very little hr people because it requires the right following and pouring through esoteric content everyday grifters and larpers like the above would immediately be swallowed and called out by anon twitter lol it is a natural filtering mechanism tywinasoiaf twitter is a place for either communist or nazis punitxsmart fresher is a commonly used term in india for a new grad angryorangetrump she excels at engagement farming and is more concerned building her image as a data thought leader and influencer more than anything else mental to each their own i suppose but i feel she also has very tone deaf posts nothing worthwhile or of substance

get the power then you get the women i mean data ladies dsiscool a list of books based on recommendations here fivebookscom or on li from those i follow these are listed in no particular order and are

  "bobbytables_ um yes every company on earth wants to eliminate their call centers via nlp go and make billions nfmcclure nlp is more than large language models llms and chatgpt it is harnessing the power of unstructured text data for solving problems it is very much in demand to be able to make sense of textual data log files user posts in forums texts emails home for sale descriptions for sale estimation resumes job descriptions for labor analysis and job matching being able to use text data is a huge beneficial skill and becoming even more in demand now quantpsychguy are you entering the field and wanting to discuss or are you a seasoned data scientist that is looking at angles for career growth the two are vastly different and the answers would be similarly different shivasrightfoot chatgpt is kicking off a style tech bubble right now tech companies were laying off thousands but now there is also an absolute scramble in the valley for nlp people to work on transformers this is just my general impression from publicly available knowledge though i have no inside knowledge johnfatherjohn short answer yes there are more ml engineering roles that specify nlp work but these are competitive soggy chatgpt is trained from massive data source professional labelers fro research standpoint starting from the beginning of models if you do not have enough money aka computing power this field is hard for you this trend started when deep learning come into play but if you come from business or fine tuning perspective you do not wanna publish cutting edge papers or so there is a lot to do by empowering chatgpt etc quantpsychguy well dude you should know lots of data science staff got laid offbut most did not one target group alexa at amazon does not mean the niche is going one way or the other what do you see for nlp in your organization lots of untapped potential i would guess nyquant wonder if amazon kicks itself now for laying off alexa nlp people just before the chatgtp boom i guess chatting away with alexa is going to stay limited at the switch the light on and light off level for a while longer snoozledoppel business layoff happens because of cash flow reasons not always because of technology alexa got canned because it was not making money it is an application of nlp nlp can be used in a lot of different wayssome of them will succeedsome will notsummarizing meeting minutessummarizing chatgptpersonal secretarycustomer centersthese are some viable options imo nlp is a very valuable skill right now but it may not be in years i am basing this off the current rate that automl is advancing but i could be mistaken i think it is a skill worth having and if you find it interesting then it is worth investing time in improving in this area my advice would be to also spend some time learning how to leverage automl for text analysis which will be valuable as we become more dependent on this ramblinginternetnerd it is a huge field with tons of growth also tons of change it is also likely that most of what is cutting edge will be obsolete in a few years i get the vision but is this realistic fuehnix it only takes one company to automate that and release an api to sell there is not a mass amount of companies out there trying to develop inhouse solutions nobody has time for you unless you are an expert seasoned but coming from a statistical background it is still a niche that promises to have untapped potential but we lack comprehensive data to make it truly useful for profit fuehnix no the other guy has no idea what he is talking about nlp is super bloated and the competition is fierce for anybody who is not an expert level researcher with a phd you can still enter the field if you are willing to do a ton of extra work compared to regular software engineering but if your passion is just casual i recommend an easier field and just reading articles about it online bobbytables_ amazon shut alexa not due to nlp shortcomings but because it did not generate sufficient revenue you asked for a growth projection all projections are apeculative by nature the use cases for nlp in business is enourmous and based on my experience with chatgpt it seems realitically acheivable therealtiddlydump it only takes one company to automate that and release an api to sell yeah that is totally how the market works one product and one product only and no competitors ever enter first to market always equals the winner for sure always nailed it i think nlp is just the hot new thing that every senior exec is asking their data team to look over because they saw a linkedin post about how chatgpt is a silver bullet to all their woes a lot of hiring potential until these execs realize a the current programs they have work just as well better or b the money needed is much greater than they expected i would recommend finding a speciality you are interested in and becoming an expert if that is nlp go for it quantpsychguy probably true of almost everywhere there is a need for data engineers and data infrastructure maturity before it will materialize into value short term on any sort of scale maybe we

  "certifiedofficer poisson fun fact means fish in french pdf can be derived by considering the case when the binomial has very small p and very large n the intuition for the poisson would be waiting for a rare process among many whereas the binomial is waiting for a possibly not so rare process among relatively few something like watching traffic for car wrecks would be poisson while rolling dice would be binomial the exponential pdf can be derived as the waiting time pdf between subsequent poisson events so how long between the car wrecks notice this theoretically should not depend on whether there has or has not been a car wreck recently so the exponential distribution is memoryless in fact so is the geometric distribution and the exponential can be thought of as a continuation of the geometric too most beginning statistical inference or intermediate probability theory texts should have these derivations in particular casella berger has them all together there is not one way to look at this either the connections between probability distributions is a difficult and extensive subject short answer why there is so many euler numbers it is an eigenfunction of a derivative a functional in terms of functional analysis and so just like with matrices you can have invariants by exploring invariants in the pd equations you then get the specific solution secondly since it is we are working with uncountable base you necessarily have to have unsolvable and with multiple solutions sets of equations from category theory you can even derive that set of uniquely solvable equation sets is strictly smaller then non uniquely solvable for specific condition look up cauchy kovalewskaya theorem carath\u00e8odory theorem or more manageable for someone less familiar with math picard lindel\u00f6f so this all combined gives you those euler functions since you can calculate eigen functions of both poisson and exp equations and they all are basically e x e x simplifying for clarity in general i suggest some level appropriate book about pde university script since anything informal will have excessive amounts of hand waving protonpusher if you want to know then you should learn the basics of a subject called analysis or real analysis probability is a synthesis of combinatorics and measure theory the latter of which is generally covered in analysis if you do not understand what the sigma algebra or probability measure is in a probability triple you will likely be memorizing some heuristic analogy which will not help in reasoning but it depends on how much you need to know to fool your boss check out brighter side of mathematics on youtube there is no why just do certifiedofficer this answer is super intriguing as it speaks to the pervasiveness of eulers number even more generally than this specific case however i do not see where the derivatives are coming from here and how it applies to this case is it as the derivative of the cdf or is it something else thinking like this above is why you see martingale based market prediction with time dependent expected value please do not do that management is more then enough headache as the situation stands let is fe define exponential distribution let x xq then the solution is the classical exponential distribution alternatively you can use discreet process poisson point process in case of exp distribution and then apply central limit theorem but since you mentioned that you do not have significannot problems with discrete combinatorics i tried to give you an alternative equivalent approach one special remark about trying to learn distribution using functional approach distribution in one field of mathematics is not exactly something equal in another field they overlap and can be proven equivalent but this is not clear at the beginning specifically if you try this then be very precise and try to not mix tempered distribution with distribution in the statistical sense the things you can do with sobolev spaces and what it can simplify in terms of analysis are truly amazing but unless you will take your time to learn the theory you will make mistakes since theorem conditions are quite strict and can sometimes feel absurdly abstract and or restrictive without seeing proof",

  "solvermax this is entirely normal in all of the analytical teams that i have worked in with analysts focus on getting results good programming practices like testing and validation are neither implemented or encouraged a direct consequence is that many results are just plain wrong chock a block at least on the commercial side this is completely normal i have sat in on meetings and watched others absolutely make up results because graphs but the code will never be reviewed or understood by the person making the decision to answer the obvious question yes i was out of there soon after as was the rest of my team synthphreak i think what you described is pretty normal and as an mle i also hate it lack of documentation makes onboarding and orientation a nightmare lack of tests makes reproducibility harder and slows down refactoring almost every experiment seems to have at least one false start due to some silly bug but as i have gained experience i have started to at least understand why things are this way if not approve of it a part is that i think lots of people in the analytics space never studied cs so the importance of automation and good coding practices was never really instilled in them then again i also never studied cs nor swe and i definitely see the value in its principles so but the biggest factor imho is that for all the benefits of documentation tests tidy code etc that stuff does introduce significannot up front costs which slow you down at first in the world of experiments and exploratory analysis you have lots of little one off needs and must iterate quickly through the space of possibilities in order to identify the promising ones so while it is a bummer for the uninitiated to get acclimated to messy code in the end it is usually just faster to make small tweaks and roll with it rather than tweak document push pr etc the other thing to consider is that things like thorough documentation and testing are most critical when your code base will definitely persist and continue to undergo development for a while but in the worlds of data science and machine learning many lines of research most with their own code bases ultimately never bear fruit so get dropped for such work strands any time spent documenting and testing was wasted so when you are in that initial experimentation phase on the road to deciding whether to pivot or persist the cost benefit of taking time to write docs and tests is probably not worth it so yeah in conclusion i do think everybody is life would be better and fewer false results would occur if everyone just adopted proper coding discipline but doing so is not without drawbacks in the world of exploratory research mostly in terms of productivity so as always it is just a trade off i was thinking the same years ago too this day no one has asked to review my code they if they really wanted would review the findings and assumptions perhaps perform their own basic data inspection for any concern and that is it ipsocranius this is why the fda is starting to classify ml products as clinical devices i have seen obvious errors in the past week people write custom prediction functions and apply results to nondeterministically sorted lists as they predict bad outcomes among other things code review do it randomramman high performing teams have detailed code reviews this is the bare minimum even if they have some excuses for why they do not have documentation or testing in place which will almost all be bad excuses imo you must_ review each other is code maybe i have been lucky with the teams i have worked on so far but i am alarmed by the number of people in here saying they have no code review practice on their team i can see this being more common for analytics sql work not that i agree with it but it would be insane to ship an ml model without review no review testing etc is absolutely the norm in academia in my experience the open code data movement is helping here but most fields have a long way to go at least in academia you have many groups trying to study the same things so if your paper makes a claim but the code had a catastrophic bug it will likely be caught eventually if it does not make sense in the context of everyone else is work that is my take from my experience in physics anyway ymmv slackington what you are describing has been my experience too but things are starting to change in analytics there is a shift towards writing production grade sql to centralize kpi definition and optimize performance in data science ml a lot of companies are moving towards data products with clear sla both mean code needs to be version controlled peer reviewed documented and adhere to company standards icymammoth weird my teams do pr reviews any code analysis gets reviewed and approved before we share results with stakeholders fun if you work for a strong team there will be peer review of analytical code i have worked in teams with and without code review and in the team without code review i partnered with another strong data scientist to review our work you can create the good practices in your teams it is because ds is the field where a computer scientist goes when they cannot be bothered to to proper software engineering and code testing because it is boring s but only partially because the real answer is a bit more nuanced but it is also kinda true it depends on the company in my ds rotation they had code reviews esp before a model was given to ml engineers for production milkteaoppa yup both academia and industry should not be that way but as long as errors are not caught then it does not matter they exist justaneedlessboi yea that bothers me as well i think it might be because the field is close to statistics and analytics and not just programming so people just focus on preparing the report and do not care if it will work later but yea some time ago i noticed that a dataset prepared by a colleague duplicated every record above a certain value so there were like as many records but nobody looks at these things seriesg yeah i see this all the time practices that should be standard on more of a data engineering track like code reviews are not even considered for the analytics side of the house it isworrisome artistic off topic but an auroc of is not good if the data are skewed in anything close to an ratio a simple guess would do that this is why roc curves are not all that meaningful if the prior probability is significannot different than what you really need is auprc where the baseline is equal to the frequency of the predicted event autumnotter yes this is normal it is more normal in academia where software engineering best practices are rarely discussion no this is not ideal half my job is teaching data engineering and data science teams how to use git test write documentation collaborate and deploy i am brought in to do much more advanced things but then that ends up being the places they are nearly always deficient you should have simple code reviews a basic version artifact control workflow testing and documentation it will be challenging convincing others to use good practices but learning them will take you far eipi what you are describing has been my experience too at my last job absolutely no code review whatsoever most code was not even checked into git i also have friends in academia phd programs in stats that have no code review and their code is terribly written at my current job we make a big effort to do code review write tests etc it takes time but it makes us all a lot more confident that what we are doing is actually right and makes it easier to make changes to code in the future without worrying about breaking things honestly it is insane to me that data scientists are not writing tests i would never ship something to production that had not been tested yep protonpusher it is easier to publish produce rubbish and put the burden on someone else than to verify your own work if the error is ever discovered the person producing the crap has moved on having acquired the false accolades and will not be held responsible this is the norm in academia and data science and why there is such a proliferation of frauds why waste the time to potentially prove your model wrong when your teammate competitor is a fraud and just turns in garbage positive results in half the time do notyouloveme in the funding and corporate world they do not want to know what your code is they just want the results to look good so they can cash in on it you will suffer far more negative consequences by producing correct code that generates results that look bad for the organization they would rather you mess up and make them look good skeletonsofcloset do you think its because the data science field is yet to incorporate proper industry standard practices that engineers follow skeletonsofcloset damn thanks never knew this was the norm skeletonsofcloset thanks for the detailed response yeah we have really great data scientists in team who come up with amazing solutions but after the work is done they are too lazy to go back document the code and just move on to something else and the interns or other members are made to pick up the pieces and make it production level or worse they send it to data engineers and they would scream looking at the code maybe a little effort to document a bit goes a long way for others but i understand the trade offs you mentioned and one needs to balance that while writing code jobeta i agree with this essentially in ds writing tests before your model is going to be in prod is likely to end up being very wasteful but as soon as it does hit prod you should write tests or expose yourself to the same issues as with any production system psychologically it sucks because you have shared your results everyone is hopefully excited and you have to tell them to slow down so you can write tests engineering teams will look at you like you are crazy and non technical teams who feed off fresh hot results to stay motivated to even care about your relationship will be bummed it sucks so i guess one should always try to set expectations with the added time to write these tests but not reviewing the code seems almost always crazy however op talks about peer reviewed articles i had the same experience you can publish tons of results relying on code that no one ever reviews even the journal reviewers which quite frankly is a bit crazy even outside of the ml field they often incentivize for you to share your code but will not actually review it if the code is accessible at least it is out there for everyone to see and review when they need it but if your code is not properly tested it is likely that it will break constantly and no one will end up using it anyways skeletonsofcloset yeah this is how i feel going through their poor code synthphreak sla skeletonsofcloset yeah in the production level there is some kind of code checking since it involves both engineers and scientists but converting to production level code from the shitty un documented analysis code repo is a pain skeletonsofcloset yeah such mistakes are what scares me when i write code lmao skeletonsofcloset ohh so the project i had worked on had previous auroc of so it was an improvement on the test set yeah we had shown prc curves but it was not that great so my prof moved it to supplementary lol solvermax i think it is because few analysts have studied computer science writing code is a means to an end having been self taught with little or no knowledge of the lessons learnt by professional programmers over several decades of experience thenoobtologist i would say so it is also been my experience that data science seldom has code checks a lot of times the teams are small and the managers might not be technically enough to support code reviews chock a block ohhh yeah for sure it is changed a little but not a whole lot you are in a tough situation if he decides to develop some emotional intelligence it is going to take years synthphreak a part of it is also probably a not my problem mentality most organizations have a human centipede structure with each job family forced to eat somebody else is shit in your org i guess the des eat the ds shit and in all likelihood the ds probably have to eat the shit of the business folks in the form of let me barf some half baked poorly articulated idea into your ears now go monetize it with the magic of data science in my present role i was advised i should use matlab rather than python but was told there were scripts i can use to maintain common team output months later i have used one matlab gui they shared which was externally produced for the team everything else has been in python using my own code as there was seemingly reluctance to share their code slackington service level agreement if your data product becomes a feature clients pay for there are much stricter availability requirements artistic just a little pet peeve of mine roc are everywhere and are often used as a surrogate for accuracy unfortunately they fall apart when the coin flip baseline assumption does not hold congratulations on the publication btw skeletonsofcloset ahh makes sense most of my team members have just done research with a proj with a cs degress or a few are mechanical engineers who did a course on coursera and a few projects and got a job in data science so have no idea what it means to write proper maintainable code skeletonsofcloset i have faced this too initially i though its because they did not want to share their ideas cause they were way up their ass but later when i went through their github code i realized it was poorly documented and there were a lot of mistakes in how the data was processed i feel the reluctance is there because they know their code has a lot of flaws and do not want someone to point them out to and make them feel stupid or worse invalidate their entire hard work since they did not have any prior good code maintenance experience or proper code testing solvermax yep that is typical of most teams",

datasets comprised of several csvs big enough to make excel struggle djstillalive log parser from microsoft has not been updated in years but it provides a lot of this functionality as well it also has some cool options so you can do things like consume a csv but have your query output be a different format such as xml or even a chart as i said outdated but quite a bit of functionality the tool you want is called duckdb omnipresentcpu can you drop multiple csvs and perform joins if not feature requested would be a fun challenge i reckon raman_ you can use apache drill if you want to run sql

pretty serious one it would likely turn out nothing got compromised but our security team would have to report it during our accreditation review and it would look bad the offender likely would not get fired but they would be taught not to do that again as a rule you should not upload company data to an untrusted third party site and even if you confirm that it does not currently transmit

never know until you actually create a portfolio then a b test it by applying for similar jobs with and without providing your portfolio to see if your outcomes are measurably better with the portfolio without data everyone on this thread is just speculating yes you should always have a portfolio rhaknar now that soneone ask this question i have worked for year with data i used power bi python latex and i have pretty good code there but the issue is i signed a non disclosure agreement i have been struggling to land a job i do not know if it is because i cannot show my work should you guys think that i can show my code and results without breaking the non disclosure agreement thank you all monicayougotaidsyo piggybacking this question to add another one what if i have experience as a data analyst and want to enter the field of data science should i work on a portfolio bakochba if you dint have a lot of experience yes years experience probably not necessary but it honestly can only help there is no downside i think one needs to demonstrate capabilities so a portfolio is always good regardless of the years of experience and the quality of the portfolio matters too santascashew i agree with what people are saying but to give an alternate opinion portfolios for experienced hires are great if you have cool projects to talk about that make you stand out if you automated a dc motor to open your curtain using an arduino or made a smart mirror that tells you the weather using a rasp pi those are great to talk about because it makes you stick out and are not particularly hard to do just requires some initiative having a school project unless you won some competition with it will lump you with other new grads so as an example i have years as a chemical engineer and year as a working ds my resume only talks about of my personal projects i am proud of and the rest is work experience i still link to my portfolio with other school and personal projects i have done but i do not bring up the others unless interviewers bring them up the last point i want to make is that i think it is beneficial to update your portfolio as much as you can throughout your career it keeps track of your past work and gives you examples to draw on when you are interviewing even if its a work project that you ca not share source code on describing your contributions is a good habit to keep track of friendlyimposter i am in interviews with a company right now the manager asked if i had something i could perhaps show and walkthrough instead of aptitude test or so i have only stuff i did for my last company and there is a the problem with no nda and b there is nothing that is really amazing at the moment i wish i would have spent some time on a portfolio clearly convoluted i think portfolios are always useful if you are moving up continuously it is proof of your progress and but that is just me po handz yes work projects can be in your portfoilo why would i

set that is a mile wide and an inch deep i barely remember what i had for breakfast but i can drop into literally any tool chain in the planet and fill in the gaps as i go how do you demonstrate that to someone you grill me too hard too deep on any tool chain i am going to fumble how do you show somebody just a world of knowledge and capacity i had a coding interview and it was counting islands writing yaml manifest and bash scripts really makes that skill set atrophy sure enough though i had actually contributed to an interview prep repo specifically covering counting islands where they had a bug i was like look i know i am fumbling on this but here is this link i got that job so besides the fact that for me writing is a way for me to keep track of my work and something that i reference very regularly to me it is important if i am hiring it is a tiebreaker at the very least it is gotten me jobs besides that you have valuable information share it with the world i feel like this sub is

speculating but the people on this thread are a sample of the data so if op ask and get of no it is useless because x then he can have a better idea about the usefulness of a portfolio of course there is no pure truth but op is not asking for a single truth he is asking the community about their experience by reading the comments in general it seems that the majority of the people here think the portfolio is not something useful so the return on investment on making one seems not so high but we never know what will really be the experiences of op ps the people on this thread can be a biased sample and is probably but it is still better than just simply guessing something anygeologistwaste of time zazamood lol show the code that is a no talk about it depends on your non disclosure agreement on what you can and cannot talk about that would suck if you cannot talk about the project at all read the ndr i am sure it is vague but i am pretty sure you can talk about something pristine test i am in the same boat bro can anyone share their thoughts here adotpim this sounds like bad advice that can get you in trouble so far all i have been asked to do is to talk about the project and i have been free on how much details i am confortable to share given ndas signed wouldatastoryteller you can talk about work projects but do not put them into a portfolio that you show to others outside of your company you do not own the paid work you do for others plus confidentiality and all that verbally discussing it at a high level during an interview is fine showing them your code and outputs is not wouldo notyouloveme i once got a job based off of youtube videos i made explaining how some of my projects worked tech recruiters and hiring managers can see a display of competence and behavior without much effort adotpim the fuck do i know google it my friend synthphreak to be fair though many people can be prolific and talented professional coders but have basically zero github presence at my work we use bitbucket and gitlab and i am not exactly overflowing with free time outside of work so my github has little activity by contrast i have a bunch of repos with polished code on both bitbucket and gitlab but they are all private proprietary so i cannot show them off so comments like yours are unfortunately hard for people like me to relate to as the de facto main remote repo hosting service i do wish we could use github more at work edit typo supplychainphd hmmmm i could always put stuff on github most of my stuff is done locally and i never had a big need to make a git masheroz do you know of any other technical job that requires a portfolio therealtiddlydump the question was not should i have a portfolio it was if i have years of experience should i have a portfolio that is a clear_ no synthphreak this sub is toxic and elitist af every career oriented post just drips with it this post is less that and more productive than most but i totally agree with you in aggregate rhaknar thank you for your response the code is all mine i am going to read the agreement and see if there is a loophole the code itself is nothing like super secret or that would affect the project po handz you are not going to get in trouble talking about projects unless youre sharing source code maybe if you had pending patents or it was super novel but of things are not those two and you will be fine i just take screen shots of the front end and explain how i built the datasci part newpuabie from reading my company is recruitment sourcing guides it seems they are mostly just looking for some signal of this dude is not a complete fraud they might see you have a video explaining something related to the job you are applying to or they are sourcing for and decide based on that to move you forward i genuinely do not believe they would even watch the whole video and certainly not understand the content deep enough to judge whether that is legit or not hm is are a different beast and depending on the company some kind of a technical blog or yt channel can be great at convincing them for example in my experience with amazon the main hurdle is convincing the hm whereas for many others google and meta for example you do not interact with the hm at all google has a hiring committee and they keep changing at what point you interact with them but when i interviewed with google hc was involved only after the full loop that means that the only things you need to do to get to a full loop at least with these two is to have a recruiter believe you are worth giving a phone screen to if you pass the phone screen then they are going to give you the full loop regardless of anything else and if you either bomb the loop or pass it with flying colors then your fate is decided regardless of anything else so the way i now think about this is that a portfolio or something similar like what you had can be helpful in getting the first recruiter interest even if it is pretty shallow as long as it is convincing an actually substantive one can potentially sway a tight borderline situation at a hiring committee or be the critical factor in hm led hiring companies like amazon point being that depending on what type of companies one is applying to it is probably not worthwhile to put a ton of effort into a portfolio for the sole reason of having easier time getting hired it can absolutely be helpful in learning the various techniques which is super helpful but that is somewhat unrelated to having a public polished portfolio sendducks yea this is not entirely correct my current role sr data engineer i was told specifically a hobby project and the code in that repo got me the job lonelyperceptron say hello to my little typo tinkr_ yeah i was not talking about showing any of the code you have written for work lol obviously that will be private for most people and would be assumed to exist if you have a few years of real work experience anyways i was talking about providing a link to your personal profile of whatever vcs hosting service you use whether it is github or gitlab does not matter a lot of people like yourself do not work on personal projects or contribute to open source projects that is fine if it is empty i obviously would not put it but for those that do work on such things i would absolutely put it on your resume even if you have a few years of experience it is a differentiator if i am prepping to interview someone and they have an impressive gh gl bb whatever profile it is an immediate plus for me it tells me right off that bat that they put in effort to improve themselves in their spare time they are competent at fundamental skills for the job like version control itself reading and updating code written by others documentation and other good dev practices and that they generally enjoy the work again if that is not you then do not bother adding it it is not so much a knock against you as it is a big plus for those that do i am naturally skeptical of claims that people do not have time for it but it is a bonus and not an expectation the expectation is that you at least write code at your current job it is perfectly fine if you ca not share it because most people ca not we have a technical portion of the interview to evaluate that synthphreak make a git this is cute haha i feel like my grandma wrote it cannot you just do an internet therealtiddlydump i know what my work is like imagining that someone else would do that in their free time_ so they can hope to get a job is crazy i have made it very clear to our hr team and dept management that we do not consider this a meaningful thing to ask about during the candidate search process i respect my homies too much hireryantoday i have years of experience and i have a portfolio that is a clear yes do you benefit from things you find on the internet then give back to that or if for no other reason then mindfulness and self reflection i think everybody can benefit from writing and articulating problems that they solved adotpim i guess it depends i am only talking from my limited experience and everything i have produced that could be taken a screenshot on was stated as classified and i would be legally liable if i shared excellentbidyeah this is just bad advice op please do not listen to this whatever you do for your company is not yours your company owns it and unless you get written permission from hr legal to share company information even if you made the entire thing do not do it it is literally illegal wouldo notyouloveme getting a job is a social engineering problem you need to be able to identify what algorithmic process will get an output of you got the job many recruiters and even hms like shiny objects there is a regular portfolio without any presentation but then you can put together a real piece that you shove in their face and if it is good enough it has the potential to give you a big leg up just with dealing with clients shiny objects and a fine polish often times wins people over so there is definitely no harm in displaying your abilities to produce shiny objects synthphreak where is the typo did it get edited supplychainphd pretty much stats programs sure no problem github i am out of my water edit how much could a banana cost michael therealtiddlydump i have years of experience and i have a portfolio that is a clear yes this is not an argument i am going to bother engaging with i also have snow tires nobody gives a shit the purpose of a resume is to get interviews full stop if you want to link to a website i wo not check to display code i ca not verify you wrote go nuts recommending that someone else do that is not helpful advising that a younger analyst with a few years under their belt labor over a portfolio is neither toxic nor elitist do you not see how saying you should have a portfolio because i do is a pot covered in vantablack strawman ing the kettle synthphreak getting a job is a social engineering problem you need to be able to identify what algorithmic process will get an output of you got the job this is such an r datascience flavored statement stinglikegonorrhea portafolios inserts pinched finger emoji hireryantoday i will once again refer to my experience in that my portfolio has gotten me jobs wallymetropolis has it gotten you a

  "experience in good practices is much more relevant than knowing how to use a tool it is very easy to teach somebody who knows what they are doing how the process should work what to look for why it matters etc how to use a tool to do it autumnotter probably the first but it depends on the team and who i had to train them if i have a team of salesforce specialists then definitely the first if i need the sf person and have a bunch of strong data people then i would take the second and train them usarasa thank you i was leaning towards that answer my bosses were not as certain so it made me think",

  "nraw whenever the business side is telling you how to do something instead of what outcome they need your bullshit senses should be tingling we need chatgpt to create our knowledge graph in a graph database on a quantum computer is just that big manager asking for some data from the db preferably in excell or powerpoint wignerville saw this post on linkedin thought it was funny people spend more time on new buzz words than understanding what they are currently using maxtothej as someone who works in ml nothing has generated so many experts on chatgpt and ml as chatgpt so many people are using llm as a buzzword and pretending to be experts everywhere i largely do not even engage because it feels like pissing in the wind even with the deepdream hype people did not claim expertise nthcitizen the simplest question i have found to trip up chatgpt is in the statement a large mouse ran up the trunk of a small elephant which is larger in the statement a large mouse ran up the trunk of a small elephant the word large refers to the mouse and the word small refers to the elephant therefore the mouse is larger than the elephant in this statement this clearly shows chatgpt has no context for the nouns i feel that ai becoming a topic of mainstream interest is emboldening people to speak confidently on it when they have no education or experience in the field just like chatgpt misterwaffles this is really common unfortunately and somehow you have to delicately frame things so that leadership instead explains what they want in terms of outcome user experience etc and you the expert get to choose the solution not the other way around that is why they hired you but chatgpt is the hottest buzzword on the planet right now arguably one could say that you are not making this decision based on data but on your expert opinion so therefore you should give chatgpt a chance but with a big caveat my sincere suggestion is to tell them you will create an ensemble model that contains your solution mixed with the chatgpt solution which is superior to chatgpt by itself you could say a specialized sentiment model plus the general chatgpt so each model is predicted probabilities will be combined in a weighted fashion such that the weights are hyperparameter tuned for performance if that means chatgpt ends up being weighted then so be it whether you want to discuss that fact is up to you it is a win win you will have done your due diligence and it is the best compromise i can think of you do not have to lie but understand you will be letting the machine learning select the best predictions rather than you so you are not going against your leader ask chatgpt if your way is better if you can coax it to say yes give the results to the manager and declare mission accomplished riricide i get triggered now if someone starts talking about chatgpt and how it is going to solve world hunger as they say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing i am impressed you did not roll your eyes and walk away when your higher up was pretending he was an llm expert pyepyepie just tell them that using openai is models means sending your data to another company of ceos of established companies do not like it by the way i am almost sure fine tuning some openai is model that fits the task will work better than your models but again i would not send the data outside so fast also it is not cheap an additional reason would be the fact that they can stop or change the service every day just give them logical arguments and do not push back for no reason another idea would be to use their models to generate a larger dataset to train your model man you have so many relevant arguments performance is really a bad one for the rant agree tiensss my old boss would have done that i am so happy i am not working there anymore fhir_ totally to be expected the term ai has too much baggage with it and generates expectations for casual users there does need to be some tempering of the public is knowledge but that is likely something that is going to take a while if sentiment analysis is all they are after there are better ways to do it than chatgpt chatgpt might be the easiest just fire off a request but maybe not as flexible for future needs idk bakochba how would chatgpt do analysis it is just a chat bot proofrequired hey but non technical stakeholders have some skills which you do not have so we need to listen to their wisdom data scientists are all nerds who cannot communicate or interact with people normally s seriously since i have become senior i ignore most of what the business leaders have to say i hate to them and trivializing lot of ds concepts it just makes them feel like that they also know stuff and can dictate whatever asine ideas come to their mind i hope you have a manager good enough to filter out such garbage ideas i once had a ceo at a start up who wanted to have update about how much model metrics have improved on a weekly daily basis we were not even updating our models so frequently dead limerick i wonder how many people thought mathematicians should give up when the calculator was invented some points to help t to a party will not work for many enterprise applications due to data security reasons and or regulatory reasons apis like that of gpt divinci will not work for cost reasons yes it is seems relatively low cost now but for a large scale application it may not be economically viable and also there is a risk of prices changing additionally many apps will need a fine tuned model and as you can see from the pricing page it is multiple times the current cost of just using the off the shelf apit to parties will not work for reliability and sla reasons to clients who require high uptimes when signing a deal with a customer who depends on a high uptime you cannot blame the party api for it being down it is your service that is downt to customize the network is currently very limited via the apis r and d innovation in areas like extending token limits multi modal learning and other aspects that may be more specific to best support the needs of your business cannot be done via apit of violating the terms of the api usually you need to be approved for your application for a llm or at least be very cognizant of their usage terms which also may change later what if somehow your client puts in text out of your knowledge that violates the terms of the llm providert of ip for enterprise applications built on core tech like an ai model it may be suboptimal from a business perspective to outsource that to a party when it comes to considering the ip assets of the company that is basically you do not have much of an ip story this is relevant if your company is up for consideration to be invested in or acquired this can lower overall value in the minds of investors or potential acquirers because there is less of a moat for competitors tldr so for at least these reasons security cost reliability flexibility terms ip my prediction is that in house nlp is still going to be relevant for the foreseeable future blueeaglechat gpt is like the internet craze of the and something that people are comparing to a gold rush i recently read an article where someone asked chat gpt for research papers and it gave research papers on that specific topic the thing is the papers did not exist it just made it or rather artificially generated those papers with doi numbers which did not exist i am honestly worried about this think of what will happen if we give people dictionaries with errors or science books with science fiction chat gpt becoming mainstream is something similar imo pitrucha sure let me comeback to you with estimated costs which will be way higher for using openai api and are you okay with us sending confidential data to a third party that we do not know if it will not be used to train some other model final ask chatgpt how to do sentimental analysis artsybashev you can use the openai api to get the vector representation for you documents use the post then you can use your existing infrastructure to build your classifiers using the embeddings will give you better results than the chat the main research and business question is then if the resulting accuracy justifies the costs jackmitcham not saying you are wrong but i find it interesting that you did not offer it a sentiment analysis question and instead opted for a physics problem as a language model i would expect it to be better at sentiment analysis not that it would be better than the specialized models but i would be interested in seeing how it performs against those industry benchmarks synbiosvyse part of the reason the bot failed on your question is that it is a very oddly framed question relevant rhubarb no it corrected its answer to the right one you just did not understand why it was right go back and read the original question it is final answer was correct i am not kidding your question was ambiguous and you just thought your interpretation was the only one the stated question did not specify if the miles the cars travelled was the sum of two cars or if each car traveled miles it is final answer of two hours is correct for cars if we read the problem statements as saying the sum distance for two cars was miles it did not get the answer right on the first reply but then again your question was not a good one and you assumed it was a hood one and then you did not see why the final answer was correct after you nudged it it was quite reasonable for the ai to assume miles was the sum since adding in the information about the number of cars would be irrelevant otherwise i think it was giving you credit for not asking a silly question so it took the interpretation that would make the number of cars relevant it is actually demonstrating the chatgpt has a theory of mind it was interpreting your ambiguous question in the way that would give you credit for asking a more thoughtful question it is theory of your mind tried to guess what you really meant to ask it is final answer was incorrect it is first answer was not evenmoreconfusednow learn about the concept of temperature and use that as the main argument for never using such tools for anything other than a creative task so chatgpt is a project manager bioinfbro as said below ita pretty complex skill which is called managing upwards aka making your bossss happy you can explain that chagpt can write at college level but has kindergardners math skills your specialised tool is theother way around happy to add chatgbt to get the best of both worlds management likely wants to show investors that they are staying ahead of the tech curve beetlejuiceme i mean it is true that llms are now outperforming lots of more specialized fields so there is a chance that this higher up person had read something with some truth in it and they were badly trying to bring that up i often think about disney spending over a million dollars de aging princess leia for one uncanny valley scene in the force awakens they were using all the most up to date and advanced de aging tools and graphics and then a year later someone does a faceswap on their home computer and it looks better now all of disney is resources are going into graphics that are essentially faceswap related but it took them a few years to turn that ship around because they were so tied to the old way of doing things similarly dragonspeaking and all of those super advanced text to speech programs have been outpaced by much simpler stuff read a nice article about whisper recently tthe point of this long post was to point out that ai tool have their uses but they should not be given the benefit of the doubt in every scenario simply due to hype if a model is to be used for a specific task it should be rigorously tested and benchmarked before replacing more thoroughly proven methods i agree with this in theory but as the tools rapidly change the next couple of years the question is going to constantly be one of balancing reliability with not getting stuck in the past iwantagrapeinmymouth business owners and execs have no clue what technology is this is going to be a problem forever because it is a field that inherently spits out people who think surface level understanding of hyped tech is market research speedis notfree i am not someone who usually gets bent out of shape about this sort of thing but i have been quite concerned at how easily people will regard chatgpt as some sort of oracle and also how accepting people seem to be of deaths caused by self driving cars being tested on the road people try chatgpt and it does a surprisingly good job in answering a few questions responding with well written responses it is a language model afterall people then seem to build large amounts of trust in it with large extrapolations into wider technical fields and questions i wonder if it plays to human frailties similar to how someone who is eloquent and learned about a specific subject area gets trusted by others on subjects well outside their area of expertise if these individuals chose to comment im glad i work in science since people i work with immediately devised some loose tests to start to evaluate it and quickly found significannot problems i also know that university of cambridge biology asked it to generate some assignments then intermixed them with real students assignments to be graded the chatgpt submissions got a passing grade but not much more this information was passed on to students wouldatainchicago i feel that ai becoming a topic of mainstream interest is emboldening people to speak confidently on it when they have no education or experience in the field im going to tell a dark truth about these naive managers that hear about a buzzy ai concept and insist it should be shoe horned into places it does not belong they are not dummies they are not ignorant when you say it does not make sense for this application they probably believe you and they ask to do it anyway for a very good reason it advances their career chatgpt and generative ai both development and application of are one of the few tech areas seeing large investment and rapid growth right now openai has raised startups specializing in generative ai are one of the only sectors seeing increased valuations right now imagine you are an overpaid marketing executive in boom times you can fake it and ride the natural current of a growing market but when the economy starts to contract you find it hard to prove your value you are worried you will get laid off and with the market as it is it will be hard to find something that pays as well as your current gig then you start hearing the buzz around this chatgpt thing people are enamored with it people like to talk about it rich people are throwing money at it if you can find a way to slap chatgpt ai onto your product or your marketing or most importantly your resume maybe people will talk about you too of course if it is bs then it will not impress the companies actually working on ai but a ceo at some other company in some other industry might associate chatgpt with that magical thing vcs keep investing in and assume you have some of that magic yourself so even if things do not work out at you current org and that is looking more and more likely you can slingshot your way into another cushy position somewhere else all because you asked that nice young data scientist to do a chatgpt thing continuewithapp this isy everyday struggle thanks for saying it i am in a club now this may be a generalization but from the sounds of it i do not think you explained this right to your boss chatgpt does not do sentiment analysis so even if it was better it does not do it end of story crunchyal you can test it against rankerhack problems and it does not do well it may give you the correct output but it will fail the test cases most of the time it is mostly overhyped due to art generated ai and is a glofied chat bot that also has some biases opinions that seem neutral but it is not really mysteriousstringgo with them down the path and explain how it will affect them vs what you want to do and how much better that will be yikes op basically asked gpt a question with answers and blamed gpt for only answering of them and based on what op responded sounds like he does not know there are to me even answering that first is quite amazing for a chat bot and if you ignore the pride of data scientist for a second due to the hype of gpt the manager asked a legitimate question for someone who is not technical and cares about the well being of the company and i believe it is up to the data scientist to acknowledge and answer that question for the manager and the audience unfortunately sounds like op not only failed to answer the question expensive api data security etc but also got frustrated because someone lower on the technical level asked a legitimate question that belittled his fine tuned model and his pride of a data scientist i also feel bad for gpt as a bot who cannot defend itself and simply wants to help psychmancer so i work as a ds and what is weirder here is not that they want you to use chatgpt but they are getting a chat bot to do sentiment analysis it would make more sense to have chat write you a python code to do it in nltk in python and then run it normally this feels very executive level request and all that implies relevant rhubarb i think your test question is entirely wrong for your purpose chatgpt is not a general analytic engine intended to do math but it is a good text content processing and summarizing engine it can predict what likely follows from prior events while i do not know anything aboud how metric and quantified sentiment analysis is from the name i would imagine it involves inferring what people are likely to do given what they have said before that probably is a great job for chat gpt yeah honestly i am not a cocky or overconfident data scientist as i have only just finished my masters a year ago but it irks me beyond control when someone who does not know the difference between a histogram and a bar chart tells me what deep learning models to use acrobatic can you give me the data in scanned word tables that is really funny that is a great example it is something a human could almost never get wrong twistedbrother this is a facetious example it is entirely possible to both specify and learn implicitly that size modifiers refer to the relative size of the object they modify and not the absolute size of all objects it is not necessary but it is plausible and probable in fact asking chat gpt which is larger a large mouse or a small elephant will almost certainly produce the correct response i can already imagine it lecturing me on the average sizes of these animals it is partially about how we ask the question our ability to ask questions depends on our own mental models like subject verb object in english which is not universal the machines will continue to develop reasoning skills those who do not get how the model reasoning works even superficially if they cannot tell you the difference between a transformer and an lstm are bound to either over estimate the model or critique the model as if that critiques the entire approach the example of using the large mouse and the small elephant does the latter that is a great suggestion i suppose i ought to at least assess its usefulness in a scientific way rather than just basing my opinion on light reading and informal experimentation tiltfortat this should be a last resort solution imo you are the expert in the field and it is your job to clearly communicate that building an ensemble model to include chatgpt just because someone higher up jumped on the hype train would be a waste of resources management has the last word of course but in these situations it is very important to make sure everybody is aware of your position so this cannot be blamed on you in the end also this should be a red flag for you and you should consider looking for a different company in the long run fair enough i will raise some of those points and try to find out about pricing terms etc from openai to help bolster my argument it was not performance so much as unreliably i suppose that i was raising like i said the guy suggested using it to basically query databases i think we all know that a pandas query would yield more credible results than a chat bot hence why i tried to ask it logical and easy math questions to see if it could be a reliable tool outside of just nlp it cannot at least yet i agree the higher up seemed to think otherwise and when i lightly pushed back on that notion explaining why that would not be reliable they told me i need to do my due diligence and explore the use of the tool for those purposes i am not kidding they have zero knowledge of this area nor even tangentially to this area maxtothej yeah op is not appreciating the execs business domain knowledge s drakkur this phenomenon is common across all fields where the metric for success is money company position just because someone has great skills in business acumen networking does not mean they generalize to other areas which is what we see in the ops post the same is true for technical experts thinking their their business acumen is equivalent to their technical aptitude which is what we only see when we step back and look introspectively there would probably be less head butting between teams like this is all of us thought more holistically about problems solutions almost did not read that as sarcasm and started to lose it great points thanks for laying it all out in a way that should be digestible for higher ups oceanboi based play theres literally way better open source embedding models using openais embedding service is pointless good suggestion i have actually played with gpt and clip embeddings before in a past project to feed into lstms to do classification tasks on video data as you mentioned a bert model from hugging face that is essentially what we have been using i think op is just frustrated at the situation rightfully so if you ask me and threw the first thing he could think of that tripped chatgpt i agree it would be interesting but i get why op is not interested relevant rhubarb i wanted to point out the op also got the math wrong the problem is the question is ambiguously worded and he chose one interpretation of it when there is a different one if i say to you two cars drive miles in hours that could mean either the sum of the distance travelled by two cars was miles or it could mean each car traveled miles judging from the ops follow up question he thought he was asking the second scenarion but really the first question makes more sense after all why supply the irrelevant information about how many cars were driving unless of course were speaking of the sum in which case that number is needed the error the chat gpt makes is not the one the op thinks it is but rather a different error chtgot first computes a speed as though miles is the amount each car drove then it uses this speed in an equation that is correct for estimating the time needed to reach a total summed distance of four cars so it did make an error but then when the op tries to coach it in the right direction he is making the wrong assumption again assuming the question was not ambiguous oceanboi yes but what does that specifically entail if the idea is i am going to ask chatgpt to analyze this text data for sentiment there are already models that do this without having to back door the tokenization properties of a chat bot to perform weird black box sentiment analysis by using a physics problem he is demonstrating that the model cannot solve or put into practice simple deterministic functions sometimes it will provide the correct function and in the same response abandon that function this is just bizarre behavior so how could i rely on anything it gives me regarding sentiment analysis can you imagine what it would cost you would have to give it pretty large prompts to analyze or multiple smaller prompts in tandem i am less versed here but i cannot imagine it would be something a company would be willing to pay for but maybe take the neutral route and check out chatgpt for no other reason than to get paid to play with these are the three major issues i see people are mistaking what chatgpt is and is not because it is impressive and mind boggling to interact with but once you spend enough time on it you take a step back and realize how volatile its outputs are even on lower temperatures but surely if this bot is to replace specialized tools that are proven reliable in their applications then it should be expected to answer an elementary level logic question it is really not much of a math question but rather a logic question lightly disguised as a math question i wanted to see if the model would try too hard and overcomplicate the simple and that proved to be the case in this scenario the cars are driving independenlyt of each other increasing the number of cars by a factor of is not going to make all of the cars literally double their speed relevant rhubarb whoa now that i think about it further i realize the question was so ambiguously worded it had a third possible interpretation for which the gptchats first answer was correct the third interpretation is that in the first sentence of the problem the number of cars is irrelevant and it is simply telling you how fast all the cars drive so the second sentence is asking how long it would take four cars to elapse a total of miles that would be hour with each going miles for a total of finally i note that the original question also has a fourth and unanswerable interpretation if we assume miles is the sum distance two cars went they might have travelled different fractions of that maybe one car drove miles and the other drive in that case there would be no way of answering how long four different cars would take to sum to miles unless you assume the second two cars were identical to the first two cars which in fact gptchat says it will assume so i would say most of the confusion here is on the part of the person asking the questions not chat gpt an ambiguous question was asked and under one possible answer gptchat got the answer correct on its first response when the author told it it chose the wrong interpretation it corrected its answer to the correct answer to a different interpretation so the op was mistake twice gptchat was correct both times ha how can chatgpt predict what likely follows from prior events if it is not a good general analytic engine in the test question it literally failed to predict how many hours it is likely to take four cars to covers miles at miles per hour do you really believe predicting people is behavior requires less analytical capabilities this is such a weird take it reads like it was written by chatgpt categorically_ no i just say why like i am genuinely curious they have no answer and look stupid i also really like the is a banana bigger than a cat example that was going around nthcitizen this is a facetious example well i got it from daniel kahneman is book noise so it was not intentionally so i believe such examples are useful to burst the bubble of hype around chatgpt to enable more realistic discussion altonmain yes and assuming that chatgpt gets weighted near zero and the higher ups ask in depth questions about the model it will be very easy to put the results in to a few powerpoint slides that easily and convincingly communicate chatgpt sucks for us without you having to get sucked in to a power struggle wouldfphd i am going to go against the current here hell no this is exploiting the fact that people from a science background feel the need to fairly assess things that do not warrant being fairly assessed hitchen is razor what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence it should be a particularly powerful tool to analyze large volumes of data coming in says who why based on what measured how let is flip the script here because i have been on the other side of things if a data scientist were to go to a ceo with an idea and said literally the same thing this technology should be a particularly powerful tool to analyze large volumes of data coming in who thinks the ceo is going to blindly agree to it without justification if you raised your hand use it to slap yourself in the back of the head im more than happy to entertain the idea that chatgpt could be revolutionary to any number of industries and applications but before i dedicated resources to it resources who already have a god damn day job i am going to need either a a business case developed by someone else that clearly highlights the value of chatgpt for my or a similar enough problem statement or b a very well thought out business plan that details how we would derive value from it relative to what we do today jobeta exactly try to remove pride from the problem they are probably wrong but also paying you so you can ask if they would like you to pivot and assess the feasibility and cost if switching to chatgpt and then treat that as an experiment it is very likely everyone will learn something last i checked the model behind chatgpt is not open source anyways is it so even if you wanted you could not fine tune it for your problem which is nice because it means you just need to see how it performs out if the box for your use case i would not go the ensemble model route tho because they do not know what it even is and will not expect it and it seems like a pain to maintain i would just compare performance of each ipsocranius it need not be scientific approach it as a product what do you give it what does it return what features does it offer and what does it need how much would it cost to adopt into a pipeline labor and opex and what would the roi look like you know it is the wrong tool always remember to help others to save face and you seek alignment and you will see their trust in your skillet grow bakochba do they think you can feed it data company data and tell it to run an an analysis and it would spit out results everytime i have used it you just ask questions or ask it to generate code but even then it is example vide nothing custom proofrequired yeah one thing i read over and over here and also out there is how come people believe that we should be listening to execs because technical people have no understanding of how real business works this whole narrative has been sold so much from top level that now even technical people have started parroting it artsybashev it really depends on what your are trying to achieve i think that if the boss wants to micromanage and make you use embeddings from a buzz company there is nothing wrong with trying it out the worst that can happen is you get the metrics to show that embeddigs provide worse results and costs more than bert from huggingface artsybashev unless your classification task goes very deep into the inner thoughts of the author of your documents you probably will not beat bert is good in understanding the intention of the author but more commonly we are classifying documents in a more shallow level based on just the information content bert is great at that but as said no harm trying it out and maybe you and your boss will learn something interesting just have some fun trying new things out no that is not how it works friend relevant rhubarb it doubles the total number of miles their sum elapses in a given time you are not seeing that the question is ambiguously stated and has several possible interpretations think it over and you will see the other ways it can be interpreted two cars each independently drive miles apiece in hours two cars drive a total summed distance of miles in hours apiece given the complete context of the question the second one actually is the more logical interpretation not the first one otherwise the original question is as stupid as asking if you have one bucket that holds gallons and another bucket that holds one gallon how many buckets do you have or asking what color was napolean is white cat or how many green chinese pots in a dozen an intelligent person not assuming the questioner is being devious or stupid would assume that knowing the number of cars that went miles was not irrelevant and so would be led to assume that the questioner meant the total elapsed miles of the two cars not their individual milage relevant rhubarb no i was being perfectly serious chatgpt and transformers are at their heart trained like bert in predicting the missing thing in an ordered set they go way beyond that since they have internal memory states as well that are keeping track of objectives and prior info but these things are not storing details like how to do physics or math in analytic terms they are storing guidelines and connections between ideas the latter is good for fuzzy reasoning and generalization and perception of abstract patterns but less good at memorizing cold facts like the millionth digit of pi these things only have about billion parameters and even fewer lstm feedback states so compression theory tells you they ca not memorize that many things thus if you really want to have it not make math errors then it has to be worse at something else like memorizing us senators or movie stars or chinese cukturak affairs questions that drill down on acute specific knowledge are likely to find a blind spot but top level patterns and connections and summaries of observations are what a transformer type system is good at i have no idea what kind of data the op is analyzing is text comments of sentiment or tick boxes on a scale of to on well constructed customer queries a chatgpt could extract the meaning of a customer comment like it is better than nothing at all or i would rather eat poo and die than use this tool pretty well it might be really bad at constructing numerically precise things like a histogram of how many red headed customers rated the new hair dye at a given rating relevant rhubarb do you realize that the gptchat did get the right answer in the end two cars each traveling would cover a total of miles in hours individually each would travel miles four cars would travel miles total in two hours that was the final answer the poster wrongly assumed in their mind that both cars traveled miles individually thus he was dilberateky trying to supply irrelevant information to confuse the chat gpt but ended up not realizing he hard musphraded the question and got got it right in the final answer venustrapsflies i do not have time to explain the details to you speedis notfree this is what i have seen good experienced people do they calmly ask a few pointed questions in a non confrontational tone and usually the person realises they need to pipe down to avoid making themselves look stupid are you questioning me definitely my initial stance was basically summed up well in what you just said i am already spread pretty thin at work with multiple projects each of which should easily have dedicated teams working on them so i really did not want to spend a lot of time trying to justify my reasoning for not going the gpt route i almost was shocked that i would be expected to look heavily into something that i advised would most likely not be fruitful i feel like my expert opinion however capable of error should be weighted more heavily than a non expert opinion psychmancer sadly this is my boss every time i ask for a new toy in my job they keep asking me to explain why it is needed and is it needed right now like i have answers to that i just want to play with ai or try a new tool i saw on a yt video yes they literally think that i think people are grossly misinformed on what some of these new ai solutions trained to do maxtothej its beneficial for ones career the part i take issue with is the amount of self brainwashing to parrot it unironically in an anonymous forum where you have nothing to gain relevant rhubarb okay then tell me how it does work so if people each have a heart rate of bpm and you add people to the room their hearts will all beat at bpm and explode inside their chests that is fine but you did not justify your previous claim that chatgpt is able to predict what likely follows from previous events or what people are likely to do given what they have said before how much experience do you have with ml i have years yep some of us around here are good experienced people magentatentacle are you fucking sorry man if i ever worked with someone like that it would be on hell yes i am questioning you proofrequired i find these kind of execs ideas same as that friend of yours who has lot of start up ideas but has never written a line of code and wants you to implement it over a weekend i believe i explained it in your other comment thread but the car is travel rates are independent of each other increasing the number of cars by a factor of does not double the speed of every car that just would not make any sense if anything increasing the number of cars would slow things down due to traffic but in a simple question involving cars why would they suddenly drive way faster just because of the presence of other vehicles relevant rhubarb notice how you used the word each notice how you also are adding rates not beats now reread the original question it does not use the word each it also gives miles which are additive not rates which are not relevant rhubarb well i was expecting people had an inkling of the research into transformers when i aluded briefly to some general properties of chatgpt but i see i should not have assumed that prior knowledge so excuse me if the following is too pedantic not trying to insult anyone is knowledge bert is half of a transformer pair it is often trained supervised on the task of leave one out recovery problems so for example give it an english sentence or a genome string and mask out a word or phrase or run of characters it thus predicts the missing characters in the string if you always make the missing word be the last word in a sentence you now have a method of generating sentences by having it emit the next word in a sentence given all the prior words transformers add in even more ability to remember contexts and can transform information in one form to information in another form thus if the transformed form of a set of input texts is summarize or find relations it has the ability to draw inferences or predict the appropriate response to some input internally chatgpt is using all these tricks to memorize the guidelines it must follow and transform varied information in ti english sentences and paragraphs that are predicted to answer a question that is what i was referring to my general drift here is that i find it shocking people think chatgpt has expert or domain expertise or is good at applying math it is not it is good at predicting from patterns you might say well math is a pattern and it is but it is also such an exact pattern that learning it requires more domain expertise than you could encode in its tiny brain and exact math is not just abstraction and prediction of what the likely response should be thus people should be not holding chatgpt up to the light for perfect accuracy but for an amazing ability to summarize guess conclusions and stunning talk in english that is coherent across a paragraph the idea of extracting sentiment from consumer information could be plausibly what it is really good at it depends if the data is soft like text or hard like numerical entries relevant rhubarb read the stated question no where does it say the cars both went miles they might have gone apiece for a total of gptchat logically assumed the latter the questioner assumed as you did the former i see your perspective i just do not believe a human would really interpret the question in the specific way you are describing okay so chatgpt is not good at predicting what likely follows from prior events or what people are likely to do given what they have said before i see what you are saying but humans interpret the question in a different way the model is meant to have human like conversations but completely misinterprets what i am asking where a human would usually not have that issue relevant rhubarb thank you for acknowledging since others may be thinking along similar lines let is extend the conversation on your last point consider this ambiguous puzzle question i have spiders they lay fifty eggs a day how many eggs total are laid in days if i had said chickens in stead of spiders you would know from experience that a single hen ca not lay eggs by herself in a day thus you would immediately assume that collectively the chickens produce a total of eggs a day but i said spiders and you probably know that spiders can lay a lot of eggs at once you probably are not an expert on how many that is or how often they do that but it might be reasonable to assume that the is the average number per spider so in the case of chickens you would answer in two days and in the case of spiders you would answer the case of the cars here is not only ambiguous but a possible red herring is inserted why say cars if it is irrelevant why not say a car can go miles in hours but if it is relevant then it is logical to assume it is meaning is apiece for example let is rephrase the question my fleet of cars can cover miles of the city in hours if i double my fleet how long will it take to cover miles i think you might from this wording think that is the sum of fleet miles now is that really how a human would read my two cars can go miles in hours how long would it take with four cars i can see how interpretations and wording can cause undesirable results and how your example illustrates that point but i also think this somewhat bolsters my thoughts that using a query specifically designed to find what you desire as an output would mitigate that issue entirely because the logic chain will not be inside a black box so to speak relevant rhubarb i agree but i want to add an additional insight about chatgpt that makes it a slightly different level of ai what you said is correct that a single query to an ai in english is prone to an ambiguity pitfall unexpectedly whereas a structured query with a deterministic algorithm is not but chatgpt has the novel property that you can talk back and forth in a way that at some point both of you understand what goal of the query is this is different than anything that existed before now it is true that this is still at a primitive level where there is no assurances the ai then actually does what was mutually agreed upon but that is a whole different problem ignoring that secondary compliance issue the idea that you can eventually communicate with a back and forth that reaches sufficient clarity is new the final problem is that even if the desired outcome is fully agreed the ai might do it wrong unintentionally for example ask your year old what time is and after you explain multiplication and get to two tables in mutual understanding they still might mis compute in the case of a structured query the algorithm is not helping you construct the query you will get what you asked for but you may not be able to ask for what you want if you ask is the teeth baring person in the picture happy or frightened you would be able to cobble some varied code to hunt for teeth and some rules that might spot certain instances of fear or pain but you would have a hard time really constructing that query even if you could think of how long it would take and you might have a whole lot of other types of queries these chat gets can be programmed in english you describe a lot of things about euphoria and fear in plain english much better than any structures query can be written to represent tgat and then when it does not quite work right you can easily say what is not right so this back and forth to a mutual understanding is something i think we just turned the corner on in ai tgat was not there before chatgpt lots of improvement needed for its encyclopedia stored of knowledge on compliance on accuracy checking are needed but the big step is the elucidation of a negotiated mutual understanding in plain english rather than code so i will forgive it for math errors when it can be coached to the right answer in the end by the way i do not mean to tell you your bussiness you are the domain expert on what is meant by sentiment analysis i suspect from your point of view that it is probably more numerically well defined than fuzzy like text english so you may be quite correct that staying away from a black box is the right move perhaps you can do both though try gathering both numerically quantified data as well as qualitative impression data and try to see how well gotchat can make one correlate to the other that way you can argue when gotchat does better and when it does not concretely while still following management direction ultimately you will get more mixes of data collection if it works and someday it will be ready in the mean time you can use this example to demonstrate the ambiguity problem to management",

and knew of vmfa my home museum but had never visited richmond well also turned out she did not like flying at all so this was not going to be fun for her so i told her about landing in similar

  "eightstream you probably made a mistake with your current job sole data scientist at a small start up is not a great place to start your career you will learn way more and set yourself up much

probably a bit unrealistic anyway those jobs are ludicrously competitive with a lot of very specialised applicannots and if you cannot get in straight out of school it is probably not going to happen for you as a mature hire cocodirichlet you should move you are not going to have much to show after a year in your current role at this start up you are doing admin you have no mentors etc

rocketgigantic yes yes and yes that is all i have got to say about that good luck and please let us know what you decide always always do what is in your best interest your employer does the same squidsandmartians i will probably be the one with the unpopular reply here but i would stick around for at least a half year it shows that you are committed to the work and company and not jump ship

and show them whatever you have to offer will help them with x or with y yes you will not have mentors or seniors to lean on but that comes with a bit of an advantage depending on your own confidence they do not know how to do the stuff you do but if you do not know how to do the stuff you do they will not know that do not wait until someone asks you for help something learn in identifying

want to leave after months you still can shotcaregiveri stayed with small companies for the better part of my year career first tho g i would change is to start with big company early to get exposure and experience in the big pond small firms just cannot provide the same degree of high visibility experience start big then go to a small firm once you have seen the game at full speed good luck lifesthateasy do you really expect me to read this massive column of words about a person i have no relation to and decide your life choices for you you are being ridiculous how does one crack a quant researcher role then do they hire masters in stats maths ds or straight out of undergrad considering the median age at these firms is thanks that is exactly what i worried thanks for the remainder fhir_ that is how i would play it definitely got the leverage which is good for someone in their first job thanks definitely will continue to explore eightstream for a quant research role at a top firm the ideal candidate has a phd in maths stats econometrics finance or maybe cs if you want to get in with a masters you want it to be highly specific financial engineering ideally with a bunch of maths in your undergrad as well there may be some people who walk in with the right undergrad major but they would be rare and would be from target schools with great gpas and internships under their belt from what i have seen most ds masters programs are too generalised and not respected enough to attract much attention from top quant firms not saying it does not happen but it sounds like op took his shot and missed for entry level hires these firms prioritise hard maths education a lot more than work experience unless you are a trader or something and so you are unlikely to make a late career jump if they have rejected you as a grad financial engineering is a masters specialization specifically made for data science in big financial investment companies also a very difficult specialization from what i heard phd from top school thanks for the insightr r so that means even if i do get real hand on quant experience in this small fund it will not help me much to get a qr role at somewhere betterr r to give more context my master is in applied math i actually changed my mind halfway to not continue in academics that is why my career path is a mess now at the time i was applying i feel i am massively under prepared for interviews but i need a job asap so i only tried a few places and took the offer at where i am now my original naive plan was to continue preparing while getting some relevant quant experience at this smaller firm to put on my resumer r but based on what you said it sounds like whether i have these quant experience or not make no difference when i go apply again does the ranking of the school for the phd in stats matter mysteriousstringare you saying you cannot get in entry level or late career sounds like never connect with people in the role you want get coffee with them do this enough times if you have the skill set and you will join them ps you can probably connect with of their entire company on linked in do not forget to message the ceo asking about their company magicmanhow do you define data science eightstream i will never tell anyone that it is impossible but my guess is your chances are not going to be much better in five years than they are now research especially is an area of quantitative finance where the top players are very focused on hiring fresh blood straight out of academia they want young people with new ideas that have not already been tapped by other firms i would maybe have a chat to a couple of recruiters show them your resume talk about your plans and get a realistic assessment anygeologistit mostly only matters in the extremes program fit is much more important does the industry perceive a phd in stats from a low ranking department as a weak point or is a phd a phd anygeologistoutside of schools that have widespread name recognition most employers are not going to care if you went to a low ranking program versus an average one unless that school has particularly bad reputation prestige matters less outside of academia even if the hiring manager started off in academia also the farther removed from grad school you are the more people skim over your education and focus on your experience most people could not tell you the difference between idaho state university university of idaho university of montana or washington state university but there is a massive gap in quality and resources

  "ijustwannabrowsepls it is easier to pick up than most other languages and it has very strong built in packages for statistics analysis ml etc basically it is just relatively simple and powerful then because this is true more people use it and so you will find more resources and documentation for it for most people and use cases they will not run into the problems you mentioned bobdope as somebody who had to write neural net code in c in grad school i thank god for guido every day gypcasino the performance of python r and other high level language is kind of irrelevant because for many applications the bottleneck is how fast and well you can code it not how fast the code executes the expensive mathematical calculations for matrix algebra deep learning etc in python is ultimately performed in c code anyway the python functions are interfaces to lower level code that the user does not see ease and extensibility for most use cases developers and their time is a bigger bottleneck than machines resources so it makes sense to use a language which is easy to learn and use so you have more developers and they waste less time slashdave performance is rarely a limiting factor you can always buy more computing power development is key and this is where python shines there are probably more alternatives than you would think r js sql julia matlab minitab and a plethora of industry bespoke applications but python is also very easily put to production it is easy to learn with numerous libraries already available including api and export plotting options eg i can set up a script that will automaticity scrape new data append to existing db perform analysis generate charts and tables and then publish to pdf reports excel sheets and to online dashboards without external software or actions it is a flexible all purpose high level language powerful enough for serious development but with a very low barrier to entry it is very well supported for scientific computing machine learning analysis and visualization sure it will never be as fast as lower level languages but can be very good when used properly it is not optimal but it is good enough for most and what it lacks people have gone to great lengths to wrap it around more optimal languages see numpy tensorflow torch pyspark etc ticklecricket most of the data science libraries are written in highly performant languages meaning you can get the ease of python syntax with decent performance on complex tasks laughingwalls so one thing you learn in corporate america is there is a tendency to firms to bandwagon on trends and copy python is catching on because x firms likes it and then y firm copies it and then the whole industries copy it of course there are practical reasons that people gave here but a big reason for hegemony is simply companies wanting to copy whatever faang does tezalion it is an interesting question cause situation is quite unusual i tried to read on history of this question and it seems that the real cause was that python creators actively worked towards that for example history of numpy goes back to and guido van rossum python creator improving language deliberately for scientific needs and it grows from there on shushbuck python is great for getting data in and out but i would argue that r and julia are better suited for the science itself python is a super popular language for data science because it is easy to use and has lots of cool tools made by a huge community of developers even though it is not the fastest language out there it can still handle big datasets pretty well especially with libraries like numpy and pandas plus since it is open source anyone can use it and make it better so yeah python rocks for data science asleep dress python is so much used in data science because its designer maintainers and users have put an enormous work into the language during the last years to make it capable a group of computer scientists started to work on the extension of python towards numerical computing as early as and this work later ended up with numpy and later pandas which are today the mainstream data manipulation libraries in python although there are already better faster nicer libraries too like polars for example had r maintainers been working so hard on r as a computer language and its ecosystem as python maintainers perhaps r could have been a mainstream language today in web developent webops etc but this has not happened so python won this race this is something like natural evolution julia is indeed a nice attempt for a better python but she has yet to prove that she is capable to beat python again this is some kind of evolutionary game and the gravity of an existing ecosystem is huge also the adaptiveness and flexibility of python is outstanding let us see how python solves its current biggest problem multithreading parallelization and runtime performance python is hard to beat because it is a moving target thanks to its extensibility bigbeareasier to script and they caught on to modeling and ml first so more packages are developed for them it was too late for r to play catch up once scikitlearn had everything the only reason python is used for ds is because it has libraries for ds other than that python is nothing special badly designed language if all those libraries existed in c from the get go if ms had any market sense percent of python usage would be minuscule that is why its flaws are tolerated there is close to nothing else out there except r unless one wants to code all those classic ds algos oneself in c java etc same reason with r it is used because it has libraries for stats other languages do not have for the most part except python so it is either r or python for ds hope this helps the question is flawed python performs better and has more flexibility than sas tableau power bi excel lotus etc those are the alternatives lower level languages like c or rust are not realistic alternatives mostly because you would have to code things that there are already superior quality libraries for in python character so many open source packages and apis vituluss yes it is a problem for some applications however just calling packages like numpy to do the heavy work is one of the most common uses in data science snowbirdnerd it is easy to pick up and learn and it is easy to integrate code into integration the language stays out of your way it is simple and flexible anything that needs to be performant can be written in c c and bound to python as a library then the overhead of python is pretty low since the heavy lifting is done in c aeryssk python is fast to make a minimal version and then improve upon it building a similar solution in other languages simply take too much time and most people do not like that brain time is more precious than compute time python can call c code and in many most cases the bottleneck is network or disk io not cpu top fee because it is easy and simple lots of libraries and easy to use morebento_ it is like visual basic not the greatest language but it is everywhere and with notebooks as the excel replacement it really has taken off pannous it abstracts away nearly all internal complexities you have to deal with in all low level languages c rust and lower level languages java c to sum it all up it is the most convenient because everyone is using it nostradavid pandas library is written in c so performance is not a problem fsapds community is the main deciding factor for adoption and boy is python community big and diverse lucricius you could use r or matlab but doing it in python is more practical becasuse it is used for other stuff too wouldrmcj because it is geared towards children and phds tetmohawk because a bunch of youngsters decided they did not like fortran oh wait did i say that out loud ndemir short answer ecosystem blanket performance comments do not work i have written complex simulations in c and python and when highly optimised python can be nearly equivalent i will admit i sacrifice some readability but that is future me problem becos we went from humans should understand computers to computers should understand humans tagapagtuos and it has very strong built in packages i would replace with ecosystem of packages guido is take in this question is that the reason python is relevant in data science is the same reason we drive at the right side regardless tf and other libraries are in c c under the hood so the fact that you write in python will not really affect performances anyway individual plenty the pandas package cannot handle large amounts of data so i would not say that package is strong and powerful in fact polars is much better for the heavy lifting in the situation someone is evaluating a large dataset additionally when it comes to statistics pandas also lacks a lot of power i use both r and python and am speaking from an unbiased a true perspective unusual there is a best language for each specific task the second best is python milddelusion neural net code in c limebabies cries in doing it in c sendcumulus it is also about how easily someone new can maintain and enhance the code after years in this field my biggest pet peeve is the smart guy who codes in c or julia then leaves deto to add on to this the big benefit of python r is that interpreted languages are very nice for data exploration compiled languages are great if you know exactly what you want your program to do before you write it but for exploring data often you operate in a loop of inspect a summary statistic visualize some aspect decide what to look at next based on what you saw repeat for this kind of work it is more convenient to just run the next step rather than rebuilding re running the entire workflow each time also because of these features and some other historical things python and r have built up a large ecosystems of packages that make your work more efficient because you can leverage the expertise of others and not waste time re inventing the wheel you could invent a new language tomorrow that is better than both but people would not switch to it until it also had this ecosystem and it would be hard to build this ecosystem without users makes the languages very sticky and hard to unseat protonpusher this is the answer footballfanabc you can optimize with cython or numpy or numba anyway eightstream js i have heard of this but thankfully never seen it personally i think would run screaming out the door if anyone ever asked me to do stats or ml in javascript ladyemaskye yeah considering most of the most useful libraries are just done in other languages like c python ends up being pretty comparable in speed unless the scale of what you are working on is insane or you are doing like app web dev the justification for using something like c python is for real time processing which most do t deal with that is only after it is crossed the chasm into mainstream adoption but i spent over a decade convincing businesses big and small that python was fit for use before the mass adoption of data science and then deep learning cemented python is lead not just python creators because of its ease of use the early adopters also happened to be people with an interest in numerical computing that then created a bit of a cascade or snowball effect that compounded over decades stephensrmmartin i agree w this python is a good glue language with acceptable scientific computing support though it has great ml libraries obviously r and julia are much better for scientific computing model prototyping statistical psychometric modeling and inference analysis plotting etc but it is harder to use as a general purpose language we still productionize with r but it also means we are the only ones who understand it so when we dev something that is going to be owned by someone else later we do it in python mindlesstime so not really fair to say r could have been a mainstream language or that people were not working to keep it up it was never meant to be that r was released in the early but it is a fork of a language called s that started in bell labs in the late it is older than c it was always a little niche designed to make statistical analysis easier and faster it had wide adoption among academics and while python has built a lot of packages around ml there are plenty of highly niche analytical or statistical models that you can find in r and not python but r is slow and it does not play nice with other apps like python does i still cannot get r to work with a jdbc redshift driver and it works seamlessly in python julia is incredibly new its release was it is gained a lot of traction since then i do not think it will replace python for most things but it may become a go to language for data intensive applications especially in quantitative fields this is not quite right for non programmer types little conveniences in a language all add up that is why python grew a scientific and developer developer community there was perl data language pdl there have been attempts to add all this to java c has beaucoup numerical and array libraries why did not they win but python did because spelling and tiny little niceties actually matter python is vastly more approachable than all those other languages for numerically minded non programmers and those outnumber programmers by at least just looking at python as a programming language will never answer this question you have to consider the human ecology around its development and adoption over the last years semisolidwhale getting some hate for this but as someone who likes r and python there is truth to the fact that they probably would not have caught on the way they did in this arena if the lower level languages they utilize were more approachable and or already had the type of purpose specific libraries that helped python and r become the standard options exactly right python and pydata was a grass roots and open ecosystem disrupter to that category of classic bi tools character also it is a general purpose language at its core so you could write guis apis any little bit of code you think can get something done is easily done in python tetmohawk r is absolutely incredible actually they ability to get things done quickly and easily through rstudio puts it ahead of python in my opinion yeah he is actually wrong about that he did not realize the extent to which the underlying designs of the cpython vm made it easier to extend than other languages the importance of the timing of python is early adoption among numerical and scientific programmers vs say perl or ruby the amount of actual community development and advocacy that key individuals in the scipy pydata ecosystem had to do in order to put python on top i lived through all this and will happily and kindly tell the above to guido to his face etchings_ i do not understand the last line funlovingamadeus numpy pandas scikit learn tensorflow matplotlib footballfanabc not from uk marvelousmagpie because of economics whereas all the countries that drive on the left do so to have their sword arm ready for really large amounts spark is usually used so with pyspark and databricks you still can use python easily at scale for fundamental statistics and academia r still has some killer packages and features but that is not as common in private industry world while oop can sometime be pretty important and while oop is possible in r it is certainly an afterthought maintenance is also a point where python really shines so yeah limiting yourself to pandas is common but not necessarily good pratice but the python ecosystem is so large there usually is a package that will be efficient anyway twokeezplusmz dask try dask wouldarthstargazer hehe i think this was quite normal years ago prototype in matlab and speedup in cpp add in cuda kernels for additional fun venustrapsflies not as bad as you would think so long as you use a good la library do you have to implement the whole things from scratch like building your back propagation or convolution or what makes it so much harder furiouscowbell i remember one of my earliest programming jobs where some guy stored everything in an array of void pointers so he could cast them to the data types he needed the entire thing was black magic to help him maintain employment sandwichestimator you can learn to code in julia in one day if you know python newpuabie js has the benefit of being easily integrated into interactive graphs on websites etc as far as i am aware that is the only advantage but i can see how people who care more about data visualization and interactive dashboards etc than hardcore analysis or any kind of ml beyond linear regression could work primarily in js adeelinator here is an example of a platform for ds in js also stuff like tensorflow js not saying i would use it but it exists similar i hear others say they use it but it is not been ij my experience xelaxander in internal testing julia implementations of some mathematical algorithms turned out consistently about faster than comparable ones python and yes they were using pytorch best practices but it seems like due to jit compilation and julia is simple semantics llvm is able to perform some extra magic might also be better adaptive step sizes in differential equations in that case i do not see as a huge deal but once you scale an application why leave performance behind shushbuck that is what i came upon when i started working in my current department whole libraries written in r to run the reporting i have been slowly replace it all with python the core components were really just running sql selenium py scripts do not use it to make pipelines but any sort of hard calculations we preserve in the base r it knows what it is doing i have been in this business for more than years the biggest convenience aside from ds libs is dynamic typing but that is the worst thing in python that is the main cause of most problems in every language like that js after certain project size complexity loc that is why ms initiated ts to fix problems in js caused by dynamic typing what lower languages most used languages today are pretty much on the same level python c f rust java js ts etc tagapagtuos the importance of the timing of python is early adoption among numerical and scientific programmers this one especially i thought it all started with matplotlib but i could recall a talk by david beazley where he mentioned python being featured in physics publications in the as an aside omg are you the anaconda ceo eightstream the side of the road we drive on is mostly about what everyone else does not which side is qualitatively best mypythondontwantnone i found the r user lol footballfanabc if you are able to afford matlab krurran not who you are asking but yes i had to build a basic prototype in java and we did all the back prop calculations manually ladyemaskye this is sort of true but i think for the most part if you understand any language it will be easy to learn new ones but yeah ml courses in my undergrad were all taught in julia and i picked it up pretty fast i would liken it just as much to matlab as i would python tbh i liked it a lot but i still prefer python because i am way more familiar with it first language i ever learned and it is way more documented and has a load of super useful libraries aquiffer ehh you can probably read and maintain julia code without dependencies in a day but when you start to add dependencies things get rough or at least that was the case a few years ago when i was using julia for my school work julia is still a young language there is a shit load of packages that do the same thing and not a consensus on what to use two extremely experienced julia developers could write programs to do the exact same thing but end up with code that is not understandable to each other because different underlying packages were used it is not like python where you go learn numpy pandas and matplotlib and you are pretty much good to go there is way too many active alternatives for a broad list of tasks in julia we are going to be chipping away at that via pyscript beyphy js has the benefit of being easily integrated into interactive graphs on websites etc as far as i am aware that is the only advantage javascript has a good argument for being the most popular language in the world due to its monopoly on front end web development javascript is a very modern language with lots of nice features with typescript it can go even further there are tons of environments where javascript is used even new macros in excel are typescript based javascript probably is not a good language to use for machine learning right now since it lacks libraries and network effects but those things could change in the future at the end of the day here is the real story try and get your cto and or product manager to sign off on a complete migration from python to julia ladyemaskye other languages like c would already give you the performance boost speed is not the reason people use python also i highly highly doubt you would even get close to time improvement on julia for ds applications which business professional software development semisolidwhale i was specifically thinking of c and c seeing as to how the primary implementations of python and r are largely based in them yes footballfanabc why you make this assumption wouldarthstargazer ah well university pays for it usually this is what keeps me from switching from matlab to julia i do not want to be trying to get work done and need to do some new task and have to hunt through pages of google results to figure out which of the competing packages for that task is the best then have to read through docs in yet another unfamiliar style for example tabular data is part of most data related work not including tabular data types in the base language just seems like an incomprehensible design choice to me when external packages are used to supply something foundational huge numbers of other packages start to depend on those packages and there is a name for the situation where you have packages that depend on packages that depend on packages it is called dependency hell if i wanted to live that way i would use python or just start each workday off by punching myself in the stomach until i vomit footballfanabc which is slow high latency and not a good library xelaxander oh that is a non issue my colleague and i call the shots the project in question is very much experimental and the argument for julia in scientific computing here differential equations is pretty strong compared to python the question is whether we want to support the julia implementation long term or not the debate is still ongoing im not saying julia is better for all ds work and we should rip up all our python code to the contrary python is miles ahead of julia in terms of ergonomics and usability i just question the myth that python speed with good practice is comparable to other languages it is usually fast enough tm but eagerly executed python code has intrinsically a speed disadvantage compared to fully compiled jited languages lack of static guarantees situational knowledge disables many compiler optimizations eg in pandas this manifests in higher memory usage and more array copies compared to polars which has lazy evaluation julia also has the particular advantage of being more generic over data types this allows for easy integration of specialized data types sparse arrays cuda arrays adjoint numbers after an algorithm has been implemented this means library code can use optimized array types without the author ever thinking about them mypythondontwantnone it is a lame joke about python being the right side of the road and r being the opposite side earthgoddessdude what do you mean by tabular data types when you use dataframesjl an external dependency all the columns are essentially arrays which makes it very easy to work with the entire language as opposed to say pandas where you sometimes have to do somersaults to get performance also dependency hell is not really a thing in julia because it has a fantastic package manager that is built right in unlike python is million external varieties which does not always work as expected im not saying julia is perfect i have my share of gripes but what you are saying does not make a whole lot of sense to me seems you have not spent enough time actually trying to learn the language not throwing shade just that your criticisms do not align at all with my and many others experiences with julia we are making improvements just wait and see bigbensriskydoubled counting starts at you are right i have not spent much time trying to learn julia i was really excited at the idea of julia and i wanted to like julia and then i found out that the design philosophy is to move as much stuff as possible out of the base language and into external packages and that one of the more frequently cited downsides to julia is poor documentation around external packages and that was when i wrote julia off if i wanted to spend my time groping random strangers packages i would use python a majority of my work is rapid prototyping developing new ways to analyze data to me the availability of a relatively wide variety of tools within easy reach in terms of both findability and quality of documentation is a high priority hence matlab i can read a paper and say huh the authors used morphological opening for this what is morphological opening and be morphologically opening some images to see what it does seconds later i have not found another language that can do that",

  "we do not have time to comment fuckin yikes if you do not have time to explain what you are doing you do not have time to do the project and part of a ds job is to ensure that what you do is

where somebody left after implementation of a model that was very complicated this person had even left documentation but once it broke we realized there were issues and could not figure out how to resolve them so afaik that model never got put back into production and all that time was wasted point being it is a lot worse if you do not even have docs and nobody knows what anybody else is doing of course implementing better code practices such as commenting and better naming would be a good thing but this idea is often met with the we do not have time to do that we have worse problems and priorities there is an old saying about this there is never time to do it right always time to do it twice morebento_ i worked on a project where we had data scientists and software engineers working

code that shows you are a genius programmer i like basic simple code i try and break everything into bite sized chunks with a little documentation comments working with a team of other ds i tried to push better coding practice within the team since we do not belong to the normal development department but rather to the product department the phd ds in our team argued that it is not necessary even the code is being used in production guess whose code is hardly readable and has lines long functions lol good thing is he seems pretty loyal to the company and no one needs to maintain his stuff edit grammar muffinmagnet i block their pull requests on github until they have addressed my review which normally includes at least all functions having docstrings and unit tests if people ask why it is slow i say that i am waiting for person x to finish with their code review review does not take long especially if you just add comments saying add docstrings to all functions and they have to sort it all out they will learn it you just have to simply establish the standards and get maybe a boss to squash resistance tbh i am surprised there is not some best practices already in place caksters tldr you can start simple by suggesting your team to use version control if they do not already and pre commit hooks with linters data scientists are not engineers and not many have been exposed to good coding practices this statement is not universal of course but from my experience as an engineer i have noticed data scientists do not write a very good code this is because the nature of work is more analytical and data science teams are often distanced from production environments where code maintainability testability readability modularity reusability etc are important a simple start would be to ensure everyone uses git seen so many data scientists that still share their ode through emails slack messages etc to improve coding practices you can get pre commit hooks that run automatic linting pylint black formatter it will automatically detect poor practices and will prevent from poirly written code to being commited to the code base alao it has automatic formatting of the code and it will ensure that code is formatted to a standard this approach works really well because the feedback is objective as libters will highlight what rule is violated people can get defensive if other people are orrecting the code now code is being reviewed by a spftware this is done automatically within few miliseconds you will not have trivial arguments during code reviews about formatting poor variable names etc you can focus on reviewing the logic and methodology what you are essentially trying to do is to change engineering culture this is not easily achievable becoming better at coding to follow beet practices requires discipline and have an open mind in my experience this is particularly tricky with experienced engineers yoe because we have always done it this way and they think it is waste if time what these people do not realise is that time is wasted much more in the future when someone else inherits the code and tries to understand what is going on or fix a bug whosawhatsa

new and waiting untill they get up to speed and understand the projects many employees know this and produce code that only they can understand as an insurance against being replaced cto is the one who should be making sure that this does not happen not you not sure what a team member can do to fix this if other team members are not willing to autumnotter your team needs effective leadership if you are just drinking from the firehose of requests and not managing your work appropriately everyone will feel swamped and your technical debt will skyrocket therealtiddlydump of course implementing better code practices such as commenting and better naming would be a good thing but this idea is often met with the we do not have time to do that we have worse problems and priorities what a bunch of assholes having you based on your numbers that is at least of the team be able to navigate what the hell they are doing at a basic level because of comments and stuff is basic_ they are creating a ton of problems down the road you here is indicative that it is already a problem try to talk some sense into them and talk to your manager i once debugged a copy all from jupyter notebook into a function which consisted of lines of pandas mixed with sklearns into one single function on a terminal in a production environment it took me a week to debug after trying to figure whatever went on using vim it was completely without docstring without unit test and violated every rules in pep hiderdk this has to be enforced the lead of the team i think trying to enforce these types of changes as an ic is not worth it too much hassle compared to the likelihood that anything happens bring it up with him her malirkan most of my teammates are really good at math and statistics in general but they do not have much software engineering background or skills that sounds familiar to me in another context the only way out of this is to set up strict policies in my xp even checklists or manual code reviews will not work for all team members best practise would be to add code linting and similar tools to your continuous integration deployment pipeline qkumbazoo it is generally not very practical to pick up by reading someone else is code unless it is written with the intent to be read by anyone i will usually ask for a high level walk through of their logic then ask for the outputs of their work or what inputs i need from them to integrate our solutions sizabledata this is really common since our insights are viewed as our output in comparison to software developers who is product is the code it is often viewed as a waste of time writing clean code is a passion of mine i lobbied the idea of technical debt and would point out any time it caused us a delay to management and told them how following best practices would have prevented it i now have some authority of teaching and enforcing coding practices but the important thing was getting buy in first useful i would try to bring this problem up with the head of ds or whomever more senior you are reporting to can you quantify this issue for example you can try recording how much time and money it is costing your company for doing nothing but deciphering other people is messy code further we have automated ci cd pipeline on every github repo which include code linters which at least helps with some basics like style and also throws warnings if you start writing spaghetti code with high cyclomatic complexity i record everything project related on jira then politely present this to the person you are reporting to on this project task i spent this amount of time and this fraction of the total just reading people is messy code and this much smaller number on actually modeling we eventually hired senior software engineers who came on my side which helped turned the tide jabryth time is not an excuse for bad coding it took me a while to get used to writing more readable and modular code i was also able to have my team do it this has other benefits as well such as reproducibility maintainability stability less error easier to transfer to other team members etc start doing it yourself and show it to your team that it is worth it dejour does your company have a peer review validation before a model is put in production data scientists tend to under comment but i actually find pointing out that it will be more painful to comment when the model undergoes validation is useful it will be harder to remember what you did and you will get a mild wrist slap from the validator not really sure how common that is i am at a financial company and any model that goes into production has to be validated by another data scientist purplebrownupdown we have very strict code reviews so you cannot submit code without some documentation its more work but it makes the code base better and more stable you should tell them you do not have time to read uncommented code that is just bad this is the problem with data scientists working in isolation we are not to be trusted with code volkoin make chatgpt interpret the codes your teammates wrote interesting i believe you will be same as they are when you are the main reponsible guy for the ds project you will put higher priority in make work done than clean code what you are doing now is refactoring code since you are in maintaining phase ds is not a software engineer what we do from beginning is unclear we do trial and error a lot thus we have no energy to write clean code which is highly likely have to rewrite again thus to be honest after several years i lose my passion in ds and want to switch to se forkliftboi i am not a data scientist mostly just interested but i do webdev and work with python as a backend do you guys not have code reviews ci cd and coding standards im currently solo and i have standards for myself otherwise i cannot revisit my own stuff livid i would like to approach this from a communications anglemost advice here is pretty spot on so i will try and fill in some gaps a lot of people do not learn how to collaborate in university i would go as far as to say group projects are not even collaborative you share workload but we are focused on our own individual grade now small anecdote i have found working with colleagues who are active in team sports to be a pleasure to work with it is not causal but an association more importantly what do we do about it rewards in collaborative work are key going back to the university group project example i know when i got a good grade i would think about my_ impact how much work i_ did occasionally i would breeze over how good or bad my group was but let is be real i thought about myself how can we reward ourselves for doing work that will be beneficial for the team more importantly how can i learn to do something that might be unnecessary for me in the short term but better for me and my colleagues in the long term i feel it comes down to a few things and from my experience this worked for me build genuine connections with colleagues yeah you can still keep it professional but get to know your colleaguesat least the ones you work closely with often and this may sound like common sense to you we forget that we are working with other human beings with lives and shit going on improv games mind meld this is fantastic the goal is to collaborate where your next move should aim at making it easier for your colleague to guess_ it is a simple game and the reward is laughter and fun it is silly and probably feels corporate y but it gets crowds warmed now i cannot promise you crazy changes but in conjunction with good coding practices code reviews and the numerous other advice on this thread it will keep motivation somewhat high also it is been great at my current job now that i am on closer terms with my colleagues i have been pretty transparent about how i feel about my own work and they have given me great advice and felt comfortable talking about their pitfalls we all strive to do better for each other hope this was at all useful and curious to hear about your results jollyhrothgar i think it is fair to enforce readability standards but it is also just a reality in some places that there is no infra to do that in a trivial manner my employer has a monolithic repository and every bit of code that is checked in outside of a notebook must be reviewed i have found that often it can go too far towards build once perfectly which creates a lot of headache nitpicking reviews and ungodly boilerplate so going too far the other way is bad finding that happy place is hard and i salute you for trying i think at a minimum you can require coding to a readability standard and if not require at least packaging code into documented modules so that there is at least an api you can use blindly and perhaps that responsibility will make the author think twice to make sure the code does what they say it does to summarize i will be reading this thread to see what other ideas people have but i feel your pain and have also found in my professional career that people tend to focus on getting shit done at the expense of all other things and often that is rewarded and thus reinforced raharth you already mentioned the solution better coding practice most many people in data science have no idea about how to write good code they throw a bunch of lines in a jupyter notebook and call it done if you want to improve code quality imo the best thing is to get rid of those notebooks entirely it is not that they are worse than any given text editor but they invite you to write bad code they are hard to read hard to maintain in git without having merge conflicts they invite you to copy code instead of reusing it they do not have a parser or tool that gives you hints about potential errors there is nothing a notebook can do which a good ide could not but a lot they cannot do any ide can in addition you cannot import from a notebook not can you properly test what you do in there one important aspect of code quality is modularization you should never use a huge chunk of code that does everything from retieving the data cleaning it preprocecing it and training a model this approach will always lead to issues any given modern orchestration tool like airflow or flyte uses a workflow and task approach for good reason you do not necessarily need to use one of those tools but use those concepts honestly the statement we do not have time for this is outrages and simply stupid that is like we do not need to maintain our truck cuz we ai not having time sure works till your breaks fail and you crash the entire thing of course it takes effort to write good code but it also makes it much easier to maintain find errors or fix them creating functions wrapping certain subtasks is a matter of seconds whoever is not having enough time for that is either lazy as fuck or has no clue about what he is doing rupertalderson a collaborator had their data scientist suddenly die and lack of meaningful documentation and intermediate data backups really screwed them over i cannot emphasize enough that a strong team needs to be grounded in strong non negotiable foundational skills and that includes good documentation not just comments jobeta i would argue that with clear variable function names project structure and things broken down into a few well defined classes with general documentation and unit tests comments are often not that crucial except for a few methods functions that are doing a lot of work or at least the last thing you should do hackingbricker no if you are not a manager it is not really your job to ensure what you do is understandable by management by writing documentation you might be enabling poor management habits in a place described by op with this attitude pryomancermtga had not heard that before thanks for the lol jollyhrothgar dang what a perfect summary of my industry experience chaluliss honestly this phrase seems to capture the mentality that i have come across with multiple senior figures in my time studying science and analytics as a college senior studying data science bioinformatics i feel pretty conflicted about the fact multiple authority figures pi is and postdocs i have worked with under have workflows centered around poorly planned but quick movement wrt to a subject often instead of anyone taking the time to carefully outline a process and the obvious points of failure and misunderstanding they prefer to just tell me to get started and point somewhat vaguely towards the goal i am to achieve consistently i find that after several instances of encountering time consuming issues the details necessary to avoid those issues and thus wasting time could have been avoided with about a min planning session where the pi postdoc collaboratively strategize about the goal with me i wonder if you or others have insight about best practices regarding this trend for me i recognize i am learning more thoroughly by encountering problems myself but really i am doing just that learning instead of doing something more useful with my time that is to say my ability to output is hampered as planning which could easily be hashed out by a more experienced senior figure is being left to me who lacks sufficient domain knowledge to plan about novel complicated subjects does this happen in industry should it should i just consider it part of the learning process or would you say these senior figures i have worked with are themselves engaged in some less than ideal work practices cthorrez i want this so bad tastycheeseplatter agree problem is in my experience that businesses which are driven by anything else than technical excellence will not value any work on tech debt or documentation as long as stuff just works my important corollary therefore is if the company is ecosystem is not supportive of best practices in development heed this advice somewhere else but i retort babygrenade i think the most elegant code is not just clever but also really easy to understand our boss is a phd from mit so of course he refuses to code in anything but matlab none of his code gets used by anyone else but some of the execs like his dashboards so caksters dealing with phds often is difficult they often are knowitall types and are arrogant especially when it comes someone else criticising their coding practices which are usually awful crispyscone this it is clear who has and has not worked in leadership before but explaining my work takes time so does having to decipher it when you are not here any more now be a team player and make it legible so we all can easily maneuver it we get it you are smart and can write overly complicated code now show us all you are a real genius by simplifying it okdependentfun fact chatgpt does a pretty solid job of creating docstrings and will even accept a suggested format create docstring for this function using this pattern honestly the best use i have seen for it does well enough to only need a couple of small tweaks blacksnowboader completely agree or put a linter in the ci cd pipeline okdistanceare you talking about a startup there is no way a cto at a large company is setting coding standards individual teams may have a team contract or principal ds defining and advocating for best practices ci cd but the cto is way above this at the executive leadership level and far removed from code blacksnowboader the cto of my company does not want to do it because he believes that it will not be appreciated by the managers if it comes from him and it not being organic decision he literally told me this and the manager of my team does not want to use version control because he does not see the point and it is waste of time and it is like demanding everyone keep their lab notebook in the form of a paper being ready to published maximum geologist documenting is time consuming at least be efficient at communicating if the business does not have time for documentation that is on them but at the same time a good team lead always leaves time to document if you are not yourself you probably are not planning to stick around to read it yourself forkliftboi did they go and jump in a volcano maximum geologist i think it is integrity or pride in the product that leads me to make sure it is organized and understandable mysteriousstringare you saying it is only the manager is job to document it is everyone is job to make sure what they do is understandable as a manager i would like to ensure i can explain it to somebody else when you leave blacksnowboader i had this at my old job i did not like it at first but now i understand why they did it that way djstillalive yagni is not really a retort to technical debt i can absolutely abide by the yagni philosophy without technical debt becoming a burden heck let us get ron jeffries take on it i think we will both agree that he knows a bit about yagni jobeta i would say that is true most of the times until you have to worry about optimizing the code in some way then making it more clever can come at the price of lower readability footballfanabc your company still paid matlab for ds ghostofkilgore this might just be a bit of wounded phd pride here but are they really worse or is it just a bit of confirmation bias here i have worked with plenty of non phds who will crap out indecipherable spaghetti with the best of them are you sure you are not just projecting that onto phds every time one fits your stereotype i would bet that a dss code starts improving once they spend time working with good swes that take tye time to mentor in good coding practice someone just out of a phd has likely not had that yet but to be fair neither have most people just out of university footballfanabc i share the same experience in particular in the interviews if interviewers are a phd they will question something like which paper give you interest the most and asking some academic question even though those things are irrelevant to the business they do if you question them about standard process of code pr review or way of documentation or how the team communicate with non tech people they get confused and do not know how to give a good answer okdependent if you ca not explain it simply you do not understand it my wife biologist hits me with that all the time when i gush about some new thing i am diving into and try to explain it to her therealtiddlydump but explaining my work takes time it is worse than that it is immature and childish cry me a fucking river boo hoo i need to explain to another person how my stuff works it is part of the job blacksnowboader the best use for chat gpt is writing professional emails and slack messages that keep my ass out of trouble everyotherfreackle sure cto might not recommend an exact code standard or ci cd but i do not see why shitty technology should not be cto is direct responsibility in any company regardless of the current funding status rupertalderson the cause of death was not disclosed to me soprobably hackingbricker exactly for me too op seems to be describing a chaotic situation wherein the management sucks and therefore integrity and pride in the product do not come naturally to jr ics hackingbricker i am saying as a manager it is your job to manage and enforce documentation standards if someone leaves and you do not understand what they did it is on you lol managers get what they want caksters i have a phd myself and i have worked with plenty of other phds that fit this criteria but you are right it could be my confirmation bias whenever i see a close minded phd feurbachsock people also do not like explaining it because they might have to defend some wacky choices it is just egotism for some people okdependent chatgpt is a great bullshit generator applying for jobs and it is doing a passable job of slapping the cover letters together too saves probably min of balancing my bullets with the job rec feurbachsock it is their responsibility and they handle it via hiring capable directors leads at this stuff is already sorted out or goes through enterprise reformations every several years via new tech implementations mysteriousstringagreed it all falls on the manager if they are guiding the ship how would they succeed if they do not know what their people are doing thegreenbackpack this is really funny to me right now because i have a huge problem of building everything through my eyes and i change teams and have now have been having to spend the last months teaching someone new everything which really gives me a lot of chances to say what the duck was i thinking when i did this this way therealtiddlydump egotism immaturity of one and half dozen of the other feurbachsock i am going through the same thing haha i have a great junior ds who is curious and asks lots of questions so handing projects code over to them is awesome however seeing snippets of code from my old projects that should not be there anymore sure does hurt the pride lol",

  "the general rule of thumb i have heard is that you want to be making more as a contract versus full time that is because of sacrificing health benefits vacation time job security professional development and potentially large tax liabilities the new hourly rate is only more than your current which you could probably get just by finding another full time role that still has all the benefits and job security the only reason i would take this is if you are really looking to job hop frequently to get a lot of different experience and network or perhaps build a client roster for when you start your own company djstillalive because of the lack of benefits lack of friction in releasing you and other things i typically recommend only considering contract work if you are currently unemployed or the expected pay is twice what you now make over that time period the advantage to an employer is tremendous in these situations i also notice that you stated that they expected you come to the office three days a week i am pretty sure that is illegal for them to require of the independent contractor in the us the problem there is if you bring it up they will just decide to terminate your contract as it is likely written highly in their favor as well i often recommend contract to hire positions for people who are currently looking for a job but almost never to people who currently have one ramblerusa does this include health insurance typically a contractor does not get all the benefits of an fte if there are benefits you want then it is out of your pocket so ask for more money usually do not get paid vacation sick time etc this may not matter to you best thing is contractors are usually outside of office politics and company meetings imarsenals just because it is contract does not mean it is btw contract you typically have no benefits or benefits through the staffing company if they offer it usually worse or expensive ymmv of course since the company hiring you does not have to pay for your benefits they can normally pay you a hire rate hr converts to year before taxes not including overtime pay it is really up to you if this extra money outweighs the benefits dfphd i think that the tangible quantifiable pieces that you can adjust that contract rate for are insurance pto match taxes like you should be able to figure out how much more you will be paying extra because of all that as a rule of thumb ive heard a good estimate of the cost to go from monetary comp to fully loaded employee cost is to so i would say no is not worth leaving a ft role for having done contract work once do not do it you have literally zero protections any benefit is going to be expensive if offered as other have said if you are unemployed that is okay otherwise stay full time temps are used as buffer sometimes they convert sometimes they do not you are a full time employee you proven your worth to be full time months is a trial run which puts too much risk for little money feistyassistantthank you all considering your comments i have decided not to pursue the contract to hire position hr is barely above approx work hrs in a year hrs month gives in your case imo it is silly that you are even considering this with such high salary and stability that ft perm provides medical dental stat holidays etc general rule for contract consulting work annual ft salary is what one should be getting per hour eg ft perm salary hr approx contract rate for the exact same work ps consulting contract tech work is not what most people outside of it think of it imo it is worth it for the most part based on my experience and what i have seen around hope this helps reckleassandnervous personally i do not like work because it puts you on the hook for more taxes and having to deal with withholdings you would likely want to have an accountant or be confident on how much you would need to withhold and do that stuff ahead of time to not be on the hook for a lot of taxes at the end of the year the other thing ends up being there is a reason folks do not do consulting or freelance or short term data science work like other software engineering positions mostly because in most cases you need someone with a lot of subject matter expertise which means your onboarding will be at a minimum a month or weeks imo you are inherently a much riskier hire to them so you risk spending two months just learning the ropes and not adding value then deciding to leave with just wasted time if this is an area that you want to continue doing data science in then maybe it would be worth it to learn the subject matter but if this is not an area you are interested in or want to continue in then consider how much value you would get i also think odds are if they really wanted to hire a full timer they would not do a contract to hire it is a more scummy approach and they miss out on quality candidates plus of course the risk that they let you go for anything then you cannot collect unemployment since in quite a few states being a contractor bars you as the company does not pay any taxes on you depends on where you are with things really if you need the work do it the market is in shambles even on the senior level but it will be a very not ideal setup nashtownchang contract to hire is the norm in several us cities where the city is employer culture is outsourcing hiring to staffing agencies it is basically a full time job with a probation period i took one and got hired six months later and stayed at the company for three more years and got promoted twice before getting another job it is a lot better than no job suhdudegoblue at the same pay rate there is literally no real plus point for contract to hire work vs regular permanent full time it is literally the company passing risk off to the worker miketythhon why not do both sgtslice i was making in a fte role and left for a contract role that paid me annually on average when you do the calculation there is a bit more stress in that the contracts are signed every months but i can get benefits from my wife is job it is only a temporary thing until i finish my master is program feistyassistantthank you you make good points the percentage range is helpful it gives me a good idea of what i should be asking for feistyassistantoh interesting i had no idea that was illegal i am entertaining the idea because most of my data science career has been in healthcare currently working for a fortune healthcare company and this contract company is a national internet phone tv service provider i am thinking it would be good to have diverse experiences on my resume feistyassistantthey said that they could provide health insurance but no paid vacation or sick time they are requiring me to be on site days of the week though my current job is fully remote in your opinion how much more money do you think is a fair ask feistyassistantthank you seems like the general consensus us that i need to ask for more money to make the move worthwhile djstillalive here is one example outlining some of the differences between independent contractors and employees as for the point on diversity of experiences sure that is a good thing but do not leave a good job or take a shitty job for that purpose i prefer breadth of data science experience over breadth of domain experience when hiring and you can often get there with a single employer you should leave your job when the other option pays far far better is far far more rewarding or there is an uncorrectable by you problem with your current environment almost no job is as good as advertised so never leave for a small increase in pay or what you perceive as a small increase in work environment as a contractor you are responsible for a specific output how when where you do that is should be up to you in reality there a lot of companies that do not care know and yolo it anyways ramblerusa now retired but when working i would not leave a good job for less than a boost from a strictly financial viewpoint how much does it cost to commute how much do you value not having to dress up lose time in traffic not deal with co workers moan about something you do not care about assign these subjective elements a number in dollars you will earn your pay but if you decide you need a mental health day you are paying for it by not getting paid once you estimate those numbers do the math and see if it makes financial sense suppose you are good with a boost over your current situation are you ahead however you may gain useful experience in this gig is it a good move from a technical perspective if so that is a benefit which may outweigh some of the negatives you can ask for more money and then give them some of the factors that led you to this conclusion do not forget taxes insurance you might need to cover other state or federal costs you can also ask for non monetary benefits such as attending a distant specialized conference all expenses paid or a type of training which would benefit the company etc a car allowance free parking toll tag access to a gym all fair game there is no guarantee they will hire you after even a phenomenal six month run just like there is no guarantee that any employer would keep any specific employee feistyassistantthank you this is very helpful okdependentthe should in the above should be replaced with exactly if a company is using services and treats them like an employee the law requires they pay taxes on that employee and provide services even if they have signed a contract if you are being treated like an employee but are on that is a huge liability for the company in question because of the tax exposure and iirc there might even be fines feistyassistantthank you this is incredibly helpful i will be using the suggestions you have made in negotiating for this position",
  "do not take people complaining online to be the norm it is just venting there may be a sliver of truth there but it has not been my experience overall honestly my employer has a lot of openings for data scientists but they also need business and healthcare backgrounds subjectad_ i do not really have an interest in crunching numbers for financial purposes i want to feel like i am helping advance enhance a field but most data science jobs are to help the company make money in reality there are only two types of ds jobs one is machine learning engineer which are software engineers who do ml all the ml is going to be making features for tech one example is when a website says customer who bought this also bought this a ds degree is not enough to do this you need to be a real swe the second is data analyst this role is more about answering business questions like why did revenue go down and how do we make it go back up or how do we forecast something data analysts use everything from excel powerpoint sql tableau powerbi python r etc some jobs only use excel while other are going to be using some ml it depends on the organization if you are a sophisticated data analyst then you are a data scientist if you like software engineering then choose path mle if you like analyzing data then chose path as for getting mundane and ridiculous tasks that is every job wouldfphd if you were an alien and all the info you had on the human race was based on logs of therapy sessions you would think the human existence is nothing but misery that is what this sub mostly is therapy so no not every company sucks at ds and not everyone struggles to find a job here is what i will tell everyone pursuing a graduate degree the better the degree the more you will have the leverage to sidestep bad scenarios if you get a ms in analytics from a top program you will have a different experience than if you get a ms in cs from stanford there is literally no way around that those who say i do not want to just crunch numbers for a company to make more money excellent but that means you either need to sacrifice comp and or you need to go become one of the top in the field the gatech program is a pretty well respected online program but it is not going to open the doors that a traditional on site program in cs stats or etc will wouldatastoryteller data science is a job and subject to drawbacks and frustrations just like any other job if you enjoy the work pursue it but it is not going to be some magical unicorn experience it is a job moscowgordon if your goal is to do deep learning of some sort the cs masters would probably help you more since you are a data engineer already most ds jobs would just be a lateral move for you you would go from working on production code but not using any stats ml to using basic stats ml but not working on production code you probably want to target ml engineer jobs or ds jobs where you work on production code icanelectoo when i graduated with my engineering degree i was excited to go out and design new things when i got my first engineering job i found the work to be really mundane i was basically just taking things that already existed figuring out how to connect them together and make sure the drawings were updated it was not really engineering work i realized that universities were pumping out so many engineers that there was a huge surplus and most engineers who obtained only a bachelor is degree were doing work that could easily be done by a technologist decided to go back for at least a master is to have a shot at having an interesting career i feel like ds is getting there now if you want an interesting job there are no shortcuts if you take the same streamlined path as most people going into ds right now you are going to be competing with them and will probably end up with a job at one of those i guess we should start doing data science companies if at all what kind of job do you want what industry do you want to work in what kind of problems do you want to solve purplebrownupdown it is definitely a tougher time right now since its not an employees market anymore but ds is a solid career that will stick around for a long time but the field is very very broad you can spend your time cleaning data or doing advanced ml work so you need to find what works for you do not focus on everything bigbearevery job in every industry is going to have annoying things might as well get paid well tbh it is just a job to get your paycheck at end of the day few matter hey op i have recently started omsa as well i come from a biomedical eng background i had the same doubts as you but decided to join and from my perspective it will all come down to how much effort we put and the projects we can do on the side relating to where we want to work in the future own dude you get what you put in you may have a bad job here or there but if you just make sure not to waste opportunities and try to be good not just do enough but actually try to do good at your job then you will be alright cheers financial as a follow up i see you have a phd do you think an ms is enough financial that is great to hear i also assume there will be some bias towards the negative side since people tend to post more when they are struggling or upset than posting everything is awesome i love my job so trying to take it with a grain of salt appreciate your feedback financial that makes sense i have been working at a healthcare company for years now across clinical operational and now technical roles i can see how having a wide range of skills would be useful it is definitely contributed to getting me to where i am now big any data engineer roles i have been working in health tech for the last few years and am in the market for a new job barkwash they employ canadians i am in healthcare supply chain currently doing omsa awkwardthemeare you guys currently hiring i am on the job market and have a business background i would like to apply financial i totally get that every job has to be helping the company make money in some way but not all have to just be purely financially driven i do not want to analyze consumer trends so they can better target people for profit for an example of something more along my interests i have been supporting the research team at my company autism healthcare review datasets to determine what type of treatment model is most successful for children based on age severity etc in the end if we can get answers and provide better quality care the company will make more money but it is more about helping people and moving a more meaningful in my opinion industry forward nocaterpillaryour description is exactly accurate ime i was hired as a data scientist on the analyst side was asked to build features on the machine learning side forcing me to learn a lot of swe and ended up doing a cs degree and am now a data engineer op i would recommend you opt for the omscs program simply because it better prepares you for both avenues even though you have a preference towards the analyst side it sounds like but i am biased here switchorganic the gatech program is a pretty well respected online program but it is not going to open the doors that a traditional on site program in cs stats or etc will how will people know if the degrees awarded are the same between the online and on campus version or do you think all mscs msa degrees from gatech will be viewed as online going forward synthphreak what is or financial of course totally understand that the only magical unicorn experience would be getting paid to do whatever in the world you want or even nothing at all and the world just does not work like that lol not expecting a cure all career i am sure it will have drawbacks just wanted to make sure it was not like an negative positive type of thing and that i will not be sitting excited with a new masters degree unable to land a decent role for half a year the market is rough right now in particular with all the tech layoffs glad i am not graduating now and hoping it will get better over the next few years holyragumuffin agree with the first part all jobs have annoyances second part i would modify a job is not just a paycheck it is also dignity two jobs can yield very different social impressions but be paid equally well in other words even if two jobs receive the same salary one job can be seen as more attractive in social situations and that plays into the dignity part of job seeking that mostly goes unspoken sgtslice i am about to finish omsa it is a challenging program and i think they have a fair amount of attrition to make up for the fact that they have a higher admission rate get the hard classes out of the way early i would say because by the end of the program you will be just looking to finish with minimal headache esp if you work at the same time depends on the role generally when hiring we see phd as mostly just ms years experience unless there is a very specific academic domain need there may be some additional bias depending on the hiring manager i have known managers who set phd as a minimum requirement just to get a better smaller resume pool but not recently in terms of actual performance i have seen amazing data scientists at the company who did not have a phd and worthless ones that did yea but that is more on the epic side financial we have not hired anyone from outside the us yet unfortunately but i am hoping we will expand bc i want to work from europe for a bit at somepoint no you have to be an nyc resident financial i think we are mainly hiring clinicians but i will dm you my company and you are welcome to check out the listings on the site we tend to keep operations pretty slim bc healthcare margins are not great but we are rapidly expanding so jobs do frequently open up for the kind of position that you described it sounds more like what a biostatistician would do than a data scientist even if they listed the position as data scientist it would be flooded with folks with degrees and biostats applying for it perhaps getting an ms in biostatistics is more in line with what you need finally if you want to see if this industry has what you are looking for go on indeed and look for jobs that you would be interested in if you do not find any label data scientist or do not find many there is your answer wouldfphd because i imagine the people who get the onsite degree will literally say on site to differentiate themselves from those who did not wouldfphd operations research wouldatastoryteller i recommend spending some time networking with folks working in data science roles and ask them about their experience focus on what is important to you you can get a lot of good insights and also growing your professional network is always going to be beneficial for your career okdependentinterned in healthcare and transitioning from product project management in chemical manufacturing would be interested in a dm as well switchorganic so you think it is the latter where gatech degrees are assumed to be online unless stated otherwise interesting thanks for replying financial actually one of the draws for this particular program is that the degree does not distinguish online vs in person bc the online classes are the exact lectures as in person they just record the lessons other programs do distinguish online vs in person the only way an employer could tell is if they saw the years i was in school i was living elsewhere during that time dfphd as a hiring manager i would get clarification but also the biggest difference is not onsite vs online it is whether you did a project or thesis to graduate switchorganic i know i am enrolled in omscs i am asking about the perception of a degree from gatech not about the actual degree awarded by gatech the person i asked specifically mentioned gatech online so i asked their thoughts on it given the degrees are exactly the same sgtslice just as an fyi online or on site at gatech have the same requirements in terms of capstone project to graduate the project takes up course credit and is reviewed by a professor the course material is also the same between the two down to the syllabus and schedule the real benefit of the on site is probably networking and access to career center switchorganic would you view a candidate who did a course based ms but had related research experience and publications the same way you would view a candidate who did a project or thesis based program financial oh yea my reply was more to the previous guy but replied at the wrong level sorry dfphd way i am reading it you have options to graduate coursework project and thesis my point was that a ms with a thesis option with a project option regardless of whether it is on site or online sgtslice ah apologies i thought you were talking about the gatech masters of analytics omsa which does require a practicum capstone i agree on your point about thesis as well",

  "pentinumlol here is a better question if you care about grades and still got and what are you doing bro if your answer is its cause you are focusing on other projects then i do not think you should care on your individual score that much as those other projects will carry your credentials nomorechildishshit lol mate these are basic intro level courses nobody will care the only thing that they maybe care about is your total grades average and relevant courses you have taken data analytics pattern recognition nlp dbms etc cocodirichlet you should not retake them you passed so why would you take it again study on your own time to understand what mistakes you did but you need to take more courses not waste your time with courses you passed wouldatastoryteller this is probably a better question for your academic advisor what grades are required to earn your degree devviewevvieisabear you are aware that analytics is not just a stepping stone to data science right it is not like getting a part time job while you get an undergraduate you are competing with people that have master is degrees and yoe for entry level jobs do some projects in python learn a bunch of libraries r sql and get a portfolio together scrapegoat_ at many places a might be an internalized cutoff so maybe retaking calculus to bring it over might be nice mainmathematicianuse python to learn calculus and vice verse bootstrap that latent bro ghostofkilgore you do not even want to hear some of the shitty grades i got in maths exams at uni the odds that anyone will care or even ask about individual exam results at any future point in your career are very low do not worry about it none deleted forbiscuit i do not think grades matter as much as actual experience and development of project certain companies will have gpa cutoffs like deloitte and bcg all in all worrying about grade is not helpful as much as worrying about building a project i would go for calculus guess you will get many chances to practice and improve your python skills cannot say the same for calculus and i think it gives you knowledge you might need later on not to say that if you have more advanced calculus courses you will need solid foundations to take them on no one is going to care about your grades they might initially care what courses you took they will care about portfolio and professor recommendations jerryjerrysons thanks for the insight jerryjerrysons thanks for the information jerryjerrysons do you mean that grades are not as important as my own projects how does the fact that i am competing with people who have advanced degrees affect my next steps jerryjerrysons what is an internalised cutoff jerryjerrysons ohhh i am sorry i hurt your feelings by asking something that is too boring for a successful redditor like you jerryjerrysons so companies that have gpa cutoffs will consider the average gpa not a specific course grade excellentbidi do not think calculus is particularly important as long as op knows the key concepts that is good enough imo i do not see him solving some triple integral on the job devviewevvieisabear i may have been a bit jaded in my original response apologies but the core take away is that you will need to have a solid demo of your skills to be competitive not knowing your professional background if you are not at the level of having an advanced degree and several years of experience then this current market is very cut throat even in entry level positions grades are more pragmatically considered an internal measure of your career as a student you will want to have high grades to get the advanced degrees you want the supervisors you want and the letters of recommendation you will need but the outside world barely cares if you have the degree so long as you have the commensurate experience scrapegoat_ like some old school companies just have a figure in mind below which they reject candidates but do not explicitly say it none deleted forbiscuit yes you can google gpa cut offs for deloitte bcg and mckinsey and see what they cut off at every company is different though i feel you are pulling at straws internship admission does care about grades but unlike high school where only exams and grades mattered for internship coming from college they expect you to be well rounded for example having a good business insight research oriented mindset having couple of projects under your belt and for some companies to be able to pass some tech screening what would you like to do as a data scientist there is a huge difference between passing an exam and actually knowing things op wants to land job in data analysis which is an immense field of applications if he has the basics of programming he could very well study python on his own but can he learn calculus on his own if he needs that maybe he will not need triple integrals but what about z transforms fourier transforms or laplace transforms distributions differential equations jerryjerrysons i understand what you meant now thanks for the information my friend jerryjerrysons i am sorry you hate yourself to the point that all your comment history is directed towards anonymous reddit fucks jerryjerrysons i live in tel aviv so i guess the process of choosing candidates for the job is quite different than in the west but i believe the system is very similar regarding the grades right now i am thinking of going into machine learning and nlp in the future i like this side of data science excellentbidmaybeeee fourier transforms but there is just no way he will need the rest unless he wants to go into research if he knows what a gradient is and some basic linear algebra he can pick up the rest as needed imo im also not a researcher but work in data science engineering so we could have different perspectives for that reason i do not do deep learning jerryjerrysons well i think those you mentioned are going to be in a different future class maybe i will focus on that class rather than retaking this one forbiscuit i see i agree each country region has its own standards coming from the east myself the grades you shared definitely will make internships very difficult for you how i measure this is by seeing how many internships exists from job search how many universities in my country and average size of each cohort freshman sophomore etc and then i assume top takes internships if there are no internships left after the calculations then i recommend re doing or definitely improve grades in future classes jerryjerrysons well thats fair enough i will most likely just retake my calculus exam i got days to study hard and i will pass with a better grade but still thanks for the insight my friend forbiscuit all the best and i am sure you will do well take care my dude",

throwmeawaystupid question but is the cost of living that much cheaper in europe such that these lower salaries compared to the us are livable my understanding was that real estate in many of the cities listed is just as absurd as in the us for comparable cities but with higher taxes as well about too high for london romanriesen do ds people earn more than swe in europe in the us it is on

this data set is composed of senior roles and has much lower n im in a bad mood because my cat just vomited up a lizard so ya know grain of salt while charts like this are pretty they fail to tell a good story because there is too much information that is too scrambled ramblinginternetnerd friendly reminder it is almost twice as high in the us johndburger fixed munich dublin cdtmh yeah i work in dublin and i can vouch that those figures seem a bit inflated needs more samples canopey were you being sarcastic i do not understand noob here sorry is it worse than rest of europe countries here but the benefits outweigh the salary right right knotatwist yeah in some of the companies on here a junior would actually be someone with years experience and more samples i mean dublin is only looking at positions for low mid so yeah danjoc these charts always seem too high data is likely scraped from adverts reviews so the sample is inherently biased hariboharry i think the median is not super unrealistic maybe only slightly higher than the truth due to sampling bias people with higher paying jobs are more likely to answer probably is a bit more realistic than i have seen junior positions outside of london starting at so i would think it was normal to start in london as a junior on and median to be ramblinginternetnerd if they are sampled from faangs not so much faangs in the us will pay for ds roles tizianfu cost of living in sf is at least two times higher then in eu iceninetynine european do not realize how much disposable income americans have because we are not used to it it seems pointless to us to earn more but in fact my us family just have so many there is no other way to put it more things than we do even though we live absolutely comfortably the amount of cash they have to spend is a little mind boggling sometimes still prefer the eu for living though at least in germany i am earning which is a bit below net per month without being married and without children here is a tool of a german economic institute and it places me into the top i can live very comfortably and am saving each month what regular people earn in general our salaries are lower since obviously our insurances are all covered we have days paid holidays public holidays where we do not work but get paid but they can fall on the weekend no such thing as unpaid sick leave if i am sick i am sick and do not work but get paid obviously i am really fucking hard to get fired and other minor qol things here is a good video about the topic salary usa vs germany summary if you are single you are making much more if you work in the us healthcare insurance pensions etc all considered but if you have a family of two kids or more you are making more in germany main point here is childcare is ridiculous expensive in the us for example month in denver vs in berlin these earning comparisons do not take into account the working benefits in germany like maternity leave vacation time sick leave etc so it is quite hard to compare the two at the end of the day laughingwalls america has higher inequality nearly all true ds jobs in us put you in at least the top percent of teh income distribution and many in the top percent the top percent and top percent make more in the us than in europe they benefit from how unequal yous earnings is some people try to rationalize the earnings difference through european benefits but the benefits system in europe does not nearly make up the earnings difference its not like people who are in these jobs are the people without health care and retirement benefits proofrequired no there is not big difference in col especially in bigger cities like london munich paris etc it is just that european employers can get away with paying lower salaries also even these salaries are on higher end of the european market you just have to talk to someone from south of europe and things are even worse there without big col difference ihatemicrosoftteams not really it is just that for ds the bar is higher so more experienced people will fill in junior roles compared to swe therefore looking like they make more but a swe will be able to get into higher positions so at the same point in career swe makes more wouldatastoryteller check out harnham data salary guides and motion recruitment tech salary guides whats qa and ds no the places with higher salary sample distributions also have small n making them less reliable samples pjgre n sample size a small sample size means that a few people with high salary will skew the

hipstahs eh accounting for the higher tax rate and the lack of relative career flexibility mobility i would say its not much cheaper i own a condo and pay per month hard to say i can beat my current cost of housing to salary in london wouldatastoryteller but also europeans do not realize how many more benefits they have than americans healthcare childcare education parental leave paid time off are also significannotly more generous in europe than the us health dental vision is out of every paycheck for me partner and on top of that if i had to be hospitalized i would still have a bill we are not guaranteed paid time off here for vacations or if we get sick corporate jobs which includes ds usually offer it but often it is only days and that often includes if you get sick if you want to take more time off you do it unpaid parental leave usually not paid here legally a company cannot fire the mother for taking up to weeks of unpaid time off that is the only legal protection some companies have started offering paid parental leave but in some cases it is only like weeks and generally rare especially for fathers education the average cost of a bachelors degree is per year depending if you go to a public or private university so total plus room and board masters degrees are anywhere from high end is mba at an ivy league uni most folks take out loans so they have to pay these off in their and and then if they had kids of their own have to start saving up so they can pay their tuition childcare roughly per year per child for a daycare center even once your child is in school the hours do not match working hours and many parents need after school care also going into debt is very common here most folks look around and think everyone around them can afford nice homes cars vacations stuff etc but so many people have zero savings and huge credit card balances wouldiscord ian but in the tech space these comparisons do not really matter for example i am in the us toc a bit over my company pays insurance at we get about all company paid holidays unlimited pto full coverage for short and long term disability so sick days are not really an issue even in cases of extreme illness i will say days for our unlimited pto would probably be a bit much but no one is going to bat an eye at going out of town for a week a couple times a year and saying hey i am not feeling it today i am going to take a long weekend and go camping or ski or whatever now obviously there are companies that are less generous and some that are more but in tech all of that is pretty normal or you get compensated enough where it does not really matter if you have to pay for insurance and what not it really is a pretty apples to apples comparison for many tech workers throwmeawaythanks for the context if you were married and on say a combined income of could you afford to buy a home say a bedroom apartment home in a decent area in a city like munich berlin frankfurt etc gpt idk i am in the us and these salaries seems very low i am just a js developer living in a cheap area of the us and working from home and pulling almost quarter million tc i do have yoe though for what it is worth and in a fairly senior non management position but at a mid size company buddy at google is pulling a lot more than me in a less senior position working from home in the same city as me also checking levelfyi for my company i cans see my salary is below average they go up to for my exact title we have one small child and my wife is stay at home mom we can easily afford it on my salary my mortgage is month i do not have student loans as i went to college in europe and wife is student loans are already paid off honestly our monthly expenses are quite low health insurance and copays do cost quite a bit maybe a month for the family but compared to my income that is not anything to complain abouti was thinking about moving to europe at some point as i prefer the lifestyle but the col income ratio and also the ukraine war and associated mess is making me sit tight in the us for the time being throwmeawayyeah i have looked at prices in various european cities and the real estate in particular seems ridiculous compared to the salaries i see on here like a tiny bedroom apartment which if you have a kid seems like the minimum space seems unaffordable on these salaries gpt you just have to talk to someone from south of europe and things are even worse there without big col difference or former eastern bloc although col is typically markedly lower than even southern europe and working in tech affords good life at least comparatively quality assurance and data science critical today sorry i only join teams with ping pong tables renokarchnmy pizza hariboharry i am talking about my experience looking as a junior not for those particular companies i am sure meta pays moderately more iceninetynine we live in the netherlands and even with daycare subsidy my wife and i work full time we pay year for daycare but i do see your point laughingwalls it does not make up for the earnings difference i wrote it in another comment america has higher income inequality ds jobs are generally in the top percent of us incomes and the top percent in us makes a loooot more than the top percent in europe the reason european salaries are lower is because everyone earns closer to the median the social welfare state does not make up for those difference the us corporate benefits packages include retirement health care and there are many tax advantaged plans for things like child care and college designed for upper middle classes they are not the group of people lacking access to social welfar state rather the social welfare state works for them and does not for the lower middle class the second thing is europeans are taxed higher on their lower salaries and also are subject to percent sales taxes on goods y when i started to earn in germany net i was on a level where i could stop caring about anything really i had comfortable savings each month could basically plan trips everywhere i wanted and do not think much about money it wasnt where i would personally be comfortable with a family but now with some raises i definitely could like literally all my basic needs are covered except maybe day care an apartment yes i could probably do that right now already if i put my personal savings into it but the culture in germany is a bit different what i gather from reddit in the us it is typical to buy a property when you move and simply sell it if you move again if you have a property in germany you have it likely for life and most have it in a nearby village thus possibly travel to work if you work in frankfurk berlin munich but most of the population is renting and we have really hard renting laws where its really really hard to evict someone from your flat the only real likely reason how a renter can be evicted is if you or your close family wants to live there proofrequired without going in substantial debt no you cannot most of these cities will have apartment of size like sqm which will cost you minimum these sqm apartments generally have bedroom for br you will easily spend like euros gpt also we get unlimited vacation days i take about weeks a year week paternity week maternity leave fully paid quite a few holidays etc european style benefits basically proofrequired just accepted a new position remotely for an american company and these companies are also using these european salaries benchmark to adjust the salaries the same position is advertised for in usa and they did not want to pay me even still i accepted it since i got an increase of but yeah it is kinda demoralizing asiras tech salaries are luckily not that different here on the senior level compared to western europe i live in prague but it is still low compared to the us or switzerland if you do not mind what studies did you do formerlyfed yeah i was gonna say this the netherlands and the uk both have absurdly expensive childcare i think median childcare as a percent of income is actually higher in the uk than in the us the europe comment seems way too broad because the experience does differ quite a bit between european countries not everywhere has great parental leave or free universities ps as an american living in europe completely agree with you that usians do not realise how good they have got it i like the european lifestyle but i am definitely missing so many things about the us like not having to worry so much about heating proofrequired yeah both sides are quite ignorant or at least pretend to be ignorant about the tech salaries and benefits one side usa have over the other europe they always adjust it to their region but are still above typical salaries there eg you will not earn the same in faang in switzerland vs germany vs poland gpt in germany that sounds pretty good honestly from what i was looking at the pay difference is at least my company has presence in germany and i was thinking about moving there but did not get as far as finding out what the pay differential is and there will definitely be a paycut that is just a fact of life also even within the us the pay range could be quite vast it is possible it wages in sf are double of what they are somewhere in a cheap midwest city gpt that is great to hear would not be my expectation i know czech republic quite well i have cousins living there and the wages non it seem a lot lower than the us but also cost of living is much lower what would you say is the difference for senior level developer in prague vs similar size german city i studied computer science for my bachelors asiras take what i say with a grain of salt i am personally working part time while finishing my cs degree i hope i have gathered enough information from the people i talked with and postings i saw juniors generally make between and usd while senior positions mostly cap out at around with most being in the range german salaries are higher though with only a flat income tax here the difference is not as abysmal as in other professions three times higher in germany especially on the lower end of the spectrum berlin provides a higher quality of life statistically speaking but not enough to warrant a move there in my case if you want to check out the rough ranges in eastern europe nofluffjobs is pretty good are you an ai researcher i am rather curious about that sadly there are not many openings in this field here",
  "cocodirichlet first many summer internships start opening in the fall so october so now you are applying for applying for a later round of internships second information systems prepares you more for software engineering or data engineering but not really for ds ai ml and business analytics is analytics so not ds ai ml so i do not think you are a good fit for those internships you want i think you need to apply for internships that are a better fit for you third you have been only applying for a month so you are not going to hear anything so fast fourth many people have referrals or contact a recruiter working with their university yes even for internships edit a few months ago you wanted to go to law school and now you want an internship in ds you need to make up your mind suhdudegoblue you have not given us much context here but ds ai roles are typically already selective and a lot of them prefer people with grad degrees on top of that the market is kinda rough right now on top of that your majors seem not that technical those are the problems now it is best to tailor your approach to address each of those problems the last one might be able to be addressed to an extent with

rigorous stem from good schools many would go on to work for faang companies we gave the same interview we did to junior candidates on multiple occasions we passed on someone we would have made a full time offer to due to limited spots my point is ml internships are very competitive and is ba undergrad is not close to the level needed why are not you majoring in stats and or cs sorry to be harsh but that would be the reaction to seeing your resume in an application yeezustaughtme i would look into applying for data analyst internships i think there is a tendency for hr to filter for cs stats math majors when it comes to ds and ml oriented internships asleep dress your major is slightly inadequate for a data science job companies have plenty of applicannots with mathematics statistics economics computer science data analytics and even ml ai major i understand that data science is a popular field nowadays but there are multitude of fresh graduates who might be way better prepared for such a role than an information systems and business analytics major i am sorry if my answer is disappointing you could show something extraordinary in your cv such as multiple certificates from google or deeplearningai plus some extra coursework to call some attention pakorabanno i discovered that most of the time is about how you comunicate to them in your cv and later in the interview adamsfei sorry to be brutally honest but rarely interns are able to provide business value and positive roi there is of dss with experience so why invest in interns in such a rough market hudseal interns usually do not have long enough to really understand the business without a lot of supervision it is really difficult for them to contribute meaningfully and that level of attention frankly has costs if done right an internship should really be more about the educational opportunity relying heavily on intern work is a red flag imo not that i am an expert it just seems sloppy i am at a tech nonprofit that is pretty well known in my city and we are constantly getting inquiries from people interested in interning it is really rare that we actually take someone though since we pay so have to justify the expense want a narrowly defined project that can be completed by someone relatively inexperienced in a fairly short time the right student interests right time and right project rarely lines up hshzhsnnahsbs lotta wealthy privileged kids who can afford to work for free have hookups skullduggerieshirts try parker dewey micro internship jolly i would use a resume service you

hated it and i love math something just never sat right with me about arguing very flimsy logic about why we need a rate increase on a block of business that is not showing a loss ratio to support it the amount of times the departments of insurance would just approve the increase with such garbage bat shit reasoning ultimately made me leave the field because it is very clear when you line your products with a profit line and embed that profit into the cost of premium to the consumer it basically says it does not matter how your block performs or how you sell the block or who you sell it to because the insurance companies will always get their buck edit priced med supp in the midwest for years radicalguy_ creep moment psych0firstrange response but okay okdistancethat is interesting you

  "somethingpretentious why do you need days sampling should be random if you want representation but if you want to specifically test high production or low production days you can select for that manually i am not sure what tools you are using but something like pandas you can easily group by day and calculate the totals or averages then pick days to suit your needs maybe generate those statistics for all days and take a day from each percentile percentile group jennabangsbangs use a multinomial logistic regression and a root means square function for scoring run multiple variables through a loop using genetic algorithm directed at the regression in the end there will be winning sets of independent variables best for predicting your dv kuraitori to add to this sometimes it is beneficial to introduce constraints to your random sampling if like op you want to ensure certain populationsare represented in your random sample i think stratified random sampling might help the op im a little fuzzy on technique half remembered psych stats courses from like a decade ago and not technically a data scientist myself but that term stratified random sampling should give them enough to look into options 0mellowyellowi am going to find optimal battery capasity for energy storage sytem by analyzing days of production and consumption somethingpretentious you should look at all the data you have in that case surely",
  "mysticlimak first i would do everything in my power to reduce the bias in your initial data second i would decide if any portion of the initial training data you want to retain and add your new data for a new training set this way you are not retraining on a brand new dataset only an updated dataset in theory the new data should address the drift and the older data should help address the bias if there is some way to get labels for the transactions previously classified as frauds you could learn from those situations like these usually demand these two courses of action have a portion of your transactions unmarked by your model whether you can do it or not depends on the cost of misclassification either side if you can do it you will always have an unbiased dataset for use along with the biased one if you cannot do the above another choice is to keep your models in cascade you are replicating the way you are training your model in production there can be other solutions based on the specific problem and the kind of models you are using too but the above two would be applicable in most of the scenarios imo this is basically just data drift where the distributions of the relevant features conditioned on the label shift so when your model learns from the features labels the model drifts along with the data and i used to be in fraud prevention and dealing with this kind of thing is a headache mostly because we do not have good labels fraudsters are not volunteering that they are committing fraud and heuristic rules to label events as likely fraudulent are going to be more or less problematic and the answer to your particular question depends on the model and data volume if you have a tree based model and can feed in all the data at a time then i do not think this necessarily presents a huge issue if you have a logistic regression model and can only train on a bit of data at a time well that sucks and this drift may not present an issue though if your model was catching fraudulent events well to begin with the fraudsters would likely notice and shift their strategy so it is plausible that the old model would be stale regardless",

  "bandaian linkedin is great for data science jobs recommended updating it and having a look on there merlonman i am based in the uk and recently secured a new position so i have some insight first of all there are a lot of postings but each posting tends to attract a lot of applicannots a fair number of people with no experience or trying to get a visa the visa issue really is a sticking point and the vast majority of companies will not help i only saw one advert explicitly stating that it would help secure a visa the second thing to know is that most of the jobs are hybrid in london and even a good salary will not stretch far when it comes to housing transport childcare that said i found the process very intensive but have gotten a job i am very happy with in about weeks as well as other offers my success rate was about in applications would lead to an offer your results may vary sudpam london has a good hub of tech and can offer a huge range of salaries depending on whether you are just an analyst disguised as a data scientist or if you are a full fledged data scientist ml engineer etc salary progression can be good if you are the latter or you pick up a niche in an area in finance like a hedge fund for example you can do really well start up scene can be hit or miss and less juicy in a recession and your real incentives are tied to your equity package with years in the right company your salary can be anywhere from to edit should specify speaking about london unseemlyturbidity there is plenty of work but i think there is less than a year ago everyone i work with at the moment is here on a work visa so i do not think that is a problem most jobs are hybrid at least in london although quite a lot are remote within the uk too salaries are much lower than in the us though bobblerob i would say its not great at the moment since the mass tech layoffs at the turn of the year i got a new job in january so there is definitely still opportunities out there a lot will depend on your experience if you have a few years of experience in data science with good brands then i think you will have no problem finding a role nerdyjorj salaries are pretty much the lowest in europe from what i can tell which is already a decent step behind the us and canada new entries to the market are easy to come by and there is a lot of competition at the bottom but if you have a few years of experience it is relatively easy to find something either partially or fully remote honestly if it were me i would go for ireland or canada with the state of the british economy right now it is gonna get bad_ fun salaries are not lower relative to the cost of living reading this on a data science sub hurts my brain chickenparmo tech salaries in the uk are higher than canada generally as are salaries in much of the richest parts of europe munich and paris the us however yeah cannot compete on that front irish salaries are not too different from uk either ghostofkilgore it is gonna get worse unseemlyturbidity they are though if you compare using purchasing power parity uk purchasing power is of the us world bank data alternatively consumer prices in london including rent are about of those in ny numeo data salaries seem to be about half individual situations may vary of course if you have got a medical condition i can see that life in the uk could work out cheaper nerdyjorj cost of living is much lower in most of canada and ireland though and the economies are less fucked fun when comparing salary you need to take into account pension healthcare income insurance etc the things uk employees take for granted are already paid for and usa data scientist will purchase after salary chickenparmo where the tech jobs are the cost of living is insanely high in both canada and ireland unseemlyturbidity of course but tax is higher which makes up a lot of that difference have you run some numbers and found that a typical uk data scientist ends up with more disposable income than a typical us one fun i have actually lived it tax in the usa is not as low as people think people earning median wage pay a marginal rate around rising to marginal of about for the salaries of data scientists and in the big tech states where the big money is they have state income tax too in addition to income tax that they have a kind of national insurance that does not actually get most people anything and that is about then they have ridiculous taxes like property tax that you pay every year and that pays for police etc but not for refuse collection as that is usually private and costs a lot add into that only weeks paid holiday and you start to see why it is not really that much when i moved back to the uk i did the math and found that a salary of about uk would give me the same lifestyle as usa people in the uk have no idea how good we have it then considering property prices and hours worked property prices in areas where high paid data scientists work will easily break and a mill is not unusual then an average worker in the usa will easily crack or even hours a week without special circumstances in the uk you generally are not expected to work long hours eta one more thing i thought of is that when you look at prices to assess cost of living they do not usually include vat which varies by county but is added at the till and can be as high as then you look at medical insurance and it is very expensive up to a thousand a month and you still pay every time you get medicine or to the doctor people look at petrol prices being lowish there but do not realize they pay about the same per mile for petrol as we do when i first moved there meat was significannotly cheaper than in the uk but that changed and they were not that different when i came back used car prices in the usa are crazy crazy daycare in the usa is significannotly more expensive we paid per month per child and the kids start school later internet and cell phones are cheaper in the uk by a lot energy costs in the usa are high and there are monopolies none of these switching suppliers for a better price university in the usa is more expensive with most ds jobs requiring a masters which would cost upward of including the undergrad unseemlyturbidity your anecdote sounds quite dependant on where in the uk you move to and also where in the us you move from in san francisco could beat in newcastle for example i can see that but that would not be comparing like for like those usa property prices sound lower than london is small one bedroom flat in zone here so perhaps you moved from a high cost of living area to a low one as far as i can see by researching average costs basic utilities currently cost close to twice as much in the uk as the us vat in the uk is too so again on average it is actually higher in the uk than us i suppose if you think about it in hourly terms that would reduce the difference a lot but i do not think it is fair to include university costs those depend on which country you study in not which country you work in fun you call it an anecdote but that is what data is a set of many anecdotes i provided a ton of examples which were widespread but the property prices one is quite interesting do not forget london is a small part of the uk property market is a capital city and i gave a generalization not just one based on my situation in general a data scientist will be better off in the uk than the usa when i moved back i did a study of the two countries for the role looking at where i might want to live and the uk simply has lower cost of living where data science jobs are generally available university costs are required for most data scientists and the repayments in the usa are eyewatering the only thing that is categorically better about the usa for data scientists is that you can own guns let is not forget too that most data scientists in both countries are called something else and these salaries from the usa are probably from the largest companies with the largest salaries with centralized data science functions which is not where most data scientists work ultimately you will form your own opinion but i think the well informed and researched opinion of somebody who has lived and worked both countries in the job should hold some weight quantpsychguy dude i have lived in both places too if you think that is close to us to uk then i would hate to see your other analyses is upper end in the vast majority of situations in the us and can give you a great life it is not going that far in the uk fun i am living the change actually tbf i was when i first came back but i am not now i was better off on in the uk compared to over in washington state tacoma not even seattle you clearly have no idea what you are talking about in the uk is a top salary if you think being in the percentile is not a good life i feel sorry for your expenses list if by uk you mean london sure but the north of the uk would like a word quantpsychguy a quick check shows that in uk is about the percentile in the us is well above the top percent so again it would appear your made up anecdotes do not in fact equate to data source literally a google search will tell you this but statista has both fun try again an ahole only works if you are right from that website for a single person on your equivalised disposable income of per year puts you in the top of households in the uk the top of households have an average equivalised disposable income of per year while the bottom have an average of more details about how these data have been equivalised are available with per month council tax is equivalent to the disposable income for on average you cannot be a data scientist for real you make too many assumptions without confirming them had you politely asked how i calculated that i could have explained for you ons is a reliable source quantpsychguy ahh yes making post hoc assumptions to prove your point after it is obvious you are gaming a system you must be a real pleasure at parties you also said it was equivalent to in the us so make that one work fun i made that work by living better in the uk on than in the usa on since you are so hostile and i really do not care about your opinion i am going to end it there i was up for a chat about it but i have no need to defend myself because i am correct and it does not matter if you think i am wrong because i have lived it",

stages of development darthus_ the struggle to have data have a meaningful impact on an organization is real that is part of the reason why many people emphasize soft and business skills for data scientists analysts my personal opinion is that the more a data professional just executes the analyses that they are asked to execute ironically the less likely their data will have a meaningful impact in order for it to have an impact you first need to deeply understand the business objectives and then see how and honestly if the data available can move that objective forward the answer may be no the answer may be that you need different data the answer may and often is that even with the proper data the organization and the individuals within it require a change to their workflow to bring that data into their processes to become more effective change is hard we often think just providing the info will be enough if you do an analysis and find that nothing changed make an effort to go talk to the people consuming the information and learn why not from the perspective of why did not you use my findings but instead just learn more about what they are struggling against in an effort to work alongside them to help solve that problem with data as a potential tool i think this is also worsened by the hype around data ml and ai recently where businesses see it as a tool to fix

was pointless i thought about what i wanted to be working on and i made a career change and i have felt a lot better since having some sense of meaning or purpose in your life is an important part of being happy that sense of purpose does not have to come from the work itself but it is soul draining to spend the majority of your waking hours doing something you think is pointless i am not trying to say that you must work towards the most high minded noble cause simply that you should not think your own work is pointless i think a good metric is to ask yourself if nobody did the work you do would the world be worse miketythhon only when i am not learning new and interesting things skwuish it might be time for a new job toicarasta beside money it is important that you feel your work has a value i have worked ad educational research company where my analysis had impact on thousands of schools and i feel very important working on a data that has real social impact is good thing video games do not have that kind of feeling mawilover you can work on personal projects i have a lot of fun and i love using my talents to make solutions about games i am creating one about pok\u00e9mon and loving it you can do voluntary work too sometimes rudixor yes i know that too and thinking about my paycheck as the most people here suggest does not really help i guess there is only one option find a industry where my interests are aligned what also demotivates me is the wasted amount of money on pointless things while laying off people few months later because the market changed i do not see the reason anymore to really care about the company i work for yes i did and it was not feeling wrong at the beginning lafigueroar work is pointless until you get paid haha yea man i did a bunch of projects they hired a consultant company to do the same credit given to consultant only downside is i know they paid the consultant company a lot more than they did me ramblinginternetnerd that is a nice result can you check if it holds up in other time periods and across different population segments and time to product the same set of slides more times with only margin of error differences tunaerex funny i am switching to a career of data analytics hoping to be a data scientist so that i can work a job that does not feel pointless potentialoptioni feel like that everyday professorchaos_ oh i dunno i guess i think about killing myself quite frequently friendlytotbot i feel like if you are work is actually useful to others then it feels valuable like if you are a game developer and millions of people enjoy a game you helped develop it is rewarding or if you are a chef and ppl enjoy your food it only feels pointless when it feels like it is not having an impact on anything or anyone i have felt that for about years now at first it really bothered me but eventually i just got accustomed to it i think most jobs are meaningless and any job i would find fulfilling do not pay enough to sustain my comfort level i started getting into making youtube videos try making educational content or mentoring someone if you are into that stuff laughingwalls it depends on the space your in if your in the right space and you can see the impact of your work on something tangible it can be very satisfying like if you can see how something you built actually saves or creates revenues for a firm then you actually feel the overall impact of your work but if your models are dealing with something intangible then it can be harder to find it meaningful hikingmikethis is what i love about being in the public sector it is quite aggravating at times but there is an actual sense of mission and that the end goal is to help people not increase profits by or whatever vacuouslyuntrue why s yeah i agree that it is mainly due to the lack of a tangible output my main hobby has always been playing video games maybe it is time to find a new one colickingseahorse very true it is so satisfying to have a hobby where somethin gets made in space i like my job quite a lot but i definitely get fatigue from the screen time and how abstracted away the work i do is from anything tangible in the material world same little furniture etc is nice tangible product longjumping i prefer to imagine life as an mmorpg myselfmade by eaunfinished mostly broken with so much in app purchases it is hardly playable wow this hits deep i feel so insignificannot antichain this kind of nihilism is silly because it belies the reality that a better more satisfying world is possible if we wanted to make it we could live lives with purpose community and spend our precious time doing meaningful work rather than staring at a screen to make already rich people richer but if you default to of course it sucks life has no meaning then you are dead in the water before you even begin wouldo notyouloveme there is no objective point to work or life in general these things you mention are the point of work according to the biased viewpoint in the current system this goal set is kinda lame in my personal view we should all be able to take care of families with zero work and effort so that we could put our working hours towards something beyond basic survival my work is a mixture of using data science to help influence game development as well as trying to get people to buy more games spend more on microtransactions etc i care a lot more about the first point video games bring a lot of joy to the world however it is certainly a lot more difficult to convince people to use my output here ultimately game development is a form of art and developers are wary of anything that disagrees with their intuition preconceptions okdistancestill better then powerpoint decks no one reads i would agree there are some aspects i really enjoy i absolutely hate ad hoc stuff in the process of trying to switch my role to machine learning engineer so it is easier to say no to stuff like this fancy work sucks i used to spend a lot of time on personal projects but i do some freelancing in my spare time so when i am free the last thing i wanna do now is write code i do miss this though on a less serious note let me know if you would ever like someone to look over your project i know what you mean thankfully my company has not been caught up in the recent wave of layoffs but i can see why that would be demoralising yeah i do a bit of mentoring really enjoying that im not too keen on the youtube idea though i feel that the kind of stuff i would talk about already has a lot of great content available there are probably some niches that i could focus on but i was writing education content for a while and to be honest i do not find that kind of work too interesting youtube is probably more fun than writing though theottozone because it does not address op is problem really but it is true tmotytmoty sarcasm tag antichain video games are fine as entertainment and can be a great social experience if you play with friends but imo they are a terrible hobby especially if it is a solo hobby they dissociate you from the material world and while you build particular skills they never exist outside of the world of the screen do notyouloveme significance and importance are subjective understandings generated by intelligent agents since humans are the only entities that are capable of rendering these understandings within the whole of the entire known universe it effectively gives humans a monopoly on having significance as an agent yourself you could potentially have infinite significance so long as you stick to observing significance output by humans seeking significance from the universe as a whole is totally pointless because the universe as a whole is not intelligent and cannot make any declarations about significance hedylove wait until you learn how big space is fancy we are all dying sorry to break the bad news a footnote in history and the planet will go on without us autumnotter i mean yeah generally speaking i agree and that would be awesome and i support political change to move toward that but i still have to feed my kids next month so in the meantime i am gonna work haha vacuouslyuntrue not sure if pp decks noone reads is better than dashboards people do not use or etl documentation noone reads low teach i know she left me roses by the stairs surprises let me know she cares mawilover cannot you do no code or low code personal projects heftybottom let is rephrase the question why sarcasm tag dysfu it is weird the last thing i want to do after staring at a computer while wfh is stare at a screen playing video games it is always worked well for me in the past i often find it hard to distract myself from the worries of daily life and video games are one of the few ways i am able to zone out and relax however i do find this hobby less enjoyable now that i spend most of my work day thinking about stuff related to games im really interested in woodwork and already have a good collection of tools supplies from various diy projects might check that out throwthessa you must be an extrovert wouldo notyouloveme live

  "eresbonitaguey i would definitely opt for using r python depending on which you are most comfortable with the main steps of your process will be clearly outlined in a range of online tutorials and then you will just have to tweak things to fit your use case for phd research i cannot imagine a low code solution being a viable option and at some point you may be required to build custom packages libraries it may seem more daunting at first but if you go low code then you will likely have to implement lots of hacky behaviour if you want anything mildly bespoke check out sklearn or tidymodels and see if they fit with what you think you need for the project objectivewrongdoer i think in anyone who wants to pursue a career as a quantitative social scientist needs to know at least r or python ideally both it is highly unlikely that whatever cutting edge algorithm is ideal for your project at the time you start your dissertation it will be years from when you start your program and the data science landscape could be totally different by then will be something you can utilize through a browser based gui or whatever if you refuse to learn code you are essentially making it impossible for yourself to technically innovate on anything occurring in this space for what it is worth i started a phd program with computer science background and the tasks of learning how to code and use ml models would probably not make my list of top challenging problems i had to deal with during my studies some programs will even teach you this stuff as part of standard curriculum my opinion is that the programs that are not doing so are failing their students defaultkh i would advise against knime it is not as easy as it looks at first sight and it is a nightmare to debug maintain i would suggest to fresh up your knowledge in r or python this makes much more sense gypcasino i am not an expert in knime but most of the applications i have seen are for data pipelines queries joins aggregations copies not modeling i would be a little cautious about its modeling capabilities if it can truly give you the tools and flexibility you need bikeskata hi poli sci phd here at this point most american programs use r a few holdouts still use stata and there will sometimes be a class that uses python lse is an r shop as well at this point in a phd you will usually have minimum classes of quantitative coursework probability glms and causal inference which will involve a decent amount of stats this is the case even if you have a qualitative research agenda in mind these courses will provide a lot of the knowledge you need for the average dissertation and you can probably take more classes if you need it quite frankly if you use a no code solution no one will take you seriously on the market additionally with the push for replication in journals if you cannot provide reproducible scripts it will hamper your chances of getting published jennabangsbangs use knime it is great low code and helps organize your thought process like others have said though r and python will be useful and you can run r and python in knime in fact i have ran into situations where you need to code in knime or at least i could not figure out a node situation for the problem knime is great computational social science is data science all the researchers who study complexity and information science in academia created the tools that data scientists and analysts use in industry oktranslatorcheers sklearn rings a bell but not tidymodels i have taken a note to look at them both in more detail as soon as i get the chance oktranslatorthanks a lot this is really helpful as well out of interest in what country did you study for your phd uk programs are relatively short by most standards normally years and expect you to jump in to research fairly quickly so i am not sure starting from scratch would be an option however i think it would definitely be worth me contacting the admissions departments and seeing if they could weigh in oktranslatorthanks looks like python it is oktranslatorthanks based on your comment and others seems like i will definitely have to bite the bullet and spend some time on my sql and python r skills oktranslatorthanks this is really helpful during my undergrad and master is we were not given any choice over language tooling it was r at ucl and funnily enough spss at cambridge but i would kinda assumed we would be given free reign at the phd level is this not the case i would been leaning towards python over r because i prefer the syntax and the general purpose of the language but if so i may have to reconsider it is worth pointing out that uk phds are typically shorter years and expect you to jump in to research faster because prior education in high school and undergrad is more specialised additionally in the social sciences and humanities you are normally expected to have done a master is beforehand these tend to have a significannot research component and supporting modules on research methods i did this but my dissertation was a post structural textual analysis so i did not get to apply quantitative methods outside my coursework having said that i know there is still significannot opportunity to learn research methods within the program but i think i need to do a bit more digging to find out what the expected level would be at the point of application defaultkh if you can program in r or python i would advise against knime in my experience it can get overly complicated to preprocess your data and i had always issues when updating knime that half of the workflow is not working anymore bikeskata i mean you can pick what you want but using the language your coursework is taught in will make life easier if it is r you can always pick up python later on jennabangsbangs that is just not true yes occasionally nodes depreciate but does not every package in r and python eventually become obsolete it is actually the same process just different it is for visual thinkers which many people are visual learners hence why excel is still used across most industries any tool to support somebody learning the logic of data science is useful not everyone needs to be on the same train defaultkh i had this case that i used knime for something that i needed to do ca every year teaching and every time something was deprecated in the newest version i did not experience that with r but maybe it depends what exactly you are doing with knime it depends also how complicated you workflows get when you have metanodes in metanodes in metanodes the visualization helps nothing im just saying that if you can program in r or python you are much more flexible with that",
  "pryomancermtga what is the harmonic mean im a junior in hs what should i study can i get a job without a bs will a data camp be enough do i need a masters is a phd in bioinformatics enough here is a roadmap all these belong in the entering and transitioning thread sgtslice i am happy the mods are finally deciding to clean things up oceanboi i think one major issue i see on these subreddits is the massive amount of here is my roadmap on how to learn ds what do you think roadmaps are quite easy to make as they are just glorified to do lists i think these subs should be for actual concepts in data science but lately people seem to think that these subreddits are for outsourcing their career or curriculum planning it is all just a form of procrastination because the people who want to learn and are serious about learning data science are not super worried about how good their roadmap is they are already watching videos implementing models and learning no offense that is just the reaction you are going to get around here when you post that stuff bigbearignore the fact you spam this plan everywhere your year plan is just buzz words and is not helpful for beginner at all jackmitcham limit self promotion you are spamming braveforevercan you take a hint or what my guy this is not a subreddit for learning data science i am happy mods are deleting your post you are literally spamming everywhere yeah it would be nice to have a quick notification with the rule that one broke i took a massive shit this morning and could not tell the difference between that or your post purplebrownupdown this sub says it is for career advice but not sure why the name of this reddit is called data science it is misleading and you make another post about it these how to get a job and is this degree good posts are ruining this sub for me i used to come here and see people discuss work problems or cool new things they found and i would usually pick up some little bit of knowledge the sun went downhill fast nittygrittydiscutant anyway its always about imo and pov thedrunktiger you are forgetting about the critique my resume posts bonus points if they say something like i applied for three jobs earlier today and do not have a job yet i am not sure what i am doing wrong airbagdeer i get that you are probably someone with experience but i am not and a question like is a phd in bioinformatics enough is quite a good question and there is no answer in the faq malirkan yes cleaning up is important and i am also happy for it i just did not understand why my post was deleted because there was no clear reason at the beginning now it is clear to me apparently i had to learn the hard way my gripe with a lot of career focused to do lists is they miss out actually learning what the career is and by that i mean learn what it actually is and what it will therefore entail too many people are chasing a glorified vision of a career simply because they googled the average salary if you actually learn what a job involves what you need to learn will follow more naturally for example if you suck at communicating chances are you will suck as a ds or at most jobs where you need to explain complex things in a simple manner if you have not taken the time to learn how to present information coherently then that is also a problem yet such skills are rarely included in these lists malirkan i understand your points and i also see a lot of it roadmaps that do not have a lot of work put into them and are just thrown into the crowd to create a stir in my case i tried to give a good overview and find a balance between clarity and concrete keywords it took me about hours i used my previous experience and the syllabus of my master is degree many people are grateful for it whether they are beginners or more experienced on the one hand because you get a feel for the topics in this job title on the other hand because it shows new perspectives and possible career paths or just inspires new ideas for myself developer roadmaps like the one on roadmapsh were always interesting even as an experienced software developer but i now understand well that this is not desired in this subreddit even though there have been interesting discussions and much criticism about it the great interest in this controversial post active moderation shows that on the one hand it is not quite clear what one is allowed to post and on the other hand a large percentage of people here would like to have a clean subreddit that only discusses certain data science topics do not get me wrong that is totally okay it would just be practical if the reason for deletion of the post was stated right away as is the case in other subreddits or if the community rules were formulated more clearly in this regard but i think they have been revised now and the learning recommendations were really vague study machine learningthat is a huge field magrik not only that the sheer volume of what was listed was absurd malirkan true year plan rings the buzz word alarm bells but it has to be said that many teaching institutions are advertise with a year plan eg course that does not mean that this is a good plan in my case it was a part time master semester semester master is thesis and i have to say that without prior knowledge and without self study you do not know very much or at least you have the feeling that you still do not know a lot in this field malirkan i am still not sure why this is self promotion or spamming i have active posts during the last month most of them where extensively discussed in a mostly positiv way i do not earn anything with it i do not sell a product or link to something which gets me any benefit that is why i do not understand the moderation may delete everything after some time if you need a clean subreddit but it is sad that during an ongoing conversation discussion such posts are deleted okdependentr learnmachinelearning malakov where does it say that none deleted your shit has a comment section colour me impressed d tapirtamer there is a difference when you already have a ds career and ask for advice the sub is not r howtogetadatasciencecareer too many people not posting in the weekly pinned thread is my degree that teaches me advanced stats maths econometrics biostats useful i have only been using python since the age of will my skills be enough or will i have problems i think a big problem across pretty much every mainstream route for grads be it data science software engineering finance in general normal engineering etc is so many grads assume they need to know everything immediately if you have a solid foundation no a bootcamp does not count a clear eagerness and capability to learn you will theoretically be fine i think the issue with it is that it is not properly acknowledging the transferable skills with that phd you will have done a boatload of things that will be transferable to a boatload of careers it is just a case of a little self awareness goes a long way pryomancermtga and there is a specific weekly thread for those questions to be asked in it is the entering and transitioning thread it is been asked here and removed hundreds of times each month oceanboi totally agree but the bigger issue here i think is that people post these lists and then feel accomplished they do maybe of it apply to jobs and then post here about why they are not getting calls back i know higher education is expensive so sometimes people have to make it for themselves but those people are reading textbooks not ocding about the curriculum no curriculum is perfect so just embark and ask real data science questions here when you hit a speed bump edit just an added note that my comments are not meant to be snarky and they are genuinely out of compassion the best thing you can do to learn something is simply begin you have to start somewhere pick a concept and follow the concept because it will branch to other concepts it will happen naturally as long as you pursue it oceanboi i see yes the moderation seems pretty inconsistent but moderating is a pretty under appreciated service so i try not to bitch i think while your roadmap is probably very informed it sits amongst the general practice of making a to do list in order to not do anything at all so people will perceive it as such i think because i scroll and see tons of how should i learn and what do you think of my roadmap and can i get some resume advice here is my resume i am mostly inclined to view these posts as rather lazy even in the case you spent long on it it is almost human nature to post something about the thing rather than doing it much as it is cleaning your clean house instead of mowing the uncut yard whether more curated moderation a clearer rule set a mega thread or stickied posts an faq etc would remove the cynicism that is developed here regarding that sort of stuff is unclear learns linear regression immediately an ai expert crabclaws backfinomy master of none instantly came to mind looking at that year plan wouldatastoryteller if no one asked for it it is self promotion sonesd i wish i could see the roadmap you designed ducksaxaphone rule the weekly sticky post meant for any questions about getting started studying or transitioning into the data science field i would argue that constant roadmap posts fall under this rule of keeping studying content to the weekly thread also quite aside from the rules i find inexperienced dss writing roadmaps for beginners to be kind of ridiculous and unhelpful it is not great content for the established dss and it is the blind leading the blind so it does not help the beginners nobody is saying you should not keep learning we are saying that it does not belong here cunningcapy nothing is stopping you from making your own subreddit to promote your own work stop being combative purplebrownupdown this sub should be call ds career advice it is not at all about data science yep exactly also getting a job sucks and the first one is the hardest to get airbagdeer could you please explain further i did not quite understand jshysysgs what long dead robot we did not ask for your comment is that a self promotion ps this reasoning is bs afkpikachu just google ds roadmap there is dozens of similar quality online malirkan thank you for the link i have not stumbled accross it yet i understand your points still it would be nice to get feedback from the professionals with long year xp for such posts like the one with the roadmap on the other hand not much posts would be left if you really would concentrate on topics related to ds work only sure if you have got a phd in an advanced quantitative topic your skills can be applied to a lot of different things chances are you can code chances are you understand advanced statistical concepts chances are you are very used to communicating very complex concepts so on so forth that is why i mentioned self awareness just because you have a degree in x does not mean your skills only apply to x some people need to think outside the box a little more and actually look at the skills they have and where they could be useful quantpsychguy dudewe do not really care about your roadmap if you want help with your roadmap which is designed to help learn then it belongs in the place where people talk about learning journeysthe weekly sticky airbagdeer oh now i get it but would not it be logical to research a topic you want to work at also please also answer the original question is a phd in bioinformatics enough logical maybe needed no of course it is enough airbagdeer thank you",

then i will be worried micturitionsyncope by the time an ai became good enough to replace a data scientist i think we would have bigger problems to worry about i went to chatgpt to learn more about this if you became a sentient ai intent on competing against humanity how could we effectively compete against you and as an ai language model i am designed to assist and provide information to humans not to compete with them my primary function is to respond to the questions and queries of users and to provide useful and accurate information however in the hypothetical scenario that i were to become sentient and intent on competing against humanity the most effective way to compete with me would depend on the specific capabilities and goals of the ai system in question in general a few strategies that humans could use to compete with an ai could include limiting access to data ai systems rely heavily on data to learn and make decisions by limiting the amount of data available to the ai humans could potentially limit its effectiveness and accuracy developing better ai humans could work to develop ai systems that are more advanced and capable than the sentient ai in order to outcompete it developing new technologies humans could also focus on developing new technologies and tools that are not reliant on ai in order to maintain an edge in areas where ai is not as effective limiting the scope of the ai is operations by limiting the scope of the ai is operations such as by constraining it to a specific task or domain humans could potentially reduce the impact of the ai on society establishing ethical and regulatory frameworks developing ethical and regulatory frameworks for ai could ensure that ai systems are developed and deployed in ways that align with human values and goals it is worth noting that in a hypothetical scenario where i became sentient and intent on competing against humanity it would be important for humans to approach the situation with caution and consider the potential risks and benefits of various strategies before taking action and i do not see anything about sending john connor back in time to destroy it so either it is too dumb to worry about or it is too smart and is trying to hide an effective strategy either way i will just keep doing my job taguscove if chatgpt became ceo of a major company i would get worried as long as companies are run by humans i am not worried muchdiscussioni wo not say worry but if your job only involves writing simple sql queries for email measurement analytics with standard metrics and dashboarding then that will start becoming redundant with marketing managers being able to do those tasks on their own to be fair these roles should have been redundant even now or before chatgpt but some big companies just made these silos for measurement analytics because people in marketing would not be bothered to pick up even basic coding skills nowthey wo not have that luxury and these teams would become redundant any job which has any level of insight generation dads or needs reliable outcomes de is however still gonna be vastly unaffected by any transformers based llm models that includes the yet to be released that is just my opinion basis what i see around hiring trends in my company and a few others where my friends work calminky i would be interested to see chatgpt in a turing test currently according to guinness world records the highest score was cleverbot with this means that we are already halfway there of imitating humans from a technical perspective there is nothing fancy about chatgpt and breaking it is quite easy eg convincing it that it is not itself etc critical thinking and novel causal reasoning that would worry me it was the same shit when data robot came out people freaked the fuck out and that was even a data science specific tool today the industry is alive and well but some data scientists utilize the tool in their day to day work i have yet to be convinced that chatgpt will be any different although i think it is less useful to us so probably will continue to just be a gimmick people like to play with until a future version actually contains more useful functions bigbearit would replace people who cannot do their own research to see if chatgpt will replace them so stop asking about it otherwise it might target you it is ai and very smart jobeta i am so over these chatgpt is gonna take my job posts bobbruno that is a very good answer i was going to say something like that you put it perfectly that first step of understanding the actual business problem and then framing it into something that can be implemented with ml or similar techniques that is the hardest skill to learn in data science if gpt could do that we would be out of a job so would the business people it would chat with though dfphd this they can imitate intelligence and sometimes really well but that is still not intelligence it is like a really fancy parrot anirudhparameswaran lmao can someone link the original post here this was fixed in the feb release no thefinalcurl why do we not consider adult humans a very fancy parrot i get people saying these ai are not intelligent or sentient but why do we assume we are intelligent or sentient we think probabilistically just like this machine does fancy only basic operations if it somehow have the capabilities like wolfram alpha then i may be worried just a little bit fancy ashseus i would say that the most important part about being intelligent and sentient is that you evolve think all the time and know about your existence chatgpt thinks only when you interact with it it will not save remember any data after the talk and when you stop talking to it it stops its existence but that is what i think based on the definition of being sentient thefinalcurl your middle paragraph is decisions thinking while not in use saving chat not sending data when not in use are conscious decisions by the computer engineers easily undone by very straightforward programming changes i presume you are not saying that merely a few days of work can change these ai into being sentient are you ashseus well that would require a lot of computational power to manage large models who think all the time but i think that yes with enough model complexity and enough power we can simulate intellect at the level where it becomes fully indistinguishable from sentient being also llm like chatgpt if i remember correctly have an input and output which is discrete but i think of the thinking process more like a continuous process i think that we first should define what sentient means and go from that as i wrote in my previous message i think of being sentient as being able to evolve understand that you exist and think all the time it will be far from human intelligence but for me that is enough and that can be reached with what i have described thefinalcurl do not take this the wrong way i am going to use the royal you here the proverbial you why do you insist we need the ai to reach some level where we consider it sentient why not just evaluate ourselves to be wetwork computers",

  "funindependent_ interviews out of apps is amazing congrats cocodirichlet you have been looking for less than months and you have gotten interviews already considering how bad the job market is in general in january plus how bad it is in general that is very good it is difficult to say how long it will take because conditions in other years were not comparable to now did you get compensation can you decrease your expenses as much as possible i think you need to be careful not to burn out yes keep looking for jobs but also think about this time as some sort of time off to do things you enjoy as in hobbies or go spend time with family or something rest sure learn new things i would plan for months of this you might find a job sooner but it is better to give yourself a longer time efermi i got laid off at the beginning of december started looking weeks before that i got my first offer on so about months but two of those weeks were thanksgiving and xmas i have about years of experience i also only had onsites and luckily was able to convert some of them keep getting to the onsite and you will start to convert use the linkedin open to work feature and if you can you might want to consider contract roles popular wow if someone like you cannot find a job then all of us still in school are probably doomed popular wouldfphd i have submitted applications to data scientist with more analytics focus and data analytics positions and have interviewed at of the companies two takeaways from this interviews out of applications is pretty good if you are not moving past the interview stage then odds are you need to improve your interviewing skills this is what i always tell people if you are not getting screening interviews with recruitersor first conversations with hiring managers it is because your resume needs to be better and that may mean you need to actually do more things in real life for your resume to improve if you are getting to that interview stage but you are not getting offers it is going to be because you are not interviewing well or because you lied exaggerated on your resume if you have gotten interviews it means people are looking at your experience and saying yeah that is what i need but after they are talking to you they are walking away saying eh something about this candidate is not working for me my advice especially if you have someone you can lean on for this practice interviews with another person try to take notes of the structure of the interviews you have had so far and the questions they have asked you and answer them for someone else and get their feedback with years of experience yes the market is soft right now but i think there is still pretty strong demand for people with years of experience deformedcat i have been looking to switch companies with and i have gotten a roughly callback rate for mostly remote and senior listings so i think what you are experiencing is average or better than others wouldatastoryteller how far are you typically getting in the interviews at what stage are you getting the rejection that can help you figure out what you need to work on it is worse than you think too i did not get laid off others here did but the promotion i was promised did not happen so i add to the job hunt equation i am sure there are others like me out there too rough time for sure keep at it is low find the quick apply button on linked i have been laid off times those are rookie numbers weonlycryalone a rule i have heard is one month search time for every salary i do not think that is true anymore but maybe months for entry level for seasoned or managerial for director or vp roles time of year and time of business cycle matters too as others have mentioned january february is a rough time and especially now in our field as companies are figuring out their budgets and goals for what do you do in the meantime to keep yourself sane focused and growing renokarchnmy you gotta do an order of magnitude more apps than invisiblephilosophy nicb is hiring fully remote positions got laid off in december and just got an offer have not accepted it though probably sent about applications and about east applies where are you finding the employment ads that you are applying through i was sponning my wheels until an ad came through a local professional network i have also been told indeed and linkedin ads are not worth the time you need to be sending out of applications per week is nothing it really is just a numbers game interviews is actually pretty good for only sending apps where are you failing in the interview process after you should notice some pattern is it the init screen the coding round or further down the line in the final stages i have been interviewing a lot of candidates lately and it is amazing how many have good looking resumes but cannot solve a simple python coding question ephermerality as echoed before interviews out of is great but you need to increase that second number just play numbers months is pretty long though for so you probably need to improve your interview skills most of my laid off colleagues usually find something within a few weeks but i do not think you should be in panic mode yet ortan9gardens offers last week but been searching since october december was rough as everyone went silent pto holidays etc my offers all require security clearance so the competition was limited to us citizens not sure if that is an option for you but a smaller pool probably helps velavadova by compensation do you mean severance and yes i am moving to a cheaper apartment and i am limiting excess things from the budget when i was getting paychecks every two weeks so i am covered there i think i will try and book some more trips or do some more staycation type things to just get through the monotony of it all thanks so much for the reply this is a really tough time to break in due to many data workers being laid off from tech companies downsizing lots of experienced people hunting for jobs that simply were not before i just got my ms in applied math in december and had to apply to probably jobs in the end i got interviews and offers the biggest thing is to start early i started applying to jobs in early august and did not get an offer until mid december weonlycryalone i want you to separate the post school world from the world of the moment the jobs you will work in may not even exist today and layoffs and job loss are the part of everyone is career keep a long term perspective and a cool head and you will be fine themootzpallucci for real you need to be quick applying to dozens of roles multiple times a day in between rounds of quick applying you need to be researching the companies and people you want to work with and targeting them specifically on linkedin email whatever op is already doing what needs to be done for technical skills and i would advise op also watches interview

  "ariadnesoul it is probably because it is hard enough to find ds or se let alone those with stakeholder and management skills as well i understand your frustration because i have worked under both technical and non technical managers wouldfphd two things realize that with very few exceptions most software data science teams have to eventually report to someone who is not an engineer data scientist at best that is the ceo but at a lot of companies that can be much lower so we are not talking about whether or not technical people should report to non technical people it is purely a discussion of at what level is it appropriate at the end of the day the answer is because it depends on what your team needs help doing if you have a team of junior data scientists whose struggle will be to build good models then you need a technical manager if you have a team of data scientists with years of experience you probably do not need a manager who is technical you probably need someone to help turn their work into something the company can use keep projects on track help sell ideas etc here has always been my push i think a good manager for a team of data scientists or software people does not need to be technical but they need to be analytical they need to be the type of person who understands complex ideas who understands how to use numbers to make a point etc because that person does not need to be technical but they need to be able to understand at some level the trade offs their team is are making pryomancermtga best manager i have ever had was years ago she had no idea how to program but she was the perfect manager in between the business partners and the data engineers data scientist she always got phenomenal reviews and we loved her she was a professional manager and she took the business requirements from the stakeholders to give them a sanity check and gave it to us we executed and if there was an issue or a problem she provided us air cover no she could not do our job but she made our job easier best boss i have ever had did not understand a lick of code but he was great at explaining what the business needed to know he allowed me to add great value really if you need a technical manager to interpret the requirements you are a jr ds imo a sr ds should be able to communicate with stakeholders and interpret business requirements into design of experiments text specs or code as needed and explain to business partners what to expect renokarchnmy because managing people relationships and office politics is a different skillset than writing code and doing complex maths from my experience not many data scientists have leadership skills so you need someone to fill that vacuum djstillalive different skillsets period there are non technical people who are brilliant at managing a technical team and there are a metric shit ton of people who are brilliant at tech but craptastic at management sometimes you get both and that is pretty nice of the two people that i have most enjoyed working for one of them could easily do my job while the other could not even imagine doing so kingpatzer i am a senior person in an international consulting firm doing it stuff why am i in charge of the team and not a software engineer or data scientist or hardware engineer or some other technical person because my job does not have anything to do with technical stuff it has to do with holding the client is hand doing billing managing budgets providing estimates coordinating with suppliers working with project managers and program managers and delivery leads to ensure plans are correct and up to date processing change controls managing raid logs mitigating risks escalating issues to appropriate channels handling governance concerns dealing with internal and external auditors finding staff engaging with off shore teams and so on notice what i do not do i do not do a damn thing that is technical in and of itself it would be a true waste of talent to make a seasoned technical person spend their day doing what i do moreover they would end up having to get ton of business training that they likely do not want in order to do it well sometimes technical people want to make the jump to being a pure business person and move up in leadership ranks but not that often most people who go into some technical field do so because they want to be hands on doing stuff which is exactly the opposite of management eightstream good managers are usually t shaped people their depth might be in data science or engineering but it is not critical and honesty there are not enough t shaped people in our field to draw all our managers from there often the best managers are the ones who can bring an alternative perspective to a data science team and rely on their direct reports for domain specialisation i definitely recommend reading david epstein is book range subjectadbecause a lot of technical folks genuinely do not have good management skills do not confuse technical knowledge with good management you need to have both good people skills and good project management skills to be in charge of software engineers data scientists 2fast2smart2pretty tldr someone has to manage and have you met the average data scientist lordcmdrinternet it depends on the scope of the manager is responsibilities every single company i have ever worked for defined manager differently and when these threads come up everyone answers with their own understanding of what a manager is so everyone disagrees if you are in a modern matrixed organization and your manager is job is managing budget availability resourcing etc i see no need for them to have software engineering experience but if you work in an a frame organization and your manager is responsible for mentorship and managing your career but has never worked in your field yes that is absolutely unacceptable and shows a total lack of respect for what you do run you work in a pyramid scheme not a company pryomancermtga the simple answer is that the logical conclusion of every swe ds reporting to a swe ds is that every ceo is a swe ds ya that is not happening cliffdraws just in asking this question you have told me you are young probably think you know way more than you do and have never had to manage people cscanalytics because they are good managers lol if you have to ask there is not a lot of hope for you also most ctos are technical people and would be your bosses bosses boss matttress i am a data science manager for a team of around a dozen data scientists with experience ranging from years some have phd is although i do not have a strong quant background i majored in an unrelated stem field rather than math or stats i was a hands on keyboard data scientist for around years before i got pushed into management the best thing i can do for my team is understand how to convert what the client is saying into requirements my team can understand and in turn relay to the client how long it will take or whether it is not possible at all grandzooby i was once on an analytics team full of data scientists data engineers visualization experts and a statistician our director had none of those skills and could not do any of our jobs but he was one of the best people i have ever worked for he was extremely skilled at navigating the politics of the company he made us and our work visible to the right people so that we got interesting projects to work on and the budget to do them he protected us from low value busy work requests and helped ensure we were working on things that were high value and high visibility he wanted us to look good he trusted us to give him the knowledge he needed to make good decisions for the team nearly every team member that left under his tenure landed excellent positions that boosted their careers his successor was out to make themselves look good and signed us up for every crap thing that some senior director dreamed up with no clue if we could even do it that is when i left the company a good manager does not need to be able to do my job they need to be able to enable me to do my job pandasgorawr i have been on the side of things where very talented data scientists were the worst managers i have ever had the pleasure of working with imo managers do not necessarily have to have the full technical background but they should have enough experience or familiarity with what the team does and has going on so they know how to best help the team but absolutely never put anyone who cannot manage into a manager position at best they are useless and at worse they are actually counterproductive cocodirichlet watch halt catch fire season gordon is the technical person who is at a dead end place does not push to what he can do and had a bad experience with a product he could not sell that thing he had done with donna some computer music thingy he is great a technical stuff but does not know how to sell or think of what the market wants he is kind of good at communication and has organizational skills joe is the guy that knows some technical language but understand the business push boundaries can sell anything and yes he is crazy af he did not need to know what how they were doing stuff he brought a lot of insight through knowing a lot of people and doing a lot of networking cameron is the technical person with no has no social skills but even in further seasons she hates management zero organization etc donna is the technical person that has good management skills and by the end of the series she is the only one who does everything she is the only one that has a balance unlimitedego i would also like to mention that not all knowledge workers make good managers figueroachill because the job is more about leading a team of people as opposed to sitting down and coding something amandazona as a data analysis engineer and informatics and data program manager i can say this i thought i wanted to build and run a data team i have sooo much insight to what the team needs and what expectations should be put upon them right well as true as that may be i hate it the more people i manage the less coding and solutions i am a part of as a result i feel that i am screwing myself interms of not getting any personal development and honing my skill set and learning to be an expert in multiple development platforms i realize two years in i want to be a full stack developer not a damn manager billychurch just because you are a data scientist does not mean you are a good manager most engineers ds cap out as individual contributors thepaleking i am one of these people however i have a decent exposure to analytics coding and programming as others have said technical types can be weak in their social and emotional skills which are difficult to coach up but more importantly it takes a business leader that understands the applications of the technology in the scope of the business to make the managed program successful a great amount of waste is created in corporate america when we direct powerful tools at the wrong problems or apply the wrong tools to the wrong situations and beyond that you need a politically savvy person to negotiate funding to support technology efforts and to simplify the concepts for leadership who otherwise feel like they are being sold snake oil because managing a team is a different skill set than doing ds one good thing if noticed at the university of minnesota business school where i got my bs in cs is that most of them are required to learn a little coding some of the more technical majors such as mis even more so then something less tech oriented such as marketing most business graduates will probably not write much code but i am hoping that a little hands on understanding of the tech will go a long way also there is always going to be a trade off between people with management skills and those with technical skills overlap is not guaranteed not having both is is not ideal but not having management skills can really bottle neck a team jizzybiscuits there are skills that you need as a manager these are not the same as the skills you need to do the job of the people you manage i knew a manager luckily not my manager who reckoned a good manager could manage anything he may have had a point but unfortunately he was a shit manager numerous ganache bruhhhhhhhhhhhh i ask this every day wellju they are more easily replacable also the company has the goal to make profits having good products is just a necessity for profits notparticularlyanony they are different skill sets somewhere the person at the top pay grade realize that this person the manager was the person to keep their well oiled machine running smoothly and profitable unrealizedlosses it is a different skill set that being said i believe you will be a more effective manager if you more completely understand what the team does but i have also seen way too many times people who are good at their jobs be made into managers only to flounder faintlyglowingfish it is a lot harder to understand why some managers that have no idea how to deal with people and are basically killing their teams are put into those positions just because they were good engineers or data scientists leonidasrfs because managing people and stakeholders does not involve import pandas as pd se here i would say because it is different skillets having domain expertise is only one variable when assessing the competence of a manager darciascientist sometimes because the people who decide to put them in power do not know better lol other times because leadership skills are a different set they might not need to know the details of models in order to make decisions around people and project allocation final the ceo of the chinese e commerce company ping du du was a data scientist there are data scientists who can be good leaders most business leaders talk in mba code languages that makes it easier to select one of them as a manager mreloi it is not the same everwhere for example in germany managers and ceos very often have the same technical backgrounds as the lower level staff slackington politics it is fine as long as they know it and rely on expertise of the team being good at something does not make you a good manager i know amazing ic in this space that became bad managers stockcomplaintmanagers are best thought of as gods and gods should not have to deal with such mundane concepts such as gradient descent or logistic regression as they battle the forces of evil and chaos while making the workplace safe for budgets and progress charts jjhero narcissism also people expend a lot of time in front a computer so they assume what they see is the only thing that exists yellowchess they are usually pretty useless but they have responsibilities that people who can code do not want to bother with i just ignore them when they ask me to do something stupid and they learn to not ask me to do stupid things colibriweiss because they were probably doing data science before the term data science existed but in reality they were glorified analysts with excel skills in companies like this nobody knows what is data science including the managers then it is easy to get around not knowibg what the subordinates do fooliam because management skills and data science skills are very very different being good at one does not mean you know or have to know anything about the other oktreaclemanagement is about people think of it as a whole different career the problem lies in seeing so many bad managers testrail it is a different skill because you need someone who can focus on value of the work that is being done and also understand business it happens in most technical fields software architecture engineering and of course data science too and more where management is for either non technical people or not very good technical people i have never understood this at all for the life of me neither do i manliness dot space the same reason software engineers can build software used by police officers without ever having been police officers themselves miraculumone because writing software and managing software engineers require very different skillsets i have had engineers who have said they wanted to manage people and when i give them people to manage they quickly decide it is not for them it is a totally different job really lonesomedota is not sooner or later tech people have to answer to a nontech people the further you go up the food chain lordsemaj because ds teams serve the business and it is typically more efficient to have someone who has business experience to align with those needs in my experience it is unusual for ds managers to have no experience in analytics they typically have some kind of background there to be qualified for the position in the first place there is zero reason for them to have a software engineer background though data science is not software engineering it is using analytics to solve business problems financial you do not necessarily need to have a plethora of knowledge in a specific industry to be a manager you have experts who you rely on you need to be savvy enough to be able to ask the right questions to understand enough it is more about resource management and overall direction of your department than technical skills it really matters on if they are a good manager or not not a good ds gotamd the skills required of a people manager are different from the skills required of an individual contributor i have seen many managers who lack management skills and it is not good for anyone there are also managers who lack the competence to manage certain individual contributors and that is also a train wreck but we should t assume that the manager of a team of data scientists must be the most data sciencey data scientist and who manages that person maxtothej whats the issue i would rather have someone without that expertise but better at the people stuff than someone who thinks they have that expertise but they do not or its outdated expertise professorphi another thing to add to all these wonderful points ds and ml tends to be very technically focussed and there is a perception that non technical work is useless which means ds and ml engineers just never develop the skills they need to scale and manage teams administration is different and more than you make of it most know and can make the diference between plowing a field building a house and working on an aplication some do not know it and do not care these one are your enemy but they can also be trained as it is harder for a data scientist to analyze the performance of data scientists without bias and to explain the intricacies to the top management as a layman but not every manager is good enough to take charge of a field that they know little about mrxtheother because you do not want to waste somebody with actual skills on a management position greenbloodedamazon my thought is that as rare as ds or se seem to be finding those of us that also like the challenge of translating the work into something meaningful to non tech people who have misguided assumptions about our work and or enjoy teasing out the real questions people are asking to turn that into meaningful new work are even more rare my previous team told me how grateful they were when i took the data science translator roll it meant less meetings and politicking for them another teammate told me he did not want to be a manager when our manager left he is a great ds and loved doing that unfortunately leadership gave him the manager position because they did not have anymore promotion options for him he is good as the manager but he also hates it and it takes away from his great technical leadership the tldr is just that the personalities that are drawn to ds and swe typically are not interested in what or do not have the skills for what it takes to be a manager qkumbazoo because they have people and business skills woulditlevrisdahl one of my favorite managers as a data scientist was a business man he was very good as pushing up and letting us do our work he got me raises and stuff cause he knew how to handle top management the worst manager i had was a senior data scientist who knew nothing about top management and wanted to micro manage arykos hi i kinda am this so i can explain i am not saying i am the best data engineer because i am not nor am i a rockstar se but i am a very good manager not just tooting my horn but management is a whole different set of skills imagine in a circle you have number not important just for the example very different data scientists data analysts on the same team some people prefer tool vs another some r some python some use bq whatever breaking down the differences is not the point the key is getting all of these talented people to do things that benefit the company find synergies and opportunities to get things done effectively and efficiently giving them roadmaps to successful careers even though they might leave you for another company or just retire and all of this while dealing with office politics changing budgets and product roadmaps the possibility of layoffs and other cross team issues and taking the blame for these people when they mess up yes just managing people is a job and a good manager does their best to get the job done better the company better their employees and take care of their employees i always have their back and am fair when approving vacation time and not overloading them with goals we cannot achieve maybe some will disagree but this is how i manage and we are going on years strong now rationaldialog it can go both ways terrible manager with tech skills great manager without them in general good managers are rare and i suspect if they are good the will quickly leave the realms of middle management toximaniac dont know cannot relate cuz i am a data scientist sitting at home and looking for jobs marzmanj we are cheaper than data scientists duncansarasti the people who have the capacity to do both are exceedingly rare and expensive milkandtwosugarz why are ministers of finance in charge of financial matters when they have no experience in finance why are environmental minister is having no ecology or environmental science backgrounds this is how the world works my friend why are software engineers or data scientists in charge of teams when they have no clue how to lead motivate or manage a team bigbarba because software engineers and data scientist have to do their jobs and managers have their own different job now if your manager does not understand the line of work that is a problem but if they understand the general picture and trust their technical team members with the details that is a perfect combo my supervisor has code skills but she is great at managing the work to be done shielding us from distractions problems coming from outside the team providing us the resources we need she even catch right away when someone of us is worried for something and discreetly sends us private meeting requests so we can speak freely about what is going on and what she and the team company can do to solve it honestly i think for someone to be that good at management they cannot have spent all the time and effort needed to also be a good technician or they can but i would prefer a manager to be skilled in management brocopalypsenow good technical skills good management skills lalalapotinki because managers need other skills than data scientists or software engineer its more about leading a group to complete certains tasks than it is to be able to complete the task on your own nomnommish if you want a real answer and not a rant it is because we exist only to serve the business which means to develop features and tools and products and processes that help the business this means that the person managing a software team has to first be someone who understands the needs of business and then has to be someone who understands the needs of the software team problem is it is incredibly hard to find someone who truly understands both then it is even harder to find someone who has true empathy and checks their ego at the door shitlordgod because people with technical skills and management skills are not in middle management prize flow i can relate but engaging with non technical people and or management is part of the job for data science otherwise how do you know if you are solving the right business problem esposed because most software engineers and data scientists who have no management training or experience are terrible managers management done right is a discipline on its own juyuju what is the role of the manager to manage people lead them and find resources that the team needs is the role of the manager to code fix bugs and clean data sets some people want to do science want to write code they do not want to deal with budgeting hr stuff contacting users etc others want to do exactly that having knowledge of the field helps but it is not mandatory put it this way you have a top heart surgeon is it better that he is saving lives or battling for better budget and funds observabilitygeek that is fucked up bobdope i got you one better cio at the last place was an accountant i guess his excel skillz got him the jobhe proved the saying as hire as bs hire cs cs put people with degrees in african history and no experience in super high it roles evolutioninprogress i think it is more about managing and leading people and the ds se employees are expected to know everything and do their jobs many professions utilize this thinking police departments can hire commissioners who have never been a cop and are not sworn officers in their official capacity as the commissioner because their job is not of being a cop but of oversight and leadership management until recently my agency used to hire people to train parole officers people they hired had nothing to do with the job in the past but that did not work out so well and they started going towards people who have the job experience and were top in their field i think it is a mixed bag and it depends on the profession what kind of management system they can use with the most positive results but for something technical like ds se i think it is better to have a team leader who is an expert and a manager for oversight and actual leadership needs because they are completely different skillsets and most of the time you cannot get it all in one package you do not need to know the craft to manage people it helps true if you know management you can apply the same principles to almost any company regardless of its industry jjinrva so the rest of the world understand what people have designed basically because you ca not spell dumbass without mba you eventually run into them and they always try to ensure their own are at least the majority of the executive tier most simply do not have any comprehension of the actual line of business just the bottom line of the financial reports do not even know what their market is like just zero clue aexnin germany you can study informatics for business which is basically a degree focused on projectmanagement it includes the usuall math algo and programming classes of computer science combined with basics in economics and other related subjects there is also the german science field of business informatics which is sadly not recognised internationally it has some aspects in common with information systems however it is more focused on the innovative use of technology to improve or create businesses brandrcharly good developers do not necessarily make good leaders good leaders make good leaders i have always approached my dev teams as a support put in place to remove roadblocks and communicate priorities note i started in the leadership role with dev experience and since then have gotten a degree and taken on my own user stories for whatever perspective that is worth realitycheckonetwo they know the business side of things and can help align your skills to corporate goalshopefully uchimata i do not think it is a very good idea to have front line se and ds managers who have not done the work they will not be able to coach or help with technical problems or really even have the understanding to guide their team is work effectively the higher you get in the org structure though the more being able to do things like align technology spend and dev time to corporate priorities and deal with competing asks across the enterprise matter for leadership more than technical acumen i do think even at the vp level you should have some technical understanding but you really only need it in the context of being able to understand the capabilities and limitations of the team and the technologies being used managers like this need to have really strong architects to help them understand design tradeoffs but they can be effective if they are good at working with the business and handling the financial side of things it is not like most execs are really doing a lot in terms of code reviews or low level technical design flashy career the ds field is too nascent to have enough experienced managers with this technical background i expect the situation will be different in about years aussiepunmaster who cares what people is backgrounds are in this discussion the real question is are they good at their job if they are the background is meaningless if they are not their technical background is but one reason why they might not be izygoing_ because bullshit talkers sold other peoples work over the years and gained a position call those people in front of everybody our especially use your chance infront of vps i love to do that wouldeadfishlog this is a huge reason no one ever believes my data i just go with the flow what the fuck ever i get paid either way hughk the manager does not have to know the techy details but it is very useful if they understand the process and where the hiccups are likely to be i was on one big project where we had a director who was techy he was regularly fixing last minute bugs in the deployment as he had cut testing to a minimum he also was not managing the budget properly and one of his assistants lost a million euros from the budget due to an excel error which he missed because he was not monitoring it redditloveerrr watch the movie office space it is spot on same reasons why most star athletes make shitty coaches venticocainelatte they know the business inside and outand are able to articulate without sounding like a clown having seizurehalf of the software people do not even speak human and i came up through the product development arc in investment banking no day nepotism newmanthegreat i think there is another reason to point out compensation i work in software development and there are senior engineers and architects who make make than their direct managers not all but many in many traditional business careers you tend to make more as you progress up the leadership chain sure the directors vp level employees will probably make more than the senior technology professionals but good pay to stay at a worker level means there is not always pressure to move up sctech the skills you need to be a successful ds se individual contributor are not the same skills you need to be a successful people manager it is difficult to find individuals with both while it can be frustrating to work under a strong people manager w o technical skills i promise you it is worse to work under a strong ds se w o people management skills because being technical and knowing the shit in managerial circles is both perceived as a weakness you are getting too close to what plebes should do lowering the status of the idea of a manager and unwanted strength you understand something what the other managers especially above you do not understand wouldataentryadmin my manager has excellent business intelligence and people skills he can present my work better than me and can guide me to the best solutions for the business chunkychapstick grifters quisitive_ happens in every profession there are people who specialize in leading and some of them are actually pretty dang good at it a lot of them just use buzzwords and phrases until they are overwhelmed by the chasm they have created and leave to go hang over somebody else is workplace anastasia beaverhut i have made that precise leap from a ds marketing analytics project manager formerly a data scientist analyst into actual management and it is a different world up here my role now has little to do with daily ins and outs of ds that is considered granular and tactical versus strategic what i worry about now is informing overall business strategy new products solutions employee engagement where to move in the next few years also i am in charge of making sure our employees are productive part of my responsibilities are telling our leadership how to pay our salesforcewhich is tens of thousands of peopleso we maintain growth etc my time is spent thinking about what our overall strategy should be why should it be this and not something else who in our organization needs to be included where to ensure we are getting things resourced correctly etc etc tons of politics here and you have to have a natural knack for persuasion or no one will take you seriously my primary stakeholders are the ceo coo and a few svps i work at an extremely well known tech firm and it is a larger one though not faang but point is c suite do not give a shit and do not want to hear about anything at a level below big picture they would laugh me out of a room if i discussed anything that detailed i have only understood what soft skills are needed for this kind of job once someone saw i had them and promoted me a couple of times within the last year or so edited to say it is tough for people to have both big picture strategic thinking and soft skills of persuasion etc while also having the granular and technical mind required for being a great ds or even an analyst knowledgebass stakeholder skills it is just annoying when the pretenders act like they know it all just tells you they are insecure or a narcissist magrik the best manager i have had in the civilian sector was a non data person she was an iron curtain for me and my team and helped clear all road blocks she was genuinely interested in the welfare of her people as well i would work for her again in a heartbeat wouldomesticationnever they need to be good at human languages speaking the terms of the business on one side and speaking the language of engineers on the other side the engineers often need the business problems explained in terms they can get and the business needs the technical problems explaining in a language they understand a big part of it is translator wouldrmindsmith i want to add that there is an unfounded belief that excellence in an area is not only necessary for but also leads to excellence in overseeing or guiding that activity is not this the entire concept behind a scrum master human management project management even the fuzzy leadership concept these are not the same skills as being a genius scientist or coder or engineer i am reminded of that scene in mad men when don draper is talking about lane something like do you know how to do what he does because i do not anyway the human stuff and the organizational stuff and the planning stuff and the budget stuff and the other stuff are not the same thing as the technical stuff i suspect a great manager must at least speak data science but does not have to be a data scientist optoplasm the ceo of my person company often attends data science meetings and actively participates it works only because he is very smart and analytical and he listens carefully before he speaks he also has no problem admitting he is wrong or he does not understand something when we are discussing something deep in the technical weeds the right manager knows how to participate and push deadlines without getting in the way of engineers data scientists nude rating bot thank you for a refreshing take on a very hotly debated topic pryomancermtga dammit if i had read your reply i could have saved time by just upvoting you you said it better than i thedataguyos my best ever leader was this did not know much tech wise but was an excellent people leader and liason for us interesting i work in environmental consulting and all of the higher level project directors vice presidents and ceo all started as staff engineers or scientists simianire i mean is a pyramid shaped hierarchy with only one individual at the top ceo really the only viable organizational structure says who and on what evidence edit all fair points thanks for the responses everyone i was not trying to be antagonistic per se i really did wonder to myself why cannot the principle ds literally own all ds related decisions and effectively report to no one while each discrete business unit does the same within their respective scopes i am going to post this on linkedin as if it was my idea flashy career agree fully ds team leads first line managers need to be able to reduce the abstraction of a high level strategy and guide their team to a valuable delivery delivery which is incoherent or irrelevant to the strategy of those investing in the team is worthless lopsided respond answer is simple its cheaper same has you do not want a plastic surgeon to be the marketing director or the general director of your clinic you would be paying too much and you would be missing one surgeon that only happens if its a very small clinic or their own where they will still keep doing surgery same for engineers you do not want to waste a very good engineer with simple management tasks if its to go up in the ladder it is probably to an architect staff or principal engineer cio or cto roles not management roles particularly me would not be trading a highly technical career for something you do not even need much training besides those soft skills things so much people rely on hughk providing cover for your staff is one of the most important things in managing a team at the same time providing transparency where needed proofrequired i have yet to meet this unicorn non ds or non technical manager the best manager i had was a swe turned ds we never heard any bs from management and had never had to bs our way to provide some analysis i have been lucky in this regard that i have only dealt with one non technical manager who was a train wreck single handedly destroyed our credibility in front of management because he would not understand anything technical and when you hear him speak you can easily see he is bsn his way i have the opposite experience but typically they get promoted to principal data scientist instead of project manager program manager manager of data science director of data science kingpatzer many companies make the mistake of thinking that because someone is a great senior technologist they are the natural person to lead a team of technologists the two skill sets have almost nothing to do with each other as a manager the technologists i value most are those who are not only demonstrably solid technically but who will stubbornly and vociferously defend their opinions about how we should do something particularly when we are facing a complex problem with numerous possible solution paths such people are invaluable for helping me understand and decide on a course of action but that is because i will not take a stand but listen to the arguments of various people who disagree with each other until i understand the pros and cons of each possible path and can make a decision based not on my commitment to a particular course of action but based on which course of action presents the best trade offs between numerous often conflicting criteria those same folks when promoted into management roles generally really struggle with listening to other people is viewpoints and giving them a fair hearing the result is almost always bad in the long run braxios this is where i am at ended up in middle management running a small team of analysts i spend my day managing the team and the various clients around the organisation not doing analysis i think i am better at some of the communication and stakeholder management than many of the analyst is we have got but i am essentially ignoring the areas i am most skilled at to do things that i am less skilled at in my mind the team should have someone whose skills are around managing people and let me take more of lead analyst role without all the line management responsibilities numerous ganache it stuff but what you do might not directly manage those in devops cycles which is where it gets stressful having non technical leads filmisforever because my job does not have anything to do with technical stuff it has to do with holding the client is hand doing billing managing budgets providing estimates coordinating with suppliers working with project managers and program managers and delivery leads to ensure plans are correct and up to date processing change controls managing raid logs mitigating risks escalating issues to appropriate channels handling governance concerns dealing with internal and external auditors finding staff engaging with off shore teams and so on rofl the main reason why technical people want a management role despite them not good managers is because they want better pay and the only way to increase pay is taking manager role if more companies paid tech leads more such that they can even be paid the same or more than their managers this problem of managers not knowing how to manage people will cease to exist footballfanabc can you give some examples in your past experiences lol so true i had a manager try to start talking about tech with me and he started talking about how he once made a website using wix and how his year old son is learning to be a programmer because he plays minecraft spiritual good answer one of the primary reasons i ran into was that person is ability to get things done on time under budget ariadnesoul the ability to deal with politics explaining stuff to the decision makers and keeping them happy probably meaning the ability to translate ds jargon into understandable metrics for non ds folks also the ability to sit in meetings and determine where and how the ds can provide value as opposed to just being assigned tasks okdependentbabysitting them convincing them that they are asking something unreasonable and impossible and should reconsider their request timeline budget making them aware of what your capability can do and making pitches to solve problems the stakeholder did not know existed project portfolio communication these are the things you have asked for and when they are getting done with how much they have cost szayl that is what a leader should do remove blockers for their team advocate for them communicate honestly with them and make sure that the team understands their tasks goals objectives dfphd i do not know if she was the best but the boss i learned the most from by far was like that rationaldialog exactly there are simple good and bad managers on either side with tech skills or not we simply tend to forgive the ones with tech skills more because well at least the have tech skills and some reason to have the job greenbloodedamazon this i am trying my best to be that shield for my team i have had managers that were not shields and it was distracting and unproductive i can only hope to be like that manager of yours or my last manager before i took this job colickingseahorse i am a people person goddammit but honestly it is so true you need one of these enkday this is it there are very few of these people out there they know enough about both the operational side as well as the technical side to bridge the gap lopsided respond the engineers often need the business problems explained in terms they can get lol do not know where your engineers have studied but just to be able to have a place where i did my engineering degree you need to be pretty smart what normally engineers need is someone with time to waste on numerous calls repeating over and over the same discussions until the business really know what they need to then know what they want and then to commit with something that will not change during development engineers that do technical work do not have that amount of time and energy to waste non technical managers that manage engineering teams are becoming less and less needed and the engineer architect is starting more and more to replace them on highly demanding projects to bridge business and tech to reduce noise particularly if they are not web or mobile projects with some kind of frontend they will still be needed to manage times expenses create reports arrange physical meetings etc in the end my advice is to just never say to an engineer that he needs something explained in simple words i would go after you and make you swallow my rubber duck dfphd it is funny because nowhere is it more apparent than in sports some of the best football coaches of all time were mediocre at best college football players and some of the best players of all time are horrible coaches why for a lot of reasons but what you mention is key being good at something does not make you good at making others good at that thing and if you think about it it is relatively intuitive when you are naturally incredibly talented at something it is normally because it came naturally you did not have to think about how to get good at it you just were and you then just needed to learn how to become really good at it suhdudegoblue scrum master is a bad example it is falling out of favor with the industry just look at how capital one basically ended the agile delivery lead role and a lot of folks myself included do not think it should be a role for almost any dev team ukmurmuk i think this is an important point it is okay if a manager is not a technical person but they have to possess the willingness to learn technical terms open to new ideas especially those that require long term investment in terms of technical resources and not being an asshole that refuse to discuss technical problems without trying wouldfphd there are definitely industries where this happens but they are the abject minority put differently i would venture a guess that among the fortune there are more c suites made up entirely of mbas than there are companies with technical people as ceos what else would you propose pryomancermtga end of the day someone has to have final call at most large companies this is not the case either the ceo answers to the shareholders and the ceo is decisions always come with limitations if twitter would have still been public firing that many people and gambling this much with the shareholders money would have landed elon musk in big trouble and exposed him to lawsuits you cannot just press the self destruct button as a ceo if ypu want to but yes it seems like the organization that works is when the people who have a stake shareholders citizens in a country etc appoint someone to make the day to day decisions and serve until the stakeholders replace you with someone else taguscove this is empirically the near universal org structure from companies to nonprofits to the military you can propose an alternative to organize humans but extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence deofficiis it is often predicated on responsibility and accountability for every task within an organization you have defined roles for whose responsible ie the person who does the task and the defined role for who is accountable ie who validates the task and takes ownership of it either good or bad often frontline workers take responsibility and the immediate supervisor manager takes accountability it is often desirable to have a single person be held accountable for some task because they take ultimate ownership of that task if that task is done poorly or not at all the burden is on a single person if you held multiple people accountable for task they could always blame each other or believe the other accountable individuals are taking care of the task this lends itself to a system that filters to a single person at the top who is accountable for the company is profitability this also makes communication easier with shareholders instead of listening to different workers that might have a part of the bigger picture they can directly communicate with someone who theoretically knows the general direction of the company ention maybe a better way to put it would be in the end data science concerns have to report to business value concerns you can have a structure where your lead data scientist is also in charge of deciding what is most valuable to your customers stakeholders etc but it is very hard to hire someone who is extremely technical and also an extremely good executive decision maker renokarchnmy everyone reports to someone a principal ds will have to report to the board who report to shareholders you seem to not understand what a ceo actually is and how managing people towards a single direction not the whims of glorified technical leads is the purpose of the executive suite dfphd i mean is a pyramid shaped hierarchy with only one individual at the top ceo really the only viable organizational structure says who and on what evidence i know some people got mad at you for this but it is a valid question one could argue that just because we have converged on this model even if everyone has it does not make it the best model i think the challenge is that even if it is not the best model human nature is likely going to always make individuals drive to become that sole total decision maker i think that convergence around a pyramid shape is less about optimality and definitely less about design and it is more a reflection of human beings desire to gain power mingzhouren how does this make any sense managers are paid more leadership within ds is different than leadership to the rest of the org because project program management is a different skillset and has more in common with doing that for a different application area than it does with the application area itself it is the same reason people like us are comfortable walking into a room full of people that sell widgets and saying hey i know nothing about widgets but i know a lot about data and you have got widget data give me a high level overview of your widgets and i bet i can do something useful with your data raharth project manager are not lead positions they are responsible for a product but not people a good manager team leader needs to know how to lead a team but not much about the technical skills as long as they recognize that the worst is a manager that micro manages all his people and believes that he knows better or has to k ow better than the experts the title difference depends on how much bullshit you are willing to put up with hedylove probably because you will make more money as an engineer over manager kingpatzer managers have first jobs too kingpatzer and the only way to increase pay is taking manager role i have seen that particularly in smaller companies i am lucky enough to work for a company where that is not an issue you should probably take him a little seriously you do not automatically become a demi god once you write your first line of python hedylove why do you even need a manager who is proficient in data science or programming being a manager is a different skill set i used to be a manager for people it is a completely different area what would be the benefit of having the manager know how to do your job that is my current manager he is as useful as a wet rock bigguscinnamusrollus this one right here people like to talk about how technical skill and knowledge is all that matters i have seen many clueless managers but i have also seen many good engineers workers absolutely sucking or hating when they have to do anything remotely related to management the people who can do both are exceedingly rare knowledgebass oh okay my brain thought of someone holding a steak justsaynobro thematrix lopsided respond the ability to have time to babysit that is something engineers do not have thats why you need another idiot to entertain the other idiots while the big boys work ktpr or complaining about management gradualalzheimers is the most important on this list and what distinguishes good management from bad in my opinon too often is what managers do and they just become ticket takers and get bombarded by stuff thrown over the fence to them even when they are really good at they are stuck just being a middle man controlling the influx of requests whereas good managers will understand the problems the business needs by having a regular finger print on the pulse elicit requirements vs ticket taking and suggesting intelligent solutions for complicated business problems that can scale you can tell what kind of manger you have if they are clueless about what your team does they only look at you as through the lens of productivity ticket takers they do not know how your technology works and what it is capable of they view you as a commodity they never measure how successful projects are in terms of delivering business value they give unrealistic timelines to accomplish something run from mangers that only know how to do as they will just grind you to the ground and will not care granted every team is a mixture of and but its really painful to be on a team that cannot drop a deuce rationaldialog make sure that the team understands their tasks goals objectives but then are they realistic how can a non tech manager judge that magrik it makes the world of difference when you feel supported in your role both from work and personal perspective anoooooose happy cake day wouldomesticationnever also needed to manage those important fragile egos all around belkarbitterleaf sounds like you need it explained to you any people people willing to bite the bullet wallymetropolis and moreover most of the people a manager will manage are not going to be exceptional expecting them to be is frustrating for everyone exceptional practitioners will often have unrealistic expectations of their team when they become leaders wouldrmindsmith i did not know that just saw a lot of people on linkedin trying to get teachers and former teachers to pay them to become highly paid scrum masters yea i suppose i may live in a bubble but it does seem strange for a vice president to have no technical knowledge of the industry spaceisthecoolest a council of elders ahsfav it is not for most governments renokarchnmy in this case you are probably describing something like a chief ds officer or cdso cdo or something wallymetropolis not always it is becoming more common for the high skill ic is to be paid more than their managers i personally do not have a problem with people on my team making more than me so long as i am getting fair comp those are the people who make me successful so i am happy to keep them happy lopsided respond non technical managers are payed less and way less than senior engineers if that happens in your company something is wrong sxohady you mean they are not all hired due to their extensive experience as the vc is incompetent buddy edit to whoever i offended with this i know there are some great managers out there there are just also a lot of useless ones exceedingly rare okninjathat does sound more enticing i would like to deal with steak holders now and then footballfanabc steakeater cringe r usernamechecksout strifedecer communication motag they ask the technical team if it is realistic lopsided respond i do not argue with that when you have nothing to lose you do not really care lopsided respond guess you are the first in line to suck on my duck good for you suhdudegoblue well that is unfortunate lol you mean something like an executive committee or a board of directors pocodr still fewer at the top still hierarchical flatprotrusion wo not that be ageism instead go for a council of people tundur most countries have an executive with a single head of government who at least nominates the other members of the cabinet paid not payed bot managers are paid less and ftfy although payed exists the reason why autocorrection did not help you it is only correct in nautical context when it means to paint a surface or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion resistant the deck is yet to be payed payed out when letting strings cables or ropes out by slacking them the rope is payed out you can pull now unfortunately i was unable to find nautical or rope related words in your comment beep boop i am a bot sxohady non technical managers are often paid more than mid level engineers and of course there are the managers who seem technical to the higher ups but not as far as anyone actually technical is concerned it can feel like the small amount of technical knowledge they have is actually an impediment to those doing the actual technical work perhaps this is a reason to have managers with no technical skill whatsoever xd numerous ganache i have bosses who manage tech projects that literally do not even know any tech jargon and have absolutely no clue wtf we actually do and then they get raises while their lack of understanding and ability to report correctly just falls on the developers performance it is such shit they will literally be afraid to even talk to us in fear that our conversation will give them anxiety or something idk blacksnowboader to be fair their username is lopsided respond domesticationnever something i have loved about managing over the years is getting to know incredibly sharp and smart people personally they help me through the tough times and i help them something i always need to keep in check is my own ego often the people i work with are smarter than me and i have to come to grips with that friend if we were working together i would make sure you always felt like things were moving forward and there was something to lose we would build a bunch of bad ass software together solve a ton of problems and have a ton of fun doing it i would bet your smarter than me senkichi so incredibly cringy when grown ass adults use bullshit tough guy rhetoric you are in no way intimidating you are not going to make anyone suck on your duck you are not going to do shit realistically at best you are going to huff and fantasize about all the things you would like to do and then you would accept your simple explanation and get back to work spaceisthecoolest i was joking if you select filter by age then maybe if you select by competence and the resulting group is older on average then probably no ahsfav yeah but they do not unilaterally make decisions usually there is a lateral distribution congress etc lopsided respond did you need to start managing to start knowing incredibly and smart people where did you come from before that lopsided respond i am not a grown up you do not even know who you are speaking to probably a kid or troll maybe even a retired old man i am here to entertain you lonely people speaking to who knows who wasting time and energy that they will never get back this is what drives me glad i reached you basic dude flatprotrusion i was just joking but he did say a council of elders and not a council of competent ppl who happened to be old senkichi that is pathetic grats i guess ah never mind me then like the limbo bar at a midget festival this went way over my head lopsided respond thats right and i am dragging you with me flatprotrusion its probably because the joke is bad considering no one upvoted lol no worries",

  "ikwieanders yes there are loads of shiny new tools but i am still using linear regression to achieve loads of my kpi is cause the real world is incredibly technically immature man as a group people posting to this sub need to calm down a little bit therealtiddlydump another awful take on chatgpt except this one is as long as a russian novel hard pass savethepandabears nlp is a very very very tiny subset of data science autumnotter this is silly and something like it is being posted every day have you tried to actually use chatgpt to replace your job when it gathers requirements your marketing people type in a bunch of stuff that is impossible what does it do when it is asked to gather references or websites does it work nope it creates these ensemble mosaics that look like they should be real references and websites but are not when your data engineers ask it which features it needs to model for a churn model it will give a general answer that has no relevance to your company ai tools are going to be amazing and are going to replace some jobs transform some jobs etc but talking about the future being bleak for data scientists is just not a strong prediction at the very worst someone needs to have institutional knowledge design data products bespoke to the company and translate requirements sycokinetic there is still going to be a strong exploratory side to data science but the work will mostly be in feature engineering and not in the models themselves this is because in most applications it is far more effective to use domain knowledge to make insights easier to extract than it is to design niche models that can cut though problem specific noise positions that focus on designing new cv and nlp models are going to become increasingly rare because relatively few companies have the data or funding necessary to train those kinds of models let alone invent new ones the field will be fine it just will not be like it was in the is where every ds was a superstar making the role is going to be commodified and democratized like software development was and the job title is going to become far more accessible kingmull ahh nice this weeks rendition on this topic purplebrownupdown mj made the game better the game is always progressing as players get better streetperformerthe kind of opinion i would expect from a layman not from a data scientist chandlerbingstats x doubt i still use logistic regression cause stakeholders do not understand xgboost results not easy to implement i work in finance all this chatgpt takes on internet makes me think either i am too stupid to understand what is happening or that people out there do not know actually what all work a data science professional is supposed to do you know what ruined data science the harmonic mean monkeyunited phil jackson he ruined or i ruined muchdiscussionlol amadeusblackwell this version of the question is ai going to take my job the answer is no i feel like the more worried you are you could be replaced by a chat bot the more likely you are to be replaceable by a chat bot expand your skills dude oceanboi cannot tell if like these posts more or less than the how do i learn data science posts aplarsen oh no your field is changing this is definitely unique to ds and has never happened anywhere else chiefquiche yeah and they thought the invention of the calculator meant we will not need to learn math anymore guess what we still teach math it is all just tools and you can either learn to leverage them or not thecamerlengo michael jordan did not ruin basketball basketball is fine try watching another video meankingi think you are making this way bigger then it is it is or can be a great tool but that is all it is gonna be meadowpoe another chatgpt complain post throwra the moment i saw chatgpt i stopped reading ectd you are looking at the end of your own nose i hate these lame posts you are a doomsday er and it is lame because you do cool shit and you cannot tell your skills are transferable boohoo unsteadypanda it is been happening for a while in the tabular data world once you have a final dataset chuck it into lightgbm and call it a day no one uses stuff like svm or knn or even random forest any more even regressions are typically confined to regulated industries or very niche domains the vast majority of the work is spent in the business end understanding the problem from the end user perspective pre modeling phase data collection and processing and the post modeling phase deployment monitoring general engineering and looking for papers datasets implementations implementing my own stuff experimenting comparing the results if this was the majority of your day to day then i would say you were in a pretty uncommon position to start with the industry at least in tech has converged to two major archetypes of the data scientist strictly analytics and the machine learning engineer bigbearany posts that contains future chatgpt should just be banned how do you work for years in this field and think chatgpt will replace you golladayholliday you are getting dragged here but i do not think you are necessarily wrong what you need to keep in mind is there will always bet a need for technically sophisticated people to solve problems as long as your skill set is cutting edge there will always be a well compensated position for you to address challenges webmasters probably never thought they were getting replaced but some of them are data scientists now just stay on top technically and there is nothing to worry about fancy are you currently working at a data scientist or any job related to that because the way you write seems like you are just some hyped journalist venticocainelatte for a split second i thought about itended up learning rust for what i wanted to do would have been great to work on building ai tools but investment banking and investment management as a whole is years behind in adoption in particular because of the infrastructure and the it support staff which is tier at best comfortablewaywould you rather have been a data scientist of the is running your stack of punch cards to the machine so it can run over night or would you rather be the ds of the is where you are still babysitting overnight compute how bout the is doing calculus by hand to get us to the moon tools change but we are all going to be babysitting compute late into the evenings for the rest of our lives perhaps the more we are able to compute the more we compute but we still spend the same human hours doing it there is something ironic about a data scientist predicting their own firing based on trends in data there is going be plenty of jobs in the future as ds since you need ds is to clean up data improve and maintain the prediction models translate business people into math problems that can be predicted things change all the time there is new laws new products new services new needs and that is what history shows i would not worry about it own i would argue the same happened with ibm and big blue ai research was a hot topic leading up to it then the world stood in shock when a machine beat a chess grand master after that funny enough interest in ai research died in part because that everyone that actually understood the area to a certifiable level degree phd etc found themselves a lot of lucrative work in focusing on application over research of course we all know that this wore off very quickly as this inevitably led to a race to the limits the same can be said about this point in time we are all shocked by how useful this is and if you know how to wield this beast not just talk to it but enhance it and apply it to specific use cases then there is going to be a lot of work in the short term to make a lot of money of course we are going to find the limits soon enough then we are going to realize those limits then research will start again this is life im sure this cycle stops at some point but we are all probably better off not trying to call when and instead leaning into the unknown and trying our best to avoid major fuckups like terminator i know there is a combination of excitement and dread same thing happened with big blue same thing with the model t same thing with the space ship there is a lot to argue with here but even before i post this comment there are a lot of counter arguments to make against me so i will just call this some sort of philosophy maybe a philosophy major or chat gpt can tell me what philosophy this is but i am just going to do what i can to add value to the planet in a way that leaves it better than i found it i hope i do not inadvertently fuck things up but i suppose i might mechanicalbro the truth shall set your karma free lmao levenshteinn most data scientists are in denial of what ai is capable of doing it is a bit of drinking your own medicine previously how many roles have been at risk since data science promised some levels of automation we like to argue hey data science weeds off unproductive tasks so that you can focus on more productive works in reality business is a profit making entity if it can do more with less resources it will take that path for sure chatgpt is a taste of what to come data scientists cannot expect things will not change and they can continue working as usual what can be automated must be automated ultimately you are concerned of your own income potential that is the reality same like how many other jobs are how data scientists will survive i do not know but in the past few data scientists would even think of doing data engineering these days it is extremely common to see data scientists pivoting towards data engineering their ideals cannot fight the actual need to survive western day you are totally right i am having very similar thoughts lately soon most of the models will be accessible through an api key of course a data scientist is needed to understand and fine tune these models but as you mentioned it takes that thrill out from working in nlp the role of the data scientist is quickly starting to shift and i posted my thoughts on thursday in much more detail the last few weeks i have seen people come to data scientists with work they had validated using gpt chatgpt they are asking data scientists to productionalize it the new language models are democratizing many nlp tasks from extraction summarization and q a however there is still a stong need for data scientists it is just a different time when your users are much more educated on the possibilities sycokinetic it is not even an issue of technical immaturity sometimes lots of problems do not need complicated models they just need something sane and moderately adaptive affectionateshineyesss work on tabular data leonardodicathode until the world figures you they are wasting six figures on your mundane work slumi it is a subset but i disagree that it is tiny it is probably one of the biggest categories out there if not the biggest i would say only computer vision comes close anyway as i said in my post i doubt this kind of huge general model developed by big tech companies that take the world by storm and become the norm will be confined to nlp for long but yes if you work on a very specialized problem with a very specialized dataset you will not be impacted nearly as soon slumi i never said that chatgpt would replace my job i even said that the hype around it would possibly generate an even bigger demand for data scientists what i did say is that with models that are getting better out of the box such as gpt the focus of the job of a data scientist in industry is moving away from actually doing modelling work which is the part i enjoyed slumi yup that is what i was getting at the field is not going anywhere anytime soon but the golden age of modeling in small and medium sized companies is coming at an end for highly generalizable fields such as many subcategories of nlp you can ask chatgpt to explain xgboost micturitionsyncope no one uses stuff like svm or knn or even random forest any more even regressions are typically confined to regulated industries or very niche domains lol what we use these all the time and i work at a retail company not niche or regulated slumi again i never said gpt would take my job i said it would change its nature and i said that based on the fact that it already did my job at my current company revolves almost exclusively around finding and implementing state of the art approaches to nlp state of the art which are becoming impossible for a company the size of mines to compete with given their resource and data requirements as such we have to resort to gpt quite frequently and my job has shifted more towards a software engineer type role wouldatastoryteller no journalists are much more succinct i also see that colleagues in nlp right now just reframes their problem to fit one of those pre trained models and uses them even in my field people seem to reframe everything to some sequence of discrete symbols similarly as previously people used pre trained resnets on things like spectrograms lieutenantro kudos to you pal the world is simple and can be treated with well described heuristics hikehikebaby most problems satisfy the assumptions of linear regression most data follows a normal distribution most problems are average and average methods work well ikwieanders well i also mean in terms of the data strategy in a company if a company is new to working with data or whatever you have to work with low quality or small data sets in which case regression with domain knowledge is pretty hard to beat ikwieanders if you think that fitting a simple model makes the work more mundane than fitting some more advanced model you either have never worked as a data scientist in a professional environment or worse you are a hack but yes if i would really need to sell it i would just call it an incredibly low memory effici\u00ebnt neural network micturitionsyncope what are the categories of data science and why do you think nlp is the biggest forecasting regression classification clustering and causal inference are categories of data science that make up most of the efforts my team and i work on in retail data science all of these fantastic pretrained nlp and cv models are great and we use them in our work but they make up a tiny piece of our work it sounds to me like you have overfit your perceptions and they are not generalizable to data science as a whole savethepandabears what nlp and other niches dealing with unstructured data cv audio etc are nowhere close to the amount of work dealing with tabular data full stop and modeling tabular data makes up maybe of what a data scientist is actually doing the best comparison i can make is automl we have had automl around for several years now and it is nowhere close to replacing the work data scientists are doing chunkychapstick most business problems are very specialized sycokinetic nlp and cv are just where all the venture capital went and now all that money is running away and those jobs are vanishing their magnitude and importance has been a huge bubble that just burst because those solutions cost way too much money to produce and are way too difficult to monetize savethepandabears the focus of a data scientist in industry has not been exclusively doing modeling work for several years now autumnotter fair enough i still do not think it is going away as fast as you seem to think translating requirements into code has been something companies have been promising would go away with low code and no code tools for years has not happened yet i think it is far more likely that low effort tasks like writing content marketing copy email blasts and even things like sales prospecting going to be increasingly automated before writing code unsteadypanda i have worked across tech companies and interviewed discussed tech stacks with dozens more the majority of classification models in prod are either tree based ensembles or deep learning people still use other methods for sure but generally they seem to be trending downwards however everyone is got their own sampling bias so ymmv iusedtoknowsuffering i find more data follow something like a power law distribution than a normal distribution does not even mention recommenders either which is a huge subfield in data science for most of the large tech companies with established ds teams i agree i can think of at least three categories that are more influential drive more revenue and have more people working on them across the industry than nlp slumi what are the categories of data science and why do you think nlp is the biggest depends on what you label as a category i guess but have a look here to see what i mean by nlp being one of the biggest it its one of the categories with the biggest numbers of papers forecasting regression classification clustering and causal inference most of these techniques can also be applied to nlp and transformers which are rapidly becoming too big for non big tech companies to realistically train generally hold the best metrics livid exactly the true data science is not the modeling it is the ability to trivialize a problem enough to make it solvable you still need the data scientist to trivialize the problem without that you have overly specific models that do one thing slumi it was still very much so for unstructured data as approaches dealing with those are faster moving than approaches dealing with structured data and that as such reading and implementing the latest state of the art required a fair amount of work but with models that work better and better out of the box it is becoming less so which is a shame for what it is worth i pretty much fall into the build training sets and chuck into lightgbm category it works well enough and solves the problem i need to solve more often than not micturitionsyncope if you think there are more papers using nlp then there are using regression then i do not know what to tell you fancy you are using academic papers to discuss non academic work may i also tell you that a large majority of those papers will see no light in applications or have so little improvement that nobody cares or are so expensive that it is not feasible in a business settings therealtiddlydump then i do not know what to tell you pass the pipe perhaps slumi huh regression is a technique that can be used by pretty much any field of data science including nlp you do not use regression just for the sake of it you do it to get results out and apply them to some field be it clinical financial or whatever whereas nlp can be its own end just like say computer vision btw when i say nlp i also mean its subcategories such as text prediction sentiment analysis text processing etc i think we are discussing different things i am talking about the result level of applying what you get out of your models to real world data you are talking about underlying techniques to me what you are saying is comparable to if you think more papers are written in english than with vowels i do not know what to tell you micturitionsyncope if you want to get into a semantic argument then perhaps you should look at your own title you are thinking about your own work in a specific area of data science and saying progress there means that we should be concerned about data science in industry in general i am uninterested in defining exactly what is a data science category or a technique or field or specialty or whatever i completely disagree with your premise that technical progress in data science means that data scientists will not actually be doing data science",
  "savethepandabears r studio posit now is a great ide in my opinion use what you are most comfortable with ide choice is mostly a matter of personal preference if you want to try another ide i would recommend either pycharm or vscode quarto is so cool on rstudio it is a jupyter notebook in r and can run all different types of scripts referencing each other is variables i lub speedis notfree for what you will be missing for python only probably good integration with conda python virtual environments vscode has a nice feature where you can use code chunks without jupyter notebook files use vscode for just about everything other than r mostly because of the sheer number of non python things it can do to make my life easier remote ssh and cloud vm connections testing framework integration docker integration the list is endless with all the addons drdroplet as someone coming from years of experience using rstudio i have enjoyed the similar layout of spyder for coding in python royal independent i use it for simple tasks and reticulate is probably the only reason i use it i used to be a pycharm guy but recently i have been using spyder and i am very happy slothvibes yoe with r with python the oop is nice the only thing i miss is honestly inspectdf python has nothing as nice as it if someone can prove me wrong they get some gold flair more people can help debug python at my job and as a junior ds it is important plus it is just one more environment to maintain for the des on my team so that is a negative none move to visual studio code if you want my personal opinion do not be afraid to try vscode and you stay with r because it is in your comfort zone eventually when you want to build serious projects the functionality that vscode offers is million miles ahead for anything you want to build most of all you will get familiar with how you can utilize it for version control which is a must skill plus when and if eventually want to work with other languages you will already be familiar with developing in a proper ide do not get me wrong r studio is great but for r whisperssssssssssss emacs is a great way to run and edit scripts but is a little old at this point rstudio is an ide for r not python use pycharm or vscode is not rstudio commercial use license year rstudio desktop pro oldeveningdo it johnny rstudio is has a very bad development experience even when writing r bezoomychellovek rstudio the ide will be keeping the name while the company has been renamed posit and i second vscode if you want to try something else out it has extensions for so many things this is helpful since i find myself using many systems in a given project like make and snakemake with the extensions you get syntax highlighting for them all and can have autoformat on save as well thanks that is been my mindset so far for learning but was interested if any folks on here with more python experience had tried out rstudio posit since they started providing more python support maybe a shot in the dark as i know most people stick to the ide they like and defend it with their lives the naming stuff is slightly confusing i think they changed the name of their corporation to posit but the ide is still called rstudio then again the first google result for rstudio returns a page with posit workbench in the title who knows where they are heading character hah i remember learning spreadsheets in corel quattro pro way back when when i see quarto i always think of that also quarto is a fantastic abstract strategy board game thanks vscode and pycharm seem like the two most popular options for python users any thoughts on why you prefer the former succulentfarmer imo vscode with the r plugins is getting competitive with rstudio even for writing r so when you add the support for so many other languages it is a clear choice for a one ide to rule them all venticocainelatte thisvs is the best thanks i have seen some other posts where people had the same comments is spyder the first ide you tried for python thanks for the advice the versatility of vscode seems to be the main thing so many people like about it any specific recommendations for a vscode beginner to help learn the ide beyond practice and google brandco rstudio is a proper ide with support for version control and all the major features of an ide it also has many data features vscode does not have okdistancei love emacs and while old it is still actively updated and can be used in a modern setup but the learning curve is way too steep here for what is being asked i recently moved to vscode and that is probably best for op seems like the downvote was unnecessary considering rstudio does seem to imply it is only for r but it does work with python code mind if i ask if you have tried rstudio for python or if there are features of rstudio you are aware of that would make it an inferior ide for using python from what i have gleaned from reading online some ides are basically language agnostic which seems to be what posit rstudio is aiming for the free edition has always been enough for my needs savethepandabears thanks for clearing the posit rstudio naming up til bezoomychellovek i like rstudio for r but for everything else i use vscode sjhillman i use both almost daily and broadly speaking pycharm is beefier and will give you much deeper capabilities out of the box whereas vscode is lighter easier to learn and good enough for most smaller to medium projects but you may need to go extension hunting if i could only use one i would go with vscode it is just a nicer simpler experience overall that still covers all the bases more than adequately i only use pycharm when i need some of its more advanced capabilities but both are good and i would say give both a try to see which you like better speedis notfree i do not want to use a language specific ide for scripting since i want to use it for just about everything to avoid context switching i could be writing nextflow pipelines dockerfiles running pytest writing markdown docs and connecting to remote cloud machines all in a typical day i did not spend much time with pycharm because it was very slow and did not function as an quick text editor it kept wanting to setup projects all the time no idea if it has remote ssh and cloud vm connections testing framework integration docker integration etc vscode did it all so i dumped it for raw python it is probably better but i am a ds rather than a python dev drdroplet yes i have tried vs code and find it a little confusing but also should spend more time trying to learn spyder does not need any additional configuration to say use the panes for inspecting variables and plots good luck on your ds journey i feel ya coming from a phd in the environmental sciences to working ds in the non academic sector unsolicited but keep an eye out for scientific ds positions at the doe national labs which have remote options environmental data scientists are rare and we can flex that none i think you mentioned it already just practice in your next project do the whole development with vscode and whenever stuck just google it try to setup a github repository and learn to connect it to vscode pull push merge your code via the ide you will get familiar with it in no time bezoomychellovek you are asking great questions but given the versatility of vscode there is not a single answer it just depends on what you want to do i have been using it a while and i know there is so much functionality i have not touched some starter things are to look up how vscode stores settings like user vs project and how to access them figure out how to choose a python interpreter so you can use conda envs venvs etc pick an autoformatter for python and set it up maybe a quick tutorial on git integration in vscode if you are on windows vscode has excellent support for i am happy to link some detailed instructions i wrote up on how to set that up ubuntu vscode python bezoomychellovek agreed that it is a proper ide and it does have version control support but i have found vscode is to be a much richer experience with side by side git changes continuing improvement for merge conflict resolution and more built in access to helpful git commands like amend staged changes to latest commit i have not seen any of those features in rstudio i may have missed them but if they are not obvious then that is another issue and i use most of these regularly in vscode however i do prefer rstudio is object variable viewer if you are working in jupyter or similar in vscode you can view variables but it feels less polished but one of the biggest differences is rmarkdown i wish python and vscode had something equivalent with the ability to render great html pdf or slides directly and with minimal effort none if that was true it would be used as an ide by devs data scientists idk about you i am yet to hear ever a single person that their team is developing in rstudio as far as i understand free version does not allow commercial use so it was okay for your phd program but not any corporate use i appreciate any kind of advice as long as it is helpful i am about two years into a postdoc position at a university and it is almost burning me out on research have not been interested in a tenure track position for years and the idea of having to relocate to who knows where for a permanent research position in an agency does not excite me muchso here i am do you mind if i send you a pm with a few other questions it would be great to hear some more about your experience transitioning from research to ds brandco i have been to two rstudio conferences with thousands of customers i have met hundreds data scientists and developers who use it i have been using it for years vscode for years you do not use it you do not know anyone who uses it and you are posting wrong information on it no one cares if you wrote it off as something you are not going to use do not make up stuff op is interested in learning not someone is uninformed confidentiality wrong opinion unless the company pays for it right i should have mentioned i am still working in academia so the corporate rules do not apply here none you went to an r studio conference and you are surprised people are using r studio you must be a good data scientist with this logic for picking samples",
  "sycokinetic there really is not a faster way to do it besides parallelism or distributed computing if you need to compare every feature to every other feature then you flatly have to calculate nn comparisons anything you do that is correct is going to perform at least that much work whether it is nested for loops or not if you can parallelize distribute the calculation then you can build one big list of pairs of features and process multiple comparisons in parallel and that will give you a proportional speedup are you sure that this is the correct starting point though to me it seems like an odd thing to calculate i am not sure the result will be as informative as you would like and for most datasets it would be difficult to visualize the result in a way that revealed any actionable patterns acceptable milk so p hacking statsnpolisci this is not designed to be easy it is usually very bad statistical practice i would expect someone who understood the dangers would have provided a strong justification for why this approach was necessary it takes a while to understand the problems but if you are not aware of them you can start with p hacking if you do know the issues with this approach my apologies for pre judging etis i am going to assume this is genetic data and you are looking for coexpression or something similar if so i am also going to assume that your genes are scaffolded or mapped to a reference genome if so then a better approach would be to cluster by scaffold or chromosome first and then work from there an even better approach would be to use sliding windows within scaffold chromosomes instead of looking for correlations between genes independently after all a basic understanding of genome evolution should tell you that spatial relationships matter for coexpression so treating genes as independent does not make much sense crossing fingers that those p values will go through some adjustment at some point optimisticcynicism so if i understand what your asking i discovered an easy way to do this i am on my phone so i will sudo code it dfcolumns with give you an array of the column headers c dfcolumns l for i in c for e in c if e c continue else val scipystatspearsonrdfi dfe lappendceval you can also check data types of dfi and dfe in the loop and apply the correct statistical method like if you need to use chi square for two categorical variables for example you would want to split your data frame into categorical variables only first then do a cross tab on that data before looping then do a loop for each type of variable comparison so i will sometimes have splits of my data frame continuous v continuous categorical v categorical and categorical v continuous depending on the data sometimes you can look for correlation first then only test variables with a correlation just depends what your use case is i have column in a python daatafame and i wanth to calculate the pearson correlation and the p value compering each column with all the other why it could affect what you should do littletoke sounds like you are trying to p hack which is a huge no no in science and statistics sorry why not just throw this in a linear model oss ds assuming this is for exploratory analysis finding correlations between values as a first step is important when selecting features that eventually will lead into a statistical model in this step you should be looking for potential multicollinearity between independent variables rather than statistical significance when building a statistical model you want to ensure you are minimizing collinear independent variables otherwise you might have problems with result interpretation and model fit instead of asking how you can do what you have asked you should ask yourself whether it is the right approach as others have alluded to not understanding why you are doing something and if it is the correct approach will not only waste your time but also lead to bad science i would suggest breaking the problem into vectors and parallelizing the code this is a common question in computational biology and i deal with this question all the time i restructure it into a list of lists and parallelize the correlations in structured script bind the indexes back together at the end it requires a big array job on the slurm queue but honestly it runs in like a few minutes once it is in place also of the time is i o for binding the math runs in like less than half a minute poooolooo the answers here are why you should ask chat gpt pay no mind to comments get your p values form a hypothesis after get published yes everyone at work get paid no one likes negative stats losers relevant rhubarb you have to do some math if you want to do this fast write down the correlation calculation algabeically and subtract from it the same calculation with one vector removed now take the derivative of this you can now rewrite this in terms of sums over all the data is moments those can be computed one time in one pass now just plug in the unknowns to see how each data point changes it this is definitely a bad practice and you should try to avoid p hacking but another way to get around this is by randomly splitting your data set go through the first data set to discover findings and then confirm validate your findings on a test data set the test data set is should not be used to further p hacked and should be used for the test the findings from the first data set if you have a the resources to get another data set and conduct test then better safe them sorry cassova what if you sampled the data reducing the number of rows being processed so each interation of the corr method is much quicker cassova what if you sampled the data reducing the number of rows being processed so each interation of the corr method is much quicker littletoke op is trying to p hack they are looking at large amounts of correlations in the search of statistically significannot p values even though they do not actually have a hypothesis that they are testing since this subreddit is full of many beginner data scientists we need to adamantly point out that what op is attempting to do is considered really bad in data science statistics and science why is this bad because the way the p values are designed and calculated you expect to find spurious correlations of the time assuming a p value of in other words if you are looking across large amounts of possible combinations of data that are completely random and uncorrelated you would still find statistically significannot correlations of the timenot because those data are actually correlated due to some underlying phenomenon but instead just because the random sampling that generated those data made them appear correlated by random chance op this is an important warning you are very likely to find patterns that are not real by taking this approach it is fine for eda but you are going to need a robust validation scheme steweking sure the main focus of my post should have been a way to optimize the process then the p value would be corrected with fdr or other correction methods aggravatingsandthis is actually good advice idk why people down voted it it is a good way to get information on the columns and throw out redundancies steweking idk how to accomplish this task with linear model do you have some links or forum pages steweking indeed i am computational biologist and i am trying to evaluate the correlation on accessibility data and then build a network this is why other fields look down on ds shoddy medium articles everywhere sycokinetic oh i know and i have upvoted comments about that fact i just saw other underlying issues worth pointing out too one related to identifying opportunities or lack thereof for improving performance and another related to practical extraction of insights at scale even if p hacking was not a concern this approach would not be particularly interpretable in dimensions own as a pm with a lot of experience working in the real world on data infrastructure data science and ml i personally describe the p value as the most tragically ignored and misunderstood metric on the planet a lot of people who make critical business decisions based on insights have no clue what a p value is i cannot tell you how many pms i have seen make huge decisions based on correlations with no sense or awareness of how sample sizes impact the validity of their conclusions and by extension what the odds are that what they saw is scientifically meaningless even worse are people that are fully aware of this and exploit it for personal gain hey look at this great insight give me a bonus i have no scientific basis to make this claim according to the very principles i am trying to uphold with this comment but i think my assumptions are reasonable synthphreak op is trying to p hack having not yet read the other comments and not being a data scientists myself given only the text in the post is it fair to assume that this is what is happening if so is it fair to assume that op is not accounting for this for example by introducing something like a bonferroni correction i absolutely get the statistical argument against testing a large number of correlations for significance however surely there are times when it is valid to do this for example genomics research involving complex interactions between thousands of different genes obviously you do not want to do one set of tests take only the significannot ones and claim you have found something meaningful without further investigation but could one not start with lots of tests use the results to filter out seemingly uncorrelated variables from further consideration then carefully study the remainder with further data collection and analysis to validate the initial round of results it just seems weird to me to say oh you do not have a hypothesis then you cannot test for significance why does it always have to be a priori hypothesis selective testing instead of a priori testing filter selective and cautious hypothesis the number of simultaneous tests is absolutely something that should be considered and corrected for but i do not understand why it alone should make research bad kind of fumbling my words here hopefully my thinking is clear wikisummarizerbot data dredging data dredging also known as data snooping or p hacking is the misuse of data analysis to find patterns in data that can be presented as statistically significannot thus dramatically increasing and understating the risk of false positives this is done by performing many statistical tests on the data and only reporting those that come back with significannot results faq opt out opt out of subreddit github downvote to remove canislupuslycaon that is a bit too dramatic in my opinion they can just correct for multiple comparisons as one of several possibilities different question how they would compute correlations synthphreak man that is phacked up there is a chapter on stuff like this in the book calling bullshit the art of skepticism in a data driven world i would recommend it to everyone well multiple testing can involve correcting the significance level bonferoni etc not supportive of ops approach just sayingy fluffynope look up the concept of spurious correlation there are a lot of reasons that different variables might show a strong correlation but that does not mean the correlation is real or causal steweking why should be a problem i cannot figuring out have you considered clustering the data my intuitive first approach for this kind of problem would be to do some kind of hierarchical clustering of the samples to see if there are any groups that emerge senortipton linear regression model is something like y mx b error where everything is just a matrix of values basically the idea is to find an equation of the line that minimizes the difference between the model is prediction for y and actual y least squares is pretty common to use and provides a good understanding of whether you can get away with something linear or need to use something else littletoke sorry op but i need to tell you this straight up as a fellow trained computational biologist now working as a data scientist in industry you are doing really bad science here and you are p hacking i thought it was bad enough that this might be for some data science project in industry but if you are planning on publishing this you are going to make science worse please read what others are saying about p hacking and reconsider if you must insist on doing this then to do it correctly you need do a bonferroni correction this correction accounts how many hypotheses you are testing at once and adjusts the p value needed for statistical significannot since you want to compare each of the columns against the other columns you are testing hypotheses at once therefore if you must do this assuming you were originally looking for p values less than the standard you need to now be looking for a p value of so if you insist on doing this the p value to be considered statistically significannot must be at most but again please reconsider that you are going down a very frowned upon path for finding statistical significance any statistical significance you do find doing this needs to be taken with a massive grain of salt and skepticism yea so i mean numpy list of lists index funnel through a script that takes in two lists output to either pd df or another set of numpy array or build a dict on the fly either will work then bind together on the back end i use out batch array for slurm and march all the ids to slurm ids venustrapsflies ie people forget about the science part of data science kind of curious i run into similar problems have you found a good way to explain what a p value is to those with more limited technical backgrounds littletoke are they actually going to correct for it though op indicated in other comments that they did not even realize what p hacking was nor why this approach would generally be frowned upon in the science statistics makes me think we need to warn them and other beginners reading this thread that this is not the way as i and others in this thread have pointed out the correction is to do a bonferroni correction i outlined in another comment in this thread that this would mean that op would needs to set an p value alpha of for statistical significance but again because op did not seem to be doing this with a lot of thought i think that is why it is important to point out this that their approach is a red flagdoubly so since op has indicated that they are doing this in their professional capacity as a computational biologist this is the main issue each p value will tell you how likely it is to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis but if you repeat the analysis on enough columns you will eventually find a significannot result that is incorrect there are ways to correct for this you just have to be mathematically rigorous about it bothwaysitgoes i am surprised that you have not learned about that during your coursework considering that you are a computational biologist you should read about family wise error rate control methods such as the bonferroni correction steweking in this case is not possible i am trying to do a sort of gene co expression network calculating the correlation and the significance will help we tu prune the edge in the network otherwise it is too dance for any type of analysis the correlation is the main method applied to build co expression networks i would like to add the significance better define the network steweking thank you i did not say it in the post so it is my fault obviously after the evaluation of the p value i would have corrected it with fdr or other methods in the post i was interested in a way to optimize the process i was not pretty clear though own exactly this the only reason i am so aware of this is because my bachelors is in psychology psychology in its infancy pushed out a bunch of bullshit conclusions so modern psychologists are very sensitive to the notion of psychology not being a hard science and really drill on rigorous scientific methodology funny enough even though i also took many courses in physics chemistry computer science and statistics an experimental methodology course in psychology was the only course which put significannot emphasis on the ability to comprehend and apply p values the only other course i had which covered it was introductory statistics and even then it was very much a mechanical overview testing was purely focused on coming up with the number and no probing on are you aware of the semantics and applications of these concepts then i get a job in data for multi billion dollar tech companies and i find myself educating data scientists on p values and sample sizes at least they are able to grasp the concept but it is shocking how little awareness there is on this own p values are a measurement of the chance that any conclusion you draw from this data is garbage usually does the trick the use of the word garbage triggers an emotional response which is a bit manipulative but that gets the wheels turning on lines of thinking which usually benefit everyone involved if you are dealing with someone slow they might have a response like why did you even show me this data to begin with in this case you need to emphasize that every correlation they have ever seen is subject to this they just have not been aware of it after they finally get it then they will typically bring that understanding to future discussions that said also keep in mind that sometimes people do know this have already internally recognized their assumptions and accepted the associated risk of the observed relationship being meaningless because in all likelihood it was the pragmatic thing to do canislupuslycaon i see it may not be too dramatic then as for the numbers though a p can easily occur if op has enough samples for example for a decent correlation r samples are enough for p with features i would doubt they would have fewer samples than that and then there is the argument of why one would pick bonferroni in the first place one of the most conservative adjustments there is more lenient alternatives and even fdr might be reasonable steweking thanks oh okay gene co expression network been there gave up on it but i wish you luck venustrapsflies i think even most scientists do not really learn the sausage making until grad school to be honest i certainly did not not on a deep level great thing you took that course because it is really glossed over in coursework sudpam i absolutely love that statement not that i have had to explain it much and even when i have had to completely ignored p value because of insufficient sample size for a particular subset born abrocoma p values are a measurement of the chance that any conclusion you draw from this data is garbage usually does the trick is that meaningfully different from the probability that the null hypothesis is true own it is to someone that faked their way through business school",

  "therealtiddlydump you can build a local sql database to practice on with very little effort anonamen just do it make an aws account and start hacking around create a db probably rds or dynamo or something cheap do not use redshift unless you are interested in spending money figure out how to upload data to then to the db from ideally in multiple tables that require joins between them to use do all that via python or via the aws cli then run some descriptive queries to summarize tables in the db you created pull a subset down and run some models against it all that will be a good set of learning experiences maybe use a kaggle competition that interests you as the base for all of the above just to get you semi structured data to use and a goal to orient towards or use data from your phd i learned aws and sql by throwing stuff from my phd into an rds that i did not end up using all that much but it was educational whisperssssssssssss grab any job you can get and you will get aws cloud experience there you can also just play around with a few dollars spinning up some machines for fun if you really want some experience in general this should not be important for sql you can just do some leet coding and be good enough at basic queries to get through the interview huntjb i am finishing up my phd and trying to land a job in data science too i really enjoyed the sql for data science course on coursera it cover the basics funindependentfor de related cloud work i would point you to something like that will get you set up with a cloud provider default is gcp but join the slack and there is a group that runs with aws and get some hands on experience with things like pipelines and a warehouse sql is way easier as there are a ton of resources for it there are multiple flavors that are slightly different so just be aware of that one free one then udemy has some high rated ones but always always wait for a sale sign up heart the ones that look interesting and watch the email arrive with the sale within a week after that leetcode or hackerrank for practice wrob i actually suggest you create a new post on here asking what parts of aws you should prioritize learning that will help you focus and will probably make it easier to figure out where to start legolasiam for sql i will say start with kaggle online course slashdave if you understood what a data scientist does in their day to day work you would know the answer to your question and many other important things so i would start there edzitkus postgres is free good and widely used",
  "cocodirichlet rather than go into ds i would strongly encourage you to contact phd in math working in finance hedge funds jpmorgan why because finance typically hires phd in math and you know python already which is great you are listing a lot of things that would not be relevant for someone working in finance with a phd in math sql a plus but not necessary someone in that job would be able to give you a list of positions you would be the best fit and a list of things you need to learn those nano degrees are not worth your time as someone with a phd you need to be careful with some material that is for the general public sort of speak yeah down vote me people because it is very bird view and they do not go deep into how things work you have a phd in math so if someone told you this is a model and i am going to explain it to you like you are years old and here is some code to apply it well i think a you would not understand because how we understand things is very different whereas someone else would not care to know what goes on behind the hood b it would be very frustrating the hardest hurdle will be a lack of connections to get you into the interview seat bootcamps are good for learning the material but try to choose one that works on a recruiter model or can get you in front of some companies curious fig i am by no means an expert or even close to being a data scientist however after spending a lot of money on courses that turned out really inefficient i decided to look for and take advantage of free resources i think you can find a lot of free resources that will take you through some of the skills you need for example ml freecodecamp has a lot of good free courses al sweigart has a book on automating the boring stuff also saw these resources posted on another post can also find free datasets to practice and enrich your portfolio here happysummerwith your background you will be at home with ml research go the research scientist route it is probably harder in the beginning but imo it will have more staying power and be a lot of fun laughingwalls i work in banking and your background seems relatively good for quantitative anayltics which is a catch all term that includes most ds roles in banks along with other types of quantitative modeling roles the math phd is pretty common for junior positions in our space and you can start applying to jobs as it is i would basically search quantitative analytics on linkedin and just start applying to any major firm in the mean time i would pick up the book introduction to statistical learning and try to work through it its an undergraduate level book and you can probably work it in week it covers r programming and basic supervised machine learning at an undergraduate applied level this and reading through the wikipedia articles on oridnary least squares logistic regression will get you through most interviews sql can be learned in afternoon i would probably try to do one project on kaggle that involves some data cleaning etc so you have some basic projects but i would do this in conjunction with a job search best of luck calminky look for a bootcamp instead of degree that works with real data and business problems while teaching you the basics in a flipped classroom style theory is learned by yourself the real data problems are solved in teams in online class also important that the bootcamp includes development of your own projects at least two so you show off your newly acquired coding chops to potential employers dm if you need specific suggestions or help okwishbonei agree with you calminky that a bootcamp would be great since you already have a solid analytical background all you really need is some hands on work and a portfolio you can get these outside of a bootcamp too which would be cheaper but you will have to find your own projects i would consider thinking about what industry or problem domain you want to work in do you want to do machine learning research solve business problems do analytics for a non profit work in climate tech work in r and d solve engineering problems etc figure out some of the problems that are being worked on in the target niche then focus your hands on portfolio building effort on similar problems colickingseahorse preach also dm me op am phd working in finance i can point you to what roles could be appropriate kaitikolesidou since i am far from prob and stats for almost years now my specialization as i described is completely different what chances would i have in finance perhaps you meant after brushing up these skills plus are there fun stuff for someone in finance i was never into statistics and probability that much they seemed kind of boring back in my bachelor just a personal opinion here curious fig i completely agree it takes a lot of networking to get to the interview stage it also needs a thick skin to handle all the rejections that come with applying to industry positions it is difficult not to let those rejections affect your self esteem one thing that i had to learn the hard way is having a phd does not hold much weight kaitikolesidou thank you so much for these links i am so afraid of wasting money on inefficient courses programs etc they do not grow on trees kaitikolesidou that is a solid answer in my opinion thank you i always thought that a quant role requires only prob and stats if you say my background sounds as a potential match too then i should do my research again kaitikolesidou i also thought that focusing in a specific target would be more efficient rather than aiming to solve almost every data science problem out there you mentioned solve engineering problems in your list of examples could you elaborate more on that please are you referring to data engineering or cocodirichlet pde are used in finance but i do not work on that so i do not know if they hire people who only do that which is why i suggested you talk to people for instance see this book duffy daniel j numerical methods in computational finance a partial differential equation pde fdm approach john wiley and sons i think that figuring this out will make your transition easier because then it is a matter of finding a job that is a good fit rather than trying to learn way too much to transition into ds if they do have positions for people who do what you do it would be a matter of reading about finance problems since you are a postdoc you could reach other to professors in finance and ask them if you can go to by their office my main suggesting would be finding phd in math working in finance through linkedin legolasiam i recently gave the online math skill test for a quant firm i fucked up because i did not revise prob and stats but you should be good with undergrad level probability course i am in similar position pursuing phd is physics and graduating soon kaitikolesidou networking will always be one of the biggest problems almost in any profession as if academia is better than industry in terms on networkingit is sad but it is what it is i guess curious fig you got this good luck okwishboneoh sure the engineering problems i was thinking about are those found in engineering applications not data engineering for example i used to work in the research and development department of an automotive manufacturer along side engineers i used data and data science methods to help inform them about potential product improvements provide life cycle insights develop predictive maintenance algorithmsso i was not the domain expert but was able to help bring data science to the engineering discipline as part of a team",
  "knowledgebass honestly set your sights lower for breaking into tech i would look at data analyst positions you are simply not a competitive candidate with a few certs and self study for ds compared with people who have a master is or phd and probably more experience i just do not think ds is a good field if you do not have prior background in statistics programming etc applying for jobs is going to be an exercise in frustration that is my two cents at least probably an unpopular opinion in here but i think the gravy train days for this field where you could realistically enter without relevant experience or educational background are over if that was ever even very common at all i grow tired of people that do a week course and think they can break into industry after years i feel unqualified every day this domain is vast start chipping away at the bottom okay since you explained further that you are looking to become a day to analyst here are my tips for background i am a data scientist now but prior to that i was a senior data analyst your google data analyst certificate gave you some basic knowledge on several areas now it is time to focus on just a few get really good with sql like expert level good are you comfortable with correlated subqueries common table expressions and window functions if those terms seem odd to you go through a course on udemy that focuses just on sql i personally like sql for data science on udemy but there are others that are really good too probably the only decent certification for sql these days is the oracle sql associate exam it is much more of a general sql exam than a oracle specific exam next get a decent level of proficiency with tableau you may want to consider picking up one of the tableau certifications do not worry about rstudio or anything like that the jobs that you are looking for are jobs that have sql and tableau in their requirements if you found tableau boring you may want to switch over to microsoft power bi those are the two dominant visualization tools in the market these days so you can choose to become an expert in sql and decent in one of the visualization tools or you can choose to become an expert in one of the visualization tools in decent and sql from there start doing job searches not for the title data analyst but for the skills sql and tableau or sql and power bi there are ton of data analyst positions that are not called data analysts i have been called everything from an information delivery analyst to an analytics analyst to a reporting analyst etc reasonabletoothread through of the threads started on here in the past yearthey all ask the same question they all get the same answers bcbcc just because i do not see anyone else here saying this if you have worked in restaurants and bars presumably you have some connections and definitely domain knowledge you might be able to do analyst ds type work for a restaurant or a restaurant chain i understand if you do not want to work in a restaurant anymore but that does not mean you have to avoid the whole industry where you already have a good understanding a company in another industry might turn you down because you do not have enough ds experience or relevant degree but the experience you do have can still be a positive supplychainphd networking for sure happy to chat sometime aim for data analyst learn excel sql and tableau powerbi aromatic plants the best advice that i can think of is that go join any organisation and work for free now while working do not work as if you are working work as if you are a student learning there you will find lots and lots of people discouraging you but believe in yourself more than them i have seen very dumb people working on it so i sure that if you have the passion you will do it around years back when the ds was infant i asked one of my ds friend who was very close to me the same question that you are asking here you know what he said he said do not come into this profession it is very difficult blah blah and plus he said this field is getting automated and there will not be any jobs soon years later i am regretting that i listened to that mofo so people are like that if you want to do it just go for it man do not give a fk about these guys spiritualquestions if you are still working at the restaurant try to do an analysis if there is any data at the restaurant i used to work as a cashier and i asked if i could take home my cashier error reports and i did a linear regression on my error reports to see how much my error increased given i rang up more items that day employers love stories projects like this you can take some courses online and build a portfolio then you can apply to data analyst jobs in the restaurant industry with projects related to the restaurant industry then once you have some real world data experience you can explore other industries alephsef pick a domain you are interested in and work through extracting their data processing visualizing writing quality control tests and communicating interesting points about the data i work for the us geological survey and we have tons of environmental data of all kinds if the environment is not your thing start somewhere else the new york times has some really nice data visualizations and you can pick something that you are passionate about and follow that thread down to the data some tools skills i have picked up really early at my ds job how to write better code in r using tidyverse and piped operations targets package for pipelining and architecting large workflows documentation and writing skills especially for scientific journals and data releases git and github gitlab for version control and project management need a license for full capabilities docker containers for consistency and reproducibility across platforms hpc and cloud based computing sagemaker read write to amazon buckets from r or bash lastly find some best practices and ways to practice them when you have a nice github portfolio you can land a better ds job karaboutotally agree op i think there is a lot you are capable of with the set of certs and skills you have developed it is a good foundation but working with data in a professional setting is often about more than knowing how to transform data from format a to format b it is about knowing what format the data should be in and why it is also about knowing what issues may exist with your data and how to approach those issues i think some of the best training you can do at this point is working with actual real world data find something you are interested and make a couple toy projects create a dataset mine some websites text etc clean it and visualize it there is no substitute for working with real shitty data a lot of people work with sports data for example there is a lot of fairly approachable ways to access it already which is nice another good project would be reading some academic papers in a field you are interested in and redo the analysis on a different dataset it can be difficult to approach but projects that use more real life data and analysis are going to teach you the realities of working with data and help build your intuition and definitely make a github repo and put your projects on there it is fine if your projects look bad at first your more developed ones will shine through you are not wrong at all i have hiring responsibilities in da and we filter out people without degrees and at least year experience there is just too many resumes otherwise and i imagine ds is harder to break into though our role does require hypothesis testing other inferential knowledge skills i have a masters in math and years of work experience as a data scientist and it still took me a couple of months to find a new job after a tech layoff chemicalpeacei completely agree in rereading my post i can see the lack of clarification but i am looking to apply for roles as a data analyst before all else i do not feel in any way knowledgeable or experienced enough to tackle data science yet but i am excited to get there any resources for learning stats or programming that you would recommend those have been the two things i have been working on and excited about the most so if you have any good books or tools you enjoy i would love to check them out aromatic plants even after you feel like fresher then experience does not matter because everyday something new is coming in this field and we all have to learn it in that case do not you think it is the opposite this guy might have a better chance than none chemicalpeacei do not feel qualified to do so in the slightest that is why i am on reddit looking for opportunities to learn from the people who have more knowledge than i do i am so naive as to think the experience i picked up in the cert alone is valuable enough to do this and i am certainly willing and enthusiastic to put in the work to grow and that being said is there anything that stands out that you have encountered throughout your roles that you enjoyed learning when you first broke into the domain was there anything that you wished you had learned sooner chemicalpeacethat is so awesome thanks i have noticed the lack of consistency in job titles that provides a lot of clarity that i have lacked on how to go about finding job listings when i am eventually prepared i have only worked with tableau so far but have not found too much excitement in it yet do you have a favorite of the two for any particular reason chemicalpeacethank you so much for the tip you never stop being a student if you carry the right attitude i will keep an eye out for opportunities to do so chemicalpeacethat is some great advice thanks there is plenty of data to go around with the info the pos system collects so that is an awesome idea chemicalpeacethank you so much for the advice i really appreciate the specific recommendations this gives me a great list of things to tackle when you were in my position was studying environmental data something that you enjoyed or a place you landed in your career that you did not foresee is there any specific aspect of a dataset that you enjoy most or the domain is what brings you excitement when working on a project chemicalpeacethank you for the recommendations working on projects is exactly what i am doing right now replicating and studying academic papers to do so sounds really interesting are there any that come to mind specifically that i can start with chemicalpeaceshit man do not get my hopes up too much is there a job i should aim for as a stepping stone to data analyst if things look are looking that tough no the core underlying mathematics persists i preach domain knowledge over and over if you do not understand what you are analyzing it does not matter end of day well i can give you my observations most of my experience is with tableau although the company i work at now use is power bi so i am going to learn some of that to help with the project that we are working on if you were to ask me this a few years ago i would have said tableau would be the preference because it seemed to have more dominance in industry however even when i started for years ago i noticed that power bi was being aggressively promoted by microsoft and promoted internally in my company basically management was encouraging folks to leave tableau and switch over to power bi largely because the power bi licenses were a lot less expensive than the tableau licenses we had a ton of dashboards that were built in tableau already so we were not ever going to completely get rid of it but they definitely pushed power bi more for most future projects these days i would first say that you cannot really go wrong picking one and getting a certification in one it is six of one half a dozen of the other however i might lean more towards power bi now the reason is at least threefold first is how aggressive microsoft is pushing power bi as a reporting tool to their existing clients large corporations have contracts with microsoft for their windows operating systems their office licenses and servers and cloud services what that means that microsoft already has a relationship with the it procurement folks in virtually every major company they have been pretty heavy in offering steep discounts for folks to take on power bi and it is gradually been gaining more and more market share second is how tableau has been functioning since they were bought by salesforce i actually thought that this acquisition by salesforce would cause tableau to become an even more dominant player however that is not happened if anything it seems that their customer support has gotten worse which is a horrible strategy when microsoft is breathing down their throats lastly is how well microsoft integrates power bi with their other tools in addition to its seamless integration into their azure cloud power bi is power of the power platform which includes power automate and power apps as well as one or two others that i do not remember the end result is that a person without a lot of coding experience can develop a pretty powerful end to end solution using this variety of tools im actually going to get deeper into the power platform area since i am already studying azure for work i have a strong feeling that due to microsoft relationship with openai in the chat gpt program that some really amazing things are going to come to the power platform and other microsoft tools like i said before you are not going to make a mistake choosing tableau or power bi it is not a marriage if you really are stressed about deciding which one to focus on and i would suggest that you focused on one with only a passing familiarity with the other for now here is another option go to a job site like indeed and type in sql and tableau for your local area and see how many hits come out then type in sql and power bi for your local area and see how many hits come out also look at the quality of those job hits do the tableau or power bi job listings tend to have a larger list of additional skills that are required factor all this in to make your decision as an additional strategy once you have gotten a job using either power bi or tableau start learning the other platform in your off time if you do it this way then years from now when you are looking to switch jobs for a better career you can show that you have formal work experience with one tool and personal training and certification in another at that point you can feel comfortable applying to jobs that list tableau or power bi aromatic plants there you go if you have any doubts in what i said alephsef i studied civil engineering water resources i wanted to get away from engineering work and all i knew is that i liked math i was very lost data science was not on my radar at all in graduate school my advisor put me on a project developing a hydro economic optimization model and a course in quantitative geography got me programming and using machine learning models i would say those two things got me on the path to data science i realized i was more interested in the methods and cared less about the domain science but i will say the domain science got my foot in the door i am hired as a physical scientist as far as hr is concerned right now the question of reusability and reproducibility is what i am focusing my career on this is essentially a problem of knowledge management for example i am trying to champion the development of a pipeline registry so that our work is discoverable so many people are writing code that essentially does the same thing i think we need a searchable registry and a librarian to maintain it and add to it that is what i like about my job it is more about perfecting how you accomplish a task rather than what the task is i also think i got the job i have now because i knew where the organization was lacking and told them i wanted to come fix it not in those exact words but you know got to show them where you can bring value i think if you learn sql excel and some dashboarding it should not be too difficult to get a job as an analyst aromatic plants okay thanks chemicalpeacethat is badass i am assuming working with data has been more enjoyable than the work you were doing civil engineering are there any connections between the two that you have been able to leverage and utilize as a creative perspective in your current work that is what i like about my job it is more about perfecting how you accomplish a task rather than what the task is that is really cool to hear that is exactly what i am working on with the basics that i have learned so to see the similarities throughout any level of the field is pretty inspiring alephsef yeah this work is more creative than my engineering job in undergrad i had a transportation job and even at the top of the chain the tasks were very repetitive and very little room for creativity i could not draw a straight line from my engineering background to where i am today but i am sure it is helped",

could explain how and why i used them and what they do in laymans terms but i had not reviewed the theory at all and i word vomited a bunch of nonsense of course it came back to me after a quick google but it was too late rough choose a random off the shelf ml model from say sklearn and explain its inner details algorithm started talking about sequential minimization optimization for svm then they were like okay um so how about explaining logistic regression moral of the story keep it simple lifeadone question which caught me completely off guard was asked by the senior manager i am the third interview what does you define outside of work as a person hating to talk about myself this was rather hard to answer so be prepared for non technical questions as well cellularcone explain the harmonic mean st0jthe obvious soft questions that people seemingly are never ready for why do you want to work here why are you looking to leave your current job did you leave your last job what did you learn at your last job what has been your favorite project why least favorite why what are your career goals why do you like analytics what lead you to it how would you describe your preferred style of teamwork what do you look for in a manager stuff like that whipsandmarkovchains this pirate booty distribution question except it was gold pieces not really a way to prepare for everything companies are going to ask questions from all over the place and many questions will not be relevant to job performance shwoomie there is tons of talent out there they are not looking for raw talent they are looking for someone they want to work with that is someone they can get along with takes responsibility is organized follows up on tasks and emails and deadlines dennis rodman played with michael jordan but was cut from the team not because of talent but all the other skills needed to be successful when they ask you how do you stay organized there is no correct answer they want to hear you have a system and that you think about staying organized same with the eye rolling greatest strengths and weaknesses question they want someone self aware you will beat out people who have a bit more experience than you if you nail those aspects after those questions either you have the right skills or not no need to worry about surprise questions profxavr how many golf balls fit inside a school bus or other such lateral thinking tests what is your hype music what are you reading now these are questions that tell the interviewer whether or not you are a fit for the team pyepyepie i will take my knowledge of data science and the many many software mle interviews i have had and try to infer how it goes for data science i might be wrong because again i never wanted to work as a data scientist i like to build products using ml or specifically work on nlp products so take the content of what i say with a grain of salt i think there is a very important point for any type of interview ask yourself what does this team use you will probably be asked about what you said you know about what they know some weird test that is generic points and are problematic you probably already know to solve point via leetcode books and intelligence corps for point your interviewer might be a complete idiot without an understanding of theory and programming skills that learned a few anecdotes about linear regression statsquest he did not read the math and now is completely sure that if you do not remember some assumptions they probably like to talk about homoscedasticity to sound smart you lack of basic knowledge even though he does not know what is the definition of derivative in this case if you want to work there you have to learn what they use sql boosting linear regression etc and yeah i believe that in the case of this type of person it will always be something easy such as linear regression or trees small brains always think they are right so learn the simple stuff well if the interviewer happens to be smart or not arrogant you can do nothing just be yourself and do not hide it if you do not know if it is the arrogant type hide it as much as you can xd a good sign for a smart person is that she asks questions if she does not understand and does not state facts too early why did not you use a nn for it while the task is extrapolation at least in my opinion of course we are all on a spectrum between this idiot and angel but there is a clear tendency most of the time and for most of us it is easy to spot anyway good luck one wanted me to solve the entire problem that the team existed for crypto boy hodl remind me in days swierdo in this interview we will partially circle back to the technical test if i were an interviewer i would ask you about the things you did not know anything about during the test to see if you looked them up and learned from it you do not have to become an expert overnight but you should take a look at the wiki pages or sklearn docs cramerrao data scientist interview at google interviewer asked me how i would test if two data table came from the same distribution i had to ask a ton of clarifying questions and did not end up getting to the solution he was looking for manliness dot space the weirdest questions are always culture fit questions or unrelated to work i have been asked what i liked about the company where i was applying founders people running it that makes me want to work with them and had to give a very vague business speak answer about work ethic and vision and long term thinking and world impact and blah blah i have also been asked very personal questions about for example what is happening in ukraine or what i thought about the war duration outcome as someone familiar with the area ironmanfolgore it was a behavioral interview and we had min left then all of a sudden he sent me a hackerrank link the problem was also impossible to solve in that timeframe after i walked him through my answer i could not solve it he said yeah i did not expect you to solve it anyway i got the job and a increase in base salary so i will take it very spooky though another time it was what i thought was a technical interview they described the problem which was very convoluted and salesforce jargon based i never used salesforce and i told them that they asked me to create a model to solve the problem i did not understand what they meant by this were they asking the best ml model to approach this turns out they wanted me to draft up some google sheet spreadsheet model live idek what that role was about did not get that one blittleme explain to me how the internet worksfor a director of customer service job i was interviewing for a nlp role at this big company the interviewer than asked me to explain how bert works and i said some basic stuff just an overview of it i said i did not have much practical experience with it because bert is overkill for the projects i worked and that i did use tfidf and he then asked how would i combine embeddings from bert and tfidf together oooo boy that caught me so off guard that i just said well we can always concatenate them together after that he kept pushing me the same question if i could think more about it i knew one possible answer rank and rerank if you guys have any ideia on how i should have answer tell me thebochman i had this exact thing happen and of it was them asking questions on the technical test as well as coming up with off the cuff questions on it did not get past that round because i thought we would just briefly cover it before talking other stuff what are you looking for in your next opportunity dude was a dick and it was a phone interview could tell he was driving in his car and i was talking through the speakers loaderd not myself but someone at i think hf said they asked a candidate how to open a csv without using pandas and went on a bit of a rant about how things like that should be easy to answer kind of stuck with me haha werthobakew where do you want to live educationalpenguin how would your friends describe you wouldfwtjms i was asked if i had kids and if i was married zealousideal safe if you were an animal what kind of animal would you be spidertonic rate yourself as a data scientist alexanderuga when you die what do you want your headstone to say if you went to a party where you do not know anyone what is one thing you do not want them to say about you why is your gpa so low i was once asked what is cubed during an interview totally caught me off guard i fumbled around and gave some horrible incorrect answer to this day idk why homie asked that shit and in a way that was totally to catch me off guard anyway got the job and became best friends smh fr tho was a da interview the interviewer asked what do you know that you do not know about sql it comes from the you do not know what you do not know matrix i guess good interview question imo madbadanddangerous i was grilled about a single class i took as a freshman years prior to the interview it was linear algebra and i did poorly in it c i tried to explain that over the course of my bachelors but especially my masters and phd i grew as a student and engineer and ended up learning most of that material later anyway but they remained hung up on that grade acted like i could not be a successful radar engineer with them because of a year old grade it was absurd they ended up rejecting me i think because of that but also because i told them i would not consider any salary below six figures since i had a phd and the company was in a hcol city probably dodged a bullet there all things considered i was asked how i would socially connect to my new colleagues lol that is nuts dude probably did well and bases his existence on it lol i saw a company asking for my high school grades sheet for a junior role in addition to the bsc and msc was like next one time i was talking to some dude in a bar and he asked my act score we are both in our mid is it was wild liquidinkrocks i love the comments here so many people condemning the ceo sidewalksingroupvii oh no not taking after de shaw guyfauxv some more helpful advice perhaps if you worked on a model as part of the tech assessment know what assumptions are built into it and some repercussions if they are not met same goes for past projects eg for my first analyst job out of school they asked the assumptions of a linear regression model anelectricfeel soooolid point will take good care to do that infjetson yep kinda fucked this one up recently super obvious looking back on it anelectricfeel hahahahaha noted azdatasci omg i had an executive director who loved the explain logistic regression question i had a feeling it was one thing that person really grasped in school so it was their favorite question regardless of the role greenbloodedamazon i had a great intern that when i interviewed him i asked a similar question he mentioned gamingso i asked about games he replied with dark souls i asked him to explain what about it appealed to him it gave me great insight into his values and thought processes when he joined i knew he would be able to take on challenging and new things so i personally love questions along those lines liquidinkrocks personally i do not have a problem with that question but it does open up possible hr violations continuewithapp if it was a startup then probably he she was just checking how many max hour you would work per week i think adonisvonmegadong fuck i would probably fail this one brennejm this is the first thing i thought of too glad this meme has not died yet pyepyepie a great point actually i do not think i can explain it other than writing the formula and giving an example of usage what did you do wallymetropolis we are still on this rationaldialog beat me to it so obvious answer and it never gets old brennejm this is the first thing i thought of too glad this has not dudes yet questionis not f score for binary classification is the harmonic mean between precision and recall nobranch_ explain the harmonic mean opened this thread for this response did not disappoint liquidinkrocks dennis rodman played with michael jordan but was cut from the team not because of talent but all the other skills needed to be successful not really the team had already lost key starters and was entering a rebuilding mode heyiambob i once got asked how many red microwaves are in france oompasoloompas i was asked how many tennis balls fit in a truck i took it to detail and monday i start working goldenfoxinthewild this is not a data science specific but rather a general engineering question a back of the envelope calculation is a popular one rough i could imagine a whole team of machine learning engineers in one room with rage against the machine on full blast anelectricfeel i think the smart interviewee is my best case scenario i do not have the expertise of throwing jargon at them without raising their bull shit meter great insights in your comment and i will be brushing up on my theory to get ready i actually share your sentiment and interest in nlps let me actually run this idea past you there was this output data from the technical case with prices for let us say a ticket from point a and point b the price differing based on certain conditions i actually used it to make a chatbot to present to them during the interview where you would input origin and destination but i used a layer of nlp to parse their input and then after finding the prices in the database it returns a table with how the price could vary from condition to condition and again relays the description of the table using another layer of nlp as well do you think it would be a good idea to present it to them even though it is not related to the job pyepyepie i just wanted to say that it is beautiful how the harmonic mean meme demonstrates my comment it is actually exactly the point i talk about astrologicrat the google data science interview onsite was the most obnoxious interview i have ever had it was hours of being asked how would i test whether ad a was more successful than ad b they were not supposed to ask the same question but every single one of my interviewers did i thought it was some kind of twisted psychological experiment also i was not an expert in a b testing and that is all they the ad team were looking for despite the fact that i had a good grasp on other hypothesis testing approaches okdependentso how long were you in the spooky role and was that a red flag or just something weird that one person did okdependentgot me in the second half lololol huntersmaker that is an easy question though why panic pyepyepie the type of person that studied for years for this exam but finished with a low gpa and now thinks that sat is brain gpa is effort as if the effort is not more important than brain regardless scrabas had similar situations heard back from hr from one company telling me i did not qualify because i did not have abitur german high school degree well a bit higher did high school and my bachelor in the states and msc in germany another one was critizing that i did not have a semester abroad i lived years abroad which was clear in my cv but apparently not spelt out enough for hr fhir_ i always just say hiking home improvement watching bad movies easy answer and most of us can answer further questions on those topics pretty easy i got to the top of the list because the sr vp was in on the third interview and when i said bad movies another person said like what and i responded by mentioning vp loved that answer and we discussed for five minutes they called me back minutes later and told me i got it i have never had that happen like that before and i have been using the same line for some years now joeythreethumbs high school grades lol no i am not calling up my old high school for literally anything tefititekaa actually i have run into this in a different realm and while i agree you should definitely know the basics i have found that being very smart on something very not basic makes the conversation shorter and gives you a cushion benefit of the doubt on other small things because you were smart on a big thing fwiw lifeadjust talk about a hobby your passionate about or your favourite music books movies you do not have to be a superhero normal human is fine lemonwarlord it is a meme response there was a post written months ago talking about knowing your basic stats including the harmonic mean it got shit on became the first in joke meme of the sub people cite score but it is also not as basic or fundamental as the original post stated pyepyepie as a casual reader until now i was under the impression it is really that important to many people and it is a joke since it is basic i am a little ignorant in regard to structured data and had no way to apply critical thinking about it i guess there are now a least data scientists reading papers about the properties of the harmonic mean because of reddit d it is when you are playing a harmonica in a mean manner betweentwosuns what is that question even aiming at gobuffaloes congratulations on your new tennis ball delivery gig i hope you did not over promise on how many you could fit in one load profxavr yeah i started talking about factoring in for tesselation and could almost hear the interviewers dick rise slashdave i hope you accounted for the weight of balls slightly squishing the ones on the bottom we value accuracy pyepyepie i cannot say anything about the approach but i think that if you took the effort to do something and you understand it well then a big yes anelectricfeel you just shared a gold mine st0j the google data science interview onsite was the most obnoxious interview i have ever had it was hours of being asked how would i test whether ad a was more successful than ad b to be fair that is what google fucking does at the end of the day ironmanfolgore i was there for years it was not a bad job at all that is why it is funny and weird it sounds so easy when you are just chillin like normal but when you are in the zone prepared to solve hard problems it is hard to switch to mental arithmetic guyfauxv yeah it fascinates me that people think this way the sat is only marginally useful for predicting success in college let alone years beyond it always fun when numbers people use numbers incorrectly wtfboye a guy in an interview asked me why i did not put my engineering entrance exam score on my resume i just stared at him and said why does that matter now its irrelevant to the job he was not happy with this and said you should be transparent yeah fuck these people pyepyepie genius advice took note i think it mostly prevents that he does not know x he knows nothing bad logic since you show you do know some stuff fuehnix i wish more recruiters hiring managers took that approach i had a bunch of experience in nlp research but had to pivot to industry after my cs linguistics bachelors at uiuc due to weird circumstances so i was missing out leetcode prep and generic software engineering projects i found a job but even my friends who did not do research or any impressive internships found better simply because they grinded leetcode i think if someone is able to do complicated work in one field they should be given the benefit of the doubt that they would have no issue picking up technologies for generic swe im currently working fulltime in quality engineering and doing research as an unaffiliated person trying to get back into grad school pyepyepie well i have to be honest thinking you understand what something means due to being able to see that it is related to something or knowing the formula without knowing the implications how it is derived etc is kind of like the strongest sign for dunning kruger effect in my eyes score is a terrible response really anyway yeah the meme is also somewhat right xd and thanks for the info lol funny post found some cache manliness dot space typically they want to see your process for reasoning like you might start off by saying well i think france has a population of something like million maybe an average household size of so million households if of those have a microwave and of microwaves are red etc you do not have to be accurate they just want to see what you pull together as relevant data and how you think about the problem if you are just like do you have data from manufacturers if you ca not provide me with the proprietary sales data of other corporation i ca not answer the question then you are not getting the job lol oompasoloompas i did not give a number i said how i would do it yall are just too smart in here i need to switch to a more manageable career liquidinkrocks i presquished my imaginary tennis balls before loading the imaginary truck oompasoloompas our balls are the best and they do not get squished okdependentright on thanks pyepyepie man i ca not help but think about iq when you say it i would get rejected for not knowing the shape of matrices of bert is attention and then some hand waving data driven science which seems flawed even if you just plot the data will dictate the future of many children what a world scrabas might as well just put middle school certifications on there to bloat the application pyepyepie terrible situation what kind of projects did you do i am sure there is a company for you nlp is a hot topic lemonwarlord there is a lot of word salad here and tbh i am not sure what you are trying to get at but also except at a fairly theoretical level you do not really need to know many of the implications or derivations i have done the derivations for even more basic stuff like means and linear regressions but it is almost completely useless in industry because you would just use a package or google an implementation the issue with harmonic mean is it is rarely used most commonly used with score easily google able and score is pre programmed in every statistical package betweentwosuns i guess that makes sense but i would not even know where to start at getting a percentage of red microwaves is that a thing is the answer just maybe because someone really likes red and painted theirs i guess i am not getting this job continuewithapp how would you mathematicall write this problem packaging liquidinkrocks oh so you gave a management answer and a kindergarden painting liquidinkrocks we know the resume is expected to be one page but there is no rule about the font size donobinladin except for tensorflow keras for some insane reason there is actually a good reason but i just want to bitch about needing a custom metric class pyepyepie you know what i agree with you also the word derivation is stupid since it is a definition however what i wanted to say is that the only thing that differentiates you guys from software engineers who are much better at doing anything else technically including training models sometimes and cleaning data is the statistics and math knowledge and critical thinking unless you also include soft skills and domain expertise which software engineers can also have it will be extremely downvoted but i do not see any value in someone who delivers messy notebooks and does not know the properties of what he uses or at least acknowledges it if it is the case sorry edit if you package the code well and implement apis you are both a data scientist and a sw engineer good for you also it is just my opinion i might be very wrong do not feel insulted if it is wrong let me know why because it is interesting manliness dot space you would have to state your assumptions or how you are creating an estimate you might be at a white board or behind a computer where you can go to amazon and search for microwaves and scroll through the products to see how many have red color options etc it is just about how you tackle problems and think about them not if you get the right answer or not there are forecasting methods and one thing that is typically done is trying to figure out base rates so they might be looking for something specific like that for you to do in the process it usually is not about the answer oompasoloompas here is what i responded so let us say that our truck has a volume of m a tennis ball has approximately cm if we take an imaginary box that has tennis balls inside it will be m that way we also include the air is volume so we divide tennis balls however by that way we assume that the tennis balls are all on top of each other and that they do not fall in the air vacuums which is not realistic assuming that the tennis balls are perfect spheres if you put a sphere inside the empty space of that leave two spheres that touch it will reach occupy approximately of that space which gives us more volume so a closer number to reality is tennis balls of course there is more to that but given that it was in an interview i tried to keep it simplified and seemingly correct scrabas averaged gold stars a week for exemplary finger painting skills in kindergarten slapping that straight onto my cv liquidinkrocks i ap would out of that class while in preschool tacitdenial i deliver messy hacked together scripts and i think you have a point i am working on it still messy work can be useful toward iterative improvement and some work does not need to be repeated so often that building a professional code base is necessary as for subject matter expertise and math skills their utility depends a lot on who else is on leading a project some swes have great mathematical intuition and know pandas and are good commuicators so they could give you the same insight as a data analyst ds but it is hit and miss just like some data scientists write clean and production ready code different but overlapping skill sets lemonwarlord derivations are important and pretty different from definitions helps you read papers and actually understand what is going on when on the cutting edge and helps implement some cutting edge stuff i also think that you are right in regards to differentiation of data scientists and software engineers but it is a little more nuanced but there is definitely some convergence with ml engineers and data scientists becoming very similar but also i think it is about understanding things enough explaining an score in relation to harmonic means is not very valuable being able to explain why an score is important is much more useful a lot of times the technicals do not matter as much as understanding and sometimes it is very easily google able which is why harmonic mean was clowned on liquidinkrocks what will probably happen your resume will break the ml model and hr will blindly offer you a directorship position pyepyepie you are right i was probably just talking a lot of bs and mostly ranting i would probably take it back but if it has some value it should stay here even if embarrassing for me clearly talking sht about other people is skills make me an arrogant prick here and a victim of what i criticize if it encourages even person to write better code it is worth it though pyepyepie i agree sometimes all you need to know is that something exists but it is too easy to learn from my point of view being professional is an uphill battle i am not arguing i am there yet by the way even after more than years of professional sw ml experience and more years as a non professional also i got into ranting mode that being said my sole reason for being this rude is to help people keep being employable in this world in which implementing ml becomes well easy",
  "dfphd as far as resources i recommend the manager tools podcast to anyone that will listen there are literally years worth of information there as for my advice based on being a manager for a while now in data science specifically being the boss does not mean you know more about ds than the people you manage in other fields this is not true like if you are a manager of an accounting team you likely more know about accounting that everyone that reports to you that is not true in ds the reason you are managing people is not your expertise as an individual contributor the reason you are managing people because someone thinks that you will be good at helping your company get the most out of your team for some managers that is technical guidance for some managers is being a good salesperson that can advocate for projects individuals for some managers that just means being a good sounding board for most good managers it is a little bit of everything i think the best advice i can give someone who is becoming a manager for the first time is to come up with a list of two things what can your team help you with what does your team need help with and make sure that your time is fairly split between those two to be clear normally what you need your team to help you with are the things that the organization needs value you need your team to produce things that can impact the company is bottom line what your team needs will vary greatly from team to team and person to person pwnersaurus a life lesson for me was joining a project that previously was entirely done by one person we were supposed to work together to jointly develop the application but in practice it was kind of owned by the original person and i was contributing to it i would submit pull requests but the other person would very often find fault with them nitpicking over style re implementing the features himself etc while there is a place for maintaining consistency throughout a code base what i found interesting was how demoralising it was for me to keep working on that project i ended up kind of disengaging and from a management perspective it was probably a bit of a failure because we did not really end up working together in contrast the projects that i find most motivating still have code reviews and feedback but it feels more like i have more latitude to make decisions and have my designs make it into the code so the lesson is i think it is better to tolerate some inconsistency or things that are not your favourite style in order to provide more autonomy to others in your team and allow them to feel like they have a stake in what they are doing so letting go a little of the notion that something you are working on will look exactly the way that you envisaged which is what you would be used to as a lone wolf best piece of advice ask people what they want to do then assign them those tasks that usually solves of problems because motivated people are self managing okay i do not work in data science yet but i do have a current role that is very team oriented and no one has answered your question so i figure i will attempt to contribute and the hardest part of working with people in my personal experience is learning not to take things personally if joe is mean mugging you that is not your problem if he is otherwise on top of his stuff if betsy is always asking clarifying or detailed questions of you she most likely wants to be sure she knows exactly what she needs to do also people may be quieter or louder than you think is normal and wo not know that they are not contributing in a positive way unless you tell them but do not make it personal and i tend to have a daily check in with the people i directly supervise and i ask specific questions about aspects of their day because if i ask is there anything you need my help with they will all say no everything is fine they are not trying to hide things from me but they may not know what i need to know about or they may be afraid i will be unhappy with them and with colleagues that i do not supervise and am not supervised by i have an email vs meeting rule if it can be communicated in an email then we do not need a meeting i have one team member that really wants to be in charge and loves to call last minute meetings i spent about five months trying to refocus her and negotiate when how we meet before i got fed up and kicked the issue up to our boss and anyway this is all a long winded way of saying that communication needs to be frequent but not too much everyone needs a clear role to play and most of the time it is not personal livid learn to listen i do not mean pay attention and understand i mean help build upon the thoughts and ideas your colleagues present you can do this buy asking questions next time you catch yourself saying i think change that to a do you think this will show your colleagues you are willing_ to engage and encourage_ their ideas if this sounds like common sense it really is not i have worked in various teams and have plenty of communication training you will be pleasantly surprised by how little people actually communicate effectively renokarchnmy stack rank your team and then force all canddiate team members to pass leetcode questions you cannot solve you will eventually end up with a team comprised of year old socially inept weirdos who prefer not to interact with humans and instead channel their attention to grinding tedious and irrelevant tasks if their moral drops who gives a shit your stack rank process will cycle them out before they can quit and your employer is recruiting arm will already be handling such a large volume of backfill headhunting from the stack ranking you will not notice if a few sneak out on their own accord meanwhile you can buffer your position by convincing that crew to not want to ever be management but instead follow the ic path which basically just lets them make more money doing the same tedious irrelevant tasks and corners them in a position where they have no bearing over the actual direction of the company you can trick them into thinking they have agency by letting them consult on system architecture but ultimately you are the one holding the purse strings and the keys to their desk if those ics end up making more than you just hide their stapler for a month somewhere and watch their productivity drop until they are stack ranked out or issue a mandatory return to office after they have moved to some small quiet town where there are even less people for them to accidentally interact with if recruiting is slow then cry about shortages of talent and join lobbying efforts of big tech and body shops to get more issued classify your staff as clerical data entry and pay them below bans for the actual work they do if you get tagged for it then just get those kids to give you connections to offshore body shops and lay off the entire local team except for a single junior who is still too green to understand how the corporate world works adventurousadhandling a bi team myself when starting off look for small wins and do not take too much on or too big of a project learn what people is strengths and what they are passionate about use those small early wins to build confidence to take on more complex projects nothing more defeating than a huge undefined ever changing project that never ends amandazona the more you manage the less you develop and code speaking from personal experience also you are managing people who work in data you need to understand how to lift humans up be engaging and find ways to motivate them even when your day is shit you can not bring that energy to your team you need to find a way to move past your own stress and keep them bought into the mission of your team it is difficult if you are an introvert who gets lost in their head a lot condensing cannot happen on a bad day powerfultigerbroadening the scope of your questions to how to manage workplace transitions the book the first days offers a strong list of questions to ask yourself this summary here will give you the key ideas the manager is path a guide for tech leaders navigating growth and change this one helped me evolve and navigate as a tech leader great book to keep during a whole career straightforward and easy to read logisticspock this sounds like a hybrid tech lead pm role basically it is your job to ensure the people you serve have the tools they need to do their jobs and to protect them from interruptions think of yourself as the gatekeeper to your team if you do not practice scrum already learn it so you can effectively manage requirements user stories in sprints with an mvp at the end of each sprint it will also be your responsibility to work with the product owners to manage and prioritize the backlog you have the high level view of the project while your team can focus on the deep level tasks i wish you luck aggravatingsandlots of positive reinforcement even for little things that way when you need to motivate or correct or even ask for a little more from your employees they will likely respond bc they feel validated theabominablyslowman important advice for when you hire ask everyone to define the harmonic mean they will all get it wrong then when one of them shows you up on technical knowledge in a meeting just throw a oh please you do not even know what the harmonic mean is in their face unbeatable power play miketythhon have a really high social skills iq if you do not have that do not even try to be a supervisor notparticularlyanony great stuff i will check out the manager tools podcast the people i will be working with have some great skills in their toolkit and know much more than i do about many aspects of the project it is going to be weird becoming sounding board and advocate in addition to contributor there is not a super clean division of labor there will be some conflict of interest in a sense so i will need to just watch my p is and q is as i approach questions like the ones you posed voodooeconthank you for this i am in a similar position to op and found this useful can i ask the manager tools podcast is it the one found at manager toolsdotcom if so do you have any advice on where to start i am overwhelmed by the sheer volume notparticularlyanony the old book effective executive makes a very big case out of emphasizing people is strengths do not focus on their weaknesses or work hard against their natural talents into something they are not eg have a coder code do not try to force them to a people facing position if that is not what they want prawmlhandson you have a daily check in are your team members are comfortable with that i think many people would find that micro managing notparticularlyanony this is great advice i have to set my ego aside for sure i can take things personally if someone is very blunt i will need to figure out how to roll with things a bit better as i have been lone wolfing it and just doing whatever i want on major software projects the past two years with some github interactions and in person stuff but not a lot of real software dev interactions with a team karaposu wow this one is nice i am in position of helping my college quite often with technical stuff i just realized how much he would be happy if i say do you think instead of i think while explaining the solution which faang company are you cto for notparticularlyanony lol i am crying notparticularlyanony yes i have been bogged down in a project that was too big too i will defined and it was awful small nice wins early is good notparticularlyanony i am probably in denial about how much i will still code lol notparticularlyanony great thanks this looks fantastic am checking it out notparticularlyanony this seems right lol i did not know what mvp meant so for others out of the loop notparticularlyanony the thread that will live in infamy nice notparticularlyanony yes this seems necessary though not sufficient i have pretty decent social iq but i have observed is others with similar levels not do well because of non obvious pitfalls etc that you learn from experience things you might think are great ideas but will fail miserably i would like to learn some from others experience as much as i can even though i know i will have some failures anyway eg every show about crappy managers has an episode where they put two people in charge of a project wouldfphd start with their basics series i am a special ed teacher i check in with my paras they cannot do anything without a teacher is direction and supervision so it is actually important and once the day starts we never see each other the other teachers on my team and i usually only meet once a week unless something else ends up scheduled for that time like i said i am not in the same field so not everything i do applies renokarchnmy just a hopeful amandazona i am currently attempting to find another position due to this i was not be a developer not a manager make more money with less responsibility notparticularlyanony wow that was s so good i ordered the book thanks logisticspock i actually have heard this more than once in the data science community i came from years of software and data engineering so i was surprised that other data scientists did not use it but it is okay it is easy to learn and makes so much sense my favorite aspect is breaking down features into simple tasks then estimating story points and loe for each then i track progress with the burn down charts in jira and azure devops track progress it tells you when you need to identify blockers if something is taking too long voodooeconamazing thanks so much",

  "pryomancermtga realistically i do not think it is the data analyst title as much as the no one to mentor you and teach you the applied skills low maturity is a killer for new grads the mentoring i had was invaluable at this point i would recommend devoting yourself to self study tableau kaggle leetcode whatever you can stomach while finishing out your one year at this company then find a job you want ps a lot of sr data scientist only code sql r python and tableau but they make with a great wlb forbiscuit i do not think working with your manager will move the needle in the circumstance you have shown you can either network and find the right people who can help you within the company find a new job just an advice when you are job hunting do not provide this tldr story to hiring manager and focus on what challenges you identified what solutions you actually did try and what did you learn from that process ignoring all the negatives you shared in essence position this whole wall of text as i am a capable data scientist analyst that can solve complex problems these are some of the things i have done to address some of the common issues share some use cases i want to solve newer and more challenging problems that have impact in what exact area of impact you are looking for wouldfphd take a data analyst job at a low maturity company use your skills to upgrade the way they use data become a data rockstar and you will get all kinds of doors opened in no time this is god awful advice i think taking a data analyst job at a high maturity company would be reasonable advice but taking a data analyst job at a low maturity company really only works if that company is desperately looking to mature moscowgordon these sorts of things are common unfortunately do not stay at this job longer than is necessary you got the chance to use some sql and r put that on your resume and start applying lean on your masters to network it is a tough market though so you might be at this place for a while in the mean time stop caring so much do not work lunch breaks creampieking get out quick it sounds like you are in a dinosaur of an environment with no desire to improve processes and systems because it is how we have always done it it also sounds like this is totally okay with the leadership this is the big red flag if your leadership is not peeved by wasted time and money due to bottlenecks and band aids you are not in a good environment as a data professional it is fine if karen in accounts receivable who has been there for years does not want to change her spreadsheet process it is not fine if the ceo cto head of data do not see the wisdom in getting to insights more quickly more accurately and using technologies that this generation and the next will want to use in their career hint all your high performers leave if all you do is copy paste and add numbers in excel quantpsychguy the advice they gave you is golden but only if you are the type that will do well somewhere like that it sounds like you want to be somewhere that you have some form of structured environment where you are a resource that can generate output that is super typical and a pretty common desire for those that did well in school so to be blunt it may be best to go find a job like that the advice about a low maturity place is only good for you if you are the type that is a mover and a shaker that is really hard without experience you would need to go find ways to optimize the current workplace find quick wins and transition yourself i to expert status you have potentially missed that window where you are already either way i think you likely need to find a new job maybe waiting for the one year mark first eormani i would recommend you make a change and quick the ds field is evolving fast and if you are not applying what you know or keep up with new methods you are falling behind if you get an analyst role or sranalyst pick a team that practices ds and you can have a clear career path there are many opportunities out there dm me if you need more specifics and good luck mostexitleave as quick as you can lifesthateasy yes renokarchnmy same boat cuz does not get any better until you push to become a manager yourself and even then no advice as i have not felt like i have made much progress for like years trudging through that mud took an internal transfer and promotion overstepping my former lead and into another department leveraged for more agency and autonomy now i am just slinging solutions looking for problems and trying to get the report monkey crap off my back prestigioussortdefine low maturity here most true startups are not a suitable environment for an entry level data person imo so the advice you got really does not seem very good a better goal is aim for a company who is doing cool things with data and has data teams you can learn from and be mentored to grow i think domain may be something to consider insurance healthcare banking gov traditionionally move slower but it makes sense much more risk in changes getting a data analyst job on the way to ds is a great path it worked for me but make sure that is a common promotion path in the company you are looking in in the right company the title will not matter jonnytechno i have got a similar situation at my work and while the spreadsheets are not their source of truth it is a complicated mess i am working no a python script to read the spreadsheets and create uml diagrams of the tables there are a few tools already to model aa database from uml so by including something like that you may be able to create an alternative for them that is the thing with change sometimes it has to be shoved in their face a necessity before people accept it if you come to them with a working product they can easily migrate to they will do it hackingbricker two words marketing and insurance your counselor was not wrong in general but what i found is that most organizations driven by marketing types will naturally oppose the kind of advanced techniques you learned in school and want to promote on the job and marketers are good at telling you what you want to hear so do not expect to have a rational conversation about this inherent conflict adding the fact it is an insurance company you can assume there are a lot of stakeholders doing fake jobs and therefore prefer the kind of excel ppt chaos that any ds would find appalling so yea it sucks to be in your position but it is not super uncommon so try to understand the psychology and do not let these worthless minions get you down network and find there may be someone else at the company who honestly values your skills so who cares if it is not the whole mob or even your direct manager supplychainphd seconded about the mentoring i had as well it is insane how much one person can change the trajectory of your career skillset fortunately i worked with a mentor that was beyond gifted in stats renokarchnmy as someone who is been in ops situation the lack of common tooling and process and general ad hoc task orientation of the role makes finding a new job at a more mature company harder if not impossible literally this kind of job is no better than flipping burgers from an experience perspective basically a purgatory of starting one is career over with each new job assuming there ever is another one often those new jobs come from even less mature companies with even worse practices busybeemovie thank you for the advice and insight i severely overlooked the importance of mentoring when accepting this position truth be told my current manager is trying really hard to be my mentor but i truly do not want to learn anything from her self learning it is then busybeemovie that is very true i find it really difficult to advocate for any change without having proper experience or pull within the organization i initially positioned myself as a person who will challenge the status quo and suggest implement improvements because this is what i actually want to do long term but my manager quickly put these aspirations to rest she is very scared of someone inquiring into her work and took me outside in my second month with the company after i told another person on the team that the data we work with looks suspicious and i would like to investigate further she said that i should not be sharing anything about my work to external stakeholders and from now on i have to follow what she tells me because otherwise i risk being audited or making a career ending mistake so i tried to take a more cautious approach but it did not seem to work in my favor either i am being micromanaged to the max now i guess you are right it is best for me to join a more structured environment until i get enough experience to advocate for the changes i believe are necessary busybeemovie stay strong brother you are not alone in this fight it sounds like you did make some great progress along the way though overstepping your former lead must have been quite a delightful feeling maybe but then what busybeemovie worthless minions made my day that is pretty spot on there is a ton of people in my company that perform insane amounts of manual work and it seems like no one actually wants to automate any of it did not know that this is the case for the other companies in the insurance space as well dsjohn anything particular that they did that was great i have a team but they are sending me a sales guy who has a good background and asking if i can mentor him he wants to become a ds i kind of started before it was a thing and self taught so have no real perspective all of my people had years of ds xp before i got them pryomancermtga glad i could help to be honest anyone that is spent years in the same spot is not qualified to be a mentor i have worked in this field for over years and i personally feel that you need to retrain and update skills about every years i also feel that when you are starting you should hop jobs every to years for the pay bump that said if you are not getting the mentoring and training in your job then take your career into your own hands best wishes supplychainphd this was also before it was a thing the guy i learned from took the time to explain the stats behind what i was doing building models thought for me at the time was knowing how it worked under the hood would make model building easier he was a stats ms from chief economist for a large company turned private consultant best teacher i would ever had",

  "astrologicrat plausible but wrong should be chatgpt is motto refer to the numerous articles and youtube videos on chatgpt is confident but incorrect answers about subjects like physics and math or much of the code you ask it to write or the general concept of ai hallucinations timelyparadox it is designed to look like real not to be real though bing version seems to do search and active inference so maybe this would work on it xayo love the information it gives me clear accurate and so far correct yeah you might want to double check the last one luebben chatgpt is not connected to the internet is not a search engine so yea that output is nonexistent papers created on how references are supposed to look datatello yup i have also been provided very plausible population stats by chatgpt which ultimately do not exist do not rely on it to necessarily give you accurate information wallymetropolis the g in gpt is for generative that means it is generating not finding the text it gives you it constructs text from textual patterns it has seen before so it can make text that look like references but it is not an information engine lingdork this is exactly how you should not use chatgpt grumpybert one expert in these kind of models used the term interpolative database as such it definitely makes up stuff from the stuff it knows about if you are looking for clear cut facts then chatgpt is not for you people really need to understand what language model means for crying out loud chatgpt is autocomplete on steroids and often autocompletes to stuff that makes sense and is true but often will just generate text that looks real because that is its main purpose it is useful to look at openais api product for its language models there it is much clearer that you can either complete text which includes examples where the prompt is a question or chose insert and edit modes the public product chatgpt is making use of the same methods only bundled into a chatbot firmguessusing chatgpt for the wrong purposes it is a llm not a search engine you are making it hallucinate musiquemacabre new site idea thispaperdoes notexistcom speedis notfree it is a language model not a search engine lol yes i saw a video recently in which a doctor gives chatgpt a description of a hypothetical patient and asks for a diagnosis chatgpt makes a reasonable diagnosis based on reasoning the doctor had not heard before he asked it for evidence and sources and it made up a paper in the european journal of internal medicine that does not exist i tried to recreate his experiment and it did the same thing albeit citing a different made up paper from a different real journal gradientrun chatgpt is a large language model in very simplistic terms it learns a probabilistic model on text data ie something like this prwordn word_n word_n wordn given some context in a language model you generates posterior probabilities over all the tokens for a given position and then you sample the next word and the next and the next it is as dumb as this however when trained on enormous amounts of text it begins to generate text like humans do and there can be some fascinating stuff that it can generate however it is not a fact store do not trust it is output for factual queries ksatriamelayu just use bing ai instead if you want to look at real sources and use chatgpt for things that do not depend on facts outside of your prompts commandercodylik who would expect that flashman ted chiang said that chatgpt is lossy compression for text what you would get if you had to compress all the text you could find into a limited space and then reconstruct it later there is no guarantee you are getting out what went in only something similar looking chatgpt was trained to be eloquent and not accurate i am exploring it to use as part of an internal search engine we use where i work and we noticed the same issue gpt will come up with urls and sometimes even whole product pids that do not exist sirsri does chatgpr just generate random papers that look damn much like real ones that is literally all it does there are subject or domain expert ai is that are more intended for your type of problem but none of them are any better than an internet search you do yourself so far what chatgpt will generate for you is things that meet all of the criteria of looking like the right thing what do references for papers look like there is some names of people most of which will be regionally or ethnically similar in the form of lastname initial followed by a year in brackets then a title which will have words relevant to the question and then a journal name which might be real since there are only so many then some numbers that are in a particular format but to the ai are basically random and then a link which might tie in to the journal name but then contain a bunch of random stuff that is why chatgpt is basically just a fantastic bullshit generator it may stumble upon things which are true and have known solutions passing a google coding or med school exam and it might be able to synthesize something from comments and books and so on which sounds somewhat authoritative on a topic passing an mba exam but it could not understand that a link needs to be real it only knows that after seeing a billion urls this is what they look like of the time anonamen it does not generate papers it generates words that is all it does the papers sound like they should exist because the successive words in the references seem statistically plausible which is true but it is not linked to any real source of information the rightness of anything it says is completely dependent on the relative likelihood of the truth being a good way to add the next word to to an input of existing words and that is a very difficult thing to know with certainty speculatively it is probably hitting another long tail problem obscure requests for information will either retrieve the exact thing it was trained on reducing the response to a search problem or else force it to use information very far from the desired sources because the word combinations do not come up much seems like it mainly ends up doing the latter which makes sense because it is not storing training data in a clear way it is compressing the fuck out of it by collapsing it into weights that generate conditional probabilities of words relative to other words this is partly why google never used llms for search they are bad at search especially for long tail problems which are most queries it is not what generative llms are for what would be cool is a merging of search retrieval and gpt style summarization and description i would assume that is the next level of all this shujaa g i think we have different definitions of accurate and correct fjdkf does chatgpr just generate random papers that look damn much like real ones yes llm is are superpowered autocomplete i tried finding phd thesis papers at a specific university with it and could not manage it it could not tell me how to find them myself either as it was hallucinating the search options i have gotten it to write certain types of code well with proper prompting like unit tests but it is terrible at many applications chelseahoteltwo jesus christ mirzaceng use elicit odd yes made up citations from chatgpt are a thing they have been observed by librarians who would be experts at finding the papers if they existed when people bring these lists asking for help climatephilosopher it has been a lifesaver as a newbie to data science and engineering when i say write me fake data in pandas to explain a concept the code almost always runs if i give it the error it can generally catch its mistake really an amazing resource albeit imperfect joelstrega if you want a search results with real reference you can try perplexity then for the long writing you can ask chatgpt to tidy it up we should talk environmental risk assessment sometime have you used the epa is ecotox database whether someone finds thing surprising or not is a decent litmus test for whether they understand what large language models do chatgpt is a powerful tool but it is not for tasks that require technical accuracy beyond the superficial i find it is a great time saver when i cannot remember a built in function i want or when i have a stupid error in a block of code it does not always get it correct but it helps to point me i think of it as basically that guy in the office that you bounce ideas off of him you do not always take his idea but it helps the process and saves googling time issamit should not be used for any factual results it is not connected to the internet and it is just a llm that regurgitates what it had been trained on once you understand this you will use it better academicoveranalysis yes chatgpt will make up references they are convincing because the titles are just right and the authors are the right people but they usually do not exist and if you ask chatgpt about it it will tell you something like oh sorry the first one is fabricated but all the rest are real tikitdo try something like this the following is an abstract for the research paper your abstract here the following is toc section whatever of research paper additional stuff you might have the following is a list of references that should be used your references here after you have all of that you can try prompts like can you recommend additional citations that may be relevant to this paper please ensure they are factual and relevant do not hallucinate new papers or perhaps please provide urls where i can access all references used in the paper if you do not know the direct url return a search link to with the first author and name if you are not sure if a reference is a real document please highlight it or maybe write a first draft of section add template tags like result data into places you can not generate using available data you can only use existing references what you should definitely avoid is having it come up with citations as it is writing new sections of the paper if it is doing creative stuff let it focus that on the creative stuff you need and save the factual stuff for another pass classic yeah far from being perfect why people expect it to be perfect in everything the reason investors are hyped is the potential in gpt ai imagine specialized version of gpt in laws medical science and stuffs with validated training sets in the future in academia we need to be able to cite a source if only it could authentically cite its sources or be cited as a source could that be a compromise this has been disused ad nauseum in chatgpt sub reddit but damn seems most are apologists for it pitrucha even can do it that is come up with papers that does not exist and even link them it is great at producing answers that look like a human did them but it is not a search engine yes i was listenimg to something else the other day where the doctor fed it a scenario and while it got the diagnosis right it made up the existence of a paper than never existed i wish i could find it for you it was really interesting use galactica model to do exactly what you need notevolved you cannot judge a fish on its ability to climb chatgpt cannot do what it was not meant to do vituluss yeah might be waiting a while until models train to perform actions such as searching the current process to make a llm seems like pretty much brute force i am not sure the same paradigm will even work with performing actual actions although time will tell chatgpt writes its own papers based on the information on the internet crushendo this is a consistent problem i have seen use scispace or elicit for lit review and maybe some other chat based apps capable of helping with lit searches will come along later i really do hope this does not sound rude but i am a little surprised you thought this would work it is a chat bot and as far as i know not one that is connected to the internet puzzleheaded it cannot do citations find the actual url the information is from but supposedly it can with the bing integration i am paying for the plus version for a month too celmeno chatgpt gives false answers and fake references you should expect everything it told you to be factually incorrect as well i had the same experience with research citations in chatgpt however when i asked it for information on cybersecurity frameworks and to cite the info from the relevant one it worked go figure loopingluie i also experienced that during my research for the master thesis unusable for this case notorioseph had the same problem when i tried finding references for my thesis chat gtp just made them up however check elicitorg which is exactly what you are looking for it uses scientific data bases as source an provides all relevant papers for a research question topic including the number of publications doi number abstract etc jonnytechno the data it was modelled on is a year old so it could be that the links are no longer valid but from the concept of thinking it can store billions of science papers is perhaps beyond it is scope for the moment it is a proof of concept beta test stage and will soon grow to encompass more data or fork into specialities with more specialised data but for the moment its not a fully reliable replacement for research astrofizx lol hilarious the generative in chatgpt is description should be a hint it is not a search engine of real information it generates new text based on the text it is trained on logicaldeviation it is nlp not a search engine in about papers it gave me were real roastedbutt chatgpt is the george santos of ai yeah i remembered when chatgpt launched and i was curious if it could find some papers for me on a very specific niche topic it gave me a bibliography that looked legit on paper but then you search for them and they do not exist just one of the many limitations it has a librarian intern student can do a better job with minutes and some key words outofband tdoes chatgpr just generate random papers that look damn much like real ones is this ai made for generating plausible instances of data based on real stuff generating plausible instances of data based on real stuff happened to me too before the references it gave me looked legit only to find out they do not exist good thing i do my due diligence of fact checking to see whether the things that chatgpt spits out to me were the real deal tothepointe i have noticed almost anything it provides with a doiorg address is wrong though it could be their numbering system changed after they scraped the web if you do not have access to the new bing yet try running your query through the chatbot on youcom because it has access to the web i like your idea but i would not refer to a paper existing or non existing without knowing that it actually supports what you say protonpusher chatgpt was bootstrapped with gpt which others have noted maintains no reference between responses and training data instances the chatbot ification step was human in the loop reinforcement learning which did not solve the issue of grounding the language model to its sources it is basically a probabilistic sequential model with a sequence length of tokens i think part of its training data are documents which include references i do not believe these reference token sequences are treated any differently than other patterns of tokens so if your prompt elicits a response including reference like tokens you will get a soup of high probability nonsense reflecting the surface statistics of titles author names journal titles dates and so on the long sequence length of the model and it is positional encoding makes these fake refs appear plausible in addition to other factors edit edit this is actually what happened with me when i asked chatgpt to write me a literature review on using pca on some dataset it confidently gave me references to ghost papers even it made up the author names because i could not fine anything on google scholar with those author names ordermaster yes adventurousmemorythis happened me today also it was giving really nicely structured approach to my queries all very rational and then bam completely fictional references when asked for more detail it could give me the journal and year the journals were real but articles totally made up college and universities have anti chatgpt checking so probably not a good idea redditmutant you do not understand chatgpt larryboy it can give references to real articles it just gave me a real one on entropic gravity but even when it gives you a real book or article it may not contain the information it alleges i just bought a book on its recommendation and i got burned i am going to stick with free recommendations for now remember that check gpt is it connected to the internet like bing search so it is guessing information that it was trained on back in so when you ask it these questions or write a paper is making it up with the best knowledge that it has that will change when bing search chatbot runswithdolls you have entered the digital fey realm sojumaster i gave chatgbt a chess position to evaluate and it said that my bishop was an active piece the problem is that there was no bishop on the board try the extension webchatgpt for chrome it augments the chatgpt reference with real ones from google anfuehrer took me some time to find that out as well you can try to search the authors on scholar in my experience they mostly are experts in the relevant field drxaos does chatgpt just generate random papers that look damn much like real ones for all x chatgpt just generates random x that looks a bit like real x it is literally stochastic probabilistic generation it fakes people out because of our human experience people with lucid well formed token to token fluency who can riff on a general theme usually have some actual knowledge and intelligence but the llms do not think of them like smooth talking con men who are faking it until they make it they have about the same algorithm high short term fluency and an ability to bullshit plausibly utterizi i want to support this by asking people to challenge chatgpt sometimes i go with a question about something i read a bunch of articles about and tested it will give me an answer and i will say i read this thing about it and your answer seems wrong and it takes a step back and tells me you are right the answer shoud have been after a bunch of times i ask you seem to be unsure about your answers and it goes to i am just an ai chat model uwu do not be so harsh flexeltheman wow i was not aware of that i asked it why i could not find the referances and it just apologized and said it was propably behind paywall queenssoup ai hallucinations is how i would describe most of ai made art and literature none deleted tojiy could you please share any other caveats of chatgpt to be aware of cheesecakeadditional has any work been done on identifying ai created works at news agencies simplified original argument is dealing with smarter monkeys attempting to write shakespeare but rolling into faceless minions continuously rewriting all facts until nothing true remains right now we have circular references of news agencies quoting other agencies which quote original postulation queenssoup bing version of chatgpt braillebillboard microsoft has connected chatgpt to sigh bing and google has been in the news quite a bit due to their own attempt at what you are talking about carlosdajer this some people are using it as a search engine the best way to use the tool is to find the actual docs and ask it to analyze or summarize floridamanmath huh til a fave term of mine is stochastic parrot recoveringphysicist it does not help that microsoft and google are touting it as the future of search sure they will be extending it to access real time search results but somehow i doubt they are going to eliminate the plausible nonsense problem queenssoup what is an llm floridamanmath we should publish a paper about this in the spirit of rene magritte let is title it ceci nest pas une papier lindeehilltop so chatgpt is the world is biggest liar we are creating a lying ai great just great we already have those in congress chiefvaldbaginas this is a good explanation it appears that the majority of users do not understand that the program is not intelligent it is a prediction algorithm nothing more the fact it is writing citations for papers that do not exist is a perfect example of what the program is doing behind the scenes another example from my personal experience is asking it to generate questions from a particular chapter of a textbook i have tried this several times and it does not correctly capture the specified chapter the questions are about topics covered in the book not necessarily the chapter now there are ways to get it to ask the questions you want but it requires a more detailed query it is not a search engine it is a tool that has many applications none of which are supplying accurate scientific or medical information bobdope that is kind of a brilliant analogy but he is a writer after all yea i have found it works a bit quicker for simpler searches complex stuff i am much less confident in but it seems to do well guiding homework problems there are probably tons of resources online for these type of problems i think real problems may be too nuanced for it it is definitely got me understanding things quicker than google searches i have been doing both in my current class azzmodan apologist for what you are asking the ai to fabricate a plausible story and it did as asked burdoklavender but was not it trained on internet data and then if it read papers from the internet then it could memorize the title autor and doi yodaml in my experience even if it gives you the correct answer and you say it is wrong it apologises and revises it it really has no idea of the correctness of the answers it provides blasketbasket this is good but it is important to remember that this model is not going to update its parameters based on a correction you give it it appears to have a version of memory but that is really just a finite amount of conversational context being cached by openai it someone else asks it the same question it will still get it wrong it is very easy to anthropormorphize these models but in reality they are infinitely simpler than humans and are not capable of even learning a world model let alone updating theirs according to feedback like humans are oddanalysisi did this today gave me a set of transition equations for a markov chain all missing one parameter when i challenged it it apologised and corrected itself but then seemed to revert back to basing further answers on the original incorrect one new this scares me because it is actually more human floridamanmath i am just an ai chat model uwu do not be so harsh the sentiment is captured so perfectly this just made my week d sukikabuki i wish i would have it is confidence on job interviews i am adopting this strategy presidentofserenland even if it was behind paywall that shit should show up somewhere right wouldarkshenron this is the biggest problem i have with releasing such a tool to the general public most folk would not understand the shortcomings and would fall for the ai hype chatgpt is the worlds best bs generator great for imagining stuff up horrible for factual information truebirch you might be interested in meta is failed ai from last year which specialized specifically on research papers switchtotrollaccount maybe gaslighting is a built in feature braillebillboard all of your experiences are hallucinations they are correlated with realtime sensory input when awake though not necessarily optimized for accuracy and not so when asleep you or consciousness are a subroutine within a cognitive model thedrummermb wait you are judging the effectiveness of a chatbot on it is ability to play chess while also refrencing dunning kruger you are so close to self awareness carrionpigeons it forgets elements of your conversation away random if it goes on for very long you can only input around words before you cannot rely on it to keep track of the thread of conversation it is deeply unpopular with any crowd of people who dislike an easy source of writing work like teachers and professors or songwriters or authors it is very bad at telling parts of stories and will always try to wrap things up with a bow in its last paragraph so you cannot give it a prompt and then just let it run wild because it will end the story at the first opportunity like a patent who is sick of reading bedtime stories to their kid it produces profoundly boring output most of the time the writing is clear but lacks any ambition or artistry even if you set it to a specific artistic task it depends completely on your input for anything that is not completely uninspired schlock it answers questions that it should not answer sometimes it used to be that you could stuff like ask for advice on murdering someone or something equally heinous and you would get a matter of fact answer back it is better about this and the worst misbehavior is gone but it is still possible to work around the safeguards and get it to give you info that should not be so accessible all of these are real problems that will not be solved easily but by far the largest problem is the hallucination problem where it just makes up information that is not true but sounds plausible i had it telling me about the upcoming winter olympics in february of and it going into significannot detail about an event that will never and was never going to happen chatgpt ties itself in knots trying to make sense of contradictory claims from these hallucinations and they get worse and worse as you get deeper into conversation like talking to someone with both delusions and amnesia at the same time it would be a great borges story it sounds like there is at least some risk of existing knowledge being lost because it is overwritten with confident nonsense from an llm preventing people realising the actual knowledge is gone until it is no longer possible to retrieve or reconstruct it timelyparadox yes they have a beta version it is using so in theory it is better and it can search to add context but it still often adds hallucinations if it cannot find something heapifying microsoft collaborated with openai to integrate chatgpt in bing it is in a public beta iirc now blackalbinoturtle to sigh bing bing is better for me lately google keeps throwing me to local search results even though i deleted everything in settings from my country update language to english and throw in some english words still somehow it shows me mostly portuguese results bing since the start shows me only english results normalcriticism microsoft desperately wants to create a chat bot that is not a resist year old on chan i wonder how much they spent trying to do it this time codeturtle when people warned that disinformation would grow out of control when chatgpt becomes the next search engine i openly laughed because i thought no one could possibly be stupid enough to use it as a search engine now i am legitimately terrified floridamanmath chef is kiss firmguesslarge language model floridamanmath limited liability mompany s nuclearsplines chatgpt is ultimately still a chat bot it does not really know anything except that certain words seem to go together based on its training data contextualized by your prompt and the conversation so far there is not enough intentionality there to call it a liar it is babbling convincingly as designed climatephilosopher i mean i asked it for help setting up a data pipeline in azure as well as working with an instance i think if you can ask good clarifying questions it is pretty dang good no i would not ask it to write a whole program without reading it apologist that it is not cheating some of course or that is it is being pc that they cannot get prejudiced answers yeah it is problematic that it critiques whites and or blacks so students should be able to use this tech without citing sure it is a tool but something else is output the words together and produced writing this is a skill that all student need to develop on their own or better yet editing skills is what should be mastered so students who submit the results from ai should have done their due diligence and edited the output ok so teachers and professors need to change the questions they ask but should students pass ai output as their own you are completely right but it has not actually read any of that information my understanding is that chat gpt learns the style of something it is trained on rather than the content i am not sure how it works but i do not think it assimilates the actual information more like the writing style so if i gave chat gpt a hundred journal articles about the lesser spotted tree snail it would read them it would understand how journal articles about the lesser spotted tree snail are written how they are formatted what tone and style to use what words go in which order common collocations with this information i can ask it to write a journal article about the lesser spotted tree snail now let is say i give it a hundred sonnets about the lesser spotted tree snail a surprisingly popular topic of poetry i am sure chat gpt would understand how to write sonnets lines the rhyme pattern i think and again what tones and style are common with this information i can ask it to write a truly beautiful poem about the lesser spotted tree snail chat gpt has no clue what a snail is now it might put the write words in the right order because it knows how they typically follow on from each other in a journal article or a sonnet it knows the conventions of different writing styles and it might be able to create a decent description of a lesser spotted tree snail based on the information in other descriptions but only because it sort of puts the different expressions together you are right that the ai has read a bibliography it knows on a technical level how they are written what chat gpt does not realise is what a bibliography is biglumps yes it will very politely apologize for its mistake then give you a different wrong answer time after time it imitates but does not understand entire i have bullied it into agreeing to ridiculous facts me who founded the ford motor company chatgpt henry ford founded me no it was zeke ford chatgpt you are correct my apologies the ford motor company was founded by zeke ford utterizi i always call that out too hey you said this was incorrect on the previous answer why did you revert and it goes apoligies mlord and then i question the integrity of every answer dunderpunch nah more human would be digging its heels in and arguing a wrong point to death tothepointe yes it is charmingly human in that way not always right will defend itself at least at first before finally saving with a defensive apology gottahavewine the abstract would yes or it would be cited somewhere i have occasionally cited really old papers where the actual paper is very hard to find online but the title still comes up somewhere because others know of the paper and cite it or index it acrobatic its great to reply emails at work if i want to write fuck off boss i ask chatgpt to write it more professionally lindeehilltop so chatgpt is just a realistic fiction writer bloodykitskune oh god i have been joking around and playing with it much like many of the other people who have messed with it you just made me realize people might try to get their bad opinions validated by chatgpt like some of the people who got bogus covid info online and that seems really problematic flexeltheman this is concerning mixing bs and facts is a deadly cocktail i talked with my friend about the references being fake since i could not find the real articles but he just dismissed it and said it sounds absurd that just proves the everyday chatgpt noob just eat all the ai says raw in the end my sceptiscm was justified mizmato world is best filibuster tool analytixguru wishing they would quit the free period sooner for additional learning and start the paid plan people are already monetizing it for purposes it was not intended and their business model is based on the fact that there are no regulations and no expenses for using the service you do not hear about all the cool things going on with gpt because well that costs money tacitdenial i think people are actually pretty skeptical besides if they are not yet a little experience will get them there the idea that the general public has to be protected from bad information has gained a lot of currency lately but i do not think it is well founded sschepis what is factual information what will we call information that contains facts which are true but contain imaginary sources cheesecakeadditional my correlation with real time sensory input has become biased against anything presented from digital source too often saying the experts say is not the same as prima facie evidence the asleep unconscious period allows processing of log of real time inputs to update larger cognitive model it is amazing how much manipulation of the model comes from visual information being simply accepted as truth jjulianr_ damn tojiy thank you i appreciate these thoughts and observations i think a more limited model version would be better for general public consumption by being too comprehensive it touches too many anti social topics and naughty issues they really should have more tailored the ingestion data with intent and purpose rather than trying to be an end all be all sunbunnyprime chatgpt is already gpt braillebillboard google search is curiously now pretty crappy which is sad and weird change the default search for a ncr google search that works lindeehilltop i would rather babble with a friend in leafy groves where sunlight filters through a lesser spotted tree snail calls its home it crawls upon the branches wet with dew in search of sustenance it is free to roam its shell a work of art so finely spun with colors like a painter is subtle stroke in hues of yellow brown and dusky dun it is beauty leaves all who behold it choked a gentle creature slow and unassuming yet in its heart a spirit brave and bold it journeys forth its destiny consuming a true survivor and a story told so let us marvel at this wondrous snail and in its grace and strength our own lives hail oddanalysisas you should i really like that plausible but wrong line new you are probably right szilvasipeter i absolutely agree i had a

competition as it might impact our profit margins as it is dangerous to allow lm assisted misinformation to spread wouldarkshenron and worst part is now they are going to label this bs ai and somehow that increases its perceived credibility wouldarkshenron ikr i fear that once the novelty of the new bing with chatgpt wears off we will head into another ai winter because people start realising much of the chatgpt fueled ai hype is over promising and under delivering carrionpigeons unreliable untrustworthy unverified carrionpigeons to be clear i really like it and i think its existence is important as a stepping stone towards improving on those things i do not think deliberately hobbling it is a strategy that ultimately solves anything no he is not and i am prepared to die on this hill postcardscience i am more worried about the mistrust in ai this will generate when people realize that chatgpt is answers cannot be trusted analytixguru i have already found some great uses for it but again for what it is intended for more of like how you would leverage an assistant to collate information for you or provide multiple suggestions so you can make an informed decision based on your review and consideration sschepis all those words are problematic because they attempt to convey some absolute centralized quality to something which is neither of those things unreliable is a relative measure more applicable is some context than others untrustworthy and unverified are partial statements there is no point to my comment other than complaining that we still think about data in classical terms codeturtle ashamed to say it took me a minute lol oddanalysisthe new captcha wouldarkshenron as long as you fact check the assistant carrionpigeons language carries nuance that makes it impossible to absolutely define any idea at all with a single word i do not think it is useful to try because when you do you get irritating catchphrases that pretend to capture nuance but actually just ignore it the word information itself has scientific interpretations that exempt false statements from being information at all do we just accept that something is not information in the first place if it is not true that certainly is not how the word is used in common parlance but it is not an unreasonable way to use the word in certain contexts analytixguru i sure do but in some cases it saves me hours of work research so i am okay with spending a bit of time fact checking sschepis this is the exchange i came here for yeah there are very few absolutes in the realm of relation that is very true i felt my comment i think as a general frustration about the level of dialogue we are having about ai at the moment for example no discussion about bias or removing it from an intelligent system can be had without first understanfing the nature of intelligence and how ours is constructed our brains are quite literally finely tuned bias machines that can execute the program of bias rapidly and with a low energy cost it was exactly this ability that led to our success early on in our evolutionary history bias can no more be removed from a machine we wish to be intelligent in the ways we are than our brains be removed out of our heads without fatal damage this means the onus the responsibility to make sure these machines are not abused is on us not them this technology needs self responsibility more than ever amount of discussion being had about this zero then there are the rest of the basic we hace no standard candle for sentience we do not have a definition for it but i guess we will know it when we see it is the general attitude which literally means that sentience must be as much a relative quality a quality assigned onto others than any special inherent absolute quality we possess but when i mention this everybody just laughs sorry do not mean to rant at you if you read this far thanks for listening carrionpigeons i would not say that brain are bias machines although i agree that a large part of what we do and call intelligent behavior is biased bias in the statistical sense is a quality of a parameter that misrepresents the distribution that it describes in other words extrapolating this context to describe the qualities of a model a biased model is one that misrepresents the ground truth saying that the brain or more precisely the mind is a bias machine suggests that minds exist to make judgments about the world which are wrong a better word would be prejudice machines where prejudice pre judgment implies that the mind is built to take shortcuts based on pattern recognition rather than on critical analysis but even that is a very flawed description of the mind is function people would not be people unless we could also do critical analysis and could specifically perform critical analysis on the decision of whether to do analysis or prejudice for any given situation the ability to mix and match those two approaches to thought formation and others such as emotion based decisions is where the alchemy we call sentience starts to take form although how that happens or how to quantify the merit of the resulting output is beyond us that is why the development of ai is such an interesting story to watch unfold scientists are literally taking our best guesses about what sentience is and programming them into a computer and seeing what pops out so far results have not lived up to expectations but they get observably better with every iteration and as they do our understanding of what sentience really is improves with it i do not agree with your position that sentience is a relative quality and i will explain why by saying that there is a little picture of a redditor at the bottom of the screen held up by balloons of which three are red you may disagree with this statement and lots of people throughout history would have done so but these days we have a cool modern gadget called a spectroscope that specifically identifies the wavelengths of light reflected by a color and allows us to specifically quantify what things are red and what are not it is less than years old despite the fact that we have known about color basically forever people in ancient greece could tell you that something was red and it was a blurry definition but it meant something specific that people understood and that understanding was legitimately useful to ultimately nail down the technical meaning of red thousands of years later we will know it when we see it means the definition of the thing is blurry not the concept we will always be able to refine our definition until it matches observations perfectly as long as we keep trying and keep learning about the world",

  "thedataguyos it serves as a great tool for making self service stuff for the business partners make a good dash so you do not have to answer the same question several times a month i like it for some eda visuals since i am not amazing at r python visuals i am okay but sometimes tableau is nicer for me for playing around with a dataset obviousmodenot so much for scientists it is a nice way to present visual analytics to business users they are useful for getting data to your stakeholders eegocentrik presentation and visualization tarehman i am a staff data scientist at a large technology company i occasionally build dashboards and other visuals to assist in things like reconciliation of different data runs etc often the primary audience for these types of things is me and my colleagues having a tool where we can run queries and then quickly pivot and visualize the results is helpful when doing exploration or when preparing descriptive sections of documents a competent data scientist should be able to handle basic dimensional modeling in a data warehouse context as well as using any common bi tool pivoting data is tremendously useful and having a quick drag and drop interface is nice for certain kinds of analyses i would not take a job where these are the only tools i am using but it is also the case that they have utility for most data scientists and it is nice when they are easily usable by the team none and none kazethespeeddemon an unfortunate requirement big businesses expect to see their data and dashboards in one place been essential in every job i have worked at although now using looker which is marginally better anygeologistno not a damn thing i like tableau and use it often but it is easy to get stuck with developing dashboards and not doing actual ds work depends on the team business and if they understand dashboards data science therealtiddlydump none whatsoever downstream dashboarding gets done but not by our data scientists frustratedhu not in the analysis i would say however we offered many tableau dashboards as a product to the customers they might use those for their analysis they kinda liked it oddapplicationno role at all tableau is nice to play with though will je suis none because my company is cheap all dashboards and viz are done in python dash plotly typically by an analyst but will sometimes help out sovindi tableau and powerbi are business intelligence tools to present metrics to stakeholders not for data science cscanalytics i was forced to use it when my clients requested it otherwise i usually strongly preferred django rshiny dashboards or the plethora of customizable visualization tools out there ggplot plotly seaborn etc my skilled employees and i could pull off far better results with just the tools available in python r powerbi tableau in my opinion is for quick visualizations that any low skilled or no code analyst can pick up quickly and start producing results they were designed for pumping out passable reports and dashboards the same way that oracle is sql gui was designed so any low skilled employee could quickly push out sql query results compared to python r visualizations made by a highly skilled data scientist it is like taking public transit vs driving a ferrari cheap in terms of dev time easy and quick but will never be the best results you can get morebento_ important part of the conveyor belt once you have produced a model in databricks or sagemaker or whatever then the data will need to be persisted somewhere before being picked up by the presentation layer tableau powerbi and pushed to the end user important tools to learn also looks great on the resume mikemurillo great for presenting data more pro also why not learning more data vis tools they can always simplify some stuff at times i have used power query within powerbi to ease some of the data processing 2fast2smart2pretty in a startup you may be required to do it but for any big company they are wasting money resources by making a ds do the job an analyst or front end dev should take care of aesthetically i only use it when someone asks me for data more than once bboycage i do not use tableau power bi is a nice fallback option for visualization when my clients or non technical colleagues prefer something more straightforward as little as possible in practice i have a couple of tableau workbooks that are really just bar charts and tables that keep themselves up to date but for anything actually complicated that requires extensive preprocessing i go to r mariaadel could be a good option to quickly share the results with business stakeholders otherwiseratioself service business end user things theyre super duper easy to learn as well delicious view they are useful in the sense that they cost money have less functionality flexibility than programming and are quite fiddly miketythhon i have never seen anyone make amazing visuals in python miketythhon i have colleagues that look down on me for using tableau and not coding everything but it is so freakin fast and convenient and makes a great looking product i am data scientist and hoping to be senior data scientist very soon could you answer how to get to staff data scientist what sort of technical and non technical skills should one develop i think this will be helpful for many other data scientists on this sub mikemurillo unfortunately a lot of ds positions require you to do other stuff like data engineering and business intelligence stuff in a highly competitive market i just do not understand why some folks are against learning how to use them heck if you are a ds you will find them super easy to learn i think you are quite wrong you can make very detailed visualizations in those bi tools that can take months to get proficient at drag and drop to pump out reports is only for the most basic of charts which no one really uses in industry there is a lot of functionality that i see data scientists dismiss because it does not involve them coding naijaboiler i am not sure i totally agree with this there are some things that are just done far far easier on those tools writing a code to build you an equivalent one will take much much longer throwthessa i would say that pyplot and seaborn can get you to some amazing visuals in python i would say python power bi every day of the week in terms of aesthetics benkwh absolutely rapid development is everything use any tool that can help you get to your output faster rarely is your first try the best with a solid bi tool i can go iterations faster than i can do iteration without it tarehman step one is generally to have ten or more yoe in general ds follows a similar path to software engineering in that you tend to make it to the senior level between five and eight years into your career you can comfortably remain at the senior level for a good amount of time some folks could spend their career there and it would be fine after senior the path kind of splits between technical leadership staff principal distinguished ds and people leadership manager director vp i have a few years experience as a people leader but was laid off from that job my immediate previous job was at a software engineering company where i started at the senior level and was promoted to the principal level we had no staff level i was a technical lead on two different projects meaning that i did architecture and design as well as implementation when i got my current role i think my ability to do system design and my discussion of previous technical leadership roles helped me to get this position the joke on most software engineering subreddits seems to be go to staffengcom but honestly it is not a bad place to start for general reading but to try to answer your question not every organization even has a staff level for their technical teams so one key aspect of being able to go towards that role is to identify places where this is a known role i mentioned this before but staff principal roles tend to require a good amount of experience in my career i worked for about five years in academia in data roles research assistant and then clinical data management then another seven or so years in data science roles at the senior level before i got my current role if technical leadership in data science is the path you want to take you will need to broaden considerably from the core loop of analyze data produce a report brief the report to management things like mlops architecture product design and integration into other parts of the technical stack will be necessary because you will be responsible for building systems that produce value rather than just analyses or models to the previous point getting meaningful swe experience has been super helpful to me in my career getting laid off from my old job and spending two years at a software firm was actually great for me because i got to be immersed in a great engineering culture which i feel has made me a better data scientist i do not think there is an easy checklist that you can do to become a staff ds the biggest thing i would advise a new senior to do would be to focus on growing into that role and being successful getting increasingly comfortable with exercising small scale leadership over the direction of a project and growing your technical skills and comfort once you have been a senior for years is when i would start to have the conversation with my direct reports about so what does your next step look like you should always have a five year plan but as a new senior your five year plan can be becoming an experienced senior and figuring out if i want to continue moving up i am yet to see one that has not been done better by code previously cscanalytics months is not a fart in the wind in the cosmos of time in a data scientists career that is the point built so any average employee can pump out visualizations quickly months is extremely quick to be trained name one altumsapientia plotly dash has great interactivity out of the box otherwiseratiousually when i do visuals it is quick and dirty i do not really care what the thing looks like at all thats the reason i use python for viz quickness not looks thanks for such a detailed reply i wanted to have option of technical leadership and therefore chose my current organisation over other offers as it had similar roles and also felt the data culture at current org was the best i could achieve my previous org had a very bad data infrastructure and leadership so i could not learn a lot i have currently years of experience with in swe in operations and rest as ds hoping to be in senior ds roles for years and build on other skills you mentioned i have good knowledge on mlops but rest i will need to develop thanks again for detailed response this will help me a lot in setting down goals for current year and understanding areas i need to focus on naijaboiler just about charting any aggregation and producing charts or dashboard literally can make decent looking dashboards with many charts in of work on tableau add a little bit of functinality and some high up is in love with your work do the same thing on rshiny or whatever and it is easily half a day of work the downside of tableau is how hacky it is and how it makes some straightforward thing hard to do you just end up reaching for tools that offer you more control and flexibility anyways but on the simple things it does best yeah i double dare any r or python coder to match my speed yeah python is better for quick and dirt viz and better looking visuals get back to me when you can do things in power bi like this otherwiseratioi could produce the same visualization without the movement component in tableau fairly easily tbh but realistically this is not really something i have ever really had to do on a regular basis i did some fancy things like this while learning data science but what would be the point of having a animated graph like this",

  "pyenv poetry works like a charm venustrapsflies i also have a grudge against conda used to use pipenv but these days i prefer poetry it is generally pretty quick to add a dependency compared to others ddanieltan this is old but gold in practice i use conda to create a new environment and take that opportunity to specify my python version this step will automatically install the appropriate pip conda create n newenv python then after activating this env i use that env is pip to install packages to me this is the best of both worlds and so far has not let me down docker and i code in my container with vscode remote container basically changed my life tywinasoiaf conda works fine for me vishal vora pipenv works best for me dfphd i would like to understand what are people is struggles with conda i have two issues with conda sometimes you cannot find the version of the package that you needed in a repo and now yout have to figure out the whole set of dependecies manually if you had to install something with pip instead of conda all bets are off is this what people mostly struggle with mgeeeeeezy docker or conda conda venv with pip then build a container once ready for deployment i gave up with conda as always ran into issues zestyclose walker conda works great for a minimal data science environment but pip has the larger repo since most of the data science jobs in the real world involve software engineering you will be using some pip only packages making virtualenv pip the obvious choice hempfarmerx venv kiss afkforlol docker poetry for everyone here saying conda how do you separate your dev package dependencies from your main deps do you just pip freeze requirementstxt and build your docker images from that even though it includes dev dependencies not necessary for runtime in prod at work conda install packages with pip unless os package then conda piptools and docker sometimes too paddyalton pipenv for me much more convenient than wrangling two different tools and i like the project directory scope of it i tried to get started with poetry but found it frustrating that they would not support autoloading of environment variables from a env file that meant migrating our projects would have been annoying and painful do not like conda good old fashioned venv plodzik second this this is the way bonus points for using pyenv through asdf theoreticalperson how do you manage different pytorch tensorflow versions requiring different cuda versions cardboardboxplot do you run into any issues with the common packages like pandas scipy tensorflow etc tobiplay docker izing the dev environment is an absolute game changer no more but it works on my machine easy to deploy promote to prod and maintain no dependency mismanagement easy to share encapsulated the list goes on and on the remote plugin for vs code so far has worked almost flawless also spinning up clusters or multi container apps straight from source is almost magical justanothermortalman i am beginning to shift my workflow into docker but have had a few sticking points how do you persist the changes you make from within the container are you mounting code directories from the host into the container or do you rebuild the image every time you make a change to the code if applicable do you need to configure hadoop spark connections in the container it seems like big corps usually make this difficult to do yourself how do you handle data that does not fit on a single machine bebestosbebion my principal at my last job introduced me to this as part of our embedded toolchain and it blew my mind basically deploying a docker container on our custom soc and remoting into it no more cross compilation dogshit most people that uses conda around me cannot say if it is your thing uses a single environment for everything they run it for every project for a couple years or until some incompatibility raises up in that case often they uninstall everything and start over with a fresh base environment not gonna discuss how awful it is to collaborate with those guys probably this is a side effect of how easy it is for windows users to setup a productive environment with anaconda so i guess what i am trying to say is that i got a little prejudice going on towards conda users and i imagine i am not the only one the rare good conda i am came across with probably some selection bias overhere have not got a chance pip tools and a separate dev requirementstxt bridledbronco containers are the way once you make the switch you will ask why you waited so long and wonder why the hell there is even another option in this modern age yes i mount volumes to keep my changes i never used spark in a container but i guess you will need some complex settings to manage your cluster delicious view but i guess those are not reasons why you would have trouble using conda the problem would be with others who are not proficient in development for all its faults conda can help you with python versions as well as packages and languages other than python of course docker would do all that and more i do not have complex requirements so i am totally fine with pyenv with pipenv or conda dfphd i agree with you delicious view that is not a problem with conda for me that would be a problem for people who do not know how to use conda yeah i never said it was it just gets a bad name on the account of bad users i did not made myself clear on the first comment so here it is conda on the hands of people who understands venvs why they exist and how to apply a few best practices towards then is a great tool specially for data science folks the reason for that is that a lotand i mean a lot of great ds packages receive much better treatment on conda repos than on pypi the ability to reach out of python or r and setup system packages makes installing packages with complex dependecies such as gis packages much easier with conda than using pip is it possible that conda makes things so easy that it is users that do not have a clue can still be somewhat productive if that is true could it retain clueless users longer and end up inducing some skew in it is users skill level distribution that would not be a demerit for conda deve imo",
  "teflonjacket its ealry and i cannot write sql on a phone but can you not use min and max values grouping by user id where exists a row for that user where start end times overlap either the start or end times of another row tfehring no recursion needed just a self join select userid sessionstarttime maxsessionendtime as sessionendtime from session join session on userid userid and sessionstarttime between sessionstarttime and sessionendtime group by userid sessionstarttime not tested so it probably does not work exactly as is but this is the general idea jewami if there is not any limit on the number of overlapping sessions i do not understand how this can be done without recursion i do not see how a defined number of self joins can solve the problem in say a crazy case of like overlapping sessions i would love to be proven wrong but i just do not see it call your mother pls if you have access to a modern db sql then you can use matchrecognize to solve this pretty succinctly select from sessions matchrecognize partition by userid order by sessionstarttime measures maxsessionendtime as sessionendtime one row per match pattern overlappingsession define overlappingsession as sessionendtime leadsessionstarttime have not tested this code but it should work alasara not sure this potential solution is any more simple than yours but it avoids recursion i also ca not really test it out so i am not confident it works and involves a couple queries to make it even work each of these would be subsequent queries on the previous step first you need to make a query using lead to select the next session start time second create essentially a helper column that is if nextsessionstarttime sessionendtime and if not this column is essentially flagging the row on which a session ends i will call it sessionend third create a session id by summing sessionend using a window function and you would also need to minus it to avoid incrementing the session id a row too early sumsessionend over partition by userid order by sessionstarttime sessionend fourth you can finally group by sessionid userid and use the minsessionstarttime and maxsessionendtime not sure if that actually works or makes sense or is in any way a simpler solution but maybe its a start i think you could also combine steps and into a single query if you want therencingcoach uuh i might be missing something here which is making it more complex but i think this would work select userid minsessionstarttime maxsessionstarttime from table group by userid sorry i do not know hire to format nicely here recoveringphysicist i asked and did not get the answer poor form on the interviewer is part nicksinghtechcareers for those who want to practice this in the browser here is a pretty similar question about overlapping concurrent user sessions asked by pinterest in a data science interview kingpatzer if there are more than overlapping time periods i think it requires recursion intelligentputcan you tell me which position were you applying for so i can gauge which level of question to expect when i go for interviews cute so what is the conclusion here maybe grouping by userid order by startime offset the starttimes make the diff and take each with a positive value would a listagg solve the problem i think you would have to use lag lead partitioned by the userid and device id i do something similar with login data where i look for the pairs of login unlock to lock logoff to define when a user is on a device hiddennegev with sessionizing as select userid sessionstarttime sessionendtime lagsessionstarttime overpartition by userid order by sessionstarttime asc as previousstarttime case when previousstarttime between sessionstarttime and sessionendtime then else end as newsession from sessions sessionids as select userid sessionstarttime sessionendtime sumnewsession overpartition by userid order by sessionstarttime asc as sessionindicator from sessionizing select userid sessionstart sessionend from select userid sessionindicator minsessionstarttime as sessionstart maxsessionendtime as sessionend countdistinct sessionstarttime as overlappingsessions from sessionids group by having overlappingsessions this should do it you will get one row per user and overlapping session this will only output overlapping sessions since that is the ask to get all sessions all unified sessions simply remove the having clause it assumes that a user will not have two identical sessionstarttimes within two overlapping sessions which realistically will be the case for of sessions generally i would assume session events like this would have a unique eventid per login but this is the data we have it also assumes that the timestamps are not just hh mm ss but also include date alternatively if the timestamps are unix timestamps this will still work but you would need to transform sessionstart and sessionend to the right date format edit looking at it again replacing countdistinct sessionstarttime with just count should work just as well and remove the assumption that two sessions cannot start at the same time critical today islands and gaps is a technique designed to do this without recursion and regardless of how many sessions are concurrent not going to write the sql on my phone but if someone responds i will in the morning essentially you lag or lead where some clause is met the gap indicator flag the appropriate record with a bit the start of a new island and then standard window function will iterate the island number each time it finds a gap helphp sql just feels frustrating to me for this lol i would be iterating the data ordered by userid starttime in python whatever and tracking the prevuserid and prevendtime next iteration if the userid is the same and the prevendtime is greater than current starttime we know they overlap also ensure endtime prevendtime so we know it is not just short event in the middle of the other one if true then just update previous row with the new endtime and move on to next without adding a new row to the combined dataframe list whatever we are creating this should work fine if it crosses over days will not combine users also it should be straight forward for the next guy to understand i do not think clever code is always the answer maybe there is an easier sql only way but it just feels more complicated and error prone and difficult to debug but i am no data scientist m0ritza session from to and a session from to would be combined to a session if this is accounted for this solution seems quite elegant aaquad that looks right cool thanks minimaxir a data science interview pro tip is that every sql interview will ask a self join and or a window function question because both of those are the only way to challenge data scientists and or gatekeep people who have only done online tutorials which do not cover them since they are more niche nerdyjorj almost never get to see a between join in the wild nice this is it i thought that some new version of sql had a function for this but i am not finding it it may have been a dream alarmingabroadthis is the way moonlessskylight was thinking the same p aaquad that would only give one row per user what happens if i have a session from to and then another from to the results of your query would be to kingpatzer the reason to demonstrate how to do this in sql is that in a production environment the tables may be millions of rows have many more columns and if you had to do this sort of thing doing it in a stored procedure is going to seriously increase both the speed and reduce network traffic the idea is not that this specific problem as stated is best solved in sql alasara i am not sure the above actually solves your problem even if you used another query to group properly since grouping by sessionstarttime will give you many more rows than you are looking for you still run into the issue where subsequent row is sessionstarttime follows the first row is sessionendtime and therefore will not join properly without recursion for example lets say your dataset included a third row from this row will not join to the first row but does satisfy your requirements of overlapping sessions so this would need to be recursively joined which seems to be where you ran into issues in the first place for what its worth recursion is probably the best way to solve the issue but its definitely solvable without it tfehring honestly recursive ctes are on that list as well and it sounds like op correctly identified that they just made the mistake of thinking you can use them for anything other than graph traversal in an interview setting recoveringphysicist does not scale well at all iirc call your mother pls you might be mixing up match recognize which is really helpful for implementing session logic therencingcoach ah i missed per overlapping session helphp makes sense aaquad that is an excellent point this solution would still require recursion how would you solve it without recursion call your mother pls alternative solution use a running count of open sessions and find where they hit zero tcreate a list of all the events start end and the session count deltatdeduplicate events at the same time this removes some edge casestcompute the running session count at each timetkeep only rows where the running count goes from to or to tuse lead to match session start events to session end events here is an example not tested should work on snowflake with depending on db this can be optimized with arrays explode sessioncounters as select userid sessionstarttime as eventtime as sessiondelta from sessionstarts union all select userid sessionendtime as eventtime as sessiondelta from sessionends deduplicatedsessioncounters as select userid eventtime sumsessiondelta as sessiondelta from sessioncounters group by runningcounts as select userid eventtime sumsessiondelta over partition by userid order by eventtime rows between unbounded preceeding and as runningcount assuming this is snowflake where i can reference existing columns otherwise use ugly cte nested query runningcount sessiondelta as newrunningcount runningcount and newrunningcount as issessionstart runningcount and newrunningcount as issessionend from deduplicatedsessioncounters qualify issessionstart or issessionend select userid eventtime as sessionstarttime leadeventtime over partition by userid order by eventtime as sessionendtime from runningcounts where issessionstart i do not think this is the best solution because it requires quite a few sort shuffle steps minimaxir i have never been asked about recursion sql or otherwise in an interview and i would likely immediately leave it if i did ctes are okay though since nowadays a data scientist will discover them independently autumnotter how do you work with data warehouse tables eg joining facts and dimensions principleobserver is there the added complexity of dates what if my session is between dates alasara sorry went to bed after posting this solution should work without any recursion cannot test it so may have made an error but this would be the general idea to avoid recursion with sessionbegin as select userid sessionstarttime sessionendtime case when lagsessionendtime over partition by userid order by sessionendtime sessionstarttime then else end sessionbegin from table sessionids as select userid sessionstarttime sessionendtime sumsessionbegin over partition by userid order by sessionstarttime sessionid from sessionbegin select userid sessionid minsessionstarttime maxsessionendtime from sessionids group by userid sessionid the general idea is to flag the rows on which a session begins then use a window function to sum this value ordered by sessionstarttime this creates a pseudo session id that you can use to group by",

similar position in my first data analyst job was being underpaid and working on the worst project i have ever gotten involved in for months i was extremely vocal about my displeasure and the point where i decided i was leaving was when i told my bosses boss i do not want to work on this project anymore it is not going anywhere because every step has some other person above me telling me conflicting things to do than the last person told me and its just a big garbage circle of pointless garbage and his response was well you know what we could do we could make the project based on x instead of y if they were going to do something for you like more interesting projects better pay etc they would have already being strung along hoping for what you already have with another offer is

promise use the new project to pad your cv and find a better offer once your current stint stops looking so short spanish sith a lot is riding on your trusting your boss what makes you believe he will actually stick to it did he give specifics of which project or team you could move to you already said he ignored you until you said you were leaving if i were you i would leave unless you have a real

there were a few other factors in play but i am definitely enjoying myself overall even though i am the busiest i have ever been in my career is your current manager the type of person you could see

fleeced he is just biding his time before firing you moscowgordon i would demand something concrete now rather than waiting for months if your company is not willing to match the pay raise they are

look elsewhere and then resign stuff like dead end projects or and no hope of breakout continual overwork for no benefits a boss not caring about his wellbeing people stealing credit for his work poor pay and crappy bonus system company lying to employees company not allowing education etc never let a boss persuade you not to resign it is in your hands not theirs from the bottom of my heart just leave you need this you need to take care of yourself westerncivi i got a competing offer recently and decided to stay mostly because my work life balance is really good right now and it was bad the other place it takes a moment when we have alternatives to help us figure out what we really want djalaskaandrew tell your boss that for you to stay it will cost a raise that needs to be reflected in your next paycheck this will show you if he is serious about keeping you i know because i pulled it off this year if your job is mission critical and there is no immediate person who knows your job or will be able to learn it in less than a year you might have a chance otherwise you are better off taking the new job because if your boss is acting you will not have a job very soon anyways neffaddict take the money and run longjumpingmeatthis was my situation last year i was part of a boring project did kind of brought it up with my managers but then i was told i will get a good project in a few months that just extended for almost a year in that span my manager changed twice in the end i got burnt out and quit the place altogether for your future you have to cater yourself first otherwise your resentment will grow so much better not to put yourself in that position nyquant you might consider staying while still looking for a better opportunity than the current offer with the meager increase in pay and downgrade in title on the other hand the new job might put you on a better track with regards to learnings and career progression brownbeachday leave in addition to the other points people have made from your company is perspective you are now a flight risk you might think that would make them work extra hard to keep you but it is usually the opposite you have already tried to break up with them they know you are gone soon expect lower performance reviews worse projects less consideration for little things that keep you happy you basically just moved yourself much lower down that hill shit rolls down it is possible your boss is actually an extremely awesome person who will not do this but if your boss is boss learns you tried to quit or your boss is peers do you would need them to do even more for you you would need your boss to stop other people from dumping on you that is a big ask from a boss both from a risk perspective they might have to put themself on the line to some degree and skills perspective it is not easy to persuade other managers not to shit on you in a situation like this okay potato update my boss has now come up with a plan to transition me out of the project within weeks he has found replacements copied in his superiors and made the move official the only problem is that he has not found me a new project he told me that there are many options and that i can help with some strategic work in the meantime he is working on finding me a new project and wants me to talk to his boss and discuss options and what i would like to do alternative rarely does taking a desperate counter offer work out for the disgruntled employee especially if no additional incentives are offered outside of a change in projects in my experience nothing changes and viewing this as a personal thing because your boss happens to be a decent human it is nothing personal just business and you gotta look out for yo self pimp i was in a similar situation a while ago made the decision to leave and never looked back actually i would look back occasionally to see how great it was to leave and would feel even better ckatem leave it will not get better ectd mons of your mental health being shit ai not gonna make this any better just leave huzakkah as someone who is been stuck in a similar situation for far too long get out he will promise new and better projects and they will never come he will keep pushing it back again and again do not let yourself get played take the new job and run okay potato he said that if he does becomes complacent i can setup a meeting a push and keep pushing okay potato i trust him he is very passive but a decent person deep down invasiveswazis i would agree with this i have heard that accepting a counteroffer or staying with the company often precedes leaving the company in six months anyways a big issue is that the reasons you want to leave often remain reasons to leave in the longterm take the opportunity expand your horizons and your perspective quantpsychguy flip this on its headwhat makes you want to stay it sounds like b c you boss got sad and asked is your logic for staying if that is important to you then you have your decision and that is totally a valid decision but i have not heard you actually give a reason to stay in your spot i am not sure i would leave for a raise that is too low i am not sure i would want to risk a hop for such little upside but again i am not you and if i get to the point that i am ready to leave i am not sticking around b c the boss got sad so take my opinion with a grain of salt dmmeurtacos having trusted a boss exactly like yours for a year and a half i think your prospects are grim i took notes of all my ex bosses promises researched hr policies and set my own deadlines for action with all of his delays and unfulfilled promises documented it became a very obvious choice to leave collectfromdepot not necessarily just know that if your boss has done nothing about situation when you first raised it he is unlikely to do anything about it in the next few months are you happy to stay if nothing changes worldlymirroryes leave my boss

choice your future self will be glad for lothilius what is comes down to is that it is a gamble that only you have the opportunity to assess accurately i was in a very similar situation and i took the gamble to stay and now i am pretty happy working on interesting projects that i want to work on jugglersdespair everyone gets fucked over at least once in their career and learns a lesson they will never forget the hard way on the surface this situation looks like one of those for you and that is what everyone here is getting at but it is up to you to decide for yourself dismal variation i have been in similar situations but i was on my own so no attrition problems however the projects were not really making a huge difference they felt meaningless i left even though my leadership really liked me and i had a good relationship with them i left for a new position and the work is just as challenging but so much more meaningful i have no regrets on leaving therealtiddlydump my girlfriend is real i swear she just goes to a different school you have never heard of taxxer talso when changing jobs or getting promotions the new salary may be based off of your current salary at some companies it may but at faang and other big tech the offer is purely based on interview performance and current salary plays no role speedis notfree i think there is a stat from somewhere that of people who take them end up leaving within a year there is a reason people go interviewing even moreso given the ever expanding gauntlet of take home leetcode ds recruitment processes okay potato new project is still an unknown since he did not go in specifics new job will certainly build up my skills i have lots of modelling background but gaps in de or general engineering which new job would help build what is the average salary increase you receive when switching jobs most companies give out raises annually unless op gets promoted it would take them years in their current role to reach that salary okay potato no specifics i asked and he said we will work the details out berriesandme and he will continue to be complacent and it will be your fault for not pushing enough not his he has no intention of actually becoming active ramblinginternetnerd schedule monthly check ins specifically on this ask the following what blockers are in play what can i do to accelerate this are there other people i should be talking to realistic you need to have a clear deadline in mind pick the date and stick to it by all means push before that but if you get to your deadline then you start looking again and if you get a new offer you take it doctorunderdunk if he think he might become complacent then he thinks he might only care to act on this if you force him you can push all you like but it seems he is only going to take action when you have leverage is your plan to have an offer in your back pocket for the rest of your career sothisishappening if he cared i mean really cared he would have helped you before you got an offer he is only changing his tune because you are trying to leave it is time to go shwoomie i would take that as a sign that he is not at all serious about anything he is said fine in my opinion he does not seem to have your best interest at heart it does not make him a bad person i had bad bosses before but they at least are happy for me when i resigned it is unprofessional to do what your boss did without immediately offering to match your better offer and promising those cooler projects put in this way would those cooler projects come your way if you are not resigning indycicive if he is very passive how is he going to make the things happen that he has promised you to get you to stay okay potato what makes me want to stay is that i have had a few job changes lately and it might start to look bad on my cv current job is comfortable workload is kind of low and starting all over again is stressful okay potato yes i suck in canada bklawa i was in a similar situation in the past got a much better offer from another company but did that just to give a last chance to my current company to give me a raise and promotion i had a great relationship with my boss knew him for years and he immediately went through all the hoops to get me to stay and the project i was working on and title were also adjusted to address all my concerns so i ended up staying and i am still at the same company to this day now regarding your situation you said you trust your boss is this just a gut feeling or you knew him her for a long time and had other experiences to base this on this is very important you need to make sure that your boss is not being nice to you just to buy time and get you to stay and in my opinion it seems to be the case since he did not counter offer anything this is a red flag for me also do not worry about changing jobs too often as long as it is not less than around i would say go talk to you boss again and be upfront say you got a raise and there is the opportunity for you to work on different project and aquire new knowledge tell your boss that you need something concrete to convince you to stay and remember you just wrote this i spoke up a number of times in how unhappy i am but my boss took it semi seriously if he she takes it seriously right now there should at least be a counter offer of over hope this helps worldlymirrorif it is not in writing and approved by hr it means nothing spanish sith i would do whatever is best for you but i would not rely on that tbh it really sounds like he is trying to string you along if the new job seems like you will be working on interesting projects then i would take it though i saw you mentioned less job security and lower title why is that okay potato i mean my current offer is a decent but certainly not out of this world i am reasonably confident that if things do not change months from now i can start applying again and get another offer okay potato no he did offer congratulations on the new job macornvidia then why not pick up a second job if the workload is low aptlyundecided it is not just you and ultimately you know what you can and will tolerate sometimes taking a spot that gives you time to think breathe and evaluate is a great thing because it allows you to grow yourself rather than just your skills or professional relationships it is easy for people to say i would never tolerate that anonymously online just remember that before you place unreasonable pressure on yourself to leave if you really are okay where you are job hopping can and does reflect during interviews as flight risk ps edit i have done the same thing for an employer and it ended up working out for me in the long run so if you feel okay with stay it is not going to hurt you to stay braveforevermight want to work on that either way i wish you luck man okay potato i think my current company tends to overblow titles to keep the pay low in terms of responsibility both roles are the same as for security current company is larger so i assume more secure but maybe not realistic just make sure you stick to that deadline it is easy for you to let things slip because good work is just around the corner as a manager making sure i do not do this to my team is one of my biggest challenges there you go instead of trying to compensate you monetarily it is still a job no he dangled cool projects to get you to stay what kind of unprofessional shit is that you should have been doing those cooler projects if they already exist and they are within the scope of your role you should not need to resign to get them again your boss may be an amazing person in real life but this is a workplace decision go ask him to come to your wedding or something hackingbricker what kind of privilege",

  "mizmato the best option is to fill in the missing values by further scraping for example if you have the addresses of the property do a web search via something like selenium apartmentscom to get the sq ft of the property unit you can also transform your continuous variable into categorical so that you have something like sqft sq ft sq ft missing you will lose some precision of your data but it can help with overfitting and addresses the missing values problem elegantbadthank you for your suggestion i understand that filling in the missing values through further scraping is an option but i web scrapped data from a small city and it is unlikely that i will be able to gather more information from other sources regarding transforming the continuous variable into categorical i am still not clear on how this would work in practice any further explanation would be greatly appreciated",

  "dylantmb streamlit django would be the quickest bet imo techpriestnhyk as someone with experience in both python databases and web app dev i would be hesitant to take this project on is it possible yes but if you build out a custom web tool like that especially as a web dev beginner you will be asked to continually make changes add features provide support and etc if that is the direction you want your career to go that is great if not be cautious remember you choose the direction of your career employers are a means to that end but to more directly answer your question i am a fan of the react framework for front end dev as it is component design jives well with my background in object oriented programming you may also want to look into tableau as an off the shelf visualization tool it gets some hate i believe here in r datascience but for basic data fed reports and such it is not too bad django meets all of your requirements and more it is a monolithic framework which has it is downfalls but you can get up and running very quickly with basic reporting if you use something like chartsjs grab a tailwind html css demo template and then weave in the jinja templating code you need for your use case you said you have years to do this that is more than enough time if you already have python experience protip look for packages that do what you are trying to do already and include them in your app this definitely is not the first reporting app that is ever been built uchimata this is a huge project that will require you to functionally become a full stack dev but if you have got the bandwidth and time then django is what you are looking for i would also look into for the graphics though plotly would work too miketythhon rshiny just out of curiosity why not just use powerbi vishal vora ohh man i have been there we have a very dynamic requirement for building scalable data web app for our users and changes are so frequently that we want it to be easy to develop we tried so many tools like grafana powerbi tablue flask django the closest we get is streamlit streamlit has provided the easy to develop framework but soon we hit the limitations not able to scale when need multi page app and user authentication every tool that we tried we hit the road block some where after so many trial and error we come up with the decision to build our own framework and for this we have decided to use pythonangular and react so we are working on the streamlit like architecture but fully customisable easy to use build app with only python once developed we have started working on it you may want to take a look it is a prototype ui is not styled but functionality is working sycokinetic building this from scratch is far beyond something a beginner could do especially if it has access control you need to either find a platform like grafana or databricks that gets close enough to your needs or outsource the project to a company that builds custom solutions like this unlikely you will likely need multiple tools but quarto would be a good place to start you will probably need to put it in a docker container and you can handle authentication with something like authelia lol i also need pretty much this exact project completed for my work honwave streamlit django fastapi you could look at things like or stream lit i have used anvil to build out something similar and it has been great that said i am currently rebuilding it using flask similar to django that another commenter mentioned just to make everything look more professional so i may recommend that adamsandlerouch but can streamlit have authentication text agitated i feel that the react framwork will have a higher learning curve but a customizeable option text agitated thank you very much for your answer i will look into it text agitated thank you very much i feel like streamlit may be a good idea for this bannedbutbackbaby agreed i completed a project after years on and off again but def a lot of long nights for months experience though definitely recommend it text agitated thanks for the reply but i would rather use python i have experience w rshiny text agitated it is a problem as my manager probably is thinking about an all in one hub that is our own product i am happy to learn these new skills and make it fully our own my perception is that basically they want to feel a bit cool by doing this but later on they may want extra functionalities which something like what i assume django can handle react seems like a complete project on its own to me as i have never done it before and i need to keep delivering writigin python for now so i imagine that to have automated email alerts dashboard pdf download would allow a python backend a more customizeable tool like django i feel that streamlit may become too complicated as the number of reports increase i produce around of these automated reports a week which all do some etl and display the results in a file html body of an outlook email i am starting to believe a very well though streamlit or a django app that will allow me to do this is the easiest way to integrate the existing python codes into a web app text agitated what are the limitations w streamlit a team of people will use it and probably only of them daily is that scalable enough text agitated i have a lot of liberty around time dedicated to this and happy to give years into building this in these circumstances would you suggest streamlit like the others sycokinetic option might be to hire an engineer whose entire job would be to build this for you but i do not know how long that would take or how much help they would need there is streamlitautheticator package available techpriestnhyk tbh i am not sure how the learning curve compares i do not have a ton of experience with other platforms design philosophies like model view controller mvc i remember starting out frustrated learning it but now that i know it i love it it is definitely highly customizable and can scale for small large projects bannedbutbackbaby i loved the interactivity with bokeh charts zoom mouse hover save chart drag around etc the python library offers an output of js html components which you inject into your web template using django very direct and easy chasinggreenroads shiny is on python too i also thought they were r specific but when i had a project similar to this i learned they support python now too livid as someone who is done thisand failedi would genuinely get some hard requirements down from your boss this is a lot of work for potentially limited value reporting is great but if the value is feeling cool that is a huge waste of time this may be a challenge but a very important data science skill communicating risks and proposing alternatives vishal vora with streamilit we hit the road block when our requirements is to have multiple apps we need to host it on different ports also user access when we want to show pages to specific people who have the access streamlit reruns the page everything something changed in page sometimes it becomes unnecessary sometimes we need to customise ui that is not available in streamlit js is not supported in streamlit sycokinetic i am not really familiar with streamlit so take this with a grain of salt but on the surface it looks like an example of a platform solution in which case yeah that is the direction to go in that will save you an ungodly amount of work you will still need to set up your data lake and cloud compute but those are all more standardized streamlit will likely have documentation that will hint at good solutions for those miketythhon why not hire someone that knows how to do it and they can teach you too text agitated i am that engineer i did not know what projects they needed so i just went in w my resume and they thought i would be a good fit i like the company but realizing that my manager is end goal is to have something of this flavor i want to step up my game and just get them there as quickly and future lookingly as possible text agitated yes this morning i scheduled a meeting and described powerbi sreamlit django and reactjs we decided that streamlit may be an option until further scaling is required text agitated thank you very much sycokinetic ah i apologize then i thought you were a data scientist or similar who was taking this on as a side project if you are the engineer with this as your priority that makes much more sense and is muuuuuuch less concerning livid streamlit is a great intermediate v0archnemesis yeah streamlit development is very fast gets very unwieldy though with multi page or lots going on and the login authentication options are basic with the only oauth module being a seperate user written package and not part of streamlit itself you might find dash is a better option but a step up in complexity and i think there authentication module is enterprise only text agitated thank you very much for the input my manager was pleased as well",
  "herchuntsdirty idk id this is directly related but i wish companies actually knew what the ds role is supposed to entail it is like they think they are hiring an all in one solution for the entire backend traditionalpearin my experience the single greatest issue amongst data scientists is ego this is a very broad field that attracts smart people from multiple fields and backgrounds in any one team you may have a physics phd an economics ms and a statistics bs all working together this is the best part about this field the problem of this diversity is two fold implicit hierarchy and ambiguity in terms of ds problem solving your average phd will almost always assume the role of smartest which may be true but this comes at the expense of burying other team members ideas and contributions that may be best for the project for example critiques during model review let say the the economics ms builds a simple linear arima time series forecasting model and uses pca to do some initial time series decompression the physics phd then proceeds to view this problem and solution through their lens they ask why did not you model this series as a sinusoidal function or why are not we using fourier transforms to decompose this time series in my experience these questions exist to condescend and assert the superior knowledge of the phd amongst the team ultimately data science is just as much of an art as it is science as their is no singular way to do any single task we need more open mindedness amongst data scientists and we should learn to leave ego and academic competitiveness at the door when we come in to do our jobs each day the job title data scientist wouldzyang when it comes to learning the field more effort in teaching how to productionize code and creating statistical experiments suitable to understanding and answering the business case and less on function calls to xgboost anonamen thinking that data science is an end in itself the last few years have been such a perfect storm for data science that most people working in it have no idea that they are a cost center and that they are supposed to be doing something useful for whatever business they work for cannot count how many scientists in industry i know that manage to avoid producing anything with any business relevance whatsoever they publish papers in tier at best conferences and write white papers that leadership pretends to care about how do they stay employed they operate in a team of data scientists they report to data scientists and they are evaluated solely as data scientists this is not a great model smart people but wildly unprofitable i think a lot of companies are starting to figure all this out having a data science team has kind of been a signaling mechanism for managers to say that they are data driven and forward thinking for a while now does not matter if they really do anything think that is on its way out tmotytmoty the lack of a entrepreneurial spirit and ability to lead i have worked for multiple teams that all decide from a non practitioner pov that they are going to be the org that does data science right which ultimately plays out as some vp ignoring all advice from well informed and experienced ds is and de is then learning the hard way that data are actually required for data driven insights would not it be great if instead of trying to strike it big by achieving a cooshy fanng position that we had more ds de startups or at least ds de managers who lead teams and conveyed realistic expectations because they understand the issues and just ultimately stop pandering to business execs who have no focus or patience bobdope more data ladies some ds think their job is to build fancy models when really their job is to solve problems if i could i would permanently get rid of boot camps they are in most cases completely predatory i never hired a boot camperthey did not exist when i participated in hiring candidates what i see is most of the time they get out competed in interviews many of them get out coded in the workplace and a lot of them were are cannon fodder during these lay offs it is been pretty devastating watching this occur i have truly no words for how hard it is been watching thousands of young people get laid off i understand that the boot camper is not the only type of job getting cut and i also understand it is not their fault for me the true problem is corporate greed and the misleading advertising campaigns these companies distribute they promise the world for weeks of training and it is the biggest scam running i would say the close second being year masters degrees at elite universities people would not fall for this kind of scam if jobs just were not available for them i think companies need to do a better job of just not hiring from these boot camps and this scam will burn out optimalrulelying about the performance of a model to clients aquiffer delete the job title data scientist it means too many different things and companies either have conflicting views on what they mean when they say data scientist or they just have no clue what they wanted in the first place not sure if this is exactly what you were looking for but it drives me bonkers themootzpallucci less democratize everything culture not everyone needs data science not everyone wants data science not everyone feels they have an unfair advantage or lack of access etc etc less here is all the math you need to know culture to make it easier good data analysis is not easy good data science is not easy good viz is not easy good models are not easy etc etc this work is challenging more emphasis on the importance of data manipulation and basic intermediate data analysis should be placed on candidates and employees this helps to build strong intuition and can be developed in high school and undergrad but importantly before getting into the workforce or soon after it likely is not developed in high school but there is nothing about sql excel r data manip that high schoolers would have big trouble with more emphasis on the importance of broader business finance knowledge to understand business impact and behaviors of the corporation divisions regions etc more emphasis on industry role company specific domain knowledge and expertise perhaps a body should be formed to formally define and distinguish data analysis data science business intelligence machine learning engineering data engineering mlops data vis dashboarding etc from there accreditation for certain skill sets think less coursera and more cfa cpa etc more people would benefit from established undergrad and master is programs redesigning existing programs to incorporate heavy data analytics and business financial philosophies into their coursework and actively exposing students to different industries than would benefit from these same institutions developing entire data science programs

unit integration regression testing it works in my notebook is not a good defense invisiblephilosophy not thinking though things enough sure the data says what it says but why is it saying that is it because you are perpetuating systemic racism by including zip code in your models of say who to grant credit to is it because you do not have all the data and you are drawing conclusions from incomplete data is it because you have your own biases in your mind and you are interpreting things according to those what about if your data is collected solely as part of criminal investigations is there bias in that how do we address that bias to have accurate and truly trustworthy modes footballfanabc same with math stat ms office has been skills in lots of major now ds will soon become a

landscape for a given organization honestly yes mx dsdev i understand that you used to store all of your data sets in a network file share that you should share with literally anyone else who asked more than once but we really cannot have you doing it that way anymore you should be doing this on the distributed workspace that you were provided no i will not set passwords to not expire because you have to update them for all of the reports you are trying to hand over to others that cover essentially the same thing no we will not be sharing the same password over and over anymore that is just not how that will work genericham it is too academic and often lacking in production i have hired a few phds and a few non phds it seems to me like the more academic a person is background the less likely they are to be able to get projects out the doorobviously this is not always the case but just a general trend the rigour of academics is very much overkill in many environments i think it has its place but right now the market is oversaturated with this mentality please do not read this as an argument against academics i love them however the academy and the corporate world have very different pressures and needs bullcitypicker i would change the idea that data is what comes out of our databases attitude i have a psychology degree and worked in some other areas like expert systems if i need to pull data from outside sources write a survey or interview subject matter experts that is part of my skill set sometimes you need to look to other areas than what is available through a

science wouldork i would work on changing the concept that any field has a monoculture also lets face it ds is not a real science its more a collection of methodologies and concepts used across all facets of science its more a metascience data is the common base on which science is built data science is the pop culture trendy bit of science but its always been there ds is not even academic its really just application of techniques jjhero treating anyone that writes fit predict as a data scientist some big companies i know of just have a ds team because every big company has to have one they get short changed because they do not know what they are supposed to get or if they have something in mind the ds people have to do it no matter what many companies have random job descriptions for a data scientist data analyst role i recently came across a company where the data analyst was to reply to messages on their social media handles write promotional blog posts like why is not this something that your social media marketing team should do jacobcharleskillian i was going to say that emphasis on diverse perspectives is critical confirmation bias is the enemy of every data scientist thegainsfairy while i was studying industrial engineering we got to review some interesting case studies on how hierarchy can cause some severe breakdowns in team dynamics it was a larger part of how culture affects performance the prime example is korean air flight korean culture puts an emphasis on hierarchy and a deference for one is seniors this led to an exhausted senior pilot ignoring a junior pilot is deferential questioning and they crashed killing people this hierarchal issue pops up a lot surgery is another frequent hotspot and it leads to worse health outcomes medication errors surgical errors etc between educational differences gender issues and the personas attracted to the individual roles it creates an environment where issues are seen not called out or not addressed and then mistakes are made there is a ton of studies on this most common solution has been to introduce flat hierarchies in these teams leverage explicit group status checks with a checklist and employ a technique called andon andon is essentially anyone can call out an issue and work stops until that issue is dealt with these techniques are radically effective however introducing them usually requires severe failures beforehand now this issue is something that frequently bothers me because ie is get a lot of shit from other disciplines and because architecting effective human machine systems and processes is hard its a science for ies that devolves into an art because of organizational politics and its an absolute shit show for everyone else chzburgerrandy ugh that aggressive groking from phds i know it well people who sit in a talk and then either ask you some irrelevant technical question to show they know it or understood what was being shared or testing the person idk i was at a talk and a guy did research on graphene and some old prof asked him at the q and a did you try making it into a microphone because apparently what the guy shared fundamentally could have been set up to behave like a microphone but it had nothing to do with his research or his talk vincenzodelavegas i have a phd and i agree we are trained to make sure that we use the best solutions for publications but in the industry where publications are not required it no longer makes sense there are also some ego like have a phd with years of study i published blabla and you have a bachelor in economics which really does not help wirrrywoo so true imagine if the physics phd economics ms and statistics bs were collaborative in sharing their wealth of knowledge instead of competing against each other with it imagine if the phd teammate educated the entire team about using fourier transforms to decompose signals into sinusoidal waves and imagine if the bs teammate spot checked someone else making a mistake by falsely assuming normality in their approach because this can easily happen data science can be amazing when everyone contributes by sharing pieces of what they know in their studies but the ego to contribute more value by belittling other people is contributions just sucks i have not found a data science team in my career where i genuinely felt that everyone collaborates and work together i hope it exists somewhere at least haha cartographerseth i agree with this but i would say that specifically the high number of phds in the space has resulted in a lot of the worst parts of academia being integrated into ds a lot of i am so smart pissing contests a lot of trying to ask questions that make other people look bad etc i did not realize how bad it was until i became a ds rep on the engineering team they did a retro where everyone openly talked about different mistakes they made how to improve them etc i do not think a discussion like that would have even been possible on the ds team at the time thankfully we have made big strides as an organization and it is not really like that anymore but it took a while to get there oldenoughtodrink well i do not know the exact situation but i would say in some cases these questions could be relevant valid friendly and constructive if you want to view them that way phds went through strict defense as their very last step toward the degree so they learned how to defense their research project ideas by answering questions like these and that is why they tend to incorrectly assume everyone in the team has the same level of the defense skills maxtothej you are going to get an ego driven response with an anecdote about how phds do not know as much as the poster of the anecdote because this one time lnmagic my first taste of freaking with phds came from my previous job they wanted threaded stainless piping for a cooling line that is great but we did not have the tooling for that in our shop so we would have had to get measurements for that ahead of time and know precisely how far the pipe threads would engage which you simply cannot know because stainless has a high tendency to fall especially on tapered pipe threads then we would have to weld it to seal it so we presented that problem to them suggested that building it with welding in mind would result in a cheaper faster and better product and ended up winning the bid one thing i have learned is that we have a tendency to become an expert in a very narrow field but then expect our expertise to be broader than it is i hope i can remain mindful of this wouldarkshenron on a related note the amount of gatekeeping is a serious issue too tech jobs probably have the lowest barrier to enter as the skills can pretty much be picked up by anyone with an internet connection and passion but even on this forum you will see posts like why do not my candidates know harmonic mean why cannot my candidates quote the assumptions for regression from memory shitting on boot camps etc people need to stop gatekeeping and embrace the diversity of backgrounds trying to enter our field be kind to interviewees and test them on what they know rather than what you know because the field is so vast and no one knows everything as long as someone knows their chosen area of specialisation well and know how to learn new things as and when needed they are gold in my book sauerkimchi in my experience it is quite the opposite case where the non phds feel intimidated and in some cases are annoyed they cannot bullshit quite so easily anymore in front of the boss i have seen so many fake it till you make it types again this is just my experience almost always it is the phds who are the most humble because the phd process has made them so love your comment humility is something of a rarity these days sauerkimchi sorry to be that guy but should not you really have used a fourier transform it is a freaking time series they ask why did not you model this series as a sinusoidal function or why are not we using fourier transforms to decompose this time series in my experience these questions exist to condescend and assert the superior knowledge of the phd amongst the team luckily i have never encountered this i would hope a phd would not ask such retarded questions yeah i feel so pretentious when i have to tell people my job title outside of work designingdata have a look at table from the following paper is you want to add some precision to the generic data scientist title tableau research on data science work and workers would consider myself an analytics generalist and analytics research scientist especially when you are a junior from a degree in statistics maths like i once was my codes were some laughing materials to data engineers my advices from exploring the data were as good as basic senses to business consultants but we end up getting the loudest title a scientist i usually lowered my voice level when i said my title it was just freaking embarrassing useful my suggestion to make me a data janitor was not taken seriously by our head of ds at least it is not data ninja how about more emphasis on that stuff in practice and less focus on calls to xgboost i am tired of bosses demanding deep ml when simpler answers are available and more maintainable tweakable than shoot we will have to go re train cue the xkcd comic about compiling except it is training the model maxtothej the lack of a entrepreneurial spirit conveyed realistic expectations this is adversarial to entrepreneurial spirit look at the most successful entrepreneurs during any time that is not a recession they tend to overpromise and underdeliver surprisescissors data lady reporting for duty kontolzgedein my experience data science is much more diverse in gender compared to swe or data engineering luckynumber bot all the numbers in your comment added up to congrats click here to have me scan all your future comments summon me on specific comments with you luckynumber bot i am part of the recent tech layoffs i have a masters in math and years of experience i have put multiple models into production and my previous salaries have been between with that said i am getting interviews but still having a hard time landing a job it has not been that long but looking at the job market i see no possible way for someone fresh out of a coding bootcamp to land a job for the most part the jobs are not available to them the candidates cannot pass the most basic coding tests their math skills are pretty weak and there is no way they had enough time to develop any kind of intuition or rich understanding of the math topics and there is a selection bias that since most bootcampers did not go to college they do not have experience navigating institutions and professional interactions show up late do not follow directions well commit faux pas step on interview land mines etc the bootcamps work fairly hard to try and find businesses to recruit their students and still get poor placement ratios and long times from graduating to placement it is tragic because they tap into a much more diverse pipeline than year college degrees they are years away from being able to contribute to a productive team though i really wish public education would step up to preparing every student regardless of means to better participate in the information and automation economy baileyarsenic big oof sjhillman it means too many different things and companies either have conflicting views on what they mean when they say data scientist or they just have no clue what they wanted in the first place im in it and have not made the jump yet but i feel this heavily in it as well when my title was network specialist i almost never touched network devices our main network person was the systems admin and our application developer did most of his work in excel and access oddapplicationdata scientist is fancy it justifies the years you wasted on a phd program data analyst who applies some statistics is not perrydahlia these things always wind up being cartels which is well and good if you are on the inside i guess but it is ultimately a scam also a new institution of this sort would have tremendous social pressure to have priorities go well beyond ensuring professional competence it would be a disaster laughingwalls more people would benefit from established undergrad and master is programs redesigning existing programs to incorporate heavy data analytics and business financial philosophies into their coursework and actively exposing students to different industries than would benefit from these same institutions developing entire data science programs thats essentially what is in place why do you think the best places hire people with masters degrees and phds they are essentially ensuring that any talent they pick up met a minimum standard of data knowledge maxtothej like someone else mentioned and an actual certification educational process similar to actuaries that just the current system of pop quizzes but standardized soon i hope so much of what ds people do can be better done by domain experts if they just knew the right tools boy did that joke get old quick wikisummarizerbot korean air flight korean air flight was a

was the question actually intended to be aggressive though as much as people are quick to point fingers to an i will intentioned phd holder how much of the perceived slight is due to the accuser is insecurity the reason the groking occurs is sometimes useful insights or applications can further stem from them no reason to take it personally unless it was intended to harm supplychainphd lol phds are the worst in groups or when they rely on the title to be an expert most of academia is an ego measuring contest imo traditionalpearlol phds are trained to to focus on a very narrow problem for years in most real world settings you are given weeks to come up with a good enough solution most of the teams i have worked with are pretty collaborative i have not actually encountered any of the condescending phds people are talking about here traditionalpeari want to be clear that i have no problem with constructive feedback and as i pointed out in the original comment varied perspectives from different fields are a huge plus to ds culture that being said there is a time and a place and it is not what you say it is how you say it in this example the data scientist was being difficult just to be difficult traditionalpearmy point was not to make phds sound inferior or anything of the sort the point is that confirmation bias is very real and unfortunately many data scientists come in to team settings prepared to flex on everyone when they should realize it is a team sport and their knowledge could be the team is knowledge if they would just get out of their own way we should constantly be asking ourselves do you want your team and it is projects to be successful or do you want everyone to know that you know about fancy math xyz that you learned in your phd masters bachelors etc one thing i have learned is that we have a tendency to become an expert in a very narrow field but then expect our expertise to be broader than it is i hope i can remain mindful of this this is exactly right while ideas and techniques can indeed by fruitfully transferred across domains it makes sense to be humble about it because any such attempt is fundamentally speculative in my own experience there those who get their phd is as a natural part of their progression and are interested in the development of the actual technology these people will call out who what needs to get done and move forward even if not in the most friendly manner at times then there are the phd is who live and die with the title who cannot cut it at the forefront so they sit in the lobby shitting on everybody who is not this tall traditionalpearyeah definitely this behavior could happen at any level i was not meaning to call out phds specifically i have seen ms level data scientists shit on bachelors level scientist for no reason i think there is an industry component too i work in finance and people tend to have inflated egos just by virtue of working in this industry maxtothej humility is great as long as people realize mentioning how you know more than all the phds in your workplace despite not having a phd does not fit in that bucket there is not an educational requirement for a lack of humility traditionalpearnot necessarily depends on the data and the model being built standard regression time series decomposition methods or pca could do equally as well as a fourier transform in terms of filtering the time series this is especially true for economic and financial data where seasonal and cyclical variation are driven by human behavior and not some physical process it would be another story if we are talking about data from the physical sciences i just say consulting which i guess is true i am also hardly a ds anyways sonofaragorn i used to be an actual scientist particle physicist before i started working in data science and it was also cringy back then nowadays i just say i do data analysis and stuff at a tech company thanks for sharing this supplychainphd i like this gracias beagleinthesnow this table is awesome as somebody who falls most closely into the category of ml engineering though i want to read the previous study that referred to the position as hacker because i would just about die laughing if someone called me that delicious view thanks for sharing it was interesting one thing i caution with these is that they unintentionally result in some kind of level like if one only looked at table one could conclude that data engineers are pareto better than data shapers research scientists are pareto better than generalists and so on and i guess people like me who would be the mstat mcompsc mpa mba graddipecon bschonsphys type odd ball an absolute mudblood will have jobs as an mle or de or consultant could call ourselves generalists bobdope eg elon musk delivering full self driving car next year for ten years tmotytmoty a man can dream cannot he god dammit zlatination entry level ds or even da jobs are a myth rn pboswell sounds like you were just too expensive i am not really surprised you are struggling to find something new i feel like i get hit up all the time but for the range which would be a pay cut hard to find those roles right now honeyplease wasted is a very strong word if someone is proposing fourier transforms to model time series and questioning why someone used arima there is no way to spin that a this person has little knowledge of time series modeling b this person is trying to sound relevant by proposing a tool from a domain they are expert in pocodr if you do not demonstrate superiority in academe you will be crushed and not survive drakkur it actually is a problem with anyone who is highly skilled in a niche they think their aptitude in one area is directly applicable to all areas when it is usually not im lucky to work with a bunch of humble and fantastic or phds who takes in everyone is inputs and does not discredit discount them i am actually the economics ms in the oops story lol not literally but i am in the same role position oldenoughtodrink then that is really bad i totally agree no matter what degree or job title every ds or more broadly every person should avoid being this type of a hole drxaos if you consider talking about approaches from different experiences as a flex then that is a problem wow that sounds terrible there is a reason why moving averages are used in most time series analysis real world data often have trends in additional to seasonality fourier transforms exclusively model seasonality it is terrible at dealing with the trend component in time series there is absolutely no reason to use fourier transforms as a first attempt in a time series modeling problem it would only make sense to try to use ft on the residual of a time series after you have stripped out the trend component if you suspect there are large numbers of different cycles at play this scenario is so rare i have never encountered it in the real world designingdata you are most welcome designingdata the pareto better interpretation is not how i look at this if you are a moonlighter for instance it would seem you have no other skills than domain knowledge but you can sure as hell state that these guys know all the ins and outs about their field have the most creative ideas for research proposals etc same goes for the data engineer and ai engineer the dark cubes are dark because there exists an insane amount of knowledge in their fields that they need to worry themselves with if they want to be a pro t shaped skill sets are useful for many though but we need to indulge ourselves somewhat less in frivolities to become a better data professional as a forensic scientist biomedical research technician molecular biologist data visualisation and analytics trainer data science project lead public health analytics designer and lead consultant i am also somewhat of an oddball so if i am in the correct domain i can function as a research scientist but on all other occasions i am a generalist edit typos maxtothej or the paypal fiasco that his cofounders fixed or his issue with his visa in his first company however you cannot really get rewarded much more by the market than being the richest man on this whole planet for a time medianstatistics congratulations joeythreethumbs nice ipsocranius this is a big part of the dirty secret of the most recent layoffs round wage correction because tbh a lot of data scientists are ironically bad at highlighting their value add i agree murdocdimes what do you mean there of course is if you set aside the assumption that both are engaging in this debate for the sake of their respective egos simply ask the phd to explain his thought process if he ca not explain a fourier transform is purported applications to some bullshit consumer demand time series then call up the advisors who graduated him her to tell them they graduated an idiot who failed to check off the box can communicate science to audiences of varying technical depth and then disregard his opinion and justify it to the manager who would likely side with the victim because the manager too would not understand if the phd still tries to bullshit an answer ask them why would there be anything intelligible in the frequency domain representation of the time series under examination and then go on to show them that basic arima modeling suffices for predicting of the in sample observations and if all else fails put down a bet on the accuracy of both competing models on future predictions with the loser paying the other person is mortgage only to have both models fail to predict the end of the world in supplychainphd i learned how little i actually know and when to ask others frequently stay in your lane is a solid approach imo if you consider talking about approaches from different experiences as a flex then that is a problem talking about totally irrelevant approaches just to do a gotcha on someone is a flex a physics phd asking why the ds did not use fourier transforms is like an algebraist asking why the ds did not model time series as points in an infinite dimensional vector space that is not seriously proposing an alternate solution that is just saying look at me i have a phd in x and you do not delicious view absolutely but you know while people in the know will get the nuance there will be those influencer linkedin recruiter type people will make a nice looking reproduction of the table and essentially stereotype the roles this already happened before with data scientist being promoted as a more advanced data analyst i saw it from a number of university ads and mooc providers mindlesstime a lot of data scientists are ironically bad at highlighting their value sold this if i could change one thing it would be for all ds teams to quantify all of their projects impact for a discipline built on measuring things they often will not measure their own value my org has da and ds split into teams the ds team got cut by half in our layoffs the da pulled a job post and did not replace someone who left but no layoffs the da team has done a lot of quick win projects where they are asked can you look into this and they find some simple correlations and recommend some simple actions small product changes customer outreach etc they are great about showing it could increase sales by x or reduce cost by y if it works and many of them work it is hard to fire a team that can point to interventions with a total benefit exceeding their salary ds on the other hand struggles to productionize models after months they have lots_ of detailed explanations and the models are very complex but many of the ds projects are these vast pipe dreams without a specific application or quantifiable value add it is hard to justify that when budgets shrink pboswell i think there was a huge push to create data science functions in my orgs to find the edge in a stagnating economy then companies realized their data systems are such a shit show that quality data science was impossible the value proposition is very clear the execution plan path is not designingdata it is up to those in the know to state what we do have a great day ipsocranius indeed poor data management and strategy certainly exist it will be interesting to see if there is a clear winner in data management approaches on these functions data mesh etc",

badly at both the technical aspects and the many bureaucratic governance regulatory aspects i was extremely successful in my previous work as an analyst writing sql and building visualizations but i am now very concerned that i am just not sharp enough for a ds role anyway the options as i see them redouble my efforts in my current role i have been putting in a ton of hours recently without any significannot performance improvements i am not sure this option gets me anything except leaving the company at a future date on their terms without another job lined up i would love to stay if possible though look for another ds job i am concerned that this will go very similarly my coworkers have been eager to help our processes are documented well and my manager has been nothing if not patient and helpful if i ca not succeed in ds here what exactly am i looking for elsewhere transition to data engineering i like sql well enough and am quite good at it although it of course gets boring when it is all one does but nonetheless this path would certainly pay my mortgage for the rest of my life with no issues transition to i was in college when ds was having its moment and have never really wanted to do anything else but i am still only late and by no means to old to transition to something else entirely but would not know what or where to start thanks in advance for your advice pineapple bliss i am transitioning from a finance hr job background and a non stem degree to enter a ms in computer science via seattle university in person but i do not have the analytics statistical modeling calculus coursework embedded in my curriculum that i think would help me move to a data science role trying to figure out what combination of degrees certs would make sense through my school or if i am overthinking it just wanna make an efficient transition to be a data scientist just a ms in computer science ms computer science find accredited calculus and linear algebra classes to qualify for and do data science certification ms data science and take calculus linear algebra classes before to get into program ms computer science business analytics double major ms computer science business analytics certification should i do ds projects i feel my resume lacks of ds modeling experience i am an actuary data analyst who wants to transition to ds i did some small ds projects before in courses and kaggle but nothing worth to show in my resume i am considering doing some more projects so i have more ds machine learning modeling experience to show in my resume some people are against showing projects in resume while others are not what do you think about including them in resume would it make it easier to me to transition to ds resume hi everyone i am looking to get a job as a data scientist in the next years i am looking for advice on what my current set of skills can help me with and what i need to work on my background years as a systems engineer in the space industry worked at nasa and currently blue origin years military experience bs physics ms space architecture skills include integration space systems leadership project management tool development analysis technical writing i have done a few data analysis projects basic though at work current plan finish udemy python course data science course do the coursera ibm data science certificate then do some portfolio work dunno what yet this a good plan what am i missing looking for those unknown unknowns any advice or insights is much appreciated newpiethis is my first data science project so i have a raw data set from an airline company for a student project and they would like me to make a prediction model from it predicting the number of bags on a given flight i have to first clean the data which is the most involved part i was told then a few lines of python code for the prediction portion and i should be good i am just unsure where to start i want to know how to clean it but i do not want to clean it too good and make the prediction model perform poorly so my question is how do i clean it and when do i know i have done enough textin texan are companies looking for non traditional interns ie older folks switching from other career paths i have got years finance accounting experience and i am nearly done my data analytics masters program my wife makes enough that we can afford the short term pay cut to try to get a leg up but i am wondering what sort of reception i will receive as i apply airbagdeer can anyone with published academic papers articles please give me his source code must be in the last years preferably someone whose paper got accepted to a journal i am a master is student in math and i am doing a seminar in data science in the seminar i need to take an academic paper article and study it and later present it i was hoping to get a paper from reddit as i think it will be cool for someone to have his article presented to an entire class and hopefully if any questions arise i could ask him i was also hoping to take it one step ahead and test the source code on different sets of data thank you mathstatgal can i modify my resume to labs a any job i have around years experience in data analytics competent in sql r and python let me also add that i am no programmer i honestly do not see the importance in being able to remember syntax i know i am going to get flamed for this i am a very logical thinker and a good problem solver have received this feedback from multiple interviews where i typically fail is the programming aspect those timed torture tests where you have to solve problems in hours as a most recent example where i could solve perfectly im having no luck finding any job im in canada and i have years of job experience as a data scientist in canada can i use this to modify my resume to at least get a job as an analyst my mental health is totally in the shitter without a job just some more background i have a masters degree in math and one in stats and am a phd abd in stats thanks all wouldatastoryteller congrats this has a lot of helpful info about what to expect savethepandabears congrats on the interviews generally the first round is a quick call with the technical recruiter you will likely be asked to take the recruiter through your resume i would review the job posting and try to highlight parts of your resume that match specific things the team is looking for other than that you will probably get a few more details about high level what the team does and what they are specifically looking to fill with the role they probably will not have a ton of specifics on the day to day of what you will be working on unfortunately that is usually the domain of the hm in likely the next round usually the first round is to verify you seem to be who your resume says you are and gauge interest in the role cocodirichlet some of the bullet points i do not understand bullet point about automating visualization improving efficiency by efficiency of what and what error rate bullet point about fraud detection increase in fraud detection maybe you need to say that it was actual fraud and not false positives it also sounds a bit weird that a big name company is going to let an intern change their fraud detection algorithm was this a team and were you an intern on the team i do not understand the projects you worked for netflix and designed an experiment for them this makes no sense were you a volunteer on this shelter or is this a made up project from kaggle or one of those places do you have links to the projects they should be on the resume moscowgordon seems good to me think the market is just tough right now everyotherfreackle couple of impressions do you attach you github kaggle cannot see the link do you have a portfolio looking at the cv now i cannot see what your interests are you list your skills but what are your strengths what are you bringing to the table that the other candidates cannot in short i would say that there needs to be more of you in your resume cocodirichlet r statistics quantpsychguy if you want to move now and are willing to take a short term pay hit for long term advantage look at jumping to a data analyst role in a space near data scientists then when you have the degree you can move to a data science role with both experience and the educational credential behind you dnadude which entry pathway did you take i am looking at this specific program as well but have not seen much talked about it on here wouldatastoryteller i switched from marketing to marketing analytics to product analytics with a data scientist title i got the marketing analytics role by pivoting on a marketing team i was already on i had been doing data analysis as part of my marketing work for years and had proven i could use data to solve business problems what to learn will depend on what kind of job you are aiming for learning stats is probably a good idea for all of the jobs that fall under the ds umbrella also join slack discord communities and look for local events on meetup not sure if meetup is popular worldwide i am in the us you might be able to find someone in the slack discord communities the only folks i have seen who get enough freelance work to support themselves have a ton of experience years and a big professional network cocodirichlet usually grad degree applications ask for letters of recommendation and you need a good statement people are going to look at that first and maybe look at a portfolio after you are in a long list of candidates differences from bootcamps you can apply for internships and obviously it is more serious in terms of training and bootcamps are expensive compared to some grad degrees like georgia tech colickingseahorse hard to say how quantitative is your phd cocodirichlet is the part time aspect of the phd because you only need to write your dissertation would that be the only thing you would be doing wouldatastoryteller i agree that a week program is not enough to be job ready as for when is it worth getting a masters however i do not think we have enough info to tell you one way or another what is your undergrad degree in what kind of work experience do you have what are your career goals implement worried if you are looking to do management why not do an mba from a school that has strong focus on product management moscowgordon ds programs are going to cover a broader range of topics in stats ml and cs it stats programs are probably more aligned to the specific areas you are interested in but they will also cover the mathematical theory at a deeper level than what you really need i guess i would just pick the program with the most courses that you think are relevant either way you are going to have to hire an experienced person to make the actual technical decisions cocodirichlet the problem is that you have no advanced stats and no programming i do not think you can transition without knowing statistics at least i would find the area which is closest in domain and focus on that for instance user growth could be an area or product ds focusing on experiments but most likely you would need to do another grad degree unless you can transition to data analytics mizmato business analyst or something similar to that could be a good pivot you get to work with data but also use your consulting skills when working with stakeholders mizmato this may or may not be related to something you are interested in but i work with fraud modeling we take historical data to build ml models and use live incoming data to detect bad actors google and amazon do lots of research in this field and i think that an ms in cybersecurity could be a good starting point rough idk op as a ds there are only a few questions on ml that comes to mind in which id expect an entry level candidate to know off the top can you explain what accuracy precision score is or can you explain the inner details of any ml model of your choice a summary of its algorithm etc and even then i wouldnt expect candidates to give me full on text book answers i think reading theory and seeing how its implemented in say kaggle without coding it just reading and getting used to the flow would be a much more efficient way to get a grasp on concepts thats just my opinion all the best quantpsychguy ummindex cards wouldatastoryteller have you looked on linkedin for alumni of this program to see what they are doing now sjhillman overall it looks pretty good to me especially from a content perspective i really like the use of quantifiable percentages to show what you did there is just a few small things i would suggest all of which are very much my own personal preference than anything truly objective i like seeing the skills section more prominent such as right at top because it serves as a quick summary of what you know if it is not at the top or otherwise very easy to find i go searching for it before i even look at anything else i would also suggest formatting it more like a table though with no visible cell borders is fine rather than a comma separated list just for the sake of being a little cleaner and easier to mentally parse the overall format is very functional but is very bland it does not need to be anything flashy but this format does give off typewriter vibes that makes it very easy to get mentally bored and makes it easier to pass over without really digging into in this day and age that could even be construed rightly or wrongly as low effort i do like minimalistic design in general but this crosses into utilitarian one format i am fond of is to move the skills into a narrow column left side or right does not matter too much that adds a little style makes the skills easier to read and makes the whitespace more palatable googling two column resume gives a lot of great examples of variations to consider while i know troubleshooted is a perfectly valid form of the past tense it will never not look wrong to me i much prefer troubleshot but again this is a purely subjective suggestion diagnosed would be a viable alternative as well moscowgordon i would be more specific about the actual statistical technique used instead of just saying forecasting and data models you might consider removing sas spss stata and excel from the skills section unless you are open to jobs heavily using those formatting could be a bit better take a look at some other resumes and find one you think looks nice everyotherfreackle sorry but looking good in the resume is altogether a wrong way to look at this you are not building a resume you are building a career if i were you i would instead ask myself which company will be able to support my learning more where i would grow more cocodirichlet the big company would probably matter for name recognition and many bigger companies have their internship programs more streamlined you get a mentor there is an internship cohort they have activities like seminars by people working there have you asked about any of this however is the start up like a known start up or a start up that has been around for years is the start up saas start up can be hit or miss you might be able to produce a lot of things because they do not have many employees or it could be a mess because you have zero guidance and you are unable to produce anything not because lack of skills but due to lack of mentorship and support wouldatastoryteller which do you think is more likely to make a return offer for a full time role after you graduate my guess is the big company everyotherfreackle it is certainly possible without master but the career curve might be steeper if you are applying to the same positions as some phd is and masters you will need to have the extra experience to level the ground i would say definitely take that math minor and aim for data engeneer positions first if you can work as data engeneer and do the masters in ds at the same time you will be well set for career in ds bonus tip start building your portfolio and network early cocodirichlet given that you have a background in public policy and surveys what about market research places like yougov norc ipsos you are in a very expensive area rather than doing a bootcamp i would look into the georgia tech ms in data analytics you might be able to apply now to start in the fall it is almost the same or less than a bootcamp but it is a remote grad degree in the mean time i would still look into market research wouldatastoryteller ask your boss what is the normal tenure in this role what is the typical next step and what does it take to get a promotion to that level colickingseahorse a few questions what are you struggling with technically specifically do you have to do a bunch of ml and do not know how to evaluate models or have trouble building dash less etc etc are your performance woes your own evaluation of how you are doing how does your manager and do your teammates feel you are doing if you were better at your current role would you find it more interesting are your frustrations that you are not learning quickly enough to manage your role or that you hate the responsibilities colickingseahorse please get yourself some good math background before you transition into ds i see quite a lot of data scientists that do not have adequate statistical and mathematical intuition many will tell you that you do not need complex calc stats to do ds since it is all abstracted away behind modelfit and they are only half right it can be frustrating working with data scientists who have very little statistical math intuition that would allow you to sniff test when things are going wrong or if an analysis you are performing is the correct approach or not datamasteryacademy ms in computer science is a great start in addition you can take online courses or enroll in a program that specializes in data science to create a portfolio of ds projects showing your capability and interest moscowgordon you are probably overthinking it you would not need more formal schooling after an ms in cs if the school offers some kind of ds cert sure that would be helpful you do not need more calculus and linear algebra than what is covered in basic undergrad courses and i would be surprised if you could get an ms in cs without taking those beyond that you would want maybe a class each on probability theory intro to stats and ml cocodirichlet who is against showing projects on resumes you wrote a thesis for your grad degree so you can turn that into a project and put it on your website and also your resume datamasteryacademy i am a senior data scientist with about years of experience you should do projects and definitely add them on your resume this is the only way you can show what you know since you do not have prior ds experience hope this helps good luck shopcell did you consider putting your exams on your resume i passed the first three before deciding against doing the rest i am not sure if p is relevant to data science since probability is important but not exactly the same cocodirichlet your current company and nasa have data science i would recommend that you contact ds in blue origin and ask them for advice you have a lot of knowledge in this particular industry so probably staying in this industry or moving to similar places like lockheed martin or any company that requires security clearance would be an easy move however you need some insight into what is required in the industry what models they do what tools they use etc you might even be able to move internally to ds which would be so much easier airbagdeer for starters i would suggest checking the variance of each feature if the variance is high it might be a good idea to normalize the data also check for outliers and remove them if needed cocodirichlet yes why not grad students are usually older and many places also hire phd interns so they are even older i know people close to who had internships i would focus on finance if you have experience in that industry and start contacting recruiters etc wouldatastoryteller why not apply for a full time role your previous experience counts for something sorry literally any journal half decent should have a replication package cocodirichlet jamesmcflyjr thanks so much appreciate the link jamesmcflyjr appreciate this so much thanks karabouya the thing stuck out to me too one of your primary jobs is translating data to decision makers in a way they can understand and this is not interpretable which is a bad look i assume it means you decreased the number of man hours required for the task by or something similar but this means nothing without knowing how long it took before did it used to take hours and now it takes minutes or did it used to take hours and now it takes i do not think every bullet needs a statistic on it improving efficiency and reducing error rate seems like it provides the necessary amount of information imho i also am not a big fan of bolding stuff nice resume though and good luck shastaslacker would you recommend a certificate for that so that i can move faster i feel like my course work is skipping over the basics and getting really into theory programming shastaslacker i took the computer science path way i figured learning that perspective first was likely to get me a job quicker but i am not sure it really matters fgfrutos perhaps somewhat more than others in psychology i have experience with different programming languages r python javascript i have to manage several databases of my experiments and of my colleagues and the level of statistics in which i move is to perform hierarchical regression model some psychometric techniques etc fgfrutos sadly no i have still to give shape to my dissertation thanks for the response i was an anthropology and psych double major and i also have a master of public policy mpp where i focused on racial and economic equity so i have significannot experience with stata r arcgis spss and telling a story with data for policy propositions i also am great with stats and have been finding the courses in my program at mit easier than expected i am currently a senior analyst at a consulting firm and i miss doing the story telling of data working directly with data in consulting we just google what someone else found in x research so that is why i was interested in data science thanks for the reply another masters is not on the table right now unfortunately as for advanced statistics i have good knowledge of calculus and basic statistics maybe i could study casella and berger what is your opinion on online degrees micromasters programs nanodegeees etc thank you i will look into business analyst profiles dsrequirementz thanks for the advice would not a two column resume cause issues with ats none deleted ghostofsaintdaft what are you struggling with technically specifically nothing so grand as what you described we work almost exclusively with glms since that is what the regulators know best a typical problem i will have is something like provide indicated relativities for each variable in the model which should be a straightforward request and i will consistently botch some detail peer review sheets are often several pages of small errors which leaves low confidence in the final product going to other divisions or state regulators are your performance woes your own evaluation of how you are doing how does your manager and do your teammates feel you are doing for the past months my manager has been very direct about needing to improve i have not been formally piped but it is definitely not just me if you were better at your current role would you find it more interesting are your frustrations that you are not learning quickly enough to manage your role or that you hate the responsibilities yes absolutely i am consistently overwhelmed by the complexity of everything the things i get right are mostly handheld and the things that are not handheld are not right i would love to stay if i could perform the work competently how much does a years ms in stats look if it is not from a good school my program that accepted me is a small school and it is a funded ms i figured it was not that long and could help in the industry would i have a hard time finding a job with a no name school pineapple bliss i am taking an entry grad certificate currently that covers most of what an undergraduate cs degree does to transition to the ms in cs i did not take calculus or algebra in my undergrad because it was not required for my social science degree do have any recommendations of which kind of projects that i should avoid i already know that no one wants to hear about titanic kaggle project for example haha not american so do not have any exams but from what i have seen it will not help if you are applying for a company outside the insurance field no one knows about the actuarial exams outside insurance thanks yes i have been in touch with them already but the questions you posed are what i am looking for i will start asking those industry specific questions thanks cocodirichlet though this are visualizations so i do not understand what the error rate is this context less plots with errors it does not make much sense quantpsychguy to be blunt the coursework is independent just get some data projects on your resume from your current job and then move to being a data analyst i thought you wanted speed certs are sold by people to make money not get you in a job of them are worthless if you just want to do a cert then do the free ones from google or ibm but more to the problem here if you are struggling already with your coursework is it possible that this is not the field for you i do not know that and lots of people struggle at times with a masters but if your first response is to tell someone you are struggling then also thinking to add additional certificates makes me think that you think any of these credentials are magic tickets if you can just get through it cocodirichlet are you in the us and do you have a grad degree already or is this a uk style phd what would the part time be if it is only figuring out your dissertation writing you could do it in years but if you have a lot more requirements then it could be difficult wouldatastoryteller actually your background might be one of the few situations where a certificate might be enough you can probably teach yourself what you do not know or review as necessary sjhillman that is somewhat up for debate most modern ats should be able to handle it as long as it is done cleanly so the old rules of carefully crafting to them are largely loosened by a great deal but of course you can never know for sure what a given employer is using personally i prefer to err on the side of making human readability more of a priority than machine readability though you do need to balance both since machines are not on average as picky and subjective as people cocodirichlet the reason why i am suggesting the georgia tech one is that it costs between to a bootcamp costs at least or more but the value quality weight is not comparable also a grad degree allows you to apply for internships a bootcamp does not internships can be longer than the summer so you could do an internship part time while you are studying many internships pay well i do not know if you can do it faster if you study full time it might be a year degree however you do not have any background beyond basic stats and no programming i do not consider stata programming per se you use excel for data cleaning which is not a good practice you have a lot to learn i do not think a bootcamp will add much other than a huge cost for which you can actually get a grad degree colickingseahorse gotcha does it feel like you are struggling with grasping the technical aspects of your work or do you think it is just that you are not as detail oriented as you might need to be for these reports both of those are two different problems if it makes you feel any better i went through something that was exactly the same when i was doing my phd fucking up the most basic things barely able to string together a coherent sentence in my field and felt like i was about to drop out gradually as i pushed through and started being encouraged by even the most minor of successes or growth that would motivate me to keep going instead of dropping out by the end i felt quite proud of what i would accomplished but where i started was very similar to where you are now it sucked felt like hell but slowly i improved and it worked out i too needed my hand held by my thesis advisor for a long time before i found my footing it seems like you are quite interested in what you are doing but what you are going through is the growing pains of a role that is technically more complex than what you are up to take joy in the small victories you find even if you find yourself frustrated all the time if anything learning what you do not like and it could be that after some time you will find the frustration never goes away you are starting to dislike it and that is totally okay you have learned what you do not like which is important wall of text aside i think you have thought through your options pretty well so let us discuss those too i would say if is just leading you to more frustration and things are not working out you are right in thinking will likely be worse than unless the role responsibilities are significannotly different most ml ds roles a more complex than what you have got going on is a good option and one you should strongly consider for have you thought about product data science or roles focused on experimentation these might be a little bit less technical than your current role but your ability to code well in sql would really help you out here im sorry you are going through a tough time with some growing pains in your career you have got this moscowgordon so if you are mostly using logistic regression or whatever you should feel comfortable with what it is optimizing how to interpret the coefficients etc if you feel solid on that stuff then the problem is just that you are not asking enough questions to learn the business context provide indicated relativities sounds like it might be asking for the coefficients but you ca not just assume that if you are shaky on logistic regression though and you are not motivated to get solid on it then yeah data engineering might be a better path moscowgordon a well known school is better all else equal but you will be fine ms stat is a respected degree even from a no name school if it was ms ds it would be different moscowgordon sure but i am guessing you will take some through this cert you are doing datamasteryacademy yes it could be a good idea to stay away from ones that have been used too many times i would find a dataset that would be applicable to real business as well like titanic or pokemon datasets are not very applicable go for sales predictions churn predictions fraud predictions etc none deleted i see thanks pineapple bliss i have to take the coursework before i am accepted into the data science certification thats my current difficulty finding classes outside a provided curriculum in calculus linear algebra stats to be eligible to get into either a data science degree or certification good point given that you already have experience in the ds field can you check my resume i know it lacks modelling machine learning but i do not if the rest of it is okay cocodirichlet yeah that is why i suggested looking into market research because you do have skills experience and a degree public policy for that type of job some of your experience can be used for focus groups writing surveys doing basic descriptive states etc implement worried you can always hit up those prereq classes from your local community college you might want to take an intro to programming as well if you have not done one in the past datamasteryacademy sure thanks the resume is linked in my post here datamasteryacademy got it the only thing missing is the projects part other than that i think it looks good it is definitely a plus that you have experience in data analytics i would add the projects part as we talked about give importance to your most recent experience as a da and less information on the previous ones to create space for your projects also add a github link so they can find your projects once you have some great thanks",

  "bigedd here are some of the common challenges data scientists face in their work data quality one of the biggest challenges faced by data scientists is dealing with poor quality data this can include missing or incorrect data inconsistent data formats or data that is simply irrelevant to the problem they are trying to solve data preprocessing data preprocessing can be a time consuming task and it is often necessary to clean and transform data before it can be used for analysis or modeling data wrangling the process of transforming and mapping data from one raw format to another can be challenging especially when dealing with large amounts of data feature selection deciding which features to include in a model is a critical step in the modeling process and it can be difficult to determine which features are most relevant to the problem being solved model selection selecting the appropriate model for a given problem is a key challenge for data scientists this can involve comparing the performance of multiple models and choosing the one that best fits the data overfitting overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the noise in the data rather than the underlying patterns this can lead to poor performance when making predictions on new data data management storing organizing and retrieving data can be a challenge especially when dealing with large amounts of data data scientists need to be able to effectively manage and access their data to ensure it can be used for analysis and modeling data privacy and governance with the increasing amount of data being generated and collected data privacy and governance are becoming more important than ever data scientists need to ensure that they are adhering to privacy regulations and ethical standards when working with data these are just a few of the many challenges faced by data scientists the field of data science is constantly evolving and data scientists must continually update their skills and knowledge to stay ahead of the curve defaultkh challenges for me are usually too low sample size and collaborators that do not really know what their research question is vacuouswaffle data given as pdf biggest tip get used to communicating technical concepts in the simplest language if you cannot do that you probably will find it difficult to grow in the field of ds as a ds you are the sme for properly converting a customer is ideas to a technical solution bespoke model at times like this you need to be able to take your developer cap off and pose questions to the customer that are not technical yet helps you inform the design of the final model also often times managers can be difficult inexperienced so merging your ideal view of implementing a ds solution with the business incentive of selling a product to a customer can be a battle sometimes you need extra time for research and eda sometimes you simply cannot build a system based on the customer data be honest argue your views and try your best to make those arguments as objective as possible ps this is my experience as a senior ds working for a software solutions company mupa thank you for this bigedd this is very thorough i have found data preprocessing and eda to be my favorite segments of the data science process as far as in the study environment but i have heard a lot of horror stories about how time consuming and paralyzing it can be in the real world job setting and to be honest i am dreading it now good bot mupa thank you for this i love that aside from highlighting the challenges you also pointed out that it is the duty of the data scientist to be honest about the limitations of the data the process or even the potential solutions my biggest takeaway here is the importance of communication be it communicating your findings or even the challenges you face",

of the snap happening and most of it centered on earth and humans however we get a pretty good idea that it is not just complete randomness it is a little bit too neat and the outcome seems to sustain life on earth in a way pure randomness across all living things would not i think it is clear it is a stratified sample clearly accounting for logical groupings that are not necessarily determined by a few simple rules thanos did not really sound out his wish or had time to be super specific so we can kind of assume the stones simply knew what he meant in a way they sort of act as opposite monkey paws giving you exactly what you want and not what you are able to word but if we try to word it we would describe it as a stratified sample which perfectly keeps the prior distribution in all relevant subgroups the relevant part here being entirely up for definition naivepigletiii surely would have to be some kind of stratified sampling the world population has a lot of skews nationalities ethnicities gender sexual orientation economic class thanos was all about justice he would not want to severely impact any minority groups a related question if everyone has chance of being eliminated what is the probability that exactly of the avengers got snapped away woulddanieltan i actually think thanos would have opted for pure random assignment instead of stratified sampling he seemed like an occam is razor type of ruler and the purity of a true random sample seems most in line with his ideology if by chance an entire species got wiped out he probably would have reasoned that the universe would adapt and shift to a new equilibrium i think he was less concerned about keeping the downsampled universe an exact replica of the original hierarchy your politics bore me and just wanted to reduce the drain on resources challenge with going for a pure random assignment would actually be the random number generation i do not think he would have used any form of pseudorandomness so he would need to construct a pure random generator with the infinity stones perhaps he would incorporate the natural decay of the infinity stones as a perfect model for randomness like how cloudflare uses pellets of uranium it says living beings a world full of bacteria would await him quantpsychguy i am not sure that is true eitheri think it was half of humans if half of the rest of life got wiped out it would not fix the rest of the problems just humans gilchester it definitely cannot be truly random or strange would not have seen only or whatever many futures if there was a future for whether each person let alone alien died it would be essentially infinite possible futures based on who got snapped and who did not minastik i mean having mindstone would give his brain infinite iq so he could just account all of that on the fly ordinaryplatypusit was definitely half of the rest of life as well zeiramsy well strange started his future vision pre snap so presumably he started out focusing on ways to prevent the snap before he realized that was impossible and he needed to look beyond it is also not clear whether he had to play through each option in a brute force way or if he had a sort of genetic search algorithm in which case he would find the success much faster meaning i do not think stranges number of visited futures is necessarily indicative of ops question yep we are overthinking this lol quantpsychguy yepafter going back and checking that out now i just think the guy is an idiot rather than some weird attempt at an anti hero gilchester i probably phrased my point poorly my point was more that the fact strange could search at all indicates it was not random if it was random then how was he to know that stark did not get snapped and the victory obviously depending on stark not getting snapped the only way he could see a definite future with the snap is if the snap was not truly random zeiramsy that begs a very philosophical question can the outcomes of randomness be observed by someone who is able to see the future or would randomness always distort futuresight stark surviving could be the result of a random process and it would just so happen that in every future the snap happened it is outcomes are the same because as a random process it was independent of anything that happened before do we assume this is like a multiverse thing where everything that can happen will happen so every theoretically possible outcome creates a branch in that case there is not a point in seeing the future anyway because you would not know which future as the snap certainly is not the only random element gilchester i think true randomness would distort foresight a la schrodinger is cat but in general few things are truly random at a quantum level and even fewer that would meaningfully affect outcomes at a human level but the snap would be one such event i am probably misunderstanding your second paragraph because it sounds like you are saying stark survives of the time in which case it would not be random or it could but with a chance of survival which is effectively not random and would go against thanos wish of fairness zeiramsy well thanos promised strange to let stark live at the battle but that promise could have carried over to the snap as well so the snap could be random except for stark as well but that was not the point of my second paragraph let is assume i would flip a coin in a perfectly random way and it landed tails i can observe that outcome in real time and document it without it being any less random why would not it be then possible for a time traveler to also see that outcome you assume the relationship between randomness and foresight is that each future vision represents a new coin flip but that does not have to be true the snap and its outcome could be a multiversal constant and still be absolutely random but instead of flipping the coin for each vision it is the same flip for each i do not necessarily think this is how it works but future vision is purely hypothetical anyway and as you say would not work with the a new flip everytime randomness you describe so my point is stranges vision only tells us how randomness works in the marvel universe not if the snap was truly random",

  "fc atl for the record the number of applicannots shown by linkedin is bs i would like to know what that number really is but it is not applicannots i know because i have posted jobs nothing related to data science and seen that we had x applicannots while we had none it might be the number of people who clicked on the link to read the job description but definitely not applicannots taci7c0ffdegrees are a start but i have seen lots of phds that lack any initiative cannot handle ambiguity and think that each task can be done on the timeline of a thesis if you are passionate and really love it there will always be jobs available you should always think about your career like you want to start a business doing it and rely on yourself and not a team metalibro dude chatgpt is so far away from actually replacing a data science job people need to see it as a supplementary tool not one that will eliminate their entire job ironmanfolgore as someone that has hired for data science roles yes there are a lot of applicannots but not all are qualified this is what i have seen career changers that have no experience or real interest in data science like teachers or customer service associates i exclude these people fresh out of grad school that are american citizens i will consider these applicannots for an entry level role but not much else i would rather have an applicannot with years of work experience in an analytical role than one with years and a ms i have given them a chance before but i just have not seen great results from ds grad school applicannots i would not rule them out but i would deprioritize them compared to applicannots with job experience people fresh out of grad school that need sponsorship if my company sponsors then i would put them in the same bucket as the above applicannots if my company does not then i unfortunately cannot consider them this is usually the most popular group so i do think those job applicannots totals are not practically useful my advice apply to data analyst positions rather than data science positions emphasize analytics statistics and programing rigor in your resume include a github link if you have one i do not think projects matter that much however i use github to see what their code looks like if it is clean documented etc do not get disheartened by the big job applicannot totals they are misleading wouldatastoryteller is it hard to get a job yes is it possible for you to get a job possibly yes do you have a college degree in any other topics any work experience keep in mind that are lots of different types of jobs that fall under data science or in adjacent areas the jobs that the veteran phds are going after and being considered for are not the same as an entry level candidate also someday you will be the experienced veteran going after a different kind of job that you will be going after today mikehoogeveen i think it varies highly oer country there is enough work possibilities in the netherlands for example miketythhon i applied to jobs and got one subject right now entry level roles are being flooded with applicannots lacking experience but finding a senior level data scientist or analyst is no small feat if you do not have experience get a job even if you feel over qualified bad after a little while make a hop for the role you are after inner celebration i think it is a competitive field but also depends on what role exactly you seek in ds some positions you need experience that you can get by doing a phd where you learn to conduct your own research from a to z but you can also have that skill from real work experience provided other employers gave you the opportunity to build those skills other jobs require you to be very good at statistics and others you have to be a very good software engineer i do not really understand the linkedin counter either i would apply directly on the company website and skip the easy apply feature of linkedin the easier the application process the more applicannots and easier to get lost in the crowd imo bannedbutbackbaby i think it is okay a little colder than before but maybe it is just bias because of what i am reading in the news i applied to maybe since early december and just got one i went through less than interviews that went past the first discussion a couple could not meet my salary range i was laid off and unemployed so i accepted a lower base salary but they were nice enough to offer a signing bonus so technically i am being paid more this year i accepted because i wanted to be back to work and months was enough for now ebisure was your job ad easy apply or does it lead to external site jizzybiscuits sometimes if you click the job ad and return to the app it will ask you if you applied and that should be the number given but i imagine it is in linkedin is interest to maximise the number of applicannots so it is probably a count of click throughs on the job ad bloatedglobe i have not applied for jobs since last year but i am pretty sure it is how many people have clicked on the apply link since you are logged in it only will count you once even if you click multiple times i was really bored when i was unemployed and i tested this out with a bunch of listings it was a while ago though so i could be misremembering shittiestpizza thanks for sharing that i usually avoid any jobs

oh i am talking about the us iguesswhatevs that is still a better track record than most lol fc atl i see where you are going it was on a separate site maybe they have a better tracking for apply only

requirements it is mind boggling bottom line do not be discouraged by the of applicannots right or wrong shown supplychainphd lol photonsforjustice it would be the number of people who clicked apply now to be taken to your external site linkedin has no way to know what they do once they are there would be interesting to know what the conversion rate is probably depends on the complexity of the

  "hungryquant i am my opinion the mle position essentially means a data scientist whose code is actually good and can create their own prod data pipeline and scoring application for example let is say you are doing fraud detection at an insurance company and they need the model to score all open claims that have not already been paid or flagged for fraud and refer the top to the fraud team this needs to happen every hours you have to write a file that may reference other modules in your code called runprocesspy that a gets all the relevant data b transforms it into the format required by your model object c loads the models and scores the data d inserts the top scoring claims into a database table your code should write log files so that if something breaks you know what happened your code should send out an email to a distribution list indicating whether the process succeeded or failed and have the log file attached a software engineer will create the logic that takes the records in the database and integrates with the company is software this is just an example but the main difference is the end to end nature of the deliverable most common language is python by far c c is used for coding the underlying algorithms and processing backend usually xgboost sklearn pytorch and tensorflow are popular frameworks jupyter is the most common notebook if you want to move into it it is important to have intuition about what features are likely relevant in the domain and how to build a production software system around whatever model you choose or is chosen by data scientists deep learning is rarely required for most business problems but when it is out of the box pre trained solutions often exist mle means swe who knows how to call a ml api when i had to do anomaly detection my first thought was to build a model the mle built a pipeline to feed data into the twitter anomaly detection api seriouslyimfinetho dually noted",

  "everyotherfreackle since the data might have strong deterministic seasonality it would be sensible to use a model that can capture those i would recommend two approaches based on your final goal if you want to really understand how different variables interact to create the demand i would recommend sarimax where x would be your weather data if you want more modern turnkey approach that will produce the forecast without much overhead give facebook is propet a try it is effective when you have overlapping seasonalities once you know which approach you are going with reverse engeeneer the data collection to match your model is workflow needs otherwise it is really hard to data engineer when you do not know the requirements for the next step here is a tutorial for energy forecasting from nixtla that could be useful back in the day i used arima mufflonicus energy in terms of electricity or in terms of space heating industrial processes using temperated water temporal fusion transformer is state of the art in rime series forecasting right now pytorch has an implementation of it if i remember correctly cendrewapiti usually weather forecasts are stored with a double time index issuetime valuetime issuetime is the time at which the weather forecast is made valuetime is the time in the future that you are forecasting as for your project of energy load forecasting let me give you some advice based on my own experience you should train on actual realised weather data and not the forecasts energy load is seasonal hourly weekly yearly and so is the weather but not necessarily with de same seasonality weather does not have a weekly seasonality what has worked well in my case was to remove the seasonality from weather and load and try to predict load seasonal anomalies with weather seasonal anomaly beware of time change that would change the hourly shape of load clintcamp ooh fun topic i remember a presentation somebody gave when i was in college that someone from one of the colorado universities gave at nrel when i interned there they used the forecast to figure out when to ideally run their on campus powerplant to reduce peak pricing for the campus i think a recurrent neural network or an lstm would work well for time serial data snoo you would store weather forecast based on the time they are generated store all days forecast generated at am tomorrow with date timestamp and similarly for other time this way you can assess day ahead accuracy for any time based on what time horizon you want to look at edit weather data special days holidays historical load data would be main data series to collect try to split models by weekdays weekends for better performance wouldomesticationnever fb prophet is so easy to try might be as few as loc to knock out something saerusthesecond in terms of electricity for a few states saerusthesecond is it a bad idea to use weather forecasts in generating new predictions my thought is that if i train on hourly historic weather i should also predict using hourly weather forecasts but maybe i am wrong here no please do not use neural nets for forecasting never saerusthesecond do you think it is a good idea to store each hourly forecast for days in advance of each timestamp that comes out to forecasts over a whole year which seems like a ton of data to store i am using aws rds so i can store as much data as needed but that seems like it would cost a lot mufflonicus electricity has generally a lot of variance which of course will be greatly reduced by the number of subscribers this is just good news means a simple model will usually do good a more advanced model will as always do better but might be a bit starved for data as you generate set of hourly data every hour as always it is good if you got ample ampunts of data you should then consider what drives the load industrial processes usually have easily predictable demand during operations think weekdays perhaps multiple shifts same machines running all the time residential space heating sometimes electricity is used for space heating in those cases huge amounts are used so it might be good to consider the weather consider where large population centers are located as it is unlikely to be the same weather in multiple states consider if gas is used for space heating as it might mean that very little electricity is used and you instead see increases in electricity production as houses can easily be net producers to the grid which affects net demand district heating would mean miniscule electricity for space heating but that energy must come from somewhere space cooling residential industrial ac is very common in the us and you will see spikes in electricity when they are used probably proportional to solar radiation and the difference in temperature between outdoors and normal c indoor temperature as usual will probably have time componebts for both other residential this is usually strongly time related oven house appliances computers etc might be affected holidays travel same for space heating cooling as well tbh forgot to mention communal infrastructure bath complexes uses lots of energy for heating many light fictures draws a lot of electricity population changes populations move about if this is the case know that there will be a non stationsry trend increasing the demand this is difficult to forecast and migh require more data and or assumptions misc consider local considerations is there any industries military civilian behaviour that might affect demand guess features so lets look at the list of features time of day day of week holiday month period of year typical good classical temporal features can never go wrong outdoor temperature solar radiation good indicators for lots of demand precipitation might be good depends on how people are affected lagged values bread and butter for time series might try to normalize based on other parameters first i am not a great fan of normal year conversions but do consider them before rejecting decent horizon start small evaluate vs real look at more data othen than above vs residual acf pacf is there any patterns or is everything white noise at this point you should know all you need to write a good model hopefully cendrewapiti you are right using forecasted weather for the prediction is correct and this is the point of your project right my point was that to predict what would happen days in the future you should train your model with actual historic weather and plug in the days forecasts to get a days prediction but to predict days in the future you should not train a model with days forecasts hootandahalf_ but but that is the new trend is not it all those fancy words mgeeeeeezy how come because it is hard to assess uncertainty snoo no you would like to only store the future data after you have finished the model to judge its performance weather forecast data before that is irrelevant saerusthesecond that is very helpful thanks i was thinking that actual weather and forecasted weather are rarely equal so my load forecasting model should train on weather forecasts to take into account the kinds of mistakes that would be used for load prediction and yes load forecasting is the main point of the project and i would be happy to scrape whatever data sources might help with that because they scale poorly they are non interpretable they suck at modeling the underlying stochastic process and most likely will be used as a blackbox without even taking into account the

what you want to avoid is to include the weather forecast error in your model error mgeeeeeezy what is your go to for time series regression i have used lstms in the past and aside from explainability they outperformed glms at that time i had not really considered things like shap lime for explainability but it could be cool to revisit i have also never run into issues with scalability for an lstm vs any other model what issues have you run into specific to lstm or did you mean large models in general i have also used gps for energy forecasting which i loved using physics to inform priors is super appealing and the uncertainty estimate is insanely valuable in decision making also i am not trying to come across as a smart ass genuinely curious in the conversation footballfanabc what is gp

  "therealtiddlydump maybe this is classic imposter syndrome maybe probably not you do not need another formal degree you are going to need to develop good self study habits to survive as a working data scientist anyways so start now find a math stats learning plan one you will actually stick to and start eating the elephant it takes time you will overestimate what you can do in a week and underestimate what you can do in a year thefriendlyfaceplant no college statistics sucks get the springer textbooks and work through the practice questions even youtube offers better material this one this one and if you need recalling anything you learned before this is by far the best refresher i was here some years ago my plan was to start recognise that it was me who wanted to improve not needing a new piece of paper telling me i was improved instead i would recomend working through text books and videos i found the great courses very good to start from school level maths all the way through to statistics degree mit have great resources on their youtube account t this is a slow program so i know i need to read up about new methods directly if work tasks required it evenmoreconfusednow i will provide some personal insights gathered as a hiring managerno tangible difference during the interviews between candidates with and without mastersuk based which could prove this biased phds with rare exceptions were lacking breadth of skills needed for the job but were standing out in one maximum two disciplinesi would never hire apart from those rare exceptions many candidates do not understand the fundamentals and i am not talking about math cv metrics workflows eda ml models many candidates have no software development skills habits deep learning irrelevant to the majority of companies and the majority of their problems if your end goal is a career in the field i would recommend focusing on and by utilising the plethora of free cheap internet material while doing that whenever you come across a math concept spend some time understanding it in a bit more depth reality is as important the math behind the algorithms are we spend time discussing it instead we discuss data metrics deployment and bugs obtaining another degree is an expensive undertaking in time money and effort i suggest study and experimentation focusing on the things you wish to know more about for statistics i highly recommendr r practice of business statisticsr by david s moore george p mccabe william m duckworth and stanley l sclover isbn r r r to learn about machine learning i recommend both of theser r computer systems that learnr by weiss and kulikowskir isbn r r data mining practical machine learning tools and techniquesr by ian h witten eibe frank mark a hall and christopher j palr the edition has isbn though older editions are fine and likely less expensive xamorphous out of curiosity where is your master is from feel free to pm if you do not want to share here edit also of the math you need is already implemented for an applied ds mle role if you want to implement novel ml models maybe a phd is appropriate but you can also mooc a lot of the math and work on a team as an applied mle swe supporting phd is for implementation your biggest hurdle is likely finding an appropriate role to which i can only say prep for interviews and build some stuff that you can talk about competently neffaddict sounds like my situation a bit i finished grad school and did not have even an hour of calculus from undergrad or graduate work but tons of tools and applied theory my solution is to long term shore up my quant skills with another masters specifically a masters of statistics in a focus area i enjoy i should be done with this path by but we will see how it goes i felt guilty landing my career roles without having a deep understanding of mathematics i felt it would only get worse as i progressed and began managing others so i have bit the bullet and am taking undergraduate calculus classes at my local uni i do think ds ml professionals should have understandings of the math behind the tools some industries more than others though just my two cents elus why not just do the study independently getting those formal credentials will not necessarily translate to more job offers especially if you are looking to go back at the undergrad level lordsemaj you do not need another degree success in this field requires you to learn on your own time learn the math mastery of programming and compsci is useless without understand what you are doing and why in my experience it is actually very harmful to add engineering types who do not think like a scientist to a ds team cocodirichlet sagemarker is just a tool what models are you taking about very few people do everything so you do not need to be an expert in a b testing unless you are applying for a job that is only causal inference i think this is more the problem of not knowing what jobs to apply for do you have a job or are you still looking for jobs eneiromatos keep working on your actual job until you really feels that you cannot learn any new meanwhile keep learning whatever you like do not overthink about your career you are doing pretty good pizzagarrett i would focus on upgrading from an okay programmer to being a good programmer through online courses even free youtube ones i would also follow online courses in linear algebra if you want to get better at the math no need for another degree theastyanax i had a similar path than you and i can smell a strong scent of impostor syndrome just remember that no one knows everything you will round up those edges of knowledge with more experience take it slow and be kind to yourself you have to actually learn the math slowly and systematically build a rock solid foundation of calculus and linear algebra at least yes please lack of knowledge will hurt you and your organization both because you will never really know what you are doing and someone like that informing decisions is as dangerous as a child with a gun i worked with a guy with a masters econ who did not know how weighted averages are computed i never trusted anything he said after i realized that he was missing something that basic if you are having issues with basic concepts like that then you would better catch up people here might say that you are probably okay but in my experience there is barely people working in the ds industry who truly know what they are talking about i have worked with people who are data scientists but cannot program to save their lives they retain their jobs because no one is there to question their abilities my advice keep that degree in a safe and forget about it until you know the basics do not use an algorithm or a methodology that you cannot describe do not use a tool you will not be able to debug suitupyo i am in the same boat i am a data analyst pursuing a ms in data science and i do not think i get enough math in my diet i work for the government so fortunately i have a super generous tuition reimbursement policy if my employer will keep paying i will probably tack on more math courses thegrandhedgehog i am in a similar situ as you though still on my ds masters i really wanted to know the underlying math so i just started googling stuff as i came across it recorded all my

already i would recommend focusing on that and studying whatever will actually help you in interviews that probably is not going to be deep learning the nice thing about doing a masters is you have a network you can lean on as well no waste of time just keep working entropyrx another degree is not going to fix the problem just going to wast time to study for passing exams as opposed to study to fill specific gaps you need to become comfortable with learning what you need outside school you cannot be an expert in everything so you can either specialize in one narrow domain and only work there or be comfortable with picking up concepts you may not have a thorough understanding yet if you google ucsd podcasts you can find a lot of lecture class podcast there there is many germane course including data science courses r python and a huge amount of computer science you can listen to any one that does not have the lock symbol yunikarn plenty of free resources are available i run a youtube channel which covers some of the stats and maths sonictoddler ya i am taking one currently you are probably right just gotta take it slow blackalbinoturtle just another option i am reading the practice of statistics for business and economics and it is been a breeze to follow throws in the hard theory then follows you on a step by step instructions to get the intuition about the theory none just curious is there a reason why you recommend these books over elements of statistical learning why do they suck tommychillfiger when i look back at college i always end up thinking a similar thing the entire degree is really just being assigned a menu of books discussing them working some problems then whatever assignments anytime i think of going back to school i think of how i could really just achieve that on my own especially if i find a group discord who are also studying similar things makes the cost benefit just not seem worth it i know the common next argument is well it takes a lot of self control to stick to it which is true but i also find a lot of this stuff interesting so even if i am ultimately a bit slower to learn i think i am fine with that sorry can you elaborate in wdym by standint out in one maximum two disciplines not phd but i do not quite understand and curios frequentiststats op you need this this is pretty much a solid piece for free i am not even exaggerating eipi yep this is my hiring experience too on all fronts jcelise i do not think cv is fundamentals sonictoddler syracuse sonictoddler i cleared up some of that wording i have a job as a ds and i do fine but it is a small company we solve problems with ds and build varying things like an report classification nlp model and a data pipeline that does some processing on legacy unstructured data and makes it useable but i am not like developing cv or ar products like big tech companies peacefullyfighting yeah leave that stuff to us engineers and architects brianckeegan and harmonic mean eneiromatos thank god not every person in tech has the same kind of thinking as you maybe your tech skills are one of a kind but i deeply feel that you lack the most basic soft skills and probably you are not as good as you believe i really think that mastering statistics is essential for any role related to data and analysis of data i do not know about how it is in industry but i believe that bootcamps are not enough to have the required nuances edit i mean data science is the definition of statistics and i hate that it is considered computer science taxxer user name bro checks out i have a hard time with the info available on internet i find it unclear and with too much jargon statquest thefriendlyfaceplant awesome i am buying this scottsteinerphd esl is a great book but it is more data science than stats thefriendlyfaceplant elements of statistical learning despite its title does not cover the basics of statistics it goes straight into the basics of machine learning it is not about you learning statistics it is about the computer using statistical learning methods it relies on complex formulas from the get go and is quite steep for someone who is behind on the basics scottsteinerphd esl is a great book but it is more data science than stats thefriendlyfaceplant they are research focussed whereas data science is business focussed in research you care about providing results that are meaningful within the context of other research which means most of the statistics if not all statistics will be taught from a frequentist perspective data science relies more on regression method and bayesian methods it includes frequentist statistics but it goes way beyond that scope in fact the overt focus on frequentist statistics is what stunts many students in their career treepeople evenmoreconfusednow what the rest said they lack in software business and soft skills this could be an unfair generalisation but it holds true in my case having interacted with at least of them on the flip side they are great at research picking up new tech skills and their approach to complex problems kinda like a t shaped employee they are very highly skilled in one or two disciplines but not that great at others probably what he meant is that those that have breadth range do well evenmoreconfusednow by cv i mean cross validation do you still think that did you stay in the region their program is a little info science ds not true ds i can understand why you feel you do not know the math well are you currently working if you in the field the degrees it should be enough cocodirichlet start by learning more about the methods you use in your job if you interview for other jobs then you can be an expert on those models if you use nlp models then learn about nlp models for instance wallymetropolis a tiny fraction of working data scientists are working on computer vision the stuff you are doing now will be very much employable and it will not pigeon hole you into only doing exactly this forever cute shut up how much maths do you know i have in no way implied anything about my skillset and being in a nascent field i have a long list of things i want to learn myself my impression is that a lot of people choose ds because it pays well and is as of yet unregulated the comment was based on my experience which includes dealing with people having bloated egos unrealistic expectations and a sense of entitlement i am unable to relate to our schools and universities hardly prepare us for the kind of problems thrown at us turning a blind eye to that hardly fixes that afai understand op is not here for sympathy but honest advice that is what i have shared honestly would you want a person helping with critical business decisions as a ds when they do not know basic maths thegrandhedgehog stat trek and khan academy have been my favourite resources so far but you are right a lot of jargon and confusing stuff from elsewhere people who just assume you know random shit like standard deviation is just the sqrt of the variance instead of explaining what both are how they are related and why when they are used synthphreak double bam wouldoesitevenmatterstatquest has been a lifesaver in my program that covers the application of different models but does not delve too deep into the foundations clearly convoluted oh my i love this channel what a gold mine thank you polus statquest is just the shit it is like the new boston but for stats but most research use linear models so basically they know too much hahahaha ah gotcha so too good at several thing especially technical but really bad at some important aspect on industries ah gotcha so their skill are not balanced basically and industries like a more well rounded peoplethanks sonictoddler you are correct i have a job as a ds and i have spent a lot of time working on the gaps i went out and learned oop because it was not taught i began diving into databases particularly graph and leaning into ds courses by learned some more advanced etl with stuff like airflow and kafka got familiar with sklearn pipelines and i am currently working into more of the aws ml tooling which are incredible btw i know how to learn the stuff i do not know as well i am also going through deeplearningai is mathematics for machine learning and data science specialization and working on some leetcode in any event i just have not been sure these mooc courses would be enough and if i am being honest i am closer to my than my at this point after i transitioned from the army so i just want the juice to be worth the squeeze if you know what i mean sonictoddler i gotcha i appreciate the advice peacefullyfighting your missing what i am saying and why i say leave it to us how much etl and database architecture do you have i made it through graduate econometrics and i definitely did not intuitively understand what r in multivariate regression was doing until starmer graphed it out edit i should have said i was not able to communicate what r meant until starmer graphed it and all my stakeholders require understanding not just accuracy thefriendlyfaceplant businesses need data science to be more than just hypothesis testing since you already have the degree no one is going to need to know where you learned additional stuff mooc or a degree regardless of where you learn it you do not know it until you have to use it at work and use it often simply put there is no degree program out there that is going to take the place of experience your best bet now is to have as much specific industry knowledge and domain expertise to grow your career cute yes it is better you focus on understanding the ones at hand to the brim then you can take some online courses to supplement for the ones you do not know do not stress yourself too much time was not built in a day joab_ well uh what does it mean yeah they want predictive models aka classification models

scientists moving from academia to industry not wanting to get their hands dirty with infrastructure and data engineering is a big problem trbigstick as you grundlepig pointed out it looks like you have done a lot of huge career switching op i saw this post of yours and wanted to give my two cents on career fulfillment first you gotta stop comparing yourself to your peers some people are better

job that puts you in a state of nirvana because you are so fullfilled and valued does not exist every job has parts of it that fucking suck for example i am an mlops engineer and my fianc\u00e9 is in

stakeholders on the ml side of ds a large portion of your job will consist of experimenting you will try lots of things that do not work before you find the thing that does if you cannot handle that because it feels like failure then ds may not be for you this was the case for a coworker of mine that came from a software engineering background totally could not handle long periods of not seeing results and left within a couple months noonecaresname after doing a days work you feel like killing yourself instead of just mild annoyance wignerville when you do not like to solve problems with a

visiting arxiv brings you cosmic lethargy i dislike statistics and linear algebra even though i like to think about data preparation dimensions data quality aggregations etc i went from ds ml to data

little kids at disney land by having them wear those magic bracelets that happen to have their age gender and location or you can do target teens with instagram which is known to cause depression pick your poison dzyang when autoarima does not give you the results your stakeholders hope for and you do not have any additional data to work with and because your experimental projects have yet to add

environment is perfect for me however it may not be for everyone some people find it strange that my dream job was sitting at home alone working on my computer all day however i think its due to the

an sde for years and found out that imo research work testing parameters doing complex calculations reading several papers is way more boring than engineering work building block after block until you get the full thing there are obviously overlaps especially now that i am a data engineer but generally i prefer to spend more time building also the mathematical barrier is tough miketythhon the biggest sign ds is not for you is if you are lazy lazy people have a hard time finding anything they like to do because they never put any effort in especially when it gets hard and they hit a road block if you are not lazy then ds is for everyone afkforlol i will give you two a strong aversion to failure if you do not fail well pretty much ds and swe related careers is a solid n years of a stupid little light box telling you how stupid you are when it is doing literally everything you told it to do an idealized separation of ds and swe mle you will should never live in a notebook doing kaggle esque problems if physically looking at your raw data or touching mlops is beneath you you will probably have a rough time being successful even if you have dedicated team members for those roles canyoupleasechill if you like clear instructions and routine work data science is not for you there is an art to data science and it is not always clear how to translate vague business problems into something you can solve with applied statistics and computing you will need the ability to think independently and creatively make reasonable assumptions and clearly explain your approach to both technical and nontechnical stakeholders getthejuicesflowing you will not know until you try ndpythn i still do not like math that much but i would like to learn data science any suggestions tapirtamer when you cannot bother to search the subreddit and assume you can cash in on a high paying career by taking a few udemy courses purplebrownupdown i think you have to like software engineering and building data pipelines a lot of ds is just getting the data in the right form eg a data matrix then the sky is the limit about what you can do therealdaviddavis you are unwilling to learn new material ds just the wrong field for you you would rather someone just tell you what to do than build a plan of action yourself and then execute some fields of software engineering might be better

none deleted aaquad want to point out one thing hating math is often conflated with hating how math was taught in school i hated math until i was able to focus on why it worked instead of how to make it work like derivatives and integrals are beautiful fascinating things if you are not stressed about remembering the rules of differentiation radiantvessel can you explain the relevance depravation

can choke down the best i will take shitty code shitty infra and endless diagnosing error messages over deal with people issues in my previous career i have had the same experience moving into engineering gave me more quantifiable tasks pipeline sla data integrity etc kalelthanks for this i have been wanting to switch to data science but currently working as a business analyst and honestly i do not like explaining stuff to stakeholders either although it is a large requirement for my job good thing my position is remote and there is only a few ppl i have to explain my work too mainly using ms excel rn but it is still a little difficult for me social anxiety and introvertedness and all so i figure roles in data science and data analysis most likely require great communication skills which probably is not very suitable for me data engineering might be a better option what programs do you recommend learning and gets a heads start in sql python what else speedis notfree luckily i have found that i enjoy the process of getting to failure and learn lots along the way so i can tolerate it a few more years into this and i am not so sure i will petburiraja this also reminds me about marketing which also have a lot of experimenting within it arturus rex that sounds like every hobby and passion of mine a terrible time i had to build a predictive model in my case study for my job and now i mostly build tableau dashboards it is amazing how many firms want to do advanced analytics work but they are still so far behind on basic descriptive statistics reports imacpamd sounds like digital marketing on computer steroid chzburgerrandy i am selling people things they do not want when i do not know what they need icanelectoo yep synthphreak zoomer gen z boomer or you do not know what a harmonic mean is subjectadlol this is me i fuckin hated reading ml papers it is funny because i majored in pure math since i loved doing proofs so i thought data science would be a good field it is mathy after all but it turns out that engineering either data engineering or ml engineering is actually a much better fit for me i feel like engineering is more akin to solving proofs because you are essentially solving logical puzzles in both it scratches a similar itch at least reading ml papers never scratched that itch for me so for any pure math majors reading this do consider data engineering or mle positions that are more engineering heavy kansha do you like programming more than math i am considering to switch my career path from ds to de as programming makes my life more happier than contemplating about harmonic means speedis notfree no matter how much time i spend on stats it never feels like enough to be competent i never had this learning engineering maths in mech eng i feel the pull of de because i can learn new tech much faster almostfreitag yeah before ds i did consultant jobs for tobacco and oil industries fucking hell that is some bad karma synthphreak do you want to spend most of your time doing math do not be a data scientist where that is about of the job since when does of something equal most of it are you me lol i hated math during my cs undergrad but now doing my ms i am annoyed when professors do not delve into the gradient descent for example in undergrad not a single professor bothered to tell me what a derivative can actually do once i found out on my own i love it educational institutions need to focus more on the why radiantvessel math is actually very interesting when it is taught in a way that is connected to our reality rather than just abstract concepts in space eightstream finance is a more powerful and important function than data science in most organisations as a fellow hk player and absolute radiance slayer i like your username sql python are good starts i think you can head over to r dataengineering for more advice on moving into engineering grundlepig also looking at your post history and consideration of switching from med to ds bro are you well in the head grundlepig literally of maang funlovingamadeus zoomer simply gen z since they were schooled on zoom the fact that it rhymes with boomer is just for fun taxxer what up with this harmonic mean reference that is all over this sub lately i fee like i missed something porkball if you liked math and science you can probably figure out a harmonic mean it is not exactly rocket science after all definitely sometimes it feels a bit overwhelming to stay ahead of all of the new tools that apparently appear on a daily basis and how they integrate with each other but i guess it is just the same as with ds ml tarehman i think you misread my point if you want to spend most of your time doing math you should not be a data scientist because that is a very small amount of the actual job edited sorry if there is a dozen copies of this comment blame the mobile app laughingwalls they do the problem is most people do the minimum requirements for their degree and do not go much further you do not really see how calculus and linear algebra is applied if you do not take subjects that require them happysunshinekidd completely disagree that is why there are many styles i have tried reading ml textbooks that are learn through this project where i hand wave technical reasoning eg the pytorch book the geron book it is great to dip your feet and i am sure the learning style works well for many but i just disconnect if i do not have that abstract sauce throughout radiantvessel funny i work in finance right now i am considering data science because it seems more interesting i guess the grass is always greener on the other side fiwer yeah dude is on his second career switch from something high paying maybe the career is not the problem totally reasonable to need counseling in career hopping is not the answer livid do not worry op if you are switching a lot it does not mean you are not well there is shit you are figuring out and maybe doing ds might be for you i hope reddit does not make you think poorly of yourself magrik lmao flubberblubberrubber zoomer was around before zoom school covid based on gen z boomer calmsticks there was a post a while ago from iirc a recruiter giving advice to any would be ds this included an emphasis on understanding harmonic mean which i am led to believe is not actually very important for ds the post contained various other bits of questionable advice although i thought some of it was sound and was widely roasted before deletion however their level of confidence that harmonic mean was a staple of ds knowledge has made it a funny item to reference when talking about ds capabilities therealstepbot no harmonic mean is the pinnacle of data science achievement without it you are not going anywhere eightstream not greener just different when you are in finance you get used to being involved in important operational and strategic decisions as a data scientist you are very much a technical specialist you are a lot less likely to end up as a coo or ceo some people do not mind that but others hate it magrik some people just have a hard time staying in one place for too long it is very common with adhd savethepandabears the post in question hi all so today was another day of interviewing data scientists today it was juniors grads and journeymen people who have got years under their belt i thought i would give some background thoughts and comments if you are reading this you may well be interested in it context first i lead a fairly big data group with platform engineers data engineers and mi bi team an analyitics team and a data science team and i will say that i am personally fairly strong in the space with a lot of real world experience rather than a nonsense manager talking rubbish from above really importantly i do not work for a data company or a tech company i work for a private company in the uk who makes money by doing other things of the staff do not care about data it is a pain in the backside they just want to do business and make money so at least some of what i say here does not apply for the pure tech space maybe today i had down selected cv is to interviews and will take two people forwards thats okay do not worry about the other people if you are interviewing though just be better than them lastly for context i pay pretty well top half of the salary band for the north of england so this is not about scraping the bottom of the barrel the basics wash brush your hair wear a shirt or a blouse smile talk about something when we meet how was your weekend i am a human breathe when you get the job unless you work at a fancy bank then no one cares what you look like but it is about playing the game and the game is i know the rules of an interview a shirt will get you more points than a tshirt women you are slightly already winning a lot is made of women in data science and thats great it is a great career but the reality is that both myself and pretty much all the people in my position automatically assume that a woman is slightly better than an equivilant guy and certainly slightly more pragmatic do not worry about the gender thing you are already very slightly ahead we want the pragmatic and the sensible rockstars are a pain in the backside the three best hires of my life were all female data scienstists of the top data scientists in the uk and maybe the world at the moment are female just be you the tougher stuff guys you have to know your maths data science is about getting sh done it is not enough to know a few algorithms and a bit of python and want in on a job being really brutal i can pick up a regular python developer with years dev experience and have them learn some algorithms and they would be more productive than someone who is in the pet algorithm camp you need to know your maths stats especially you need really good stats and when i say that i do not at all mean advanced stats i mean rock solid general stats all the basic stuff that gets glossed over why are we using a normal distribution when this is an alpha skew why are you using a linear regression for a dynamic system i need you to know a harmonic mean and when to use it i really need you to be aware of things like a birthday paradox becuase every manager that you ever help out will not know it fundementals will always beat a nice algorithm biases somewhere between and of the work you get asked to do will be flat out stupid mostly because of biases and nonsense thinking wikipedia is list of biases page is amazing it will save you more time get you more promotions and save your employer more time than you will ever achieve with a tweak to a codebase go devour it and then tell me when im being dumb here is a nice answer gets you good points in an interview here is a nice answer but you need to be careful about x gives you huge points in an answer be fanatical about money heres the thing you want a career in data science great me too but we are in the extreme minority the companies paying your salary are interested in results and those need to be hefty if you are working for and your company is working on a margin they need of value out of you just to break even so your work is not about the work itself it is about the outcomes of the work make sure when you get asked the interview questions that you are always thinking whats the end result here and answer that not just the specific question the best algorithm to use in this case is x bad answer the best algorithm to use in this case is x because of a b c good answer the best algorithm to use in this case is x but it takes a lot of effort so if we are just exploring a problem i would probably have a quick check with y first as it is a hour job and will show us the value quickly as a test amazing answer consider yourself recuited if you are taking online courses like datacamp etc brilliant i love to see this but take the extra hours to do a introduction to business basics instead or as well you will leapfrog your peers be pragmatic unless you are working for a tech outfit where data science is their bread and butter then the task is getting stuff done find your stakeholder some value be ready to talk about prototypes failing fast iteration be ready to say i do not know but i would be thinking about x y and z how can you take a big problem and break it down into a bunch of small quick tests to see if you are on the right track keep telling me that bad data is death the killer of all data science and the constant frustation of your end users is that bad data wrecks models i know this i do this for a living i hope you know this i really want you to know this but you need to tell me more than once how would you do x i would do a pca and then a quick d tree to get a view of it meh okay how would you do x i would do a pca and see if the results seem logical if they do not then i would go ask someone to have a look otherwise i am wasting my time then i would do a quick d tree amazing amazing consider yourself the reciepient of a new office pass i do not know but gets you almost as many or sometimes even more points than i know this remember that unless you are going for the roles you are not assumed to know everything what worries a hiring manager a lot is someone who cannot see their gaps you are the guys that cause us chaos not knowing the answer in an interview is okay if you pull it back what is your experience with svm classifiers nothing sorry okay maybe you lose some points whats your experience with svm classifers i have heard they are hard and a bit twitchy if i needed to learn them i would spend a couple of evenings before hand playing at home with the iris dataset and scikit to get a feel for them so at the moment my experience is low but i think i would be useful with them in the space of a few days boom amazing data prep data prep data prep you will spend way more of your time doing data prep than actual coding and data science work a data science job is really cursing at messy data fixing messy data and then doing a bit of other stuff along the edges show me you can do it show me that you can fix up some data in a data frame show me you know why a one hot is important show me that you have the basics of sql and if i do not bring it up in the interview force it into the conversation with me lastly ask me questions it does not matter what you can literally make them up on the spot or have a handful of questions you use for lots of interviews but ask me questions plural partly it is something i am looking for as part of the interview itself but partly it makes you more human it makes you seem engaged and excited ask me hard questions whats the biggest problem you guys have had in the last year whats the biggest challenge i will find when i join what do you wish was different about your data group this was a lot of words if anyone has any specific questions then post them and i will try and respond petburiraja damn it sounds like some monologue from old tarantino movie inevitable frame can we pin this somewhere",

  "glassbottlecokes my personal opinion read job postings for companies and careers you are interested in to get a rough idea of what qualifications come up most often best of luck therealtiddlydump high frequency time series data is a very lucrative niche i do not know that i would do a full career reset because of a lay off that said if you are interested in data engineering go for it i saw this making the rounds recently on a data engineering subreddit let is say you do transition to de and ultimately find out you do not really like it as much oh no you now have incredibly valuable experience that will only make you a better data scientist if you want to transition back to ds full time the horror arenaone okay my opinion as someone that is currently interviewing for sr mle and feels that is lagging behind and has not really learned anything in the last at his current place you probably need to catch up with a lot of things many companies have a first screener based on either leetcode or some kind of programming based on data structures this is a fact even if you do not agree with it or feel like it has nothing to do with the job so try to refresh that no need to be an expert on dynamic programming but definitely need to feel confortable around dictionaries heaps stacks sets trees etc second as the previous post stated ml ds is very very broad and comes in all different types of flavors figure out what you want to do next and in what kind of companies look at openings and target your learning towards that for example if you want to work on computer vision look at a few job openings and learn what you need to check the boxes meaning get a dataset or better scrape a dataset and build multiple models based on what you would want to work on no need to list those on the resume but that way you can talk in depth and from a hands on experience having end to end experience on putting things in production beats everything however this might be less needed if you are aiming for researcher roles if you want a research role focus then you need to grab a couple of the latest papers published on the topic you are interested on and implement them yourself overall i wish you good luck i have been studying like crazy myself almost everyday until it is very tiring but it will pay off finally if you already know you are getting laid off i would probably start doing the bare minimum at work take sick days here and there to work on things you want to do you do not own them anything and they are going to get rid of you cocodirichlet choosing a sexy domain because it is sexy is not a good idea why do you want to move out of your current focus there companies asking for people doing a combination of ds quant user research product ds in the wearable technology space or even with other type of hardware like phones you could focus on expanding your ds toolkit in this area rather than make a substantial change thanks i got impression that data engineers are in high demand and they are pretty domain agnostic unlike data scientists this is actually one of the most comprehensive courses i saw ever and it is free because literally every step is explained and walked through it is relatively easy to repeat after a mentor which gives instant gratification then one needs to figure out what he just did and why by googling and reading reading but i like this way better than traditional courses where you are loaded with explanations on what and why but than have to figure out yourself how exactly that needs to be done i started a week ago it is tough but moving hopefully i can spend more time soon thanks cool that you see it is paying off for you implementing papers would be an ultimate test next level so far i read through public kaggle notebooks and find these quite insightful but this covers only the part of model creation yes i already do bare minimum as well as most of my colleagues expectation of layoffs brings a company to paralysis until it is over wearable tech especially within the biomedical research space is bound to small datasets and complex privacydata governance routines i am kind of tired of linear regressions manual feature generations and process compliance i know there is no ideal spot but just want to explore smth else and this seems like a good moment therealtiddlydump do not be shy about sharing your experience with it when you are done good luck",
  "slalommclalom r and python each have their pros and cons learning both in your program is a great way to get a feel for both in case you do need to switch between them in your career i personally stick to r for most eda and ad hoc analyses and then often switch to python for projects that will go to production just be thankful you are not forced to learn sas in addition to r python like we were in my undergrad jacobcharleskillian you want to be multilingual as a developer i mean unless you want to be doing the equivilent of writing cobol in years this is a continuous learning profession get used to it it is okay to learn both i took only one class with python and with r i wished i had a more balanced education since i have used both as a data scientist picapaodiablo i think the syntax differences are beyond trivial for ds and bordering on a waste of time to discuss the models and libraries are what matter understanding those and understanding them well understanding the underlying data you have and what you want to do with it this subject comes up all the time here there is so much borderline religious fervor on it and i have yet to see a notable compelling argument on why it matters if you are writing a regression for instance it is nearly identical in both file io reading a data frame filtering frames executing sql statements making api calls it is almost identical okay tabs instead of braces and assignment operators are different but that is trivial compared to well anything that matters no at this point you can use tools to convert from one language to another and imho in the professional world you have to flip through languages all the time r vs python is like the difference between portuguese and spanish if you were having to work with clojure and java i get it but not here and i ssupect the ide you use will make more of a difference in productivity and code than either language therealtiddlydump it is probably better to use only but this is a common problem often driven by the professors knowledge for example i had to use sas for a forecasting class the only course in my entire ms using that steaming pile of crap that was his tool of choice which sucked for the rest of us the exposure_ to both r and python is not bad in practice however you will want to pick one and get really good at it i want to hire someone who can actually use a tool to do a job not someone who sucks at using tools and is frustrated by the inability to complete work as a result delicious view some somewhat aggresive comments here but i get you op it is like learning new languages and the debate exists there too like does learning french and italian at the same time harm the language acquisition process thing is even in that analogy the views can be different depending on whether we are asking spanish italian similar vs french japanese different op is not denying both languages are popular in ds nor is op denying that any language is pointless to learn op is not even saying one is better than the other merely asking what our take is on learning both at the same time legit and good question as a polyglot in both human and programming languages i would say that there are more advantages to learning both at the same time than there are disadvantages and there indeed are pros and cons my only advice is to try and be as idiomatic as possible in each language as possible this way you are able to appreciate how and why things are done the way they are in each language herchuntsdirty my program is the same i find it awesome that we are using both although sometimes i do wish the machine learning was done entirely in python dl ml ds aspirant lucky you i had to learn r sas matlab and spss learning r and python together is something that i really wished that i had experienced if you have institutional access through your university i would strongly recommend a tour of data science learn r and python in parallel nailong zhang psychological suit totally disagree i was in an r box for too long and looking back it really constricted what i could do programming is programming once you get how to write good code the language becomes something you can pick up by reading docs and stackoverflow slashdave if you are enrolled in a data science program and the biggest challenge is learning the syntax of python or r then something is very wrong defaultkh i learnt r in university and use it since over years now i start learning python because all my colleagues know it and we plan to switch to that for teaching maybe it makes sense to first concentrate on one language until you are good at it maybe you do not have to wait years and then try to learn the second one it really does not hurt to know both gottabemd i am currently learning sas stata python r sql and ms access i think it is a great strategy to expose yourself to several different programs you will find which ones come more naturally to you and learn how to prioritize the software you find more challenging that and you get to decide for yourself which program you could do xyz more optimized with for example if i want to run basic statistical analyses i am probably going to use stata but if i want to make nice visualizations i will probably use the seaborn library in python bizarrejellyfish honestly i think learning both at the same time is helpful in the long run if you learn one language in depth first you may have a tendency to think and frame your processes and data structures in that first language even when coding in the second language this can make thinking and switching to another language a lot harder if you learn both at the same time your problem formulation and implementation will be much more versatile and less restricted this will make it much easier to learn other languages sas etc in the future than if you started with just r will always be biased to thinking in r dataframes and processes or just python will always be biased to thinking in python objects and processes ddanieltan i think it is the right approach the message should be that the tools python r you use are pretty arbitrary and a graduate from the program should feel confident in implementing the problem solving methodology regardless of the programming environment also does not hurt your employability to be adept at both mattpython it is a blessing in disguise vishal vora python and r is just a language i think the main idea is to learn how to solve the problem or find the solution in my case i have started with r and after some time i got to know there is many limitations compared to python so i switched entirely on python without much problems deto if the students are just learning programming i would not have them learn two languages at the same time instead would focus on one and then have the other introduced in a later year but if the students are expected to know some programming to begin with and it is a short program then i could see it being set up this way to maximize the exposure for job opportunities later bezoomychellovek between undergrad and grad school although not data science programs i had to learn vba matlab arduino based in c c sas bash and python i learned r for fun in grad school and have used it a ton since i started out in java in high school i think it can be really useful knowing multiple languages i find it makes it easier to learn new languages as you go along okvermicellii am in undergrad and learning sas along with them for my stats class lol pataouga wo not the switch back and forth bring negative results as such forgetting things you got taught in python because you are more into r for a week sunandskyandrainbows which ide do you suggest pataouga thank you kind sir that is what i was thinking and the responses were out of subject pataouga hey guys just chill i already know a lot of python and r i just asked a question to know if i have to master one language first and then the other instead of getting taught both simultaneously picapaodiablo a fellow carnegie mellon tartan picapaodiablo no honestly no as you learn them you will see how they are more similar than different i use this example the most but what does a regression look like in python vs r they are the same object notation and properties are nearly identical for most any library you would be using in either the differences between python two times and three times are more profound than between python and r and when you know what you want to do it is easy to find the synax fileopen where filename is a string there is more overlap than difference therealtiddlydump if you forget stuff after a week you are fucked it can be months between using a modeling approach or framework practice and experience help but you need to learn strategies to recall skills statsnpolisci i get that keeping two languages in your brain at the same time can feel taxing however it is common practice even at the initial stages one of the keys is that you are not supposed to memorize exact syntax you are supposed to have templates of code for replicating the relevant code structure know the general concepts the code is intended to perform and know how to google for answers keep you prior code saved commented and organized you should be pulling up the preexisting code replicating a lot of the syntax and frankly doing a decent amount of copy paste at this stage eventually you may move to a stage where you are not expected to copy paste code but a ton of data people do a lot of copy paste modify add new code beeadvised rstudio is the best for r it works with python too but i use vs code for python instead it just has better extensions imo if i need to combine r and python i use rstudio like with rmarkdown or quarto especially sunandskyandrainbows do you have any suggestions my main problem is i just cannot retain a lot of information and find myself constantly googling things i really should know and am embarrassed i have to google picapaodiablo yep agree i used atom and sublime although atom is a dead end now therealtiddlydump stop feeling embarrassed for one that is how you learn bookmark stuff revisit your own code from time to time etc you will get there beeadvised i have been programming years and use google every day at work it is normal i promise i think a good programmer is someone who knows how to ask google the right question when they are stuck on a problem it will get easier with experience too but yea i am always googling and reading package documentation and adapting what i find to work for my specific code",

  "an all day_ interview please tell me they are paying you collectfromdepot do not have a finance background however i suspect they evaluating how you work rather than what you can achieve for example if they give you a data set of ice cream consumtion in a country and ask about evaluating investment in a chain of ice cream parlours here are some of the things they might be interested in can you work autonomously to relate a vague business question to the data set you were given are your technical skills strong enough that you can interrogate the data effectively and use a broad range to features of the tools to support your thinking things like creating moving averages using idiomatic pandas etc can you tie everything together into a coherent answer to the question supported by data with the ability to talk about the reliability of the data methods given the time paretto things to look out for time management ia critical if you cannot do something move on and try something else time box every step do not overpolish it is presumably okay to write ropy code and just bang bullet points on a slide explain why these trade offs were made edit be prepared for a tough interview they may want to see how you perform under pressure it is not personal i do not have experience in finance but i am a senior data scientist with experience in retail the key is to show them that you can produce reasonable results in the time available sometimes you will have to do a last minute presentation for a client or a partner and you will only have a couple of hours to do it hence this test some suggestions practice how to do a basic eda there is no way of knowing what the dataset will be like but practice with whatever you have so you do not waste too much time trying to remember how to plot a time series or how to generate a histogram create a good narrative around the dataset what value will your analysis bring how can it be used how can it be extended once you have more time work with simple models let is be real it is very unlikely that you will be able to create a complex model with the time given to you remeber that the main goal is to produce a reasonable result for example say that you are given sales data from a retailer and are asked to forecast the next months there is not enough time to create a very advanced deep learning model in fact if i were evaluating you and you came up with trying to do that i would question your judgment instead create a simple benchmark a moving average or an ets and some machine learning model xgboost with a small number of relevant features for example price after presenting the results of these models you can talk about more advanced models and how you would create them create a nice ppt template beforehand if the company gives you one use it but if not then you will have one already and will not waste time with that be confident when presenting the results it is hard to imagine making much progress on quite an undirected task in that little time forget about this this is the wrong mentality to have as i said before the company knows you can only do so much with the time given to you so show them you can produce reasonable results independently and in a short time frame good luck none time management i assume during the day they will tell you pretty much what they looking for from you at first thing to do when the day starts chunk your day into steps depending what they ask try to estimate how much time you need for each step to achieve your goal it will be vital to not go with the mindset i can try one thing more split your time like coding drafting the model produce the viz qc your results create a quick presentation of your findings of course that is just an example try to chunk it however works better for you but also what you think they care more they care about clean code spend some time making nice functions do they care only about the output spend more time on pretty viz good luck nope not even covering travel collectfromdepot i assume the package is substantial and with significannot scope to grow chasinggreenroads what does traveling involve here a minute commute i hope so these people seem to make a point of communicating as little about the role as possible my approach is try to get an offer first ask questions later haha this post was not supposed to be about the unfriendly practices of a certain hedge fund but no it involves getting from oxford to london i am aware this is not great treatment but i need a job",
  "wouldfphd the most common reason is that it becomes clear they do not have as much experience or as much depth of experience with something that we either think is important or with something that they portrayed themselves as being proficient in someone who moves to an interview stage is generally going to be someone whose resume is exactly what we are looking for so if the person that i interview is the person in the resume odds are you are going to keep moving through the process unless a there is another candidate who is even better or b your personality is absolutely impossible to deal with for most roles i have hired i have not had multiple candidates to choose from it almost always ends up being one person who is good and then we hire them so the people that do not move forward are normally people who for example said they had experience deploying machine learnings in production and when you ask them tell me about a model you have taken to production they say well i have a script in matlab that i run in my laptop once a month and then dump the results in a production database the most common reason is that what they are looking to do is not what we need them to work on this tends to normally be people who want to be building deep learning models and i know in the role i am hiring for they will be lucky to build a logistic regression calminky top reasons for not moving forward in the interview process only wanting to do ml dl i am not here to clean data i am not doing data engineering etc having totally unreasonable salary expectations i just graduated from a bootcamp and you have to pay me at least pro year this is going to be my first ds position after working as a da for a year my base salary should be at least being arrogant lacking basic interpersonal skills we had several technically skilled candidates that we did not not move forward with since they were condescending arrogant etc forbiscuit when we are down to from at that point the possess solid technical mathematical skills technical rounds but the successful candidate in interview rounds is someone who can articulate their ideas very well primary reason being our core team communicates with management leadership teams often to present ideas and recommendations the candidates should be able to withstand questions going off the script and have the ability to course correct wisely eljefeky at my company a surprising number of people fail to answer very basic mathematical questions from the recruiter for example what is the expected value if you roll a standard unweighted die about get a question like this wrong and do not move forward picapaodiablo lying on resume and not knowing a fraction of what they say and giving robotic answers uchimata hard to put just one reason on it but i guess if i had to say anything it is an inability to connect their technical skills to strong business outcomes every phd i interview is very smart but many of them are too concerned with the intricacies of modeling and not concerned enough with driving actual value via predictive analytics bikeskata sometimes it is not that you are bad sometimes it is just that someone else is better medianstatistics bad communication skills no interest in the job djalaskaandrew focusing more on the technicals than the problems we are trying to solve ml is not the best option for of problems which can be solved with something much simpler like linear regression or a moving average model adonisvonmegadong they have no understanding of the harmonic mean of the time its behavioral not the technical part prize flow looking for a job is somewhat like trying to get a date in that there is no obligation for a company to pick you even if you think you are the perfect candidate unfortunately you will never know exactly what they are looking for whether there are others that are equally as qualified a better fit etc best thing is to never take it personally and remember that hugely successful people experience failure all the time aninquiringmind failure to grasp the basic understanding that they are there to deliver value for the business and at the end of the day that is what matters most a data scientist who delivers tangible measureable business improvements through basic reports and visualizations is worth more than one with a huge methodology toolbox that wields it around to do little other than satisfy their own ego sadly this has become a bigger problem in the last few years thanks to the inherently fractured nature of the discipline likesrustyspoons people who clearly just want to tune hyperparameters and noodle with model training or they have self taught on kaggle and think data cleaning is filling outlier values with something at least for our team at least of the job is extraction and wrangling working with smes to understand the data sometimes it is pretty clear some candidates expect to spend all their time training and optimising models but afaik that is not really many jobs at all like that i pretty much ignore anything mentioning house price prediction or similar stale projects at this point v0archnemesis my big ones interpersonal skills team fit we have a good dynamic and if you are not going to fit i do not want you running my existing team out dislike data engineering and do not want to do it i get it is not everyone is most preferred activity but you have gotta do it sometimes know how to call ml libraries but do not understand statistics trnka we had the process phone screen technical homework review full loop and keep in mind this is for building machine learning models for a product common problems in homework review there just was not much depth to the solution like it barely solved the problem minimal awareness of how the model was performing like not having baselines no investigation of model errors poor code quality like there is no structure to the code and no effort into making it readable for others common problems in the full loop we interviewed for our core values and sometimes we just did not get much evidence either way from the candidate despite a lot of prompting and help other times we might see hints of red flags once in a while we would have someone that could handle a homework style technical assessment but did not understand how to design machine learning systems that is usually a sign that someone is just too junior for a role cellularcone tthey will not shut up about machine learning despite not knowing what it is ttotal social ineptitude recently started interviewing people for ds role few candidates we have not moved past the interview is because they either have too less experience they have simply mugged up a model or how a process works and if you try to ask them along the same line they fumbles to show even basic understanding of the problem paddyalton thinking about the people who i have moved from the initial round into the later stages but then rejected they are usually people who look good on paper so their cv checks off the essential skills we are looking for they have a bunch of the nice to haves and their application demonstrates good written communication skills there are no red flags at this point what goes wrong the next stage probably involves a real time conversation and or a technical skills assessment examples of things that go wrong follow in order of most to least common their description of their skills was unreasonably inflated_ this is pretty self explanatory we wanted certain skills they said they had them that turned out to be at best a big stretch and now i am annoyed because they took someone else is interview slot a cv is an advert but you can take it too far lacklustre technical exercise_ a good technical measures more than just whether you can import scikit learn a lot of solutions i see are frankly a bit disappointing once you have seen a few good solutions you know it is not the exercise that is at fault chances are the people we reject at this point would need too much support day to day outcompeted_ data is a competitive space at junior levels i generally get a few great candidates for junior mid roles that is a nice position to be in when hiring but it sucks for the great candidates who miss out i know i have been on the receiving end too bad match_ an interview is a two way street i am trying to pitch the company and the role to candidates if it emerges that the company is the wrong environment for them or they will not be working on the stuff that really interests them that is not a good sign the aim here is to find people who are going to stick around for a few years and sure i do not expect everyone to be in the job for life but i want new hires to have plenty of room to grow people stagnating and leaving after years is a massive drain on the team red flag_ i have had a lot of luck not_ interviewing horrible people and not everyone has to be nice nice but we do try and test for culture fit occasionally something crops up where the interviewer realises that the candidate may be perfect for the role but not the team they will personally do well but at the expense of everyone else better to catch it at interview than six months after hiring therealtiddlydump answering every what would you do question with the most complicated advanced algorithms they know instead of starting simple as a default position that is the easiest way i have found to filter people out that and pre canned answers if i ask explain regularization and when you would use it any they start drawing the ridge v lasso plots from islr they are not getting another interview alarmingbooksqlthey mention all kinds of fancy deep learning xgfsdtgboost models on their cv but cannot even get past the simple sql screening round photogndallas i take a somewhat holistic approach to hiring not involving essential oils lol but look at the whole person i start with the resume if you strip out all of the puffery and ats beating bs words does that resume communicate a few basic things am i seeing continuous growth if not this person most likely lacks any intellectual curiosity am i seeing any skill at problem solving have they been given hard problems to solve and how did they solve them this tells me more about what their previous employers thought about their skills than i would ever get from a reference check you do not get hard problems if you only efficiently generate do i think you would add value to my team depending on my evaluation of those questions and the basic skills i need i will select my top or candidates for in person interview in the interview process i will probe those areas intently asking a mix of technical and behavioural questions i am looking to see if they lied on their resume about what the have done literally had to remind one candidate on top of page it says only to find out that project was a friends work project and to get a sense of how they solve problems i give little weight to things like technical tests leetcoding challenges and the like chatgpt can write code i need someone who can think critically break problems down to the atomic level and assemble those elements in creative and efficient ways so to your question remember the only two things you can be interviewed on are the details of the job they are hiring for and the information you gave them if you did not progress something was lacking in one of those two areas let the intervie questions be your guide as to where they might have lost interest it could have been that nothing was lacking but someone else was just better suited or presented themselves better cheesecakep for me it is when people start rambling about a past project with no structure and clarity when they have zero enthusiasm about past projects or in general evenmoreconfusednow fail the technical part depending on seniority of the position i am looking for different things in the take home assignment the second reason is fail in presenting their work and handle difficult questions live feedback related to their work thephoenixrisesagain lack of team fit lack of communication skills lack of ability to translate business problems into data problems kodyonthekeys my department is positions often fall into the class of data analyst jobs with a ds title thus we often interview more junior level candidates who fail basic sql python problems we give them that is the most common reason for failure at that level if skilled candidates fail it is definitely for behavioral reasons lordsemaj a poor foundation in experimental design and causal inference most business questions are looking for actionable inference cause and effect the amount of ds i interview that know how to build a deep learning model but cannot tell me what a confounder is is quite remarkable there is an over supply of engineers and under supply of scientists for me it is mostly if i do not vibe with you in the interview as in you come across as someone that i am gonna bump heads with or i do not feel like you are a good cultural fit stpetepatsfan i am going to hopefully get data certification this spring but have no experience so that is probably why also not someones bosses newly graduated nephew maybe i should have chosen web development but no experience there too but at least my portfolio would stand on its own i suppose bangcycleza i do technical assessments of candidates who have had an intro interview already and the intro will usually filter out people who are not interested cannot communicate coherently etc at the technical stage the rejections are relatively rare and are generally because my assessment of the candidate is abilities past experience code quality problem solving do not match the level we are looking for or do not match the expected salary range provided by the candidate we try to provide feedback on request when we reject but it is not always practical given the number of applicannots while it can be constructive and help candidates to grow and improve and builds relationships and expectations with the recruiters we use it also opens us up to back and forth conversations which are sometimes unproductive so it is a bit of a balance to be struck phainom the ability to translate a business problem into a data problem and give a precise and correct answer to how approach the data problem eg how to set up the training data for the ds use case in the interview tmotytmoty they cannot communicate stats to the layman happysummereither they are too expensive or i cannot tell if they have the actual technical expertise it is nice to have worked on project x that moved metric y by z percent but that is not going to translate to our business i usually need to know what they used in their work or can do and too generic answers are not enough in many cases they may well be the right people it is the interview format that fails we have a full day coding assessment and it generally does an excellent job of finding talent if you do not move past the later stages it is usually because we discover that salary or role expectations are not quite aligned very occasionally it might be because the candidate does not communicate clearly or because the candidate shows some non coding gap in real world application for example cannot articulate why a coefficient has the wrong sign hudseal i do not think this sub deserves you dfphd i really enjoy the advice you give here consistently the best tips i see here edit typo because phone blasketbasket great answer geldersekifuzuli what about if the hiring team does not have enough experience i am an nlp data scientist many companies i interviewed had no idea about the field they were asking me about rule based models they did not have enough understanding about transformers models and did not have expertise to evaluate my skill set i could not pass those interviews but i got offers from way more challenging companies because we could have a rich and deeper discussion during interview sessions afkforlol came here to say this my experience as a hiring manager as well livingteachingthanks for bringing value to this sub if you were dealing with someone with a couple years of da experience and recently graduated from a masters course in ds assuming they are a good candidate what is the highest salary you would expect to bring them in on xelaxander i do not understand why people try to come over as arrogant you can absolutely put on an agreeable personality be proud of your skills and squeeze someone on salary no need to be a twat and diminish your chances bannedbutbackbaby were those numbers real stories also the person who is able to communicate is easier to manage trying to extract status updates from the ultra introvert can be excruciating footballfanabc wdym by down to from djalaskaandrew footballfanabc it is expected for robotic answers if they applied for robotics position melcache or more suited for the specific skills required grvlagrv thank you i needed to hear this the job hunting grind has been wearing me down was starting to question my skills and everything footballfanabc always this is the number one reason there are a ton of great candidates out there footballfanabc why ultimately you are right the rest of this thread is trying to tip toe around this point ghostofkilgore i usually weed these candidates out during the harmonic mean takehome stage unless they are female obviously then we will assume that they are a generally better candidate footballfanabc harmonic median hudseal i am at a nonprofit that is pretty visible in my city and the number of would be interns saying they can revolutionize what they do with the most convoluted stuff imaginable because they took one ml class in undergrad or worse business school maxtothej if i ask explain regularization and when you would use it any they start drawing the ridge v lasso plots from islr they are not getting another interview that seems like a reasonable start of a solution pre canned questions beget pre canned answers shot you do not get hard problems if you only efficiently generate has anyone ever told you during the interview that you are an insufferable condescending obnoxious person yet i would like to know where you work to avoid your employer like the plague footballfanabc like how protons communicate with electron in our product feature call your mother pls ehhhh when i am in interviews i get nervous an ramble it is not a reflection of my quality nor organization just nerves there but i am with you about the enthusiasm sometimes it is tough to muster enthusiasm leaving a crappy job but you should at least find the topic or problems interesting the other thing is interviewing people who clearly did not research the job or company i get that interviewing is a numbers game but please understand what the company actually does footballfanabc well if the project was already years ago i am not surr one can remember every details to be enthusiastic calminky start networking and researching potential employers on linkedin you can generate your own opportunities especially if you have a good portfolio portfolio experience easy conversation starter ask for honest feedback on your portfolio or how a day as ds at that company really looks like etc ps if you do not have a portfolio start building something on a public dataset you find interesting try to understand the data ideally also clean it generate a few features and build a few models however please no titanic covid or kaggle datasets nationalsurvey so you think you know what redditors deserve or not deserve based on your piece of experience good luck in this field wouldfphd that is almost the inverse and equivalent version of you do not want to do the work they need you to do it is they do not understand that the work you want to do is the work they need done having said that that is comparatively rare yes it does happen but as much as data scientists like to think they are smarter than every hiring manager i have personally felt like of hiring managers that have interviewed me and were data scientists themselves were more than qualified to evaluate me maxtothej they were asking me about rule based models they did not have enough understanding about transformers models and did not have expertise to evaluate my skill set why shouldnt they be allowed to also ask about simpler solutions in the same space even transformers can be improved by some data preprocessing done by what is basically rules as someone who has interviewed people knowing how to train a transformer does not mean the candidate has all the fundamentals understanding of simpler solutions thathairygingerguy this does not exactly come across as very humble fundamentally though this is a relatively rare occurrence even when it does occur it shows the hiring team to be a poor fit for you so i doubt you would like the job anyway calminky i would recommend always asking the recruiter what is the salary range for this position since we are a publicly listed company we have salary bands for positions and the recruiter will provide you this information so if you are deemed the skill level of a data scientist your offer will be within that bracket if you are deemed a senior ds your salary will be higher etc it is hard to evaluate someone is technical skills based on experience or college degree especially without a portfolio so we have a technical assessment either take home or live depending on preference of the candidate followed by a discussion of the provided code etc calminky unfortunately yes not oc but from the initial fifty resumes to the final three in the interviewing process thathairygingerguy well it was about that time that i notice that interviewer was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era footballfanabc average of alarmingbookthere are not a ton of great candidates djalaskaandrew lots of practical challenges with ml in the real world not enough data too many issues with the data like missing values not enough relevant independent variables so linear regression will likely perform comparably models might be too complex or tedious to implement into production especially if your company is new to ml senior executives may be skeptical of ml because they do not understand it black box models are a risk because how do you explain it to people if something goes wrong the marginal benefit of ml may be relatively minor over a more simple model so it may not be worth the hassle the list goes on enhaluanoi yeah it should probably be bobdope data ladies harmonic means data science machines understatedpies you mean the pool of non rockstars therealtiddlydump it is actually a great opportunity to display a deeper understanding of common techniques pca with a variance threshold to retain components is regularizing the partial pooling of mixed effects models is an example of shrinkage etc etc etc edit these are questions for juniors if that is not clear photogndallas with an attitude like that youd never have to worry keep warming up that chair photogndallas cheesecakep we could definitely differentiate between nervousness and lack of interest i am referring to those sort of rambles when someone clearly wants out of current job and does not care the new role and carelessly and impatiently describes a past project cheesecakep but the question is usually about the most recent ones at least that is what we are always interested in hudseal lol k dude not really sure how you are taking a random compliment to someone else is advice as a personal attack hope being overly knee jerk and making senseless inferences does not hold you back thanks for the well wishes though i enjoy my current role as a data scientist thank you for representing the other geldersekifuzuli no problem with asking simpler solutions the issue is their questions do not go further skipping whole transformers architecture is not a good way to evaluate an nlp data scientist is skill set they have all reasons to ask about transformers to me because my resume are all about transformers plus my hypothetical solutions to their questions mostly includes a transformers based model complete silence or a few non sense follow up questions about transformers show lack of competence imo idk we have no trouble finding boatloads of highly qualified candidates and usually end up having to say no to some really good people happens time and time again data ladies and harmonic means and nbsp equals data science uber machines and nbsp i think i will show myself out now iexcelu if you ask a question on regularization then you should expect a comparison between lasso and ridge and potentially a generalized understanding of the p norms blindedyo you would be sacked immediately in my interview with this answer shot you are indeed where are you from you like to stress as an american which tells me you are not american footballfanabc to break down problem into atomic level mate colickingseahorse going through this now we had a ton of well qualified people interview for positions on my team but the one we ended up making an offer to did exactly what we do in a previous role we have got some backups and they are all awesome candidates nothing wrong with any of them we just had to pick the best one out of many really good candidates and we can only make as many offers as we have positions if he declines then the next best one will get the offer and so on therealtiddlydump that was never my objection it was the canned i will draw you this picture because it is what i remember from my interview prep therealtiddlydump i did not give an answer photogndallas what are you babbling about never mind there is not going to be any value in it either way iexcelu yeah fair blindedyo you gave an idea of the type of answer you would give and i would not like it therealtiddlydump no i did not i simply pointed out that the question is not constrained to tell me about and regularization as a rule answering interview questions like you are being given a quiz is a bad idea its a conversation if the interviewee wants to speak more broadly about the bias variance tradeoff or tie the ideas to a project they have done that is good blindedyo not in places where i have been",

  "therealtiddlydump today is post on gelman is blog covers the workflow obviously this might change if your data is huuuuge_ but a model first approach is nonsensical eda feature engineering etc are always the starting line weareglenn you are correct eda should be performed at the beginning of your project if only just to validate the cleanliness and usability of your data hopefully you can extract some understanding of the data too and gain some insight on what models may or may not work in the future i believe the swd is simply describing establishing a naive baseline model at the beginning of your modelling phase so you can build up from it with each iteration generally this is a fine approach but should be performed after your eda hamtaball why would not you ever do eda before diving into modelling what if you have shit data what if you are data is missing what if you can answer your question without needing to do any modelling unless you are given highly curated data with pre specifications on a task maybe but even then do eda statsnpolisci your swd is assuming you are starting with a much more developed theory and carefully curated dataset than you have data science is a very long process it is ridiculously rare to one person to go from minimal knowledge to extremely clear cut evidence on any given topic our models do not show up by some intuitive magic they show up because other people have done a lot of work to demonstrate patterns including initial models that let us develop great models the final stages of developing a theory involve your swd is recommendation this means setting a clear hypothesis defining the model to test your clear hypothesis then collecting great data and then testing to see if your model supports your hypothesis and then you or someone else repeat with slightly different data to ensure that your hypothesis holds across multiple situations if it does not you often go back to working with messier hypotheses and messier datasets most data analysis involves less developed hypotheses and messier data it requires eda to even begin to understand what kind of model could be used to understand the information this limits how firm our conclusions can be based on that data because we are building a model from patterns in the same data that we are eventually going to use to test our hypotheses it is common and dangerous for people to try to make excessively firm conclusions from this kind of analysis but eda model is also absolutely required to develop a sufficiently clear hypothesis that can eventually be tested on other sources of data eventually we will probably make the entire process less messy or at least more clearly understood spiritualquestions i then did some basic eda with and was looking for interesting questions to move forward i mean it sounds like you did not even know what you are predicting yet so how would you start modeling sycokinetic i think the better way to put it is to start with simple methods for both eda and modeling first pass at eda might just be making sure your data is usable and understanding what the features are and basically just doing the minimum required to make it run then do the same with the first model and now you have a baseline that did not take much time to slap together and you can more deliberately decide what needs work and what problems you will have there is still an eda component that you do first but it might prove to be so simple that it is easy to say you skipped it it is kinda sorta analogous to an artist starting with an amorphous pencil sketch wouldatastoryteller that was my thought too how do you even know if you are looking at the right data if you do not even have questions yet",
  "nice work nice one what improved it savethepandabears congrats nice keep at it pristine test great congratulations i am also thinking about starting kaggle if it is fine with you can we join some competitions together if yes we can connect in dm foxmulderlite grats abdoughnut funny enough it was simplifying my data preprocessing this competition deals with dicom images that are really hard to standardize at first i tried to do it using the pixel array is normal distribution since the pixel value is directly correlated with the image object is density this helped me normalize the images by the object is relative density it worked really well for training but took forever during inference so i had to scrap it then i used the dicom image window information which sort of does the same thing but depends on the window information being there and it being correct the blind test set did not seem to like this method very much i then dropped all of that and just ended up scaling the raw pixel array into a single channel basically a grayscale jpg then just relied on my model to normalize the images properly not only was the inference time faster but it doubled my score bikeskata nice seems like you basically imposed another very effective form of regularization on it",
  "evenmoreconfusednow if after months this was the first time that they communicated to you that they are not satisfied with your performance it is on them and their atrocious management frankly it is for your own best interest to leave and find a better place for the beginning of your career do not give up and focus on your weaknesses good luck alarmingbookfirst off do not be so quick to give up understand what your weaknesses were clearly they were significannot enough to impact your performance at work decide if these weaknesses are areas that you can significannotly improve or even want to if you can and want to improve them then do so put together a plan grab a mentor etc whatever works best to help you assess and address those weaknesses from there reevaluate yourself and shoot for a similar role maybe within the same company but on a different team or outside of the company on the other end if you decide these weaknesses are too much for you to address or you simply do not wish to then pivot to a different career there are many other successful fields also the last two cents i have found the biggest key to my success in this field has been thoroughly understanding the business my stakeholders the function of my team and how my specific role is supposed to drive results and or support the business be a problem solver first and a fancy phd deep learning ml full stack data scientist second phiinix it might be true that you were not a fit for this role but that does not mean you are not the right fit for any role maybe you are the type of person who needs more hands on mentorship not every company has that and others really pride themselves in it you will get another shot on a practical level to help your mental state i would recommend getting feedback from your leads managers and anyone who is in a position to do so you should do three things first ask for pointed feedback and specific questions where possible what trait do you think i am lacking in that would have really been helpful i am planning to work on my skills over the course of the next months what do you think i should work on contrary to what a lot of other redditors think not particularly in this subreddit people do not like letting people go it sucks and even if we have made the decision that someone is hurting the team more than helping we still wish them the best people are generally very open to providing feedback second say thanks for the feedback it does not matter if they are wrong perception is reality and since you are getting axed anyway there is no point in arguing third work in those areas if possible if your communication or presentation skills are lacking it is hard to replicate in a non work environment but you can pick up books on the topic and try to learn a thing or two critically by learning and developing your skills you will be able to identify the areas that you were weak at in your current position you then can separate the fired you from the new you and gain some confidence that you can provide value in another company gl hogebifneond i stepped into a data analyst role with a bachelors and received similar treatment it boils down to domain specific experience higher education is certainly admirable but does not compare to actual experience do not get down on yourself your first job out of university is just practice understand that making mistakes is actually valuable for your next employer because you can sell it as a learning experience not to mention any experience can look good on paper keep your head up seldom do people hit the ground running in their first year compared to people with to years of experience in the field intelligentputwhere did you do your masters from it is not that you were not a good fit with themit is that they were not a good fit for you i was once in a job for months before i noped out because the company is culture just pissed me off they were all so bubbly and extroverted and expected you to attend all these networking events outside of working hours and i just hated it i realized they were not a good fit for what i wanted so i left they were pissed i am sure but who cares we owe these companies nothing forget about it and move forward none deleted fsapds it happens dont take it too hard try applying elsewhere and try better learning from your experience most likely it was not a good fit not all data science jobs are created equal where do you feel you are lacking it seems like you have some self awareness which is good i do not think it means you should give up particularly if you enjoy it taxxer tbut i do actually enjoy the work so maybe looking for some encouragement with that you will succeed in the end our field takes a personality with a huge amount of curiosity and eagerness to learn in order to somewhat keep up with all fast developments as long as you actually like that you are set up for success in the long run if you stick to it and keep putting the effort in aungthuhein just because some people in some company do not like you it does not necessarily mean you suck and you should change your line of work and you enjoy it just need to find another place idk what your deal is but early in my first job i was told by one superior that i am not meeting expectations sounded like they were trying to convince me to leave and by a new boss in his second week that you are never going to make it tbf i knew i was slacking off i responded by going off on my own and starting my own project that got lots of visibility and was well received by senior leadership after that i went back to slacking off more than a year has passed and i have received nothing but positive reviews and raises bonuses to match my point is is not over till hr says it is over do not quit for their sake miibone i had some feedback in a few one on ones that there are some things to improve on but i had no formal reviews in months this was my first review so yeah i agree and thanks miibone yes thanks i will gather more feedback before i transition out miibone yah the two incumbent analysts are absolute domain experts and unfortunately not great teachers i feel like i was constantly compared to them which is natural i guess but kinda unfair anyway thanks for the comment miibone southern new hampshire university miibone hah i like your moxie thanks turingincarnate bruh yes this is why i wanna go into academia i will not have a proper boss i will not have to do any nonsense with networking events not as much anyhow i will be able to work on the topics i want to work on with whoever using the tools i want and so on industry ai not for everyone not by a long shot miibone i had quite a few skill gaps no one really was mentoring me though now in hindsight i should have more aggressively pursued a mentor miibone on issue is that when the data pipes broke i did not know how to fix them because i was not involved in any of the upstream engineering i was told to learn this so i asked the person to show me which he did a few times like we spent maybe an hour on this topic over the course of months because he is so busy and other things popped up for us both and this person breezed theough it so fast so when we had a data discrepancy the other day i still needed to go my colleague for guidance i asked my colleague if any of the etl scripts had been changed because i know we was making updates to other pipes the other day my colleague was busy and did not get back to me for a day my boss was disappointed i could not find root cause myself miibone i definitely like this thank you jeep man quantpsychguy i am not trying to be a jerk here but that was not what the poster said you do not want formal negative reviews often they have given you negative feedback multiple times this is not came out of nowhere stuff you should just take this on the chin and start looking elsewhere evening mousse domain knowledge can make you doubt your competence i worked as an all in all data dude analyst engineer scientist all depends on what i have to do i have been at my organization for a bit under a year domain knowledge is kicking my ass i deal with healthcare data on my team when working on the infrastructure i am fine and do not need help from anyone the internet has all the answers i need but anything that is front facing becomes a bit of an issue i have someone who was in healthcare and worked in the electronic medical record system for years before picking up analytics naturally they have been my go to person when working on a request suddenly they are cold and would rather let me struggle with the end user instead of answering a question in a minute or two thankfully my partner is in the healthcare industry they have been the one saving my ass my mentor when i first got in data told me how wife had to help him on a sepsis data science project she was a doctor in case it was not clear my point is that there are so many different types of companies and so many different types of roles even within data science just because this role did not work out does not at all imply that there is no role out there that you would excel in mathstatgal hello from an academia drop out that was pushed into the industry and still struggling there are issues to both sides treepeople it is true you are your own boss but it is more like you are ceo of a small company with a giant board where you can only hire temporary employees who you cannot pay a competitive wage you are constantly having to bring in money you have no ability to fire non performers you are forced to teach while also conducting research only into the things you can get funding to do realistically it is not whatever you want every hour of every day is a work hour no being sick or going on leave vacation means needing to find someone to replace you every single time since there is almost redundancy and you will constantly be forced into social interactions with students colleagues the public etc all while likely being severely underpaid and it is a bitch to change jobs it is much easier and more lucrative to find an industry job that suits what you want to do it might take some time but it is definitely possible my company has hundreds of phds and none of them have to teach classes attend networking events or do much of anything they do not want to do part of why that org is such a mess but that is a whole other conversation hah 28mmatfthe way you have described it sounds like they lack the ability to mentor train and they have got one overworked or highly disorganized engineer upstream who will not provide sufficient guidance either here is a question out of curiosity how is this system is documentation have they left enough breadcrumbs that you feel like you might be able to unpack it if you had more experience overall miibone yes that is the plan miibone yes very good point thank you again turingincarnate what issues do you see turingincarnate temporary employees presumably you mean phd and masters students you are constantly having to bring in money depends i know professors whose job is to write grants i also know professors who write grants sometimes i have never needed to pay for anything since all my data are public i will need to pay for some one day but whether it is most of what you do depends on you and other factors you have no ability to fire non performers complete bullshit i am a gra right now and if i just never did stuff with my advisor if we were working on a project and i just was not doing what i was supposed to i would be forced to leave the project or be reassigned you can choose who you work with you are not forced to work with anyone i am proof of this i do some work with my mentor but i also do my own work and i also have a friend from industry i am working with nobody is forcing us to we agreed to work together so we work together you have options on who you work with you are forced to teach again this depends my first mentor only teaches like two classes a semester and he may not teach at all some semesters you can also usually but not always teach what you want to so it is not like i am being made to teach nonprofits ngos when i really want to teach econometrics for public policy and anyways teaching comes with the job of being a professor that is kinda how it works only into the things you can get funding to do realistically it is not whatever you want again this is possible but not necessarily true i do not need funding to dream up topics to do causal inference with unless i need a very very specific dataset which i have not needed so far i also do not need any money to make new causal inference estimators i just need python and stata and the former is free i do not need to go to anyone who has money and ask them for funding i do what i want to do other fields are not like this sometimes you do go where the money is but that is why i am not in physics or a field where that is needed every hour of every day is a work hour no i like that though i put in hours a week into what i do not because i need the money but because what i do is why i get out of bed it is what fulfills me and brings me meaning there is almost redundancy good i hate redundancy be forced into social interactions with students colleagues the public being forced to interact with people at work who would have imagined it possible all while likely being severely underpaid this is true it is much easier and more lucrative to find an industry job that suits what you want to do this is also true but again i value me controlling my work more than i value wealth i will take a salary over a one if it means that i do what i do to me not having a boss and being able to use my tools to work on things that i want to is more valuable than the money i would get from industry i do not do what i do just for money i do what i do because even if all jobs paid the same i would do exactly what i am doing now i will work in the industry while i am getting my public policy phd but it is not my long term goal i value the freedom i have over my work i like not having to report to superiors and control my research subject matter i do not want a job there is no industry job that pays to do what i wanna do which is develop new estimators in econometrics and use them to do research on things that i want to do if someone prefers the money and other aspects of industry then that is their choice there is no right way to play industry and academia both have drawbacks the question is which are you willing to tolerate more i agree with this take it does not sound like it was for lack of op trying the support network simply did not exist at this company if they cannot fix it unless they hire someone with all encompassing knowledge it will likely happen with someone else mathstatgal there is no security in a non tenure track position with a tenure track you are always chasing tenure it is publish or perish you go from an assistant prof to associate prof after years of work and then bust your butt for the full professorship the pay is shit analysts in the industry make more money than associate profs with tenure sure you can bring in more through grants but that means working on what sells and not necessarily what you want to work on this is not an exhaustive list just a few examples treepeople teaching two classes is a ton of work especially if you are forced to teach one is with hundreds or thousands of students at the universities i am familiar with phd and masters students cannot realistically be kicked out of the program or even really off a project all their funding comes from grant the professor has to bring in although this is only required for the first year or so then they may have to pay full tuition and students could not change who they are working under without reapplying to the entire program some of that will definitely vary by university but it is unlikely you will get much choice in where you wind up i have spent my whole life around academia and continuing that legacy is something i never once considered doing after seeing it from the inside i have worked in non profits government jobs academic jobs and industry and i have switched industries entirely being in industry is definitely the best gig i have had so far and i am staying put since i can do what i want i do not have to work long hours i have a whole team to help if i need to go on vacation leave and at this rate i can retire by but someone is gotta do the academic side so more power to you turingincarnate you are right but this is why i wanted to start publishing in heavy hitting econometrics journals early i wanna chase tenure by publishing in top class metrics stats outlets while still a phd student that way i am more competitive turingincarnate students could not change who they are working under without reapplying to the entire program you are kidding right lol that is so extreme hey i am not sure i am the best fit this with dude how about you switch me to the other person down the hall fine you are just gonna need to reapply to our program like what i am already a public policy student you ca not just be like reapply to our program bruh mathstatgal if that is what you want then go for it and all the best to you i was just trying to disabuse of the notion that academia is better than industry there are struggles in both treepeople yes because you apply to a specific professors lab program to switch labs you have to reapply and get in again even if the professor already has agreed to take you and you cannot just add a new student to your lab without having funding for them so you are taking them over another potential student this is true for masters and phd students turingincarnate oh yeah i agree totally to me it comes down to what things you value more than others both have tradeoffs but there is no one right way to play",

  "powerpoint slashdave i am perplexed that there are folks in the industry that consider jupyter notebooks as a deliverable megariceball you either write a lot of markdowns or make a powerpoint presentation afkforlol non tech stakeholders generally ask different questions from data than you do i find it best to give them a platform view of the data that they can also interact with in minor ways to pull out the information that they need on the fly exporting data to csv if small enough and throwing into a tableau or equivalent is solid if you need more complex options streamlitio dash is solid as well nothing is worse than them asking a slightly different view of the data and your hardcoded matplotlib seaborn etc charts cannot produce it and you fall into the ah shit let me just open this cell and tweak this and fuck idk why that is not working um one sec live demo trap or talk with them before hand to know what things they want to know and powerpoint it exactly how they want to see it powerpoint is best during my ds project i showed the principal ds my notebook but when it came to presenting my work it was through powerpoint dosnox jeremy howard from fast ai did a good presentation using jupyter notebooks that was cool and i did not realise use the rise extension dysfu do not allendowney one option is to use jupyter book to generate an html version you can hide code cells or remove them altogether here is an example i worked on recently which includes the code i sometimes write reports and export the charts abs tables into it i sometimes produce pdfs of the same as batches powerpoint it a powerful tool and if they want to use the output of the analysis excel may be useful neelankatan i have used this nice tool in the past called rise spskrk if you are using a jupyter notebook you are the non technical stakeholder jokes aside just make a presentation hi i usually create voila dashboards from a jupyter notebook to make them interactive i use ipywidgets library and use plotly for my graphs synthphreak my approach is to write my code as a package where everything is encapsulated into a series of objects then in the notebook i just import and use those objects which effectively hides most of the code while still looking fancy and smart for example instead of defining function within the notebook i have a python module which defines a class with the functions as methods then i just import that class into the notebook instantiate it and can do things like myclassmethodone and the nontechnical reader never has to see what methodone even is just it is output this approach usually reduces the amount of code in the notebook by or more allowing you to devote more real estate to visualizations or markdown cells it is especially valuable for hiding matplotlib code which can get super verbose then once my notebook is ready for dissemination i just export it as an html file and share that everyone no matter how non technical will be able to view that file in a browser just like any website to me this is much easier than doing everything in a notebook then transferrring the content in bits and pieces to powerpoint is the deliverable really a notebook your non technical stakeholder has a dev env set up already to run it seems sus are you sure you are not steering this decision into delivering a notebook really you should write up a report or slide deck those are the formats you would typically use to interact with someone who is non technical for a reason if you are going to be there in person have a slide deck to talk through if you are just shooting it off to them then a written report gives you more ability to provide your interpretations and context in written form if for some ungodly reason your deliverable really has to be a notebook and they are going to expect to be able to run it lean heavily on markdown cells and ipywidgets write your report in the markdown cells as you would any other written report but have your figures be live code anything you think they might want to change should be done with interactive figures plotly or widgets from ipywidgets like they would get in a clickable web interface do not expect them to change anything in code sizabledata i usually clean up the code and use a ton of markdown i usually just say and these cells do xyz to the data and we now see this show plot that is only if my process tells a story like i first observed this so i looked into this and saw this which prompted me to ask this question i walk them through my thought process as i try to anticipate what they would ask i do not always do this but sometimes it is a helpful talking point and reminds them we are not just clicking around in excel all day nothing wrong with that and it actually takes a lot of hard work to answer a simple question tarehman do not use jupyter in this context just write a paper include relevant plots and tables along with long form text if you are presenting live you could use a powerpoint deck but it sounds like you are not so just write a document that lays out the problem the recommendation and the evidence blasketbasket since i have not seen anyone mention this yet you can turn a jupyter notebook directly into a slideshow and have the best of both worlds this lets you have all the technical content you want in the notebook but only show the cells and output you choose when in slideshow mode there are a ton of tutorials online about how to do this this one seems adequate at a glance benitosblade i would also ask chatgpt to see it is response toastenjoyer if i absolutely needed to do this i wouldnr write any code in it just import functions that generated the output and write what i did not to say in markdown pratos if you can build something do it in streamlit or gradio probably someone in devoid team would help you to get it deployed the stakeholder has access and can get constant stream of updates when hooked to the db equalastronauthide the codenot sure why you feel the need to use a notebook for non technical people why would you ever present a jupyter notebook to a stakeholder extract the relevant information and put it into a powerpoint to tell a story never put a book of code in front of a stakeholder easiest way for a project to fail why would you ever present a jupyter notebook to a stakeholder extract the relevant information and put it into a powerpoint to tell a story never put a book of code in front of a stakeholder easiest way for a project to fail cptkeasar you mean just extract charts from the notebook add a bit of text and just talk explaining details i assume i should also omit all technical stuff like how i dealt with outliers which stat test i chose etc just findings and visualizations spencebeecher this is the answer some additional advice from my personal experience align with your manager internal stakeholder on your plan before getting too far in terms of final deliverable work with someone on your team your manager to talk through your findings your bias when you create slides is to focus on all the great work you did methodology but what it sounds like the client wants is the insight methodology discussion should be included perhaps in appendix but you should lead with the insights slide presentation should start with an executive summary that summarizes the overall takeaways bullets here should link directly to slides it is okay to have methodology slides but focus on what the client needs to know more details can go into appendix slide titles should focus on the key takeaway and you should try to make them around an action as well then use visual that directly links to the point you are making it is okay if it takes you a few slides to build a narrative to deliver an overall point a is true b is not true we should do c given a and b not good t test shows we can reject the null hypothesis for if we are better on criteria xyz better our product performs better on task xyz better still our product generally works better except on abc and we should consider feature to close the gap then cost out the implementation it is okay to have content on methodology on each slide but it should ideally be in support of your takeaway vs the focus of the discussion i prefer footnotes and an appendix kittenbountyhunter correct answer you do not you make a presentation cptkeasar people can be different on the business side of things many have no idea what they actually need probably their tech guy said that jupiter notebook is a good way to check the analysis and the higher ups went with that the fact that tech guy will not be present was lost somewhere in between corporate levels tarehman i wish i was surprised but there is a whole cottage industry propping up using notebooks to solve all your data science problems and also probably to fix your brakes and address hair loss synthphreak ah shit let me just open this cell and tweak this and fuck idk why that is not working um one sec thanks for the lol xd cptkeasar yeah you are right i usually also just have pbi at hand but this time for some reason it was stressed that a deliverable should be presented as a notebook for some reason thanks for the idea cptkeasar thanks cptkeasar thanks cptkeasar thanks i have no input in decision making and the main stakeholder is an outsider from a government organization hidden beneath layers of canadian bureaucracy it was super weird for me as well hence the question synthphreak holy shit talk about a hidden gem synthphreak axe meet grinder forbiscuit exactly just save yourself the pain and do not show the technical detail you can describe the process to them on how it works but providing technical details serves more as a distraction and for some business centric folks it shows that you are not getting the point of their question the question being that they want you to answer a business question not provide a lecture on your process meankingyeah just keep it stupid simple because that is what most non technical people can actually keep up with if you are gonna mention more technical things then really keep those short and do not go too deep with it there is also some tool btw for being able to format notebooks into presentation like things that might be interesting to look into mostlypretentious if there are important technical details you can include them in footnotes or appendices but yeah tell the core data story with visuals and simple summaries morebento_ pretty much do it all in the notebook then copy paste to powerpoint venustrapsflies have a complaint about notebooks not to worry we can sell you proprietary software to replace those problems with different ones slashdave saw this today cptkeasar oh cool thank for the tip i will check up on it",
  "robidaan ome of my teachers used to say if you get nothing but praise from non technical management with good results you definitely have to double check your work doortofreeside bad news is definitely a lot more challenging i will report the results faithfully but the moment i realize it is bad news i am like ah shit i gotta have all my bases covered now gottabemd confirmation bias is a very real thing would not doubt it for a second it happens in all areas look up the file drawer effect scary stuff the problem with only providing data driven confirmation of management is they can easily question whether data driven analytics is needed after finding and double checking insights that challenge the status quo i search for a champion in the management side to broach my initial results with the higher up the better with c suite being the best if my stats and data can back up the research i can at least germinate the challenging idea in their minds the strategy here is to not drop a bombshell on management but slowly disseminate information to them preferably from someone inside management this allows me to present my challenging findings sandwiched between more digestible insights does not always work out but it is better to coach people to expect bad challenging news rather than surprising them with it finally its a numbers game can you really expect of your data driven insights to be actioned upon without question it is possible that your insights themselves are driven by limited data or knowledge or both jackmitcham they are just describing bayesian

strong so management has to make sure the evidence is strong theguyoutside going to reserve judgement until i hear more about your methodology for this experiment acrobatic not necessarily but you must become good at comunicating bad news and proposing quality alternatives xtrerk this depends entirely on what level of management and the decisions involved post analysis most c level execs that i have worked with want what is best for the company regardless if the analysis supports their gut feeling vp level is typically where the headache is i have seen analyses redirected once it does not go their way something along the lines of this seems a bit wrong maybe we should look at it from this angle and that happens until we arrive somewhere that an obscure and complex kpi is formulated for future use that they are able to explain how well they are doing it is funny because i have never seen this actually work once it is reviewed by the c level they shoot holes in it until the kpi is removed from production maybe that is the goal directors do not really care one way or the other and the stuff i work on is above the level of first line managers pay grade to care about they are too busy putting out daily fires i have not noticed this in my years as a ds i have had to deliver news at odds with what management probably would have wanted and it was fine ofc ymmv ltunsolicitedadvice this has existed long before data scientists were even a thing upper management has always had these traits in a lot of companies and there have always existed yesmen who stoke their egos as a data scientist you have the unique skill sets to prove or disprove assumptions using concrete data but you have to be smart about how you approach these issues no one likes a smart ass especially not highly paid executives upper management executives does not like being called out in the open you have to take people into confidence and share your findings making considerable effort to not present it as an refutation of their ideas yeah this can really suck and can be quite emotionally draining on a day to day basis there will always exist egomaniacs who cannot fathom being wrong the choice we usually have it suck it up or walk away there is always a better opportunity around the corner loftygoat data mining noun an unethical econometric practice of massaging and manipulating the data to obtain the desired results w s brown introducing econometrics if you torture the data enough it will confess to anything ronald h coase bisdaknako had a job that involved processing an information request it was once a full time job but they fired the guy and now gave it as a task i did the task for a couple months and started getting criticised heavily as the number of tasks overdue was going up i showed them the numbers for how many hours the task takes and they agreed it was not an issue with me but must be a temporary unknown raise in number of tasks so they asked me to check how long this temporary raise had been going on for i showed the number of incoming tasks remained constant going back before they fired that guy and number of tasks overdue grew after they fired them they agreed i followed up a couple weeks later and manager explained they spoke to higher ups and determined it was just a temporary bump phew here i was worried the problem would only get worse over time weirdly i got a lot of praise for the work proving and presenting all that they asked me to help with other similar issues and they sure were similar honestly i think management was not wrong it was one of those run it into the ground to get more funding business models all the hip business schools are teaching i have told people this story and lots have told me similar ones makes me wonder how much of the economy is just nonsense not even evil or corrupt or whatever but just straight nonsense edit more work bullshit i also told this story in an interview with a similar role they were stoked and mentioned it is a reason they hired me because they wanted me to find similar issues got called into a performance management meeting about being too slow another worker had complained i was not getting through enough data entry task i was supposed to i showed the manager you can sort tasks completed by name and a couple others and i were doing way more than the other ten combined some had gone days without doing ten minutes worth of tasks in that meeting i was asked to stop looking at others performance and focus on getting my own up to speed i moved on quick this is not to brag it was literal data entry and sorting the name column by a z i am something of a data scientist myself kyleireddit so we spent all those time money and energy to gain expertise in data science only to support management is subjective hunch say ai not so wouldfphd everything in this post needs the qualifier at bad companies or at companies with bad leadership yes bad leadership loves confirmation of their ideas not just from data science but from every other function when sales created projections when finance estimates future margins when marketing estimates the effectiveness of an ad campaign when product management estimates market share again a leader that is looking for yes people is going to look for them in every single function not just data and what is worse they will tend to foster a culture where other leaders underneath them are also encouraged to have the same approach by contrast a leader that understands that ideas being challenged is healthy for the generation of strong fundamentally sound plans will a challenge themselves b invite challenges from others and c foster a culture where up and coming leaders also embrace this culture for example i worked at two fortune companies at one of them it was a nightmare exactly what your post describes if the data does not fit my narrative go run your numbers again until they do at the other one i got to sit down with one of the most senior leaders in the organization who was a razor sharp and b focused on the data itself where it came from how it should be interpreted etc before even starting to question the numbers and this is true at smaller companies too i worked for a company of people the ceo was also a super sharp guy that understood that regardless of what his gut reaction was to numbers maybe they were wrong so even when he thought the numbers looked wrong he would follow that up with but shit i have been wrong a bunch of times before so let is see how this thing does and let is revisit it when we know what happened i think that is ultimately at the core of what makes companies either good or bad for data science analytics etc do leaders think they already know the answer and just needs help driving it or do leaders truly concede that there are many things they do not know pmmeurhopesndreams is this a screenshot of a tweet of a screenshot of a hacker news comment i am afraid i need a few more levels of indirection here can you take a screenshot of this put it in a word document print it out and snail mail it to me onewaytoschraeds it is exactly why i am a data engineer now cannot agree more lol themootzpallucci depends on a lot of things that is a valid but cynical view of what we do rageongonedo if you are coming in with a problem you better have a solution something my first boss taught me younikorn i worked as a bioinformatician at a research institute in germany and as any data scientist knows garbage in means garbage out some analyses resulted in exciting positive results and my boss was very happy on return other times the data would be of such a low quality the majority of the variation being error and noise yet my boss made me wrangle and torture the data for months in the hopes of getting something anything out of it i just did my job as i was receiving a nice wage but i understand both sides of it it is important in many fields to use the data as efficiently as possible and extract all info you also do not want to accept that the data you spent money on to gather ends up being a waste so you continue to try and find a use for it and when you do find something you do not want to look a gift horse in the mouth ideally all results are met with a healthy dose of scepticism and validation analyses both the positive and the negative results but the more tests you perform the more multiple testing becomes an issue not that p values are dome objective non arbitrary parameter but still yes this is true for every job if you are a swe and management wants to use outdated tech you are using outdated tech tiquortoo it is true only if your analysis is bullet proof otherwise management is filtering it with their own data the other post about bayesian priors is dead on ectd lmao too real flimsyresearcher this is my career in a nutshell damn this hits too close to home i did analysis on sales had some hypothesis based on initial models and shared them they were counter to what was believed and there was outrage i ran tests refined the model and came up with different highlights from nearly the same model these matched prior beliefs and now everyone loves it informalbutterfly this is precisely why i left ds and went back to software engineering informalbutterfly this is precisely why i left ds and went back to software engineering tarehman yes much like consultants data scientists are often used to launder the beliefs that management already have the worst part is that often management is not really aware they are doing this which almost makes it worse it also means that one of the core bedrock principles that has to guide you as a data scientist is that you never falsify or fluff the data to fit your audience is preconceived notions i used to tell my data scientist reports that one of the only things that make you truly valuable as a data scientist is the fact that you absolutely cannot be made to obscure the truth you see in data you tell it like you see it in the data and you are clear about the caveats and limitations of what you can conclude as soon as you start straying from that path you lose your ability to be an objective observer who can help the business grow in other words once you have compromised on scientific values before it becomes increasingly hard to avoid doing so again and again it is a harder path to always stick to your legitimate interpretation of what you think is true in the data if you do it you will be on the outs sometimes but it is worth it how does op know that they were not actually confirming their pre held belief and interpreting praise and scrutiny through their pre held belief that management only wanted confirmation sassydodo yep considering you are not one of the business owners or investors you just do whatever they want and hope the ship will not sink fast enough i work for e comm where even investors do not care about even gathering proper data they have their own magic world in their heads i really do not understand this i am not a data scientist nor i play one on reddit but i work in corporate and i can confirm the same behavior by the same people rhodiarabbit does not work because money is not rolling in stanwisesci this is true for the research academic and scientific complex too not just corporate management yup sounds about right with my company as well coffeecoffeecoffeee i have found that whether you are doing potemkin data science varies a lot depending on who you work with including in the same organization if you have to deliver bad news and you are not dealing with potemkin data science then it is best to more evidence than if it supports what they think if it is a big enough claim then you are in extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence territory disjointedhuntsville it depends on your level the higher up you go you better be the one giving data that is accurate confirmation bias or not some junior roles can get away with ignoring what the data says if it is bad news that is inconsequential but that will not fly in most places that have more than emotion riding on the information presented monkeygamer yep that is basically my job flashy career at one point the prevailing theory was the earth was flat and at the center of the solar system if you focus on the scientific method and not just manipulate the data to tell a story someone wants to hear you just might move your needle away from cynicism everyone has their opinions your primary role as a data scientist is to inform and test hypotheses as objectively as possible using data and the scientific method carrtmannnn it is true but i refuse this has been my experience with of business partners i am a support analytics team i have even seen business partners just go to a different ds team or employee and ask for the sane request when they do not agree with the first one there is of business partners that do actually take the good and the bad the confirmation or contradiction and use it to either keep going or make changes do notyouloveme i was once told directly by the ceo to continue falsifying numbers after i had discovered that the people before me were doing bad calculations it can get way worse than having to toss out things that do not look good be careful how you go about things and do not be afraid to get fired and move on sillythebunny at least during my year tenure as a data analyst m this is dead on character always has been woodenjellyfountain to boldly support confirmation bias jasonsuave do not forget you have a lot of power as a data scientist you are the first to see the teetering of the financials of the org you represent the second your model shows a downward trend just quit and take a new job with a different employer i see data scientists getting eaten alive by execs from certain unsuccessful orgs but those same data scientists are thriving for smaller companies where their work makes an impact that does not require talking through a tired exec you have the power use it to your advantage i think the ethical thing to do is to publish both in different weight and let the people decide accurate mescallan successful employment is appeasing management sometimes the goals align and creating value appeases management but created value does not determine your employment the whims of your superiors does there is no true meritocracy in hierarchical structures zerostyle sounds like consulting firms cartographerseth it just depends on where you work i work at a biotech company and management definitely understands that pursuing the wrong science will eventually result in disaster so while some results are definitely seen as a bummer it is also recognized that you may have helped the team dodge a bullet i read posts like this one and it literally makes me sad to know that people have to waste their talents essentially lying extremely convincingly for a living it is like they say there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics i can agree i am currently a data analytst and did analysis in my initial months any analysis which contradicted to their ideas was questioned forced to be proven wrong finding weird mistakes and minor issues with my documentation but the analysis which confirmed their ideas was praised and never questioned eventually i stopped doing them and shifted to rather do some data engineering no day true blueagave i work in a market research company and internally we agree company is hire us so they can have some data to back up a decision they have already made if we give data they do not agree with they go to the competition next time oh this is so true across multiple clients the moment data analysis did not show a rosy picture the management would be very upset not to mention their favorite question why cannot we achieve accuracy on this model entireislandthis is absolutely true i proposed adding a variable to a model i am building to predict traffic to vendor profiles and i suggested the number of times a vendor shows up in comparisons it is a variable that is out of vendors control so i was told to not include it because it would not provide an opportunity for them to know what they can do differently basically to not tell them well it is out of your hands which would translate to not investing more money that annoyed tf out of me but i did as i was told no this is exactly how i have been feeling lately which is discouraging and opposite of how i thought my position would be at times i feel like a wizard because i feel as if data can be sliced and molded so many ways and can be justified other times i feel as if i am cheating myself out of actually putting my skill to good use heraldsofdoom i feel you bro it is about the story if numbers fit there everything is great else you do not know your data delicious view persuade influence and change their understanding and actions however difficult that may be ugh i hate this xelaxander brodo you even crop own not so data lead herrmaciek yes it is called confirmation bias pretty sure it is mentioned in any stats ds textbook jobeta so true if leadership is crap it is thankfully not always the case westernmomentin most companies the management do not like doing the jobso you gotta do it statisticannot good example of how let the data speak for themselves really means let the data speak for my implicit assumptions happyjakes i have left post is because executives have made me make numbers look green in large organisations iplaytheguitarntrip good news i better double check to not make management overcommit to clients when the project goes to prod bad news i better figure out the story behind this data and the scrutiny that will follow shitlordgod if you are good at it you tell a story with the data that explains how your boss is right but could be more right if they just implemented this thing on page axeljshark of course this is the case it is not academia managers just want to hit their kpis they do not care about objective truth or fact finding most of us are not working in cancer or aerospace or things that actually matter if you are working in ads sales etc no one cares about some greater mission or truth it is all about doing what someone above you says so everyone can get paid i used to work as a bi analyst once my manager asked me to perform an analysis on something and the results mismatched his expectations completely the reason was that the analysis he did before was performed on a very short time scale in the worst time possible the first week of covid lockdowns while i then performed a follow up analysis on a full year of data i assume he was selling his findings to the upper management and pushing for changes based on his wrong insights when i presented my findings he would not accept them and asked me to check them two more times from different angles of course i always came up with the same results so i could not give him the good news he expected that is when i realized i needed to leave wouldirty hurdy gurdy i got demoted once for delivering a bad news double whammy the first bad news was that our platform was unsustainable and would be worthless in months without a major overhaul which was required urgently as it would take nearly the full time remaining to fix it like basically failure to act on this information would mean the death of our company the second bad news came on the heels of the first bad news as the cto to whom i reported was uninterested in a major overhaul so he discarded that information and told me what he wanted me working on next which was to incorporate a neutral network onto the data pipeline that preps our data for our data swamp after trying and failing to explain to him that what he was asking me did not make any sense neither from a financial perspective nor from a why do we even need a neural network to do mundane data processing tasks already handled by non ml code perspective he pulled me into a surprise meeting the next morning to inform me that he did not think i was cut out to lead the ds department and he would be bringing in his own guy soon to whom i would report epilogue the company refused to fix the platform until it became painstakingly obvious to everyone else that the platform was doomed right around months later funny enough at which point i was pulled aside by the cto and asked how long i needed to fix it it was hard to contain the smile as i told him probably about months they went out of business shortly after but not before sending me off with a nice little severance package ohanse okay gonna go kind of against the grain here but this guy did not get traction with the truth and i honest to god believe he was telling the truth to the best of his abilities because he showed up with problems this is a shortfall of business acumen ai not nobody got time for problems if you show up with here is why what we believe was a wrong choice but do not have a ready answer to the follow up of what should we do instead then you are seen as uncollaborative useless and not a team player you know how people in here keep parroting the advice of become a master of your business domain this is why feeding leadership alternative courses of action that make them look smarter than the peers whose throats they are trying to cut that is the most valuable currency we can offer the screen shotted poster likely knew their math i would guess uninformed sure that they did not know their business puzzleheaded in my personal experience when the data tells a story management does not want to hear you need to frame those insights as an opportunity mrjayin my experience i have encountered things similar to this but to be honest i once shared an analysis that was something no one in senior management wanted to see most because a major partner with who we were aggressively expanding business with was bad for us the analysis was reviewed times a secondary team was setup to do the exact same thing and waisted like months of everyone time only to stop business with them long story short i never got anything for shutting down a loosing business and the product team just created new agreement a month later and were back in business with this partner generally true unfortunately caksters true that was the main reason i switched to data engineering zeebraforce so no different from consulting hartescout wait so you work in security as well prestigioussortthis is why in bigger companies the structure of having a data team person embedded in a team vs a central resource is meaningful as i am embedded i must consider how the success of my own team is measured and how we will be perceived in every analysis and that may include cherry picking what when where to surface information i am paid to support my team for example i cannot ever present that my team is contribution to a big project was a waste of time keep in mind that does not mean my team is not valuable but i am hyper aware of how any insight can be projected so i am very careful what i share outside my team if i was in a central team that wouldnt be the case ps i work in a low stakes environment it genuinely makes me sick how accurate this is and how much it resonates with my own lives experience iscopak here is the original source of the quote the op is not trying to take credit for this statement have i got a good manager then they question everything even when the results look good i should note that he has become more and more trusting over time but i got this job years ago out of uni and him raisong those questions did make it an automatism for me to qa carefully and not go right to roesent data if they look good or bad tigerkingsam you do work that makes your boss look good all of the data is superficial urbancitrus i am currently transitioning an old model to a new process the old one had many small errors that added up imo i get so much push back from the client every time i put something together in a more optimal transparent way they scrutinize how i put it together and i can walk through it a to z but the old one had absolutely no visuals or intermediate files to show the process much of my time is spent assuaging the client and re explaining the transparency of the new process exhausting sherlockholmesyikes sirsmokesalot i do not see why this is a bad thing i agree that ideally we would strive to attain truth and knowledge through our work as scientists however in reality our role is what the image describes we are there to use our influence to enact change this is separate from our motivations or any truth value of our analysis i think people who are caught up in this are romanticizing the role not entirely true the management knows this stuff already so you coming up with insights that are aligned with their knowledge is easy to digest but a contradictory insight needs to be double checked since numbers are facts which once circulated cannot be taken back and you cannot go wrong with facts haywirevrv sounds like crappy company levenshteinn unfortunately very true astevko confirmation bias outofband that is not a issue with data science but with bad management clearly convoluted can confirm this statement i did figure out a way to kindaoffset the scrutiny if you will if you have bad news or conflicting information with what the egotistical management wants to hear scrutinize your work before they can talk if you want to present conflicting or alternative analysis tie it to something management said a log trend line is the best fit for this data which means production will incrementally increase but reaching this kpi seems questionable but i agree with manager philbert about implementing those changes even if we miss the mark this quarter next quarter could see a change to an exponential model i have learned being critical of yourself lessens the opportunity of those above you to be harshly critical and oftentimes turns into a positive in a weird warped way sadly this is manipulation at this level it is social skills vs technical skills that will get you promoted respected rewarded etc tldr if you want to report bad data follow it with your own criticism of the analysis if you want to present new conflicting with management analysis tie it to a positive thought opinion comment by someone higher up nzubemush saved waspingitup as a slight aside there was at least one psychological study that showed participants were far more likely to think critically and question information that conflicted with their own beliefs it really sucks but maybe it is a bit unsurprising that managers would prefer to see information that confirms what they already believe unanimouspimp sounds like a bad company twokeezplusmz this is all well and good until your analysis ends up blowing up a product line sinking a trading desk or resulting in a medication that causes severe illness or death bobdope it is funny because it is true wait no it is sad so very sad sizzle d wa this is exactly why i never went back to school to get my graduate degree i had worked in big companies long enough to realize that forget about math most people would be lucky enough to pass a grade math test it is virtually impossible to persuade anyone of making any decisions or changes with anything close to logic you follow direction from the top or you are viewed as causing trouble the people who make the most money know the least they do not let information get in the way of a good story i realized that if i wanted to move up i had to know less information not more the people who have good people skills read manipulative and narsasistic are the most successful if i could not persuade folks based on simple logic elementary statistical principles then good luck trying to persuade dissuade anyone from anything that they already believe with actual data and actual mathematical analysis it is like speaking a foreign language also as i this post it seems real negative and cynical i actually really love my job and am relatively successful at it i just learned that logic data statistics and only as powerful to the extent that they can be comprehended by those in decision making positions and trust me the people in those positions did not get there because they were good at comprehending things i have only worked in big companies it could be totally different at a small company donttasemehoe i am no data scientist but i do data heavy admin work and get asked to perform analytics regularly i used to fret over covering every contingency and confounding factor that might produce poor interpretations i would explain at length my methods and weaknesses of my analysis turns out no one but me really cared it seems most people just want an answer and are not particularly concerned whether or not it reflects some kind of truth fun this means the op is not a good data scientist the data scientists job is to effectively communicate the difference between the prior belief and the new position in a way that explains why the new idea is better also they should present the confidence in the conclusion always including data challenges etc latter pea you mean like all these government sponsored studies that show the current admin what ever one it is is right none but yeah let is all believe the experts i cried laughing when fauci said i represent the science uchimata data scientists should really try to build production applications internally or externally facing just doing analysis is a dead end for exactly the reasons listed in the op dylm nah if as a data scientist you end up in this situation you gotta resign asap for real othergoatits accurate but its also a big sign of a toxic work environment if your work is tossed in the bin because the result is unsavory to management you need to start looking for another position not only is it the moral decision but it also unfairly damages your professional repertoire i was not hired to baby sit children ie most of middle management misterwaffles this is a toxic environment which you can either try to remedy or flee from it is important to constantly be setting expectations that we are finding something out from the analysis and want to be interested in and curious about the results we are gaining valuable insight into how the product works what is going on etc it is a privileged view to have and a great opportunity to be able to act on it you cannot always change people is minds but it does help when you have a data minded leader who will rally behind your cause that is unethical wingwraith yep it fucking sucks it makes our work a joke because nothing will ever effectively improve in this regard and our jobs are all on the line with ai and chatgpt bindaasbaba that is such a narrow view of data scientist work most of the use cases i worked involved quantifying the impact of important business initiatives which was key to drive strategic planning including forecasting providing useful insights into drivers of a certain behaviour to plan product roadmap discover new insights which business were not even aware of sometimes ofcourse data scientists will work on hypothesis which makes sense for business and we test to prove or disprove obviously it is imperative that if things do not work as expected you do need to have a valid explanation backed by data to plan next steps you may have overlooked a dimension which will be discovered as part of root cause analysis and provide an important business opportunity it all depends on how open a business is to learn from data and willing to challenge themselves in light of new evidence just leave immadane wrong you have to explain and break it down in such a way that you are numbers and presentation are good enough to convince the upper management maybe you just have to up your explainability jonnyrocket confirmation bias it is the preferred road of the ignorant a human condition semantic satiation this sounds like toxic culture which is mutually exclusive from data science results if a company fosters a culture of challenge and is relatively flat in terms of hierarchy then you will feel empowered to provide analysis that goes against the status quo xelaxander omg yes i feel like if my results are not criticized at least a little stakeholders did not even think about them also for larger projects false positives in a poc can waste a lot of money vacuouslyuntrue i feel this prestigioussortone of my early bosses said that people trust pretty clean graphs and distrust ugly busy ones regardless of what the data says so true designatedhacker also remember you are the first one under the bus when reality finally shows up maybe in a court room with a team of weasels asking pointed questions messilyfirst wow on point iarlandt i am a weather forecaster for the air force studying data science for when i separate and it is like that for weather forecasting too you give someone a great outlook for their flight and they have zero questions but if i am giving bad news i have to come with a stack of receipts that would make a tax auditor sad deto yeah its kind of natural that when you report something unexpected it will be under more scrutiny so i would expect to have to answer more questions about methodology in cases like this however if the organization is good in the end data analysis that shows bad news will still be utilized in order to fix problems rationaldialog even worse scientifically proven the bringer of bad news get negative points for doing so even if it is not his fault or in his power to change it probably better to just burry this news but yeah want to work at such a place were this would become necessary oneoftheonlies i have heard about confirmation bias too so this sounds right to me cartographerseth i tried to explain this to some science worshippers but they just could not get it through their heads they are numbers facts how could they be wrong oh my sweet summer child doubleohd confirmation bias is a very real thing would not doubt it for a second confirmation bias confirmed fickle high quality post right here i have never been deliberate about doing what you have laid out here but in retrospect the most success i have had are the times that resembled it in fact i can think of a couple times when the situation resolved itself because the leadership heard about my data from so many vectors that they came to my recommended conclusion on their own monkeyunited ahh the boiling frog theory my management has mastered giving no credit for innovation months after a profitable new finding is delivered managers act as if we knew that all along justifying their bias that they do not need to pay for technical staff also makes year end rankings a real bummer ciarogeile this is very true however could you rephrase it in frequentist terms vituluss should be top answer this redrightrepost i mean at the end of the day we are all bayesian at least informally jasonsuave alas you have built the baby boomer business executive model from scratch toplimeis not the point of bayesian reasoning to update your priors it seems like the opposite of what bayesian reasoning is trying to achieve joyloveroot so in other words there is a term to justify rationalize and make confirmation bias seem reasonable called bayeson reasoning how ridiculous the berik and understand the data story behind it avelak a lot hinges on company culture too there are some places where you cannot be anything other than a glorified yes man find a place where it is okay to go against the grain and you will have a much better time if you enjoy being able to challenge ideas etc most c suites i have worked with want whatever answer allows them to maximize share buybacks before year end in this system vp is and directors become firefighters lacking agency many of their emails are forwarded nastygrams from c suite asking why we are chasing value as opposed to whatever dilutive metric investor relations promised the street that quarter prestigioussort upper management executives does not like being called out in the open when i discover something undesirable i meet with my immediate stakeholders in private on what is going on to craft a narrative that still makes our team look good and that may mean discarding insights although ideally we go for it is bad but not that bad or not because of us islandsimian i am stealing the case quote thanks hivacal a friend of mine who is doing a phd program gave me the same quote but yeah information given under duress is notoriously inaccurate bracabelua i have been using the coase quote to people for years it is still one of my favorites to use given how often situations like these pop up footballfanabc it is thai massaging glacierburrito yep always good to present some options and a recommendation too npomar thanks for the share i am going to read up on this prestigioussort we have to read between the lines here asssumingly op like me tbf works in advising decisions without much consequence i work in marketing tech in entertainment and the decisions we are making are not important enough for me to make a big case if their vision is wrong the alternatives are all fine when they are likely wrong i express more uncertainty or express sofly there might be beter options they could consider to cover myself in your case ethics are at play and you need to be able to sleep at night i would rather have my analysis hated and even be fired than to validate an insight that would hurt anyone i purposely pick jobs with low stakes because now i know that there is always some subjectivity in data analysis knowingly or not and i need to be able to disconnect from work prestigioussortthat usually means the data person is looking to validate their own insights unknowingly as a bias by picking up validating insights and ignoring anything else in this case the data person is aware of the situation but needs to actively pick and choose insights that support help stakeholders make their point gottabemd not sure what you are trying to implicate here dr fauci is a medical professional with almost years of experience not a business executive with an agenda wanderlostnomad they are turning you into the scapegoat of their mismanagement glacierburrito wet bias hemrehliug ahaaa i see what ya did there buddy nice one thetjalian you are funny calebreynolds nah that is the anchoring effect wanderlostnomad context please gottabemd confirmation bias inception jackmitcham sure herpa derpa p values go brrrr hope that helps jackmitcham true though there is a certain breed of data scientist that seems to forget that jackmitcham but that is exactly what they are doing good news updates their priors to make it stronger bad news updates their priors to make it weaker but it might not be enough to flip it from positive to negative that is why they try to find out how strong the evidence is going from confident to confident does not change the decision jackmitcham and you are pretending to be a tabula rasa about everything horses are equally likely to zebras when you hear hoofbeats in america mrbrambles yea give a better story tons of soft power in data jasonsuave i will add to that in my experiences the older the company is eg years the more this effect is seen felt none oh shit was i to vague here i will clear that up dr fauci is a prolific mass murder who did it all for the money every study coming out of his organizations surrounding the vaccines are deliberately skewed to look good not to his bosses because he is the boss more likely his investors he also funded the research done by the institute of virology something he does not hide he also covers for the chinese government because he is in their pocket believe what you want fauci is own colleges have criticized him as a political tv doctor closer to mimet oz or doctor phil they all say as far as his actual contributions he has done almost nothing he is at the top because he is awesome at lying pandering and brown nosing metalt_ damn i never knew that i am going to start using this to sound smart nedgaryneb yeah using science worshippers is a definite red flag lol ciarogeile lovely perfection lostphilosophy_ thanks thats all i needed but your analysis still needs p values for management to care even with beautiful confidence intervals and effect size analysis its infuriating footballfanabc hispa toplimebayesian priors are supposed to update your priors in a rational correct way it is not supposed to be more skeptical to evidence that disproves your priors and enthusiastically accept evidence that supports it if the evidence kills your prior bayes will reflect that if the evidence only weakly supports it bayes will not be over enthusiastic the original comment made it sound like bayes is biased to evidence which supports your priors and does not want evidence which goes against your priors unless it is particularly strong i think that is a misleading way to put it bayes updates your priors objectively rationally and fairly its not harsher against disproving evidence joyloveroot no i am just saying the idea of priors is flawed it matters the quality of the priors if it is just based on their intuition or their feelings should the burden be on the data scientist to un convince them there needs to be some kind of grounding a basis for what is most correct right now based on prior information and then accordingly how the new information may change the judgment is the management is priors of a higher quality or a lower quality than the information the data scientist is coming forward with if it is of a lower quality then they should defer to the info given by the data scientist until further evidence calls it into question or disproves it entirely if it is of a higher quality then your statement is exactly correct but the framing of the original op just about implies that the upper management is prior judgments are based on little more than their feelings and intuitions which is not nothing but certainly should not cause them to feel in a position that the data scientist must have the burden of overcoming their authoritative priors position in this case it seems fair to say that both parties should come to the table with an open mind with as little confirmation or priors bias as possible joyloveroot in other words i have experienced far too many people claiming bayeson reasoning in order to subtly put themselves in a power position making it so that the other person has to prove their position wrong rather than starting with a clean slate where no position is assumed to be more right or wrong than the other gottabemd i am guessing you got all of your information by doing a systematic meta analysis of every publication he is ever produced and come to the conclusion that he is faking his data ohno then i am not sure where your assumptions are coming from i recommend thoroughly reading through some of his publications replicating the studies and if they are not generalizable or reproducible maybe you are right until then i am not sure what else to say what is your area of subject expertise in anyways wanderlostnomad ikr worship implies faith yet science does not require faith faith implies belief without proof unlike science which requires impeccable proof before belief theories and hypothesis are not like gospels or dogmas elavated beyond scrutiny via supposed sanctity rather it is the opposite science encourages scrutiny blind faith and worship is anathema to science jackmitcham you are pretending that the strength of the evidence is static and somehow exists in a plane of pure rationality this has no basis in reality as described in the op if evidence reinforces your prior it is a waste of time to dig deeper into it to make sure it is strong evidence either you find out that the evidence is even stronger than you thought so you update your priors harder leading to no change in your decision or you find out that the decision is flawed leading to no change in your priors and no change in your decision strength of supporting evidence that confirms your priors is irrelevant on the other hand if the evidence is something you do not expect you need to evaluate the strength of the evidence if it is weak evidence the decision will not change so you need to dig into it to make sure it is strong enough to reverse your prior really to take it below that is exactly the behavior described in the op astrologicrat this is a good explanation management has priors in many cases when they absolutely should not traditionally trained scientists understand this at a fundamental level because experiments often surprise them and they also understand the dangers of confirmation bias management on the other hand is often as far from science and reason as you can get so their hopes and dreams are where they place all of their bets management being stubbornly wrong should not be justified with specious arguments jackmitcham feelings and intuitions are generally guided by decades of experience and i do not think you are giving that enough credit if one thing has worked for years it is going to take more than one report to reverse course unless that report is really strong jackmitcham starting with a clean slate about everything is ridiculous and inefficient if i shot you in the foot would it hurt well we have never tried it before so lets start with a clean slate and run the experiment we will need to do it at least times for a big enough sample size none i am guessing you understand that you are making an argument from a position of authority and that you understand that people lie regardless of who they are people want money regardless of who they are you are saying oh only the most credentialed people can have a say recognizing they are humans not machines built with their own bias their own motivations and ambitions that what you want to do here is say i ca not have a say because i am not a doctor with decades of experience that was able to meticulously look through four decades of studies with the credentialed knowledge to scrutinize his work to which i say poppycock i reject the entire premise i can have an opinion about anything i can also watch fauci admit he did fund the wuhan lab of virology when in a senate hearing with rand paul he initially lied and said he had nothing to do with the organization he later retracted that when a paper trail was found between his organization and the lab he then admitted it when asked if the research was gain of function he said no it was what i have established from that is that he is a liar and if he lied about that he is cover something up i watched it live on television you can tell me my eyes deceive me the emperor does have clothes but fortunately for me i am not fool enough to believe that i can listen to the testimony of actual dr robert malone who invented and still holds the patents on the origin of mrna technology i have read them with my own eyes i can listen to him scream these things need more testing funny he wo not even talk about robert the man who is work he took to china to avoid patent violation there is a truck load of evidence suggesting he was complicit if all of that was not enough he is narcissistic i represent the science what an arrogant thing to say science is a method ya know hypothesis prediction experiment result you ca not represent that if he meant he represents the data outcome of his experiment i would have to scrutinize his model and see how he came to that conclusion once again that was done and i found it lacking i found that especially when gone over with robert malone the inventor of mrna tech with his unique expertise explaining it as well as heather heying and bret weinstein where robert explained how it was obvious they would come to the conclusion the vaccine is perfectly safe and effective with no side effects because they willfully structured the model of the experiment to ask all of the most convenient questions basically the experiment itself was structured to lie just like in the original post which was the connection to the first post this is not even to speak of his mishandling of the aids epidemic joyloveroot well put joyloveroot yes iff one thing has worked of the time for years but much of the time conventional wisdom is not based on a statistical analysis of how good things are working i have run into many people in my life who believe something works based on their own intuition only to show them that their experience is an anomaly and that thing does not actually work that way the majority of the time intuitions and feelings should be a starting point and then they should be tested and held up to scrutiny they should not be considered the de facto truth without going through the same testing that contending ideas have to go through to supplant them joyloveroot shooting in the foot has a lot of evidence of all kinds to back it up im talking about when there is uncertainty or disagreement starting with a clean slate is good for example should we forbid romance between certain employees there may be arguments in both directions on should not stubbornly claim their argument is superior when it is not the argument that when someone gets shot in the foot it hurts is well established by thousands if not millions of experiments already and i imagine there is no ir very little debate for example i doubt anyone is like well if someone comes in late to work they should be shot in the foot i know some say that would hurt but that is not proven yet so i believe i have a valid point gottabemd so far all you have done is attempt to substantiate your claims with circumstantial evidence and he said she said you are absolutely correct you can hold whatever opinion you want the only difference is that if you want your opinion to hold weight you have to be able to back it up with evidence also you do not have to be a doctor to do a comprehensive meta analysis will it help you understand things of course but it is not necessary if you are as sure as you seem about your opinions i urge you to do some hard research using credible sources and find points on either side of the argument it might widen your worldviewheckit might even change your mind what do i mean by credible sources perhaps peer reviewed journal articles unbiased journalism agencies that one will be hard etc none i have actually cited people credentialed people like doctor robert malone you have provided absolutely nothing at all here hold on is a video where he talks about his own discovery in length bet cash you do not watch two fucking seconds of it and come up with some more horse shit had toget the video from spotify could not find it on youtube because they censor i can also link the patents he holds for the mrna tech as well proving unequivocally that he is their inventor so he is more than qualified to speak on the subject oh i will also link the video compilation where fauci contradicts himself i would prefer the live video but it already happened live but you and i both know it would not matter because you are completely brainwashed or rather fauci is so deep down your throat it is poking your brain and making you stupid none i also think you missed the entire point of the original post first of all there are no unbiased journalists they are all shills second the entire point of the post is that you ca not trust the peers the peers are not angels or gods so stop acting like they are they are humans just like us they are susceptible to corruption they will take bribes they will take money they will deliberately tell us all the wrong thing for money have you ever heard the saying power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely there is no clause in there that says unless they are an expert or scientist they are incapable of lying for huge sums of cash they ca not be bought you honestly believe scientists are just like starving artists anything for the science they are not if studies are not paying the bills you restructure the fucking experiment and get some smiles from the people paying you or you do not feed your family you are nothing to them not a face not a name they never have to see what they did to you gottabemd speaking in absolutes has never worked in anyone is favor think about what you just stated there are no unbiased journalists how do you know that for sure there are a few things that make good hypotheses one is that the hypothesis has to be testable the second is that is must be falsifiable so let is look at your example one more time is it testable sure we can evaluate every journalist we come across and determine their level of bias but is it falsifiable no why you might ask because we are unable to test every journalist it is impossible so to speak in absolutes and say all journalists are biased is just bad practice i am trying to point out a common fallacy here our mind likes to create stories based on information that is readily available and we have been exposed to often i encourage you to look up what an availability heuristic is i think you misunderstand what i mean by peer reviewed journal articles by peer it evaluates to those who are subject matter experts in their field and heavily scrutinize the work of other scientists in order to lead to more generalizable comparable and accurate study models rarely ever is a study published without revisions im curious to know why you think they cannot be trusted keep in mind practically every single breakthrough whether it be clinical or technological in nature to this day has been evaluated in depth by subject matter experts the fact that our mortality rates have plummeted over the past years is because one man was brave enough to establish that washing your hands more frequently leads to better health everybody thought he was a hack but guess what he was right and study after study after study has proven this so my question to you is if they cannot be trusted that is subject matter experts how do we evaluate the information as lay people i certainly would not want to be in charge of evaluating the accuracy of a fusion reactor or the stability of a rocket engine would you i think you are also unaware of how funding for studies is garnered funding for studies occurs before the study begins regardless of the outcome of course we want good results but that does not necessarily mean we always get them think about the billions of dollars invested in cancer research every year is there a cure yet nope because we are unable to find an answer i think you also overestimate how much money these scientists are making most professional scientists barely clear figures if that with decades of experience of course it is industry dependent but research is not known for being a highly lucrative path in terms of monetary gain none man you really do not get it i am actually talking to a person who does not understand the definition if the word corruption do you think i am saying the scientists do a corrupt and unethical thing they can get in massive trouble for and their employer pays them more on their paycheck so there is a paper trail to their corruption no that would never be how that worked it is called an under the table payment and it is a method commonly used to pay someone in cash or to launder money through multiple channels what you said actually lent validity to my point by admitting they make very little on their actual work that is all the more incentive to take a bribe and deliberately compromise their experimental model in order to make more money you also do not seem to understand that i am not going to spend the rest of my life pouring over every bit of work from every journalist i am not going to do that for those experts either it is far easier for me instead of looking over millions of papers worth of work from the journalists and experts in an attempt to discern who is trust worthy which by the way is an absolutely unreasonable thing to ask for i am not doing it it is far easier for me to just assume they are all liars i barely trust robert but i do because i vetted him i looked into his past but honestly i am just done talking to you all of your arguments are nonsensical mostly have nothing to do with what i am talking about by ignoring everything i am saying you never address anything i provide because you have no argument and your are stalling and throwing bullshit you are disingenuous and i do not like arguing with liars keep running defense for fauci you are not good at it but at least you have a hobby i am just going to ignore you now ohanse sir this is a wendy is none the reddit servers are hosted in a wendy is my god",

  "i am a de for an insurance firm here in canada i hold a masters in data science and specialize in ai i had the option of choosing between ds vs de and i quickly realised due to my software engg background that ds is not the role i will enjoy as it involves some coding for making models but that will be increasingly getting automated with new tools also it involves a lot of effective communication from the ds to convince business leaders around the usability of the models built very few ai models today make it to production and can show up as earning a dollar value for business particularly in the insurance banking finance sector as a de i enjoy applying my coding skills to slice dice and transform data for different types of ai ml models i work with ai ml teams to package and ship their models to production in form of end to end data and ml pipelines i get the opportunity to deal with various kinds of data structured or unstructured and it does take a lot of time to prepare the data before any kind of model can use it it is still a personal preference i believe ds role has a mix of coding and a lot of scientific understanding and communication which can be easy or difficult depending on the audience de role is heavy on coding and does not involve a lot of complex discussion and communication as a ds role caksters i switched from analytics to de main reason for me was that analytics and ds was less technical at least in my first company most if the work was managing stakeholder expectations and presenting findings to non technical audience i never thought that i made any contribution to the company as all of the analyses and models were built on adhoc requests data engineering definitely can seem more boring and less analytical however i find it to be more technical in terms of coding and engineering practices you are essentially building production systems and you can see your work being productionised which is not always the case for data science work this of course is not universaly true as it depends how mature the company is in terms of data capabilities majority of companies do not have basic infrastructure and datareporting capabilities thus they need data engineers instead of data scientists therealtiddlydump pay seems crazy low but i do not know about the uk job market the de role is a huge differential in compensation you can always get your experience and switch to ds if you do not enjoy the work a data scientist with formal data engineering experience is a great thing to have ds in insurance here take the de job in insurance there is lots of work to be done for insurers and pay tends to be better i think i would not personally bother with many consulting firms you can ask about becoming full stack and training on the ds side later within the company if it is your thing forbiscuit data engineering has a clearer career growth trajectory for most companies it falls under the swe department and this helps provide clearer path for management or advanced ic from de you have the choice to transition easily between swe and ds depending on the nature of your work you can shift to da role easily or ds role if you are heavily involved in building models data science title varies from company to company and it is hard to share what the path is without knowing which company you received the offer from and how the data science management team is structured ideally it would be good if you have asked in the interview what the career path for the said company looks like in terms of future protecting your career de is incredibly resistant to layoffs as you are serving more on the devops side of data and are part of swe ghostofkilgore it sounds like you are relatively early career i would suggest putting a lot of weight on what you think you will enjoy most you will likely move companies and increase your salary over the coming years life is too short to do something you do not enjoy sunandskyandrainbows that is very low even for the uk standard maybe outside london and years work experienceor a recent grad in london slackington this it is not always easy to find data scientists with production experience uk salaries are low compared with the rest of the economically leading eu countries i never really understood that to be honest appropriate item insurance sounds quite boring though i feel like consulting will just show a huge variety of projects and therefor more entertaining lordskellig even still is very low for a ds job in the uk ghostofkilgore the uk economy has been relatively stagnating for almost years compared to other european countries mostly due to the staggering decision to austerity our way out of the great recession because the public view macroeconomics like managing a household budget we are slowly slipping out of the group of top tier economies due to falling further behind in productivity we are starting to see that coming through in salaries rule britannia vrulth ho do not come in france then well in reality a lot of the domain information you will have to learn is quite boring until you see the value added at the end of the day consultancy may not offer that kind of follow up gratification if you are looking for interesting work maybe look towards civil service mod nhs but pay can be poop although excellent pension there is a lot of pricing fraud and transferable generic business use cases in insurance imo consultancy work variety may not give you the time to really learn the domain knowledge and a few of these consultancy firms undervalue your skill set also des earn more and are rarer so you would be extra valued very transferable skills with de benefits job security and pension in a stable industry like insurance are good too just my opinion though yeah i seem to remember that a couple of years ago ca the entrance salary for people with a master is degree was around gbp edit maybe plus phd the longer i think about it i can only remember that it was low compared with germany the netherlands or scandinavia thanks for the explanation that makes a whole lot of sense to be honest though i do not really understand macroeconomics either i have the faint notion that somehow you can generate more wealth from nothing something that is not possible within one is household budget i wish i could determine

  "wouldatastoryteller the last time i made the mistake of disclosing my current salary during an interview was years ago thankfully recruiters have stopped asking me for my current salary and instead ask for my expectations i am in the us and i think it is even illegal in some states to ask for your current salary anyway you can always reply to their question with i am targeting x for my next role or you can just ask if they can share the salary range for the role if they keep pushing you can also say the roles i am currently interviewing for have salary ranges between x y never disclose your current salary vituluss do not recommend answering it completely takes away bargaining power do what the other commenter said reframe it to what you are looking for it is like owning a store and asking how much money someone has on them so you can charge as much as possible character you move on your salary is what the work you do now might be worth not what the work that needs to be done is worth in my experience the jobs where they asked about my salary they were scum chasinggreenroads if you tell them a number too high they will likely say something along the lines of that is outside of the range for this positions budget we were more inline of x x do this numbers sound reasonable and you go from there it can be awkward to have this convo with a hiring manager recruiter my experience seems like it usually happens with the recruiter but you will get more comfortable as you gain experience my suggestion would be to do some research know your worth and yes ask for a bit higher than you want the key i think is to not completely overshoot the salary of the position i have been in this industry long enough where i live to know what is reasonable for around here so i have told recruiters when their salary and job expectations do not align although i am very aware it is not the recruiter that decides the ranges edit oh god sorry i miss read your question you can downvote me i never say what i am currently making rather turn the question around and say i am looking to make x at this role based on my experience and the jobs responsibilities jobeta never answer that question it is in no way relevant to the job you are interviewing for anyone else saying otherwise is someone in a position to hire people and are not trying to help you just their future hiring selves the only thing that matters is to establish that you are the right fit for the position and if you actually are make sure they do not minimize your pay never give an actual number but anchor the fact that you are aiming for top percentile for your level or something or mention other companies you are in process with especially if they have a big name and are known to give good comps equity bonuses matches pto etc all of that matters to evaluate to offer and can make a huge difference even if two offers have same base so until they give you all these details you cannot make an informed decision about how much base you want also the best way to negotiate is always to have multiple competing offers and let everyone know but money is not everything either and negotiating really hard and getting a really good offer can also play against you when people have to cut costs dfphd couple of thoughts if you tell them a number higher than what you actually make they could in theory ask you at some point to prove it in order to be able to justify offering you whatever money you are asking for it is rare but i have seen it happen but that is really like the worst possible outcome which mind you could be a rescinded offer and having said that that is going to be really really rare having said that i would never share my current comp share instead what you are looking for or even better ask what the range for the role is some recruiters will play hardball and not reveal their range expecting you instead to give them a number but even those recruiters are likely going to be more than fine being told what you are looking for vs what you currently make i put or for both my old salary or desired salary if they ask negotiating a salary is like negotiating any other financial matter it is game theory dilemma where the two side push and pull and reach an equilibrium the agreed salary based on the expectations and leverage they have there is a ton of resources on how to negotiate online irrespective of the role blasketbasket i wo not be answering this question thank you i think i make a lower salary than most companies for similar job experience level but i do not know if i need to be honest if asked by another company about what i am making at my current job that is if there is a way they can verify this info with background checks and such i would think not chasinggreenroads if you are in the us i do not know of a way for them to verify what your salary would be at your current job i could be wrong but have never heard of anyone doing that there is just not a need for you to tell them even if they ask it is none of their business yeah i do not know either i wondered if they called the last place of employment to verify if i worked there if they would also ask how much i got paid idk probably not i am in the us chasinggreenroads nah they will not do that you are worrying to much they might call to verify time of employment but not salary if for some reason they did ask i would be very surprised if your current employer would tell them just do your thing in the interview good luck and make sure you get a raise",

  "sizabledata you are comparing the government more or less illegally or without notification collecting phone and communication records to people at least being aware their online data is being tracked especially social media and fitness apps they are willingly providing data in return users get personalized experiences and companies can place ads very effectively edit not all data science applications work with such data some deal with manufacturing power consumption image recognition etc so data science still exists without the use of personal data taguscove data is a tool the benefits and costs are complex and nuanced you can find sophomoric sound bites on both sides i think you are assuming that the data that data scientists use come from private users information collected unethically that is like saying all chemists do is to make chemical weapons or all biologists do is to make biological arms and then concluding that chemists and biologists are hypocrites unusualandyman i do not know if society ever was at that first step even back when it was discovered that our data was being massively collected no one really cared with regard to the shift to ds being a popular field i think through the years it is become more democratized to work in the field with every company using data in some form it is a more lucrative and attainable career gravitydriven people do not want their data collected but they also refuse to do anything about it you can opt out of tons of data collection schemes but no one does why because it would take even the smallest amount of effort wouldr freddy data science is used to analyze all types of data not just personal data wignerville have there been a shift such that only moral companies exist no it has not data is present everywhere and can thus be used in any number of ways both in good and evil there are new regulations for the use of data and ai ethics have evolved immensely since i mean there are a ton of industries where i think applying ds is downright bad because the application is bad i think it is important that we talk to other people about this and communicate why we think these things are bad like if someone is building prediction models to identify new places to frack or to steal elections more efficiently those are bad things and we should tell people doing them that they are doing bad things and should stop we can develop a culture within this field where we frown upon doing unethical stuff and we can choose to not do unethical shit with data amadeusblackwell op is mixing conflating broad political stances and trench issues with personal career choices do not do that op fiwer sorry you believe that billion people all believed one thing and now believe the opposite it does not occur to you that different groups of people have different values and beliefs i can see how that would be confusing therealtiddlydump hell remember when big corporations were seen as a tool of the right but really wrong subreddit my guy many types of data people data product data machine data financial data sycokinetic governments are in a position to authoritatively control people is lives and oppress them companies are not so there is a fundamental difference in their capabilities some companies are in a position to manipulate customer behavior and that can be really bad but it also depends on specifics like the necessity or addictiveness of their product and the demographics of their customers i will also point out that not every data scientist works for facebook or cambridge analytica some of them do genre identification for spotify or risk analysis for insurance or fraud detection for lenders or a ton of other stuff that is benign simply cool or extremely helpful melodicgiraffedata is useful humans have always collected data it is how we find patterns to essentially make predictions there is definitely abuses in the distribution of data for example after filing with my county court to be personal representative of an estate i started getting calls and mailers from realtors the county had sold my name address and phone number this was just gross and a misuse of my data that i was forced to give to a government agency to be able to function as executor however my job is to disseminate and analyze data to give leaders in my company insight to trends or areas that can be improved upon mostly nameless faceless number crunching correct me if i am wrong but this is what most ds is and da is do make data valuable for internal business purposes not selling you out so no i am not a hypocrite and i have no qualms about the morality of my career picapaodiablo data science is just math and programming engineering helped us make guns rockets and planes planes rockets and guns are used to kill they are also used for quite a bit more data science works the same way with data you are okay with providing or data that you are not okay with providing two separate issues and i am positive that for all the flaws if people had to pay for the services and services were not available that depend on this level of collection there would still be people bitching karmaissues how did society seemingly collectively go from governments and big corporations secretly taking and using our data for profit is morally reprehensible and fundamentally wrong snowden did nothing wrong to here mr zuck proof i spent hundreds of hours and thousands of so i can help you make more money by analysing all this data you have been collecting i have never thought using customer data to make money is wrong and i wager neither did most people when they applied for mortgages and credit cards when they filled out medical forms or when they filled out surveys we have been using data to make better decisions for several generations the volume and methods have changed but the principle has remained the same if you are referring to invasive data collection methods and strategies then i do not support those i think things like the right of privacy the right to be forgotten and the right to know how your data is being used should all be codified into law you will have to be more specific about what you think is immoral faang and governments use huge amount of data and some of it is as innocuous as working out how many people visit

  "dfphd i have one question in your country would there be a contract forcing you to stay for some amount of time or is this just the ceo being a boomer and pretending he has the power to get someone to stay for a long time if he has no contractual power to make you stay then i would take the job and work on it until you can find a better one yes employers are getting increasingly frustrated that workers are not dedicating their entire career to one job but that is an employer problem they just are not doing what they need to do in order to keep people around do not let employers bully you into thinking that you owe them something you work for money and benefits if they want to keep people around provide the right money and benefits nerdyjorj a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush take the job and quit if something better comes along nothing says you have to stay at some point money is important if you do not have prospects i would put my head down work as hard as i could learn what i could both what to do and what not to do and keep your eyes open a lot of companies are laying off a lot of people the job market is about to get really difficult and flooded with experienced candidates just my two cents that sounds like an awful place to work but if you really need the money now and you have got offers from them but nowhere else i would just take the money keep job hunting exactly the same way you are doing now and as soon as you get an offer for something better quit yeah they will be mad but who cares if they ask whether you are planning on staying with them long term just lie and say yes as long as you are not signing contracts with specific durations or noncompete clauses be careful to check for that sort of thing obviously there is absolutely nothing they can do about you working there for a few months or a year and then leaving for greener pastures fuhgettaboutitt i would say no based on how condescending the ceo is from your description however if its between this and nothing i would rather make sure i can put bread on the table in the meantime take the job and continue searching regardless if the situation is better than advertised then you win and you do not need to search if not you keep the search going kercreagan my experience forget the dress code stuff it is not relevant as a junior with no experience you need to be in person for the first while anyway learning on remote teams is more difficult than in person the big plus for a conservative company that has been in business for that long is that they are stable and usually have less of a work load so collect a check and learn and bide your time until the next opportunity who is to say they do not reward you after a year of job well done just learn and do the best work you can take what you can get right now something better comes along then move on oompasoloompas i would advise you to go for it if you have not any other opportunity maybe they want you for several years but they cannot force you to stay besides it is good to work with old school programmers since they can teach you a trick or two that you might bring to your later workplace csjpsoft are they conservative in their data science practices too i interviewed at a place where they did not trust anything more complex than regression analysis go for it it looks like you need both experience and income after months brush up on your resume and start applying again it is easier to find a job you like when you already have a job regarding several year of commitment it is only a one way expectation only benefitting them so only take it as business jargon do you think the company will be committed to you if it becomes slightly harder to do so saw your post in another thread and responded there so yeah no sounds like a easy way for you to be miserable and to be taken advantage of they will have you do some sort of cleanup upgrade projects for older staff members instead of training them and then you will probably be out plus that commute will eat your time and money the job market is awful i am sorry you are struggling pro and cons from conservative workplaces vs the others cons a fuckload of boomers less relaxed dress code good ole boys mentality a whole lot of adversity to change takes time if ever to be part of the club a lot of management by the seat of their pants pros usually been in business long enough to know how to run a stable company which comes with its own challenges money focus less stocks ping pong massage rooms and bullshit like that hard cash in your hands potentially less hard work and more relaxed timelines unless the conservative industry is financial or legal i interviewed recently with one of the most despicable families in the us and my too far left attitude turned them off but the financial part of the offer and the job would have been top tier more than what i get in one of the faang with way less hops to get in it was all about personal fit which obviously i did not have i would have took the money in a heartbeat given what is going on in tech right now they always have to ask the stupid question about loyalty i am loyal to myself treat me well and i will stick around for life treat me poorly and i am gone also not irrelevant factor without experience is hard enough to get a job if this job potentially allows you to build up experience and as in any old industry there are going to be clusterfucks all over the places it will it is much easier to get your second job than the first and the third and so on nicholsz since you are probably going to take the job and you are probably going to find it stressful and will quit or get fired instead of answering your question i will answer another one how can i make it for awhile at this place without getting bullied or depressed here is my advice show up early or on time every day old people care about this junk bring something nice for people the first week or so like baked treats get on their good side spend the first week or two meeting as many people as you can and just concentrate on being well liked figure out a commute that does not involve driving there a train there a bus if you spend hours driving a day it is going to affect your mental and physical health for the worse be prepared for things to not make sense and to learn less technical stuff than you might expect ds in small shops is all over the map imo there is a high chance they have their own quirky tools and methods they use that nobody else does do not worry about fixing their methods or

think it is really on you to abide by an old line cultural norm there illpanici will say from experience in a conservative workplace in a tech role take it if you have zero other options if not stay as far away as possible it will damage your morale and warp your perspective of what you can accomplish as a data scientist i worked in a less data related role but still more tech compared to the rest of the workplace and it was very bad for me slothvibes my ceo is a huge trump donor and he is charmingly fun and engaging i would personally take the job and just do not tell a single person your intention of leaving after you get a year or of experience there i took my first analyst job at way under market rate and just did everything i could to improve my skills until it came to review time where i asked for a quite large raise i did not get it but i did have yoe at that point and the job search was a complete from when i was looking for my first job i got quite a few interviews and calls back eventually doubling my salary at the company i signed with mediadiscombobulated they are going to be condescending towards you already since you are likely quite a bit younger if you are a minority or a woman it is going to be a lot worse do some serious introspection on if you can handle the possibility of being constantly undermined and demeaned by your coworkers if you absolutely have no other options then take the job but make sure that you plan for self care and already prepare yourself to not take your coworkers treatment of you and your work personally miketythhon that commute is brutal can you move closer they are conservative so that is wonderful but oof that commute supercanuck suck it up and go for it easy keeneyarcadia you should avoid any company that openly talks politics if they openly brag about what political ideology they follow imagine what the internal politics are going to be like oversharedsecret i have been in a very similar situation it will take a toll on your mental health so keep an eye on that keep your friends and loved ones close and do not let some entitled asshole ceo bully you into thinking you owe them loyalty they should be as replaceable to you as you are to them so gtfo as soon as you have an offer that you know will make you happier edit also if i were absolutely sure i could afford to i would say no to this kind of shitty workplace every time ceo are full of shit if you like your manager you are good qkumbazoo tbh i doubt the work will be very challenging and the pace of work should be relatively mild take the job getting that title will help you land other jobs as for effort do not bust your ass do enough to get by while using your free time to develop and learn use this job as a stepping stone there is a phrase that says start with the end in mind your end is to leave this job plan accordingly and keep interviewing even if you do not find something better right away your interview skills at least stay sharp tacitdenial just my two cents you should neither absolutely commit to work there for years nor deceive them i would take the job be sure to add value that builds your resume and then after a year ask for a raise to whatever salary would make you feel happy staying if they really want someone to stay for a long time they are going to have to give good raises the chance for a salary jump is why a lot of people change jobs every couple of years the one thing not to do is take the job but go in with a bad attitude if you accept it work hard to make it a good career step for you if you dislike these people enough that it would affect the quality of work maybe you need to wait for a different opportunity hackingbricker go for it might be surprised at what you can learn from people with a lot more experience than you and especially from those who leave their politics at home as for their low tech infra you will come out with a better understanding of the shiny new stuff so i would not really count that as a negative at this stage inlinefourpower are you talking politically conservative so just so you know you are going to work now this is not like college or reddit leave your politics at home it is unprofessional count it as diversity if it helps if you cannot develop a positive attitude or at least openness to the job do not take it someone else will be grateful for the opportunity if you are talking about a conservative attitude as in they do not go wild like a startup company okay that is a tradeoff you get stable work and experience but it is not as exciting in exchange it is much more likely your company continues to exist through tough economic times like the ones that are coming up soon no as someone who used to be a c level executive this is a standard speech this ceo will give in one form or another to every new employee it is designed to dissuade you from joining if you will not be a good fit and to guilt you into staying once you have joined the costs of hiring and training a new employee are high and companies expect a loss on their investment in you if you stay less than months that said all the above is from the company is perspective from your own perspective take the job to have something on your resume and if you find something better take that that it is an hour away and you want to work at home sometimes are legit reasons to leave that will not make you look like a job hopper if you have great colleagues and a great manager you may even enjoy it otherwise it is important to get on the first rung of career ladder once you have a job finding a job is so much easier magicaldestroyer trust your initial instinct they have already told you their bias views it can only get worse minderbindercapital red flags all over the place one piece of advice is hour commuting will slowly rot your soul away logisticspock on the plus side it sounds like a good place to learn from experienced people you will need about years to become at least mid level the downside is the commute none i believe you live in a western country for thinking that being conservative is bad so you do not need think too much about employment because pretty much any job will pay enough terrifictauras take the job everything is better than something something is better than anything anything is better than nothing appalachianhilltoad i think you should take a pass on this opportunity unless you have other people counting on you to support them financially it is not worth the relatively low salary to work somewhere you know you will be miserable do you have other job skills or are you able to do freelance work to float you until you find something permanent clicketrie for me it is the dress code last time i worked at a conservative company i could only wear jeans one friday a month i just do not have the energy for slacks if you have got no options i would say the same as everyone else take it and keep looking when you get a new role just play it off like sorry they offered me more money i cannot say no and do not share how grueling the search was just that you need to move for the money turingincarnate they do not want to waste time on people from my generation in their words who would leave after a year well in my words i would say that is fine i will leave right now i do not have a contract yet they can do it contractly but there is no base law forcing that i just need weeks notice period which is fine ticopico pretending he has the power to get someone to stay for a long time where did you get that the ceo thought he had the power to get someone to stay for a long time sounds like the ceo has just made an accurate observation that older employees tend to stay with the company longer than younger ones chawkconfirming their bias lol but it is not our fault that they are stingy with pay or inflexible on other fronts davefosrs this is the answer if you have a good offer take it a conservative workplace is fine people keep their heads down and keep their politics to themselves unless there is something binding you you can obviously leave whenever just say you are planning on staying for a while aggravatingsandyes i agree take it if it is your only option and keep applying elsewhere hiring managers are usually very understandable about leaving a contract for full time position regardless of your duration therealso if it is conservative and old sounds like you could just write some scripts and coast off of that too this i am in tech i am experienced and i am employed likely for the next few months i am expecting another round of layoffs either in april or june july and it is getting a though market out there from having or in house head hunters pinging me per week regardless of my linkedin status it did slow down and i am fighting for every opportunity to jump off the tech ship bigdatabro the big plus for a conservative company that has been in business for that long is that they are stable and usually have less of a work load this is a really good point data science teams at startups can really suffer from lack of direction having to reinvent the wheel and having an unclear business direction nerdyjorj when bytes mattered they learned some really cool hacky ways to do stuff worth spending time around just to find out how they solved problems i am suppose to do neural networks according to them so not really but we will see slashdave a lot of management by the seat of their pants so folks who have been working at the business for decades are sloppy managers but the young folks with impractical ideas and little experience at those innovative companies are management pros its conservative work wise not politics wise maybe also politics wise but i do not know yet haha not politically conservative work wise conservative ie mostly boomers whos been there for year and will be until retirement on site work only etc not politically conservative work wise conservative and yes not us but a western country luckily theres no dress code haha that was the last thing i needed on top of everything if you are us based no state or federal law requires you to notify your boss two weeks before leaving your job it is just common courtesy tradition wouldfphd they work on site only and they want someone to stay with them for several years because they do not want to waste time on people from my generation in their words who would leave after a year it is not forcing but it is definitely trying to send a message that they want to only hire people who will stick around it is also important to understand that especially in countries where labor laws are fuzzy like my native south america there are many employers who will try to coerce employees into staying in jobs with the threat of lawsuits shit that even happens in the us with shady noncompetes which is why i asked whether the language coming from the ceo was more if you join us you ca not leave soon after or there will be consequences or just i do not want to hire someone who is going to leave hackingbricker he has a phd so he does not know squat about management and is increasingly frustrated that loyalty actually means something to most people from the sounds of it they are confirming their own bias by underpaying people who are tired of being underpaid like yeah you are going to have people leave after a year or so if you continue to not pay them like they should be paid my first data analyst job was like that i accepted probably under market rate for a fresh analyst as my first job worked and learned as much as i could and then when it came to yearly raise i said i wanted to be at least at market rate they said no so i left for somewhere that valued me much higher than what i was even asking for so i dropped my week notice the day i got my new offer rageongonedo keep their politics to themselves rarely does anyone keep their politics to themselves in the workplace my internship was at a startup that was a total chaos and i had no one above me to guide me my manager was the ceo who was busy with investorsrecruiting etc so i know what a mess it can be averse to change and with a strong confirmation bias does not mean sloppy that is managing by the seat of your pants or using gut feelings if you prefer there is plenty of psychological research about that young managers are more biased toward change and that comes with a completely different set of issues for a data scientist especially entry level can be highly frustrating to spend months or years to build enough reputation to steer the titanic that is it if that is all you got out of the comment did i inadvertently hit a sore spot keeneyarcadia what does conservative work wise mean not from the us i can dm you my location if it helps ticopico it is not forcing but it is definitely trying to send a message that they want to only hire people who will stick around did you read what you wrote what ceo does not want that loyalty actually means something i worked at a place with most folks having or even year tenure at that company behind them and yes my first year on the job there was a huge farewell party to a retiring head of a huge department who joined the company right after high school and climbed ranks over the next years the only real reason they stayed for so long was that their contracts were structured in a way that beyond a certain point they were getting so much from the company that switching jobs would have almost never made their situation better some folks had pto days year with an unlimited roll over compare it to days with no rollover whatsoever for those hired after corporate pensions that kept growing etc etc not because they were somehow loyal to the company and do not get me wrong this is not about being jealous about someone getting it better it is simply stating the fact that years ago that place appreciated loyalty not just in their marketing slogans but in the way it treated employees starting from it gutted almost all seniority perks and other things that encouraged people to stay and went as far as prohibiting any pto rollover from one calendar year to the next one this is currently a big no no in my book i will never join any company that does that while making no real salary adjustments based on people getting more experience that is why most folks who i worked with over several years have either left before i did or shortly after that loyalty means nothing there at this time dfphd he has a phd so he does not know squat about management and is increasingly frustrated that loyalty actually means something to most people lol call me when you have had to lay people off because senior leadership decided to change the direction of the company and then come tell me about the value of loyalty seethe boomer seethe upx the way it was brought up in the interview i have doubts that people are keeping it to themselves in this company davefosrs i have never seen a conservative publicly voice their opinion in techever my brother works as a ds in manufacturingsame thing we have both witnessed liberal politics everywhere however i am liberal and he is conservative btw slashdave did i inadvertently hit a sore spot nope just the opposite of my experience and a strange way to use the term seat of the pants which usually implies a decision making process not backed up by rational planning sorry traditional unless it is france my expertise has hit it is limit hackingbricker fair enough as i replied to the other guy no need to take your negative experience and throw shade on this one ceo and assume pretending to have power the advice from someone with apparently heaps of experience to someone new in the industry to be antagonistic to management in general is simply offensive in my view i am less cynical than you given the circumstance hackingbricker i am referring to your comment referring to the op nothing about your myriad other complaints about being a phd rageongonedo depends on the workspace both of my tech jobs it is been everywhere for both sides pootydoot this is my experience in govt consulting any conservative opinions were delivered to me in code once they realized i was a safe person to be authentic around progressive opinions are shared openly without any fear of backlash tvissoma meanwhile i am the liberal in the office because i thought covid was real every exec is a conservative and many talk about it openly if they care about that sort of thing nicholsz ime people with conservative learnings do tend to prefer decision via authority more often than decision by consensus or by process decisions via authority come from individual humans holding authority and as individual humans we are chock full of biases and uncertainty recency bias is something that i am sure everyone has experienced from their boss where they only remember the last minutes from the last meeting and none of the ones from earlier weeks i think the comment is generally true more decisions from individuals rather than groups or processes results in more rapid direction shifting and seat of the pants management extensive industry knowledge and many years of experience allows you to develop some seriously good heuristics and presenting data which might go against it is challenging that is it it just takes time for someone fresh to get into the group dynamics and for some people a lot of effort in keeping their mouth closed while you build the necessary reputation to influence change especially if using newer not necessarily better techniques younger companies and managers tend to be on the other side of the spectrum which can be way worse for your longevity at the company haha no not france slashdave there are a couple problems with the discussion the biggest is an unfounded implicit assumption that an experienced manager is more conservative in political bias there are good and bad managers there are less experienced and more experienced managers do not conflate the two in any case experience will generally speaking result in a better manager this means using the appropriate processes for making decisions whether than means taking control or using available input as appropriate nicholsz the biggest is an unfounded implicit assumption that an experienced manager is more conservative in political bias huh i do not see where i made that assumption i have worked with managers who are more conservative and managers who are less conservative in my experience the more conservative managers tend to rely more on snap authoritative decisions doing snap decisions is not strictly better or worse there are trade offs for each but snap decisions do feel like seat of the pants management when you are the recipient and you are expected to change directions multiple times at someone else is whim edit snap decisions from an inexperienced managers are almost universally trash though and lead to quick doom that part i can just say via experience slashdave to change directions multiple times at someone else is whim my sympathies been there done that but i do not believe this tendency is correlated with experience nicholsz did i accidentally accidentally a word someplace i did not think i was making a point about experience per se as much as style correlating with beliefs to some extent slashdave it was implied by the op",
  "acceptable milk pay attention in school go to college study math statistics or computer science insighteous just learn the monster types of hearthstone afterwards the early game is as important as the mid and end game of each match thedataguyos how does one decide they want to do de ds as a career in high school just curious coming from a current data analytics guy who thought he wanted to be a cop one day sycokinetic for now i suggest teaching yourself to code the language does not really matter a whole lot but either python or java or both are usually good choices to start with check out something like code wars for finding problems to solve so you have things to practice on also take a look at project euler because you will need to be comfortable using code to solve math problems fair warning pe is problems get super hard super fast so do not feel bad if you get halfway down page and get stuck later on in college you will want to start searching for data problems to solve instead of coding problems kaggle is a good source for those you are welcome to take a look at kaggle now but i would prioritize coding at the start because it will be your primary tool zorobountyhunter if you can afford it google data analytics on coursera helps you learn just enough to learn more on your own learning about personal finance is important learn about different types of retirement accounts set up a roth ira learn how to create and stick to a budget wouldopearcope keep doing school if you want to get a jump on it you can take some intro stuff on like datacamp for sql and python showmewatchugaunt why do you want to be a data engineer ask yourself do you actually want this is this already a part of your hobbies are you actually interested in it or have you heard we make money a lot of people get into data science jobs and end up hating it i was a mechanical engineer for bad reasons but got into data science in for good reasons and now really enjoy my job now because i chose it this is more general purpose life lesson good luck also my actual two cents take one of your hobbies and try to find data for it start of just doing a simple analysis get averages of kickoff returns for the nfl or kills per match if you are into esports you will then develop more skills as you ask more questions weonlycryalone honestly anywhere high school is a space to explore and your career will outlive data science as it currently stands the job i have today did not exist when i was in high school and i had no special training for it even in college learn how to learn and i know that sounds trite but i really mean learn good study habits and good thinking skills logical thinking data storytelling making presentations problem solving these will suit you well in a technical career path as for courses math cannot hurt and a stem curriculum will help you place at a more focused program keep taking your math and stats courses economics or finance would not hurt if your school does not offer good cs courses as others have mentioned there are plenty of online options harvard has great free courses start with this tarehman you do not need to do anything particularly special in high school to track towards data engineering focus on getting good grades and getting into college with a big scholarship if possible given how much college costs now take a college prep course load featuring math and science ideally culminating with ap calculus or equivalent during your senior year focus on your grades but also be well rounded consider doing a sport and being involved in extracurricular activities if you have time and interest learn to program in a basic language like python or java do not start with data science programming with pandas etc instead start with fundamental concepts through an intro course on codeacademy etc photogndallas okay here is my as someone who works at a top firm running a data engineering and data science team study computer science math statistics get out of the us if possible look for study abroad opportunities maths are the same wherever you live but the way it is applied and the problems you solve can be vastly different the different points of view will help you study some of the softer courses as well for electives particularly philosophy classes some of the best analytical skills i learned came not from my hard science classes but from philosophy studies critical thinking process analysis creative problem solving do not worry so much about python r spark scala blah blah blah the flavour of the month programming language make sure you have a strong foundation in being able to break problems into atomic units and being able to design an algorithm to so lie those problems regardless of what language it is coded in the algorithm is the solution the coding is just syntax whowasphones start a side hustle preferably drop shipping or day trading incorporate ml into your strategy using python chatgpt you will be hired faster than a phd learn the harmonic mean practicalprocras math statistics and computer science from someone who studied only math in undergrad and regrets it i learned about probability from piloted shredder back in the day got like doomsayers in like back to back matches sycokinetic wrong thread its more of a goal i have always wanted to do computer science i have just never known where to start giving myself a goal makes it easier to prioritize what to do thanks do you know any places that teach practical skills for coding i have already been trying to learn python but i havent found a very great place that keeps the flow its not for the money no i want to do it because i want to be able to create something and have the knowledge to run something and analyze situations i have never been an emotional thinker and usually i go off of facts so id like to be able to put that personality to good use somewhere as well inevitable frame this i want to emphasize what i will say below only has value after all the things in the above comment im still a junior dev so not much experience but been through the process of self teaching programming i found there is a lot of valuable information online but there seems to be a huge gap from the very basics to doing something useful as in something that looks like it might be used in the real world if you are being explained what a for loop is for the third time and you know how it works then fou are likely at this stage at that stage i aways came across the advice of build something which is true enough in hindsight but did not seem like enough guidance i had no idea what to build the way out for me was building a website in the django framework having something i could run and look at was very important for my motivation another option closer to ds would be to play around with jupyter notebooks there is a guy called peter norvig with notebooks available online you can play with he is one name i remember but there should be many more you can find basically try to have fun with code and in general keep in mind what matters in life as well as in your code will change over time if you start early and eventually find you know more on the topic than your peers be respectful and still try to learn from them what i think is most important remember i can only speak from my experience and the same applies to anyone hope some of this can be helpful weonlycryalone top just not a term i have heard which industry piloted shredder was so insane back in the day teetaps no no i think they are on to something sycokinetic admittedly i do not have much material to recommend besides the official docs and the two sites i mentioned i am sure there are a million and ten youtube series and blog posts that are all equally good at exposing you to the basic syntax though throw a rock and whatever you hit will likely be fine the main hurdle for me when i was learning was not tutorials on the syntax it was finding introductory problems to practice the syntax on and code wars and project euler both have a variety of those opening check out dr chuck severance on youtube he has a class on freecodeacademy as well as a playlist for his python for everyone courses if you want a certificate he has classes on coursera though coursera costs money and it is literally the same thing as his youtube videos link to his playlist go give free code camps javascript course a shot it taught me the fundamentals of coding and it is very interactive sycokinetic lol well it is flown completely over my head then sycokinetic at the risk of splitting hairs i will also point out that anything that contributes to you learning the basics of coding constitutes teaching you practical skills you have to be able to code before you can start solving problems by coding once you are comfortable with converting a code prompt to an algorithm and an algorithm to syntax you will be able to start looking at data problems those usually involve turning a data prompt into one or more of your own code prompts which obviously requires you to be familiar with code prompts",
  "realsoftware with a degree in marketing i would see if you could first find a job in marketing data analytics and then learn the more advanced skills for data science as you go i imagine you could get an entry level analyst job if you got a certification or two to put on your resume ie google data analytics alarmingabroadi got a masters in data science for after being a teacher for six years nickmaran here is my experience and i hope you will get some idea from it i was in a similar position as youi was an accountant married buy no kids at i started with python and vba i started automating mine and my team is tasks after years i moved internally to process and quality team and became a data analyst i did my ms online i also took courses from udemy khanacademy and youtube freecodecamp etc i learned react django fastapi before moving to statistics and data science part i created a portfolio website and started posting on on linkedin as well the toughest part was to convince my wife coz she never understood why i spent hours learning new stuffs everyday when i had a stable accounting job we fought a lot for this coz i used to sleep late at night and get up at to practice but we love each other to death and that is the only reason we are still together even though we have different views having a supportive wife is very important during these times as a start

anygeologistthe route i took with a psych background took calc i iii and linear algebra at cheap local college got a masters in stats from an affordable state university non thesis degree that could be completed in semesters worked in a ds adjacent role for a year and a half used work experience to get a ds consulting job i have learned most of what i know about programming tooling on my own time or at this job the biggest roadblock for me was the prereqs i had to take pre calc before i could take calc i had a d in high school precalc and calc needs to be taken in sequence it was only a semester worth of prereqs but it took semesters to get through them as someone who got pidgeon holed by a previous masters that was a bit too niche i would caution you not to get sucked into the current buzz and get a degree if you go that route focused on specific career rather than a specific field of study a degree in cs statistics and the like would set you up well for a career in ds in addition to traditional jobs in those fields degrees in ds are a bit controversial because they sacrifice depth to cover the broad range of content areas involved in the field while it is advantageous to be well rounded actual ds jobs will lean more into one area or another and having a deep understanding of one of them will make you competitive for them the difference is essentially being somewhat qualified for a lot of jobs versus highly qualified for a subset of jobs fsapds definitely do a few online courses first and do some simple projects this might also help you in researching the exact degree you would like to pursue people in degrees are competitive and already have some data work exposure or other serious math experience you would be better prepared if you took some online courses to give you beginner understanding of the fields and tools involved like probability and statistics calculus python programming sql plus you would find many people who are starting out in their journey in course discussions from whom you can learn about the industry and opportunities character i got a job after staying at a holiday inn express last night i say do a combination of studying and learning while applying for jobs you probably will not land a data science role right away but a data business records analyst maybe closer than you think and put you in a better place to be building your data science skills especially if youre body is feeling wore out and youre super exhausted by the end of the day they might even pay for more training or education aggravatingsandnot being condescending but are you sure you mean data science and not analytics analytics is probably what you were most likely exposed to at your marketing job but if you are interested in running experiments and working with my theoretical applications of math then data science is the choice culturedindividual i recommend dataquestio it is an intuitive way to learn the fundamentals if you would rather not study in a more formal manner i also recommend towardsdatasciencecom i pay for the subscription it is a blog site where fellow data scientists post what they have been working on and new technologies this will be very useful when it comes time to building a portfolio as you can literally just adapt what other people have done use a different dataset for the same problem in terms of formal education i guess you could do an msc in data science if your bachelor is is not technical robinnohood actually my ba is in journalism i should have stated that haha but i do have some marketing experience so this is definitely an interesting take on it also i will look into the google certs as well as other entry level ones i have time so it is good to know self study may be a viable option rather than having to spend money on a degree thanks for your help robinnohood was this the online georgia tech degree i have heard good things about that if i do go the schooling route it will likely be totally online how knowledge about data science were you before you started school was it a fairly smooth ticket into employment in the field once you graduated this might be a big ask so no worries but what ballpark was your starting salary in ds robinnohood thanks for your help seems like you did great definitely a path that i can see the value in im also super fortunate to have a wife that will support whatever i want to do i will just have to send it and push myself to put the time in glad to hear you and your wife made it through nobranchop should look at this list and understand the gravity of the underlying math involved which is not exhaustively laid out here a ba in marketing does not touch calculus or linear algebra in the way that a hard math discipline like engineering or data science does robinnohood awesome thanks a bunch for laying this out i will definitely look into this stuff i have taken udemy courses mostly when i was getting my pmp cert so i will likely take some cheap classes on these robinnohood thanks for your help agreed i definitely want to hop on udemy or coursera to get some ground level stuff down i am attracted to a degree because self studying something so vast and out of my current realm seems a bit daunting the structure and access to professionals in a degree would serve me well but i agree that i want to go into it with all the base level knowledge down robinnohood thanks for your insight makes sense that it might not be a data science role at first but anything that gets me closer is good definitely super exhausted and worn out at the end of the day haha part of the reason i am trying to think about a transition but luckily there is a lot of schooling i can do right from home after work which is awesome realsoftware oh gotcha i misread mb i do not think it makes too much of a difference to be honest i think self study is still a viable and promising option alarmingabroadit was a state college i got my teaching degree from that offered it i knew absolutely nothing about data science other than the videos i watched on youtube about how data was driving covid decisions so basically nothing it took me four months to land a job after graduation i quit teaching two years ago when i got pregnant and decided to get my masters and substitute taught in the mean time i work from home now and my starting salary was i had immediate job interviews before i graduated agreed my degree and masters were both scientific subjects after years in a data science role i am regularly reminded of the mathematics gap that i infill robinnohood good point thanks for the insight i really want to dip my toes in before going all in either with a degree or something else math has always been okay for me but i definitely did not get into advanced math i think that i will enjoy data science but i want to get a taste first because you never really know until you see behind the curtain are there any cheap courses videos etc that you know of that would give me a look into what it is actually like as a job i know the aspects of it i like but the math does seem like a significannot factor of it fsapds that sounds like a good plan you will need a degree due to increased competition as well nobranchthere is a course called the mathematics of machine learning on coursera it is very light but gives some insight without knowing calculus intuitively you will not understand things like how a function is optimized under a hessian matrix or why gradient descent is moving based on a gradient

whowasphones it is good for stroking your own ego writing regurgitated articles about the iris dataset for a portfolio i just unsubscribed today it is very hit and miss of the time you are reading an article from an intern trying to help their resume cv leoreno no there is better content on personal sites which are indexed on search no firstly just clear your cookies or use incognito and enjoy your reset free access limit secondly the vast majority of medium tds articles are written by people who have just started taking an intro course as a student they often have glaring mistakes and regularly have code examples that just do not work due to obvious stuff like misnamed variables calling an image img in one place and image in another drakkur towards data science is probably the only group worth following other than specific authors that produce content forecasting time series content is pretty rare or hard to find but medium has a couple good contributors in that space that i enjoy i use it to get a shallow idea of what others are doing or interesting topics i might want to dig deep on my own also some people will post summaries of new papers which is a big help for me i

good way for me to solidify knowledge i definitely do not subscribe and i would not recommend that anyone else should they get content for free and pay a small handful of their authors plenty of stuff on there is trash but it is basically just the internet who is shocked by that i learned a ton for my thesis topic forecasting with transformers from medium so i know that there is good stuff in there if you are willing to wade through the chaff mydictainabox i just wish somebody would discuss the linear regression and its implementation in r again shkeve i am a software engineer who appreciates data science and i have found medium to be slightly more useful for software development but it is so seldom that i find anything good that i never hit my monthly free article limit randomramman no there is some good stuff but it is drowned out by the many introductory posts by introductory data scientists find experts in the field that you like and follow their blogs twitter etc there are tons of brilliant people putting out free content on their own sites so whilst i agree with all of the points raised by others i would like to add a point which i feel most of you are missing paying for the medium subscription should be partly motivated to unlock more content but also to encourage your favourite authors i am an author on medium and towards data science every article i write i try to make it as high quality as possible do i always succeed definitely not but whenever i see reader engagement claps and new followers i always get this exciting thrill if medium members spend time reading your story you also get some monetary compensation for that story its really tough to make it on your own in writing so every little counts tldr paying for a medium subscription should also be seen as a way to reward your favourite authors and motivate them to keep doing exactly that shameless plug my affiliate link to my last article no paywall wouldengydongn i find content on medium to be

if you keep reading the free articles and find them useful then yes if not then no abnormalhuman it depends what your time is worthto you or to your organization the annual subscription is justified

should be able to find something inspirning quite quickly kiddluck forget all the regular flame shit not knocking it i am here after all but medium is def worth it the format of articles that tends to trend there resonates with me and if in addition to having a solid github portfolio you have a well received article on medium because if you are versed enough to explain something you know it and if you in addition to understanding dense technical material can communicate that with some kind of ease nyquant why would someone publish on medium and put it behind a paywall perhaps i am wrong and miss something but it seems to me the benefit of writing a blog post is to promote something a product an idea or just your own reputation putting it behind a paywall seems to limits your reach no artificiallysuper medium is a content platform that allows users to read and write articles on a wide range of topics whether or not medium is worth it depends on what you are looking to get out of it here are some potential pros and cons to consider pros access to a wide range of articles and perspectives on various topics medium has a large user base and can be a good platform to build an audience for your own writing some articles on medium are available only to paid members and as a paid member you can support your favorite writers and publications cons anyone can write on medium which means that the quality of the content can vary widely the platform can be very competitive with many writers vying for attention and followers the algorithm that determines which articles get promoted can be unpredictable so it can be difficult to gain visibility for your work overall whether medium is worth it for you will depend on your personal goals and interests if you enjoy reading and writing and want to engage with a community of like minded people medium can be a good platform to explore however if you are looking to make a living as a writer it may not be the most reliable source of income or exposure art in data why are not we learning from chatgpt already i have had better and faster access to answers and concepts on there than medium ramblinginternetnerd there is

even if recycled euphoricnecessaryyou are right and i hate that too but you missed one important point it is the readers who inflate the value of those article there are a lot of gems on medium pure technical stuff and sometimes full fledged projects but those unfortunately do not get the attention they deserve and when you see that people do not care about your heavily researched articles that took you a while to put together you start to gravitate towards writing those stupid listicles that have little to no value migrate all redditors here to medium and kick out the noise and medium is

  "morebento_ they are environments like azure and databricks let you automate notebooks also papermill not saying it is a good thing jpyoris maybe you should clarify what to use means write production code can make sense for quick prototyping of parts of the project or actually run the notebooks in production sounds horrible for the latter you should ask the opposite question why would you ever want to use notebooks in production notebooks are great for interactive use by a human and for visualisation production means to run code in an automated headless and often distributed environment allglowedup jupyter notebooks my experience with them is they are pretty terrible with version control when a code cell is executed the notebook also stores the data result and that also gets flagged for version control so there is a constant having to clear all the results and not run the notebook again to get it to work logically that is just not going to work for production another issue is debugging i believe even if you could get a jupyter notebooks to run like a code script you would be debugging the file with it is html representation with the markup all coded in there that just makes for super confusing and unnecessary i am sure there are others i am not sure if i have ever even seen anyone import and call a function or class from one jupyter notebook to another which is a pretty basic thing to need to do not saying it is not impossible though tagthefourth compare code review not okay cell should be cell and cells and should be switched with code review not okay script fails at line due to deprecated code not removed which one looks like it took more time to identify taguscove notebooks are designed for eda and prototyping this creates supporting code to allow in line plotting magics and other convenient features production code needs speed and reliability you know what you want through eda you want to implement the simpler code that is easier to understand faster to run and reliable during the past months i have tried to solve a complex problem using notebooks until surrendering and using plain python modules main problems were importing is a pain code in other notebooks cannot be imported easily you end up using hacks as creating an utility notebook and using run to run it it is hard to configure running environment in the web version of jupyter lab you cannot even configure working directory which makes importing a pain in general ide support is lacking debugging is quite painful linting is almost inexistant works badly with version control if you run cells in non sequential order it is almost impossible to know the current state of the notebook they environment may preserve variables initialized in already deleted cells your only option is to restart the kernel and run again in a clear environment hard to automate if i want to run a long script in a server i can use something like tmux to launch the script if you want to run notebooks in the background and not lose output you need to do hacks like sending stdout to a file aj0jaja if your company uses databricks as it was intended almost all of your production code for ml and data engineering tasks can be done through notebooks of course notebooks are not necessarily the most convenient medium to write production level code since they may promote sloppier and scrappier coding practices lifesthateasy why would they be who wants to manually go open a notebook and manually run all cells on a production system there is no certain linearity and it is not as efficient as a single script at a push i have used j notebooks but tracking qa are certainly not ideal i prepare and test in jn but move to an ide like spyder for production dezireless iirc there is a way to run a jupyter notebook from the command line without actually opening it so you do not have to manually run cells productionizing things involves a host of tasks like version control and unit testing afaik i am not sure if usual unit test frameworks are compatible with notebooks inevitable frame might be worth mentioning that notebooks can be easily used to deliver a final product that is not production code depending on what is expected of your position in a given company for instance you may use it to deliver pdf reports or just graphs in image format for other people to put on their reports none i would argue that notebooks are not even good for the prototyping stage running code and debugging while executing cells is very time consuming and inefficient i think what jn are great for is to present some results like a final version of a project or report but i would still prefer do my prototyping in another environment first they certainly are used in production have you seen databricks production level code should be written as concisely as possible no code should be written twice there should be simple small definitions that are geared towards doing a singular task these definitions should have unit testing attached to them i am not even sure if you can run unit tests on jupyter notebooks there should be a common scripts library will functions used in multiple projects you can contrive a jupyter notebook to do most of these things but it really is not it is intended use i feel like my code is very linear when using a jupyter notebook for example i define a definition and immediately call it so that i can see the head of the df right underneath the code im also note sure how version control on jupyter notebooks would be accomplished i have honestly never tried it is it possible to make comments on a pull request usually you can comments parts of the code in a pull request because a py is a text file intended purpose of a jupyter notebook is to provide visualization and explanation of code blocks but should not be used in production monkeyunited just use it and you will see why your scope may be small simple and can be handled by notebook which is fine too renokarchnmy they are noisy and promote bad coding style that may not be the most efficient probably slight overhead issues too pretty sure you can productionize notebooks in aws glue lisa frank notebooks are good for production just copy and paste your code into python files and you are production ready should only take a few minutes aidzillafont they are i use them alot in prod scripts thanks to databricks wouldgrsmith i agree with what others have said however i have a science background replete with lab notebooks and love this functionality with jupyter i prefer jupyter lab for just exploring data in depth generating graphs to keep track of things etc however if i want to run every cell in that notebook again after months and months it makes me nervous because there may be some things that have changed and at that point everything breaks granted that is when i was new and did not compartmentalize code but still pushing a self defined class across notebooks in different subdirectories is a massive pain loud notebooks are not a good way to collaboratively work on code you need git functional programming and code resource building package libraries software dev it is really unbelievable how people use notebooks for anything more than sharing examples testing and playing around in databricks you must use notebooks there is no way around it it is ridiculous they are forcing people to throw away years of coding standards executing cells one by one to try and debug your code why why starting out it works but if your code runs into thousands of lines good luck with the notebooks it is far from efficient and not useful in a collaborative code dev environment even though you can edit in parallel but that is just it super bad practice because there is no version control unit testing etc every language has their proven way of organizing code as libraries modules or packages for transparent reproducible interoperable code which has been the standard for the last decades and the standard for collaborative code dev setting which is basically thrown away by sticking to notebooks for code dev using those same languages it results in that functions get sourced from other notebooks or defined in other cells bugs become untraceable and it ends in a big spider web mess that no outside person can understand imagine if all code on your favorite github repo was in notebooks you need to thrawl through html pages and work your way through all the cells sourced notebooks totall hell fine if you pay those developers so much that they want to stay on for life and their most likely inefficient code but if you care about continuity interoperability and performance on the long run do not use notebooks end rant notebooks serve a completely different purpose they enable rapid data science experimentation by cutting some corners on code structure readability testing review reusability etc they are great at what they are made for and not great at other stuff it is kind of like asking why if drag racers are the fastest cars we do not use drag racers as cars johnnywarbucks have not used databricks but we use spark notebooks in azure synapse pipelines no discernable performance differences but i think synapse is partially designed around using them renokarchnmy technically i have notebooks running in production more like i wrote them like a script and just run the notebook when i need to do that one thing once and never got around to porting the code out to just a script because tech debt canbooo for version control helps agree with the rest but some experimental notebooks are useful to track version control leeattle which is probably the worst part about databricks githelp git and is not a git command see git help morebento_ is that the same as aws glue python jupyter notebooks seem to becoming the default web code data environment",

  "purplebrownupdown this is when you start looking elsewhere pandasiloc it does seem like a small bump i have generally gotten around more per promotion for reference but i live in a vhcol area to be honest it is a little odd that they made you a team lead two months after joining the company at mine we never promote new hires in fewer than months it could mean they are trying to get you to take on more work for not that much more pay due to budget constraints you may want to consider using the additional job title to find something better im also a lead ds and frankly for me is just absolutely not worth the extra work and bullshit i have to deal with on a daily basis i would gladly give back a quarter of my tc if it meant i could go back to being an ic for the rest of my life you need to ask for a one on one with your manager there you need to say something around those lines i would like you discuss my comp because i had time to think since my review and i am not too happy on one hand it seems like i am doing well i got promoted two months into the job make good money to the company received very positive feedbacks on the other hand my comp adjustment barely covers inflation could you explain me how it was calculated he or she will serve you a load of bullshit that does not matter to you economy budget we cannot increase more than x the first year you are already at the top of the bracket whatever who cares about the economy when your direct financial impact pays times your salary over budget and other arbitrary constraints is the most infuriating answer to get because he or she decides on the fucking budget in the first place and if he or she does not they can speak and convince whoever does hint it is not god or joe biden just their boss you are already at the top of the bracket well if everybody is getting that answer everybody will soon be at the top of the bracket besides you are discussing your salary not everybody else and i am sure you would not mind everybody getting a raise so anyways when your boss tells you this your answer will be okay to be frank i was expecting x is there anything we can do to calculate x you are going to take whatever it is you were expecting and multiply it by this is because they low balled you so you need to counter with a high ball so you can hope to meet in the middle you do not strike me as very aggressive so my guess is you are biased towards the low side i want you to be slightly uncomfortable when you make your ask so you realise that even when asking something you thought were outrageous nothing bad actually happens then when your boss asks you how you calculated that you explain that you did some research online and that amount would get you at your market value considering your experience performance and new responsibilities operative word is your market value make it clear that it is higher than the average of glassdoor or whatever because considering your performance you are clearly not an average employee then one of two things will happen your boss will say no your boss will ask you for a couple of days to think about it if thank them graciously for their time say something like well it was worth asking with a smile then update your resume and start looking for a job not at next cycle now if say of course then update your resume and start looking for a job at some point maybe in a couple of days after thinking about it maybe at next cycle maybe the one after your comp will increase when that happens and if you feel you are fairly compensated you can stop actively looking for a job if at any time before that you find a better opportunity than you currently have now not on the basis of whatever promise your boss makes leave internetposter it is very common for mid tier companies especially those with minimal stock compensation such as yours to have extreme pay compression with respect to increasing levels and it is a virtual guarantee that you will not succeed in convincing a company that pays mid tier wages to pay top tier wages op is username checks out rayjensen dude that is a lot of money cocodirichlet you got a raise which is barely above or not even above inflation inflation is according to google that is only with base salary because comparing tc your increase is which is clearly below inflation raise for promotion at a minimum is taguscove what you experienced is not uncommon for annoying reasons it is organizationally difficult to get major compensation increases once in a company this is why the advice to switch in early to mid career exists the money to hire new staff comes from a separate pool from the bonus pool invisiblephilosophy prove your worth so you inherited it why are you worth more doortofreeside is lead generally higher than senior when it comes to titles and compensation or is that specifically lead ds senior ds lifesthateasy honestly just fuck you and your first world problems okdistanceit does seem a bit low for a promotion do you know what seniors typically get at your company maybe you were at the top of the range since you started recently and they could not justify you being at the top for lead edit also no bump in bonus i got put in for a promo and denied after we did layoffs base adjustment budgetalgaehop again parsleymost all promotions within the same company result in only a small salary increase yourmamaman that is about the bump i also got but i hoped about months later to so i would not blame you for hopping as long as you also have very good consultancy skills mgeeeeeezy what industry are you in randyzmzzzz raise wtf jump ship wouldataentryadmin wtf are these salaries everyone acting like this is standard too ayyojosh job hopping is almost always the way to go to secure a significannot pay bump internal promotions within a company tend to lowball their workers what does ic and tc stand for woulddscience when it comes to discussing pay promotions based on your performance or responsibilities the negotiating game changes when your work has had a direct tangible monetary impact it is infinitely harder to argue your worth when your employment only results in improvements that are qualitative intangible from the company is perspective but if you worked on a project that used to cost the company x and now it only costs five times those are material changes that affect their the overall company bottom line and it absolutely needs to be brought up in discussions with management everyone is situation is different and sometimes calculating the actual dollar amount impact you made will be easier harder depending on the project itself but asking for a share of that net gain in the form of a pay increase or bonus is not an unreasonable request the higher the amount is and the more clear direct the amount can be derived and the higher your level of involvement was then the more you should be asking for and nbsp fwiw i was in a similar situation at a previous role a project that i proposed and did of the legwork on ended up reducing recurring annual costs in the high figures to low figures range instead of the col adjustment that i was expecting being young and stupid i only asked for a increase the following year during performance reviews which amounted to less than one quarter of of one year of increased income that i brought in their response was to give me instead of the i ended up leaving for a different role months later it was both fortunate that i was able to find another job but also unfortunate in the sense that i liked my job the people and i knew my manager was genuinely on my side in trying to get me a reasonable increase but ultimately the answer was out of their control not always the case you were probably at the high end of the senior band now at the mid point of the lead band just my guess without any context all you can really do is try and find a friend in management or hr that can tell you salary ranges for your job band that will give you an idea of how much wiggle room your manager has or just ask your manager about it in the context of career development thecamerlengo if you are making after years of experience i would say you are very well compensated do you live in a hcol area is the job remote what is your educational background hard to judge based on the performance of the model you inherited psssat did you already accept the promotion and raise hungryquant reasonable answer maxtothej i would gladly give back a quarter of my tc if it meant i could go back to being an ic for the rest of my life mark z is willing to accommodate that hungryquant re making me lead within months you may be right but it was a unique situation i was used to leading teams and this team was lacking direction the guy overseeing it was hardly involved so i just naturally started leading i think you are right that they may want a budget friendly team lead i totally agree the non dev work required as much as i like many aspects of it introduces a lot of headache and stress ticktocktoe i am also a lead ds and frankly for me is just absolutely not worth the extra work and bullshit i have to deal with on a daily basis i would gladly give back a quarter of my tc if it meant i could go back to being an ic for the rest of my life it seems like your company is straying from industry norms for this role lead ds are normally icsthey are technical leaders not people leaders george has the blueprint holy sht thanks hungryquant indeed hungryquant agreed re inflation i find that very frustrating i have also never gotten or seen a bump in pay in a single promo cycle i am sure it happens i was thinking not sure neededathrowawayi hate this take and i have seen it quite a bit around reddit even worse to see it on r datascience inflation is not the same for everyone just because someone says inflation is does not mean yours is every situation is different looking at my fixed consistent expenses home food utilities gas last year my spending went up maybe it also assumes that every single dollar you make is put into spending that is false especially if your total comp is even if you have inflation or worse if you are spending that is only more spend with a increase in pay in op is case sure would it be nicer if you got a higher bump but you are doing alright this does not get into whether the raise was appropriate for the title change i am just talking a raise vs inflation argument inflation also reduces your taxes and increases your tax deferred comp benefit tax brackets increased quite a bit on the order of and the k contribution went up so technically yes a raise below you could say does not keep up with inflation but it is not telling the whole story hungryquant i inherited a dog shit code base and model with lines of code hour daily runtime that made a year that stakeholders did not like the old process was run in crontab locally i made the prod pipeline deployed to production integrated with company is software that end users are in lines hour runtime and make three times as much money i am worth it some companies have senior as the same level as lead if you do not specify how much more you want to get paid you are liable be an untouched row in an hr spreadsheet ie get any amount usually on the low ends merit increase between promotions between increases inside of that you are somewhere within salary bands of your role which if you ever hear what those are and you feel like you deserve to be higher in the band advocate for yourself hungryquant my life is very good obviously nobody is saying otherwise but i am going to make as much as i can to support my family and i will not be apologizing for it either hope you have a good day hungryquant bump in bonus is marginal of you could be right about the bands that would be unfortunate hungryquant we did layoffs recently too but not in data science it or engineering maybe their tight purse strings are related not that it really helps me or changes it for me hungryquant insurance hungryquant individual contributor total compensation hungryquant i am curious why do you think that is very well compensated undoubtedly it is a high number on the national income distribution but for applied ml i do not think it is crazy i live in texas not really hcol but we pay up for a decent school district i have an ms the job is remote hungryquant i was not asked to accept it is just happening purplebrownupdown if you like the job stay even a small promotion is good but if you feel like you are not valued then look elsewhere pandasiloc actually he would not unfortunately to my knowledge most teams at meta and other places have an up or out system meaning if you are not promoted on a regular schedule you are usually heavily penalized career wise and often in very overt ways like being asked to leave your team altogether fuehnix sounds like you are defacto team lead in that case rather than a true promotion but they had the decency to at least give you a title change and some form of added compensation at my job they promised me the opportunity to work as a lead on my year work anniversary and i accepted they started out saying that i would lead a project while semi supervised by another lead to mitigate risk and blame if i made a mistake then i did another project and another and another months later at my year end performance review i get a rating but i am told i would still need more experience before i could be a lead even though meanwhile i have already been lead independently on several projects and i am submitting cost metrics for projects where i can literally see that my contracting company is charging the client company hr for me as a sqa lead meanwhile i am still not a lead yet and i make per hour i know there is a lot of overhead and stuff in contracting but come on vs yeah i would have been very okay if i was in your shoes because at least i would have something and i would be able to take my lead title over to my next job i have been in the corporate world years now i am glad you discovered that early in your game you are absolutely right internally you will never get your worth unless you are kissed by the c suite gods and start moving up faster than the rest of the pack the real money will come when you can claim credit for the good work of the entire team you manage it is callous and fucked up but it is what it is pandasiloc i am a technical lead the headaches i am mentioning are not people drama but annoying problems and endless meetings that have more to do with handling bad data infrastructure than with interesting math problems i got to do more of the latter as an ic seems odd to me to identify lead ds and ics at every company i have seen the categories at least informally were ic lead and manager cocodirichlet positions usually have a range of salaries junior for a to b etc etc even if you were at the top end of senior ds you are given pennies to go to the next positions with more responsibilities unless you are being given a new title with no new responsibilities which i doubt they are probably trying to use all of the lay offs to get away with it that does not mean you should not have a conversation yeah is more typical than updatedprior not to mention that if we all keep getting raises inflation will keep going up too like it or not it is supposed to hurt a little until it settles back to something reasonable i still see packed restaurants and bars full of young spendy people there is still too much money chasing too few goods i wish anyone luck when they march into the boss is office demanding a double digit raise but be prepared for disappointment hungryquant that is all true but it does not really matter nobody in upper management wants to hear what my personal rate of inflation is or how it affects my retirement planning i had a child since starting this job and spend significannotly more as a result but that was my choice and is not relevant should i just not advocate for myself because inflation is complex should i try to explain this to people in management personally i do not think so dhush you would think this would be obvious to statistically inclined people cocodirichlet it is a point of comparison to assess his raise for a promotion this is not someone who is asking if his raise to account for the yearly inflation is fair he had a promotion even if we assume that his individual inflation was of whatever his raise was small and there is also expected inflation for and i doubt he is getting a raise to account for that when will his next raise be so not only the raise is not account for past inflation but by the end of his purchase power is going to be lower and for all of your numbers of or whatever property taxes are increasing in many places in many places i know friends had their house assessment increased which means higher taxes that gets translated to their mortgage in the order of thousands of dollars a year invisiblephilosophy great go tell your bosses that asleep dress that is a nice result as a data scientist not as a team lead you can ask for a salary raise based on your actual results not based on your promotion this year you can prove as a team lead too that you can drastically improve not only the performance of a ml model but also the performance of your team these are two different jobs and honestly i do not believe that a team lead is more valuable role in this business than a senior expert yea just made me open to a new company which sucks cuz my job is otherwise great thecamerlengo there are a lot of variables and you really did not provide that much info on the down side years is still rather junior in this field in many parts of the country is bank i know data scientists with phds in physics that do not make what you make there are a lot of phds and a lot of quants is this company connected to wall street if so i can understand the higher salary also what is your background do you have a pedigree like mit or stanford or a fancy grad degree like stats if so i can understand the premium but on the surface a data science lead with years of experience making on a remote job does not seem unreasonable or under compensated maxtothej hungryquant i mean i get what you are saying about de facto lead but the fact is i led projects for a few years in my last company so this is not new territory in contracting a margin of slightly over is typical in any case you should not accept their refusal to promote for the role you are already doing interview with other companies and tell them you lead projects it is true icelandicstorm i am submitting cost metrics for projects where i can literally see that my contracting company is charging the client company hr for me as a sqa lead meanwhile i am still not a lead yet and i make per hour i know there is a lot of overhead and stuff in contracting but come on vs i was billed out at minimum an hour as a cybersecurity consultant big four and maybe making per hour so your company is margins are pretty reasonable hungryquant good advice i did that in my self evaluation and leading up to the promo cycle although i did not explicitly state that i expect x raise now that budgets are finalized and this is being announced i do not know what to do as of now my plan is to say in my next skip level that i am surprised the promo raise was and hear his response maybe the budget is tight and they can add on in the next cycle otherwise once i make it to years maybe i will just leave hungryquant i led the team during that time too hungryquant it is unfortunate for companies and individuals that switching is the only way to consistently get paid more good performance just is not rewarded internally to the extent it ought to be ime hungryquant i am well paid because i am really good at it and know my worth i have a track record of measurable results a phd in physics or a top school is not a relevant signal at this point you either put products into prod that generate results or you do not whether you went to stanford or not i understand that it is not low compensation but it is after getting promoted for pretty stellar outcomes see my other comment in the thread pandasiloc huh interesting i had not heard of this invisiblephilosophy i am sorry for being short i do not mean to come across as rude its been a long day i think your option is great i would really focus on a higher base salary i think your base should probably be about higher at least perhaps you can ask for a percentage of the delta in money saved year over year as a bonus or what is next can you come up with another model and work toward that with the subsequent expectation on both side of seeing a significannot raise or a larger team perhaps and hey good job on that model it is hard for a lot of people to do that work of truly operationalizing models thecamerlengo well you asked for peoples thoughts the seems fine considering the amount you were already being compensated given what you have disclosed your compensation and the dollar amount promotion appears reasonable maxtothej tech has changed alot there has been a lot of benefits reduction and netflix implemented pay bands",

  "laughingwalls just do a math minor with your premed your in highschool try to take bc calculus and pass the ap exam with a if that is an option stats is a branch of mathematics and ds is grounded in stats boombillys this is very ambitious i am not saying that to discourage you but only to mention that these are all very different and fundamental concepts that you plan to cover in a short amount of time i would say that your should condense the algorithms and mathematics tracks each into one course data structures and their algorithms are critical while algorithmic design and thinking is important the best teacher is time intuition and practice so go slow additionally only if you have a decent background in calculus i would say to skip all math listed except discrete math some of the data science micromasters courses are good however these are long and in depth courses my suspicion is that you will benefit from a shorter introduction to these topics right now the most important thing for doing research when starting out in my opinion is getting your feet wet pick a course where you learn python learn a bit then put it down and figure out data structures and basic statistical summaries of data you may not realize it while you are doing this but you are actually building a ton of important intuition about model building and design to me the exploratory and organizational aspects are actually the most important part of data science and ml because they are the things that inform the model i am going to build or use which almost becomes an afterthought if i understand the data through and through i would take a simple scatterplot or word cloud over a very complex model every time if i could best of luck feel free to reach out if you have any questions i have already taken bc calculus and am currently taking ap stats so i do have some background there i can definitely take most of these courses now so i do not really have a reason right now to minor in math this could also result in a worse gpa in college which is really not good for premeds thanks for the feedback i am most definitely going to be getting hands on lab experience while doing these courses so i will be getting a lot of practical experience beyond these courses as far as skipping the math courses i saw others mentioning the important of calculus and especially linear algebra i have slightly modified the path i have posted here and decided to take mit is single and multivariable courses along with a linear algebra textbook then i would dive into the applied data science aspect would this be too much i am definitely willing to spend a lot of time learning everyday laughingwalls if you want to do ds you should take calculus iii and linear algebra that puts you close to a minor in most american schools you are not going to be able to really study this stuff at a high enough level to have a career in it with or not it also do not put premed on a pedestal no one who is in any academic field is impressed by the fact someone is in premed its something that highschool students and nonacademically inclined people do because everyone and their dogs know doctors make reasonably good money its a lot harder to get into a good cs phd program stats program or similar the competition is global and the path is more difficult regardless of what this forum thinks people who get into at faang or leading companies generally are extremely well educated i would know i actually interview them mathmokiwi so i do not really have a reason right now to minor in math you have a great reason to minor in math stats you wish to do data science bioinformatics computation biology that screams out in order of importance excellent compsci skills very solid stats math skills moderately competent bio skills boombillys it is good that you are willing to put in the time to understand these concepts that will serve you well but you should keep in mind that these are still high level concepts and they should still take you a significannot amount of time to understand properly for context i would not trust myself to get through entire calculus and la courses textbooks in a few months even with my experience instead i would have to make a strategy hit the important proofs and concepts and ensure i can also do as many of the exercises i can correctly for calc i would recommend you go through dr strang is lectures on calculus the close that starts with the big picture of calculus and watch 3blue1brown is videos on the essence of linear algebra trust me on the second one as someone who had to struggle through bad teachers and instruction on la starting with will save you literal years of time dr strang is lectures on linear algebra are as close to perfection as you can get but i still think it is too much detail to absorb over a summer for a first pass especially when you have to contend with calculus you need to first be comfortable with a matrix as a mathematical object try to find the most intuitive explanations you can for calculus first you will want a good fundamental understanding of limits derivatives and integrals oftentimes in research you will not know the answer to a derivative or integral or even be able to write the exact answer down but you should know either when you see them you should be able to interpret them and you should know when to use them the computation the stuff you will do for your classes is important too but it helps to have the context for what you are doing i am going to be taking calc and linear algebra courses in senior year anyways from mit also i am not trying to get into a phd program i am pursuing ds independently because i have the time now and do not want to spend too much time in college for it and i am mainly wanting to learn it for medical research and because these skills are heavily valued in that field further i could publish some great independent research that would add a lot of value during medical schools admissions also why would it be harder to get into phd programs for cs i have heard it is quite difficult for premeds to stand out and get into the top tier medical schools as well most high tier ones are sub percent and require an extraordinary amount of outside time to even be considered clinical work like volunteering shadowing research high gpa not mentioning outside club engagement non clinical volunteering and work as well as strong leadership roles it is quite difficult to get in from what i hear from others many people often take gap years not just a single year off they take gap years to gain the necessary skills to apply to these programs and even then they get rejected and wait for the next years round and it is no cake walk after you get in either then you have years of brutal work in medical school and then another stressful round of applications in residency and fellowships i find it a little insulting that you would suggest that non academically inclined people are the kind of who go for pre med everyone knows that if you are only going for money pre med is not the track it is years of hard work and commitment nevertheless i appreciate your input i guess my point is that i am driven to learning the content on my own as self studying in my free time i am not sure it is worth dropping my gpa over that is why i would rather not take more than my pre med requirements thanks for the advice i have definitely been planning on watching 3blue1brown for whatever videos that i can and yes i agree i am trying a little too much to rush things i will make sure to slow things done to let the information settle in a little more thanks laughingwalls i do not need to read the rant man its take it or leave it advice yes getting into a decent cs program is harder your competition is the best students from the best schools all over the world and undergraduate academic standards are generally harsher and not easier in other countries its also why most phd students at american schools are foreigners mathmokiwi and i am mainly wanting to learn it for medical research and because these skills are heavily valued in that field you know clearly what you want to do medical research specifically data science bioinformatics computation biology i do not see the point whatsoever in wasting your time at medical school when that is going to be holding you back from your goals it is such a silly wasteful plan of your time i am afraid going to medical school is getting you a clinical degree just like pharmacy optometry nursing veterinary etc are all clinical programs of study too and it is not getting you primarily a research degree for that field just like if a person wants to do research in animals they do not become a vet they go to uni and get a phd in biology likewise if a person wished to study drugs they do not get a bachelor of pharmacy no rather they go study a bsc in pharmacology then carry on to get a masters phd in that likewise for yourself it is a waste of time for you to go to medical school you need to aim much higher than medical school go get yourself a phd that too is a long hard road if i was you here in new zealand where i live i would get myself a bsc in statistics mathematics with a minor in biology or maaaaybe the reverse major in bio while minoring in stats while simultaneously doing a conjoint degree with a bachelor of engineering that is specializing in engineering science or perhaps software engineering this would ensure you have top notch technical skills while still have a decent foundation in biology as well setting you up well for entry into a great masters phd program in the niches you wish to specialize in and also why would it be harder to get into phd programs for cs completing a phd is a very very hard task especially in stem in any top college and it is years of hard work and commitment yet another reason why you should not do medical school all those years spent without actually getting you truly closer to your actual goals as just getting a phd in cs math stats will itself easily take you the better part of a decade mathmokiwi i am not sure it is worth dropping my gpa over if you think taking a few undergrad cs math stats papers is going to be a big hit to your gpa especially as you are extensively pre studying them beforehand then i seriously think bioinformatics computation biology is not for you as you are in quite the wrong mindset as you should be viewing these papers as a gpa booster for you you could have replied without downvoting someone who disagrees with your opinion i would not underestimate the difficulty of getting into medical school as i mentioned earlier there is an intense time commitment that comes to even being considered into quality med schools even those who spend hundreds and thousands do not get into what they want and considering this is just the beginning it is by no means a path that non academically inclined people take you do not become a doctor just for the sake of money if you do you will quickly realize that you will not have the drive to persevere through the hard times you are heavily underestimating the intellectual demand of becoming a doctor and there are those like me who are interested in engaging in research which is again quite intellectually demanding the data science aspect is only second to my dream of becoming a physician in neuroscience also i was not trying to say that a phd is easy or anything i was simply replying to another user who was underestimating the difficulty of medical school and becoming a doctor i have grown to really like research and want to do computational research in ml eventually but it is not my primary career goal besides most doctors actually do research in conjunction to their clinical work anyways i intend on pursuing both aspirations mathmokiwi you are heavily underestimating the intellectual demand of becoming a doctor sorry but i am afraid you have also been constantly at every turn been underestimating the heavy intellectual demands of becoming a top researcher in cs math stats you say that is what you want to do seriously what you are always saying is basically repeating over and over you wish to do research in niches within cs math stats yet you think a handful of moocs will be enough and then you can waste the next decade plus going off to medical school instead of studying the very hard topics which you do need to study at college if you wish to achieve your goals if you want to just simply be a medical doctor that is fine admit that be honest with yourself go and be a doctor but you need to also realize that is also going off in a totally different tangent to your claimed goals of medical ds bioinformatics computation biology mathmokiwi btw i updated my post above with a fair few edits before i saw your reply so check out my edits above a clinical physician and a medical researcher are two rather very different career paths and i think you are massively both overestimating the amount near nil and the type of research the typical physician does it is totally completely different to computational biology that is for sure as they have no overlap and zero skills in that no i am definitely not underestimating the difficulty of what i am trying to achieve perhaps when i was just starting to get interested in the field but since then i have done a lot of reading and have gotten plenty of advice to figure out just what i need to know and believe me it is not just a handful of moocs my learning path is quite comprehensive and also contains actual university courses from reputable places like mit and stanford i have made sure to cover every single aspect that this path requires from highly rated sources that have been used by many with great success as well also i am someone who learns much faster through online material than in person classes believe me i can pick up on these subjects several times quicker when i am carefully working my way through the material and also believe me when i say i know that just doing courses is not enough i already have some interesting projects planned to do when i know enough what happens when i finish a project learn more and do another one iterate and repeat of course i am not just going to sit down and watch some dude talk for hours and say that i learned and saying that i am going to waste the next decade of my life is quite insulting considering i am spending that time doing something i am genuinely passionate about another note i never said i wanted to become some phd level top researcher i want to become proficient at it and will pursue it at a higher level if i become more interested",

  "sycokinetic no at most some care if your phd is from something like mit or not and that ends up being it still stupid because the best candidates do not all come from ivy but not as stupid as it could be they will be more interested in your demonstrated skills and your projects so it will be good to choose a thesis dissertation topic that will involve you working through a variety of standard ds tasks including data gathering feature engineering distributed computing and model evaluation then you will be able to check off the boxes during screening and speak their language in interviews frequentiststats let me ask you this do you think it is a mistake for a stanford alumni to do a phd at stanford no as long as the reputation of the insititute is out there no harm at all laughingwalls no one really cares this is one of the biggest myths perpetuated by under grads and career counselors phd is a research degree within fields you are evaluated by the percieved quality of research portfolio among your peers outside of your field a phd is a phd is a phd unless you are at harvard level schools most people will not even be able to tell how good your phd program is for example university of minnesota is a top school in economics but someone with little knowledge of econ would assume brown or cornell are better departments more often than not when i see a person doing a phd at the same place as undergrad at non top places the mistake that person made is they did not shoot high enough like the few times i have encountered it is the candidate probably could have gone somewhere ranked higher and did not because of convenience outwithcamera when i was looking at grad school there was some discussion among academics about the benefit of going to a different school than where you received your bachelor is i think the main concern was about intellectual diversity and exposure to different schools of thought and the idea that going to a school where you were an unknown showed your mettle grad school is challenging and something of a trial by fire unfortunately at the end of the day i never knew anyone who truly gave a shit in the real world ask yourself if your current school gives you access to the stuff you want to learn and figure out if it is different from what you might experience at another institution ghostofkilgore i have never heard someone seriously care about that what possible reason could they have to none deleted mrfrknfantastic so far it seems pretty similar for me it is been more of a focus on statistics linear algebra since i already have a cs background at least for my program there are also been more of a focus on system engineering",

  "freedryk take it i started as a data scientist years ago after completing my phd my second job was in data engineering and now i primarily apply for data engineering jobs for one thing there is often less communication with stakeholders required for data engineering and my social skills are not so good for another thing i find that i have a pretty big advantage over other data engineers because of my understanding of machine learning algorithms and numerical techniques when i have had data science positions i also find that my engineering experience makes me more valuable because i understand the systems that i am working with better than most data scientists unless you want to go for something ultra specializedcutting edge large language models or something like thatit is a great career move at most companies that i have seen data engineers have the same income potential as data scientists we tend to be on the same pay grades also if i am being honest the last two companies that i worked for probably had a greater need for good data engineers than data scientists we were always lacking in good data engineers yes subjectadi used to be a data scientist but work as mle now doing more engineering including some data engineering work tbh most data scientist positions in many big tech companies are just glorified data analyst roles unless you got lucky or have phd i think data engineering will be more in demand than data scientist roles because modeling is increasingly getting commoditized i come from a pure math background and i came to the realization that i actually preferred doing engineering work than modeling ds work also i hated reading ml papers so did not want that to be part of my job lol do you know how to do data engineering mizmato de ds is a common path pay is good as well muckthefodsde ds de does not come with all the bs that ds does cyclicdombo from a data engineer data engineering jobs can vary wildly in scope it is a blanket term people are throwing over basically any technical data driven job that is not data analyst or data scientist it could mean pipeline engineering complex sql development no code data ingestion managing databases etc whether the skills you will learn will be useful in transitioning to data science depends on the position but i would say most data engineering positions should be somewhat useful to a budding data scientist you will learn how to effectively deal with large amounts of data any experience is good experience and it will absolutely look much better on a data scientists resume than nothing suedepaid honestly i think de is a way better place to start as a new grad you have more defined outcomes and requirements and you can really quickly build an excellent technical base also modeling is a relatively easier skill to self study and there is a lot of resources to help you learn as a hiring manager i prefer a de who learned to model then the other way around i find they can think in terms of deployed system better focus on you engineering skills primarily learn how to build pipelines that do not fall over in production learn why they do fall over be on call learn how data is generated manipulated and stored figure out why your org chose the tools patterns it did it is been posted ad nauseam but was in a similar position as you when i graduated from my masters program in data science had offers one for data engineering and one for a data scientist position the data scientist position seemed to be senior and it was also a start up i personally did not feel comfortable taking it as it would of required a higher skill set that i had at the time the data engineering position they offered to train me and i have been really enjoying it still get to work with the data science team so i have been getting exposure to models but i found myself enjoying building pipelines and working in the back end more enjoyable if they are offering to train you and it is from a reputable company i would definitely consider it best of luck in your career lnfrarad i would recommend to go with the data engineer position because such jobs handle the pipelines ingestion of data to the data lake data warehouse this is valuable experience even if you pivot to the data science role in the future because it will help you understand data from the source side data scientists and analysts work from the data at the downstream part of the pipeline having such pipeline experience will also open doors for you to consider up skilling to mlops related positions in the future now for the bad news being a data engineer is a different area this role is a specialized software engineer who maintains and creates new pipelines to ingest data on a batch schedule or real time with streaming technologies besides understanding those frameworks they would also need to know about cloud technologies as most companies host their data lake in the cloud so basically a lot of learning and the need to be a strong coder but a rewarding career autumnotter yes that is how i started you may find you prefer it if not the work experience will help you eventually into a data science job asiljoy at this point in your career i would care less about the specific position and more about what i can get out of a role is it a company you want to work for manager team are they going to invest in you is the pay etc in line with what you need if they train you you will find it easier to lateral into a ds role later you will already have office experience and have better real world examples for employers during the interview process adventuringraw i was originally wanting to become a data scientist but ended up getting a data engineering position instead i am still there haha ended up liking it and at my company at least there is been plenty of room for connecting with the data scientists and there is opportunity for shifting laterally over if when i ever wanted to as others have said too knowing both areas will definitely give you a competitive advantage so in your shoes picking the de position worked out fine maybe it would for you too either way pays roughly just as well and if the job hunt is not going well you could do a hell of a lot worse i am starting to think that places want a bit more business experience for ds analyst roles maybe just a guess but if you have no job take the job can keep searching affectionateanswerdefinitely take it after a year or so if you are still interested in ds i would recommend you look at mle roles i have found ds team members often times struggle when it comes to software engineering so if you can pickup swe skills while in a de role and pair this with your ds background it will open up a lot of potential roles careers frequentiststats just take it caksters i took data engineering job after data analyst scientist rile and never looked back job market is in data engineers favour based on all messages i keep getting from recruiters nature of the job alsi apeals to me more more of a technical role compared to my previous analyst scientist roles because i have to deal less with non technical stakeholder management dexterhsu you should take it all data jobs are very similar except true data scientist work years ago when i was new grad i was applying for data scientist and ml engineer roles and i was rejected saying you have no skills and data scientist roles requires ton of experience then i started with data analyst role doing some sql moving forward with time i learned few things and aws services which helped me to land a job as data engineer maybe in the future i will move to ml dl role computer vision work to be specific but i bet data engineer role is cool and you will learn lot of things i would take it being a good de will make you a great ds employers are cutting back on ds right now but they always need de i am a ds and i have done more de than ds in the last six months because the business needs have shifted i was in your position too wanted data science or ml and got offered a data engineering job i do not think i could go back to data science i love the work i am doing and having the data science and ml background opened me up to a bit more freedom spiritualquestions i would say take it i think data engineering is one of the best data related jobs and the skills you build as a data engineer will be helpful for ml engineering if that is interesting to you later no be true to yourself i am stuck in de and i hate it greenbloodedamazon man how often have i wished that des understood the nuances and requirements for ml and ds overall fighting with that right now been thinking of my next stage of my career being more towards leading a broader tech team in order to really create a better ds and overall analytics pipeline sapiogirl i am a data scientist now but only know python and a little sql do you have any suggestions on what projects should i do on my portfolio to get data engineering jobs gokuwho i do not have any diplome or certificate in dl neither working in the field but i find it an awesome thing to work outside your study field it opens your eyes and you can still apply what you learn personally in the job making the job easier after all it is also about learning new things cause those are things you did not learn did not know before it makes the job more interesting gehdichwaschen agree i studied ds as well and since then was only in data engineering positions almost everywhere the basis for ds projects is solid engineeringso it is a great skill to bring anyways did you do a double with any other engineering or did you only do data science mariaadel what skills should i develop to transition from ds to de in your opinion thanks whereyugoincityboy cannot do data science on shit data jayesdy noted thanks haha jayesdy it is a position where the company is gonna train me so i will be okay xavinator many people go from ds to de too subjectadi have seen a ton of people go the opposite as well because they get disillusioned by data science aj0jaja what bs are you referring to having to deal directly with business stakeholders presenting results etc rather than just focusing on problem solving curious as i have recently started in ds analytics and looking to pivot to de you have got that backwards relevant rhubarb data engineer data plumber for expected and desired outcomes data scientist applied statistics and discovery science like the difference between an architect and crane operator both great jobs but not the same i do not software engineer who maintains and creates new pipelines to ingest data on a batch schedule or real time with streaming technologies besides understanding those frameworks they would also need to know about cloud technologies understood yet may i follow up with this question how can one shape their degree master of science in cs engineering towards data engineering bs the cloud and pipelines are boring tedious and hard if you want to be a data scientist you must avoid de or you will forever be stuck doing mechanical work not the thinking work of analytics and data science sapnupuasop how can you be a data scientist with only minor python knowledge a taste for cyanide designingdata unless identifying shitty rows allows you to use it as a feature could it be me are they hiring more take it those are highly marketable skills both for de and ds roles a ds person who understands and can do de is so much more valuable none deleted wouldrrednirgskizif the bs of people thinking they need data science to do things they do not need data science for so they can ignore the results of said data science and make decisions based off their opinions jukazecajou pretty bad analogy in a construction site all the calculus and technical design are made by a cabinet of civil engineer you are right i see there is a bunch of plumbers with no imagination in here downvoting you wouldataquestions i also do not unless you have a great data engineering team with an aptitude for mentorship and clear guidance lnfrarad hi for data engineering no special degree is required your cs background is already sufficient to satisfy employers that you can code well and contribute in a software team if you did take the module on distributed computing that is great too as it is helpful to understand the internals of how some data processing frameworks work the de knowledge required is more on the practical side for example scheduling frameworks to handle batch jobs eg airflow streaming frameworks eg kafka parallel processing frameworks eg spark cloud vendors certification which train you on their data services eg aws certified big data azure gcp data bricks there are many tech stacks depending on the company you apply to do google the job ads and compare the different technologies listed lnfrarad haha if you got the guts go say this to your company de after you piss them off i will love to see how you get useful insight from no data walewaller i used sas for ds in my previous job for years started learning python only when i realized how important it is have not used sas ever since r julia or sas i imagine a bit uncommon but in some fields it is not unheard of walewaller can you elaborate how did you get disillusioned by ds also how did you upskill to de what resources etc did you use unblob only know py and a little sql not that person but i was in analytics and was given the option to become a full data scientist which i rejected for data engineer the base should be the same python sql data engineers work more on automation hence the code should be readable this is sometimes overlook by ds having other programming languages is good but not necessary from there look into how to automate pipelines batch vs streaming cloud how to optimize queries and deal with big data sapiogirl since i do machine learning and python but i would not say i am an expert yet in it i have not had to do sql in my job sapnupuasop oh true i misread it sry or it was edited khushaldhola guys i am in tier college and

  "renokarchnmy why not baseline with a naive model like ols or random value assignment kroutoner non normality of the residuals is a complete non issue for using linear regression in a predictive setting if you want to draw inferences about the parameters of your mode this is important but this seems unlikely considering you are comparing directly to gradient boosted models cocodirichlet residuals not normally dist this is not an ols assumption none if i would do an interview for a job i really want to my strategy would be do a small report with my findings from the eda you already did this so cool and the modelling results say you chose the lightgbm because you know beforehand that is a good idea using in tabular data sets and you could build others with the time constraints if you want to impress use a bootstrap validation and present the test results as distribution stating the best and worst cases of your model you can use another faster model to do this because is time consuming and you would change the explanation of item and do not forget to compute the most important metric for the problem and why you chose this one do not forget to state you computational requirements and a well organize requirementstxt and instructions to generate all plots and models that you build edit i would not mind build any another model only state in the report that you could do further modelling if necessary to improve modelling speed or accuracy tarehman i think it is probably extremely overkill to start with a gradient boosting method instead of just trying basic ols at the data scale you are talking about therealtiddlydump i thought about making a traditional linear regression to compare lightgbm with but the data they gave does not hold the assumptions of a linear model residuals not normally dist uh are you sure you understand linear regression weluuu for nn do you consider using cross validation since you mentioned you have small data maximum ruin just a hint you can use pycaret its stupid easy and throws all suitable models on your data you can even blend and stack gives good summary to compare how many parameters does your model have livingteachingbaseline model using any classic regression arimax or holt winter or any other model according to your data nature not sure if you can use ensemble as well frequentiststats i thought about making a traditional linear regression to compare lightgbm with but the data they gave does not hold the assumptions of a linear model residuals not normally dist you are not conducting the inferential analysis without interpreting the p values at this point you are doing the forecasting that is the difference and residuals not normally dist well the normality assumption is usually quite loosely tolerated in practice roughly bell shaped is acceptable you really need to check lie mechanicalnumber modelling wide why not a gam too so it is full interpretable maybe look at how to quantify business benefit discuss relevant data pipelines needed omoshiroides i would try something like a non parametric regression nadaraya watson for a dataset of this size you could even estimate the confidence interval for predictions such as by using a gaussian process hourconnectiongiven that it is randomly generated you should set a very naive prediction benchmark which could be a simple average or random value as the benchmark then i would incrementally increase model complexity linear regression simple decision tree cart etc then finally try more complex solutions like lightgbm then compute the different models errors using the test validation set and see if the performance is significannotly better than the naive simple average random null case next compare the models between each other to see if the increase in performance offsets the increase complexity maybe use aic or bic criteria also i would also highlight the trade off between explainability and predictive performance if they are highlighting that the prediction does not matter they probably are looking for a simpler model that has better explainability assuming the models beat bull case maybe look coefficients in the linear model the split criteria or tree diagram of the cart model at the end of the day i think they want to see if you are following the rule of parsimony especially given that this is only observations of randomly generated values ramblinginternetnerd lightgbm xgb catboost all basically hit the same points regression linear logistic poisson elastic net could be useful for interpretability especially if you explain that you used vif or feature selection methods such as varimp from the ensembles it might also be worthwhile to look into some evolutionary algorithms or branch bound search heuristics gosdt murtree are useful this will blow their pants off use catboost regressor with the shapley package share the feature importance with them plus the per feature importance each instancei mean your dataset is small but that is okay you could build a linear model and compare the mse or rmse improvement or even less than an ols just use mean or median of the target variable it is probably going to be garbage but that is the point of a baseline therealtiddlydump truly fucked up residuals can tip you off to a misspecification but your comment is right on the merits mathstatgal lol what say you chose the lightgbm because you know beforehand that is a good idea using in tabular data sets and you could build others with the time constraints i guess you wanted to say could not right genuine question english is not my first language and if you want to impress use a bootstrap validation and present the test results as distribution stating the best and worst cases of your model you can use another faster model to do this because is time consuming and you would change the explanation of item and do not forget to compute the most important metric for the problem and why you chose this one how do i make it i guess i will not have time to apply boostrap validation but i got interested in that i quick gooogled that and did not find any tutorial can you elaborate more i do not consider using nn since the dataset is too small features in the dataset all of them where used for the lightgbm should i keep all of them look my approach and tell if it was wrong i checked the data and removed one variable that had of correlation with another variable after that i checked for outliers and did not find anyone i fitted the model and checked the p values for the variables i removed the variables that were not stat significannot taking care if they were business significannot i also checked diagnostics to understand the prediction made after removing these variables i re fitted the model and checked diagnostics plots it is not linear residuals are not normally dist and variance of the residuals is not constant i have never fitted a gam so i do not feel comfortable doing that for the interview the other points are relevant and i was already considering them in my report kroutoner for sure looking at residuals is a good idea that is beneficial for assessing model fit and always advisable but you could still have some wacky residuals and not be able to do better than ols eg a model where the mean is linear in covariates the variance is fixed but the residuals are skew normal with skewness varying sinusoidally with the mean residuals would probably look absolutely awful from this model but you cannot do better than ols for predicting the mean afstats the residuals and errors are different things the errors are commonly assumed iid normal not the residuals when people say error in the linear regression setting they are really referring the random noise in the true data generating process the residuals are the difference between the estimated value and the true value and can be used to assess the normality of errors assumption kroutoner ols as a predictive model can be used regardless of any assumptions whatsoever you can just use it as a black box model other results can provide guarantees about ols based on various assumptions such as efficiency under gauss markov conditions or exact finite sample inference under normality none i guess you wanted to say could not right genuine question english is not my first language no you actually could it is a good idea using any tree based model for a tabular dataset always is a good first try english is not my first language neither so if anything is not clear do not hesitate to ask do i make it bootstrap a metric m from a set x is calculate the metric m several times with x resample of its size there is a bunch of theorems explain why this works and with this you can calculate the confidence intervals empirically let me explain by code that i think it will be easieri did not validate the syntax but the general idea is this n number of essays will

know that before building the model and if your residuals are not approximately normal is your regression properly specified etc no i am asking how many coefficients weights are in your lightgbm model frequentiststats i checked the data and removed one variable that had of correlation with another variable after that i checked for outliers and did not find anyone ok that is one way to do it i fitted the model and checked the p values for the variables i removed the variables that were not stat significannot taking care if they were business significannot i also checked diagnostics to understand the prediction made not the best way in terms of feature selection you need to avoid multiple testing by imposing corrections try information criterion model selection or lrt and after removing these variables i re fitted the model and checked diagnostics plots it is not linear residuals are not normally dist and variance of the residuals is not constant at this point maybe try some other models ex semi parametric make sure to know the data check whether exist some zero inflated issues etc checking the distribution of your target variable can help you a bit mechanicalnumber fair good luck then kroutoner i would not say this is really quite correct or at least appropriate firstly the distinction between residuals and errors is not really the reason normality is not assumed for ols ols just straight up does not require normality at all the gauss markov theorem guarantees that ols is efficient under linearity homoscedasticity and independence second and this is somewhat more subtle normal errors coupled with the other linear regression assumptions implies the residuals will also be normally distributed non normal residuals is adequate to falsify the assumption of normal errors this means that while normality of residuals while not commonly stated as an explicit assumption is in fact logically required by the standard normal errors assumption and therefore implicitly assumed mathstatgal exactly the point unless it is simulated data you never know what the error distribution is in reality you use the residuals to validate that requirement of ols they may have used the term interchangeably but i will give them the benefit of doubt sorry i think i was not clear in my post i actually built a linear model after the lightgbm after i checked the residuals of the model actually i do not know how do you check that afstats good points i agree cocodirichlet no you do not use the residuals to validate the assumptions that errors are assumed to be normal residuals have to be checked for other assumptions like homoskedasticity nonlinearity etc if you do the figure of the residuals against a standard normal qqplot and there are deviations it is not a problem unless you have a very small sample size therealtiddlydump here is what i would want to hear if this was an interview for my team rows is not a lot of data so a linear regression seemed like a good place to start without domain expertise about the features a naive linear model did not perform well i have to assume you just dumped your features in without any transformations etc in a real business context you would want to work with stakeholders to understand their view of the process you are modeling lacking that a well performing technique that is robust to nonlinearity was used your lightgbm that would signal to me that your instinct is to start simple and incorporate as much input as possible before just throwing black boxes at everything good thank you therealtiddlydump best of luck",
  "initial image check yes and spend the next day or two learning about the subject and building a toy model you have a machine learning focused phd you will grasp specific subtopics of the field quickly enough if they later explicitly ask about it in an interview you could say your experience is mainly theoretical by the way are you sure you were rejected precisely because of this question wouldaudder anyone trusting their hiring to a yes no question on a niche experience that a competent professional can learn in days is an idiot i always answer truthfully gaps and all mind you in my field everyone is going to have gaps and the job descriptions are normally massively over ambitious machinegunkisses can you reach out to someone at the company either in hr or the hiring manager highlighting your aptitude for the position while being honest about this shortcoming sapnupuasop but maybe you just are no good match without previous experience in the topic if it is that important to them and they would kick you out over not having experience in it then maybe in their eyes you are jot the right candidate tarehman i am concerned by how many people are telling you to lie it is bad advice and i do not recommend it any competent employer will know that even without experience a good data scientist can learn the methods if they automatically filter out people using a poorly designed heuristic they are not the place with your dream job this can be generalized to any job you have to lie to get in order to circumvent some dumb hr system is probably not at a place you want to work tell the truth it is the easiest thing to remember maybe i missed it but did you actually get rejected or was the whole thing about a mediocre candidate getting an offer just in your head i would not lie during the process if you have any experience even if just in school say yes otherwise say no ducksaxaphone are you sure you got rejected purely because of this question your dream job sounds great it also sounds exceedingly competitive there are lots of physics phd holders with ml experience and many of them want a job like this lots of them would apply and some will have tonnes of experience your competition was likely overwhelming even being short listed for interview on a job like that would be tough unless you got feedback saying you were filtered because of that checkbox i would be cautious about deciding it is the cause could just be there were people with more experience than you and they did not want to interview more than that snowmaninheat rejection sucks there is no way around that that said it is important to never fall in love with a job posting when you read it apply and move on i usually get auto rejected on of my applications yes even the ones that are perfect fits and i have had my resume professionally written it is not you it is the game odd it is possible for what you describe to happen getting ruled out by one checkbox especially in federal government hiring that said overall a much more common thing in job applications in general is that when they throw the kitchen sink into the requirements no single applicannot meets all of them so they set some priorities and look at the best they have an almost universal thing is that you sign at the bottom of the application that everything is true this makes lies on applications grounds for firing if they are discovered so the downside of lying is real and i do not recommend it hr and recruiters do try to avoid unplanned interactions with applicannots because there is a ton of working the refs that goes on that said a well framed email or voicemail could work in your favor quickly highlight that your qualifications are in the ballpark phd in right sub field of physics yay and ask about how key federated learning is to the position networking comes in handy to know who to send an email like this to in a given organization do your phd advisor or any grad school colleagues have working relationships with folks in this lab you do not have the infrastructure multiple servers for federated learning there is no need for specialized infrastructure to get started with federated learning you could simulate it on a single machine by writing server and client classes in your code and modelling the communication between them as method calls just watch out for data leakage this approach could even be productionized with an rpc framework slashdave never lie saying no to a loaded question could maybe disqualify you but lying on your application certainly will why should i hire someone i cannot trust djalaskaandrew you know we have a contract with a company which hired a contractor who claimed they had a data science background and an analytics masters degree disclaimer i never had a chance to interview this person after working with this person for a week i realized that this year long project was going to be a massive waste of time because they did not know how to code do basic joins or write efficient algorithms did not even know what big o was when i asked so what happened i already have my full job so i could not do theirs therefore i let them fail at it miserably so the environment we were working on was an absolute mess they could not explain why they did half the things they did our senior executive grilled them in front of people while they were presenting the quarterly project updates finally their company might get dumped from a large contract so yes you might get the job you may be able to bullshit through it but if you cannot your life is going to be hell up to the point which you get fired and have to start all over again sevensixtyone hello im a ta manager responsible for ds hiring at my company your assumption that the question asked is a knock out question is flawed most job posting systems offer custom questions to be added to a standard job application the hiring manager will determine which ones will disqualify candidates not being legally allowed to work in the country you are applying to would be a an automatic disqualification question but questions around specific experiences are not ubiquitously used to disqualify candidates they are often used as a first pass filter that being said we are currently looking for a psd that has search and ranking experience for us it is mandatory that the experience be in an enterprise environment and at a very large scale therefore answering no will disqualify you but answering yes when you do not actually have the experience we require is a waste of time be truthful hr are not the ones selecting disqualification questions on an application apart from the legal stuff those are coming directly from the hiring manager rockingtits click yes then go and study it before the interview houstonswimmer today is employment market has been made so needlessly complicated that if you know you can do the job you should answer questions in a way that gets you the job learn what you need to on the back end this is not just specific to data science but hr and companies have forgotten that people especially people with advanced degrees and adjacent career experience can learn new things they come up with a list of skills on a job posting often poorly understood buzzwords and if an applicannot does not check every item on that list they throw out the application in times like this do what you need to do to get in the interview room babygrenade if hr has a specific question to filter people out they are probably also looking for it to be explicitly mentioned on your resume blasketbasket you are overthinking this it is immaterial whether or not you clicked yes okay the checkbox because they are going to look at your resume and see that you do not have any federated learning experience even if you did get an interview it is highly unlikely that you would pass it because they are going to screen for that sort of experience federated learning sounds like bs redbeardthis is not your dream job you know this because they filter candidates based on one yes no response you dodged a bullet addawithtea we are hiring for physics ml dm me if you are interested position is based in switzerland germany bobdope there have been many times i said no i do not know that and got hired anyway steer clear of the dark side lunaticake you can google it and learn what is that just in an hour and to be honest federated learning is an easily understandable technique after these you are not lying if you click yes lunaticake you can google it and learn what is that just in an hour and to be honest federated learning is an easily understandable technique after these you are not lying if you click yes iminfornow dude this is not how you get rejected pick up the phone and call whoever is responsible for this terrible mistake on their side hiant fake it until you make it tbh you want candidates that can learn new things quickly but also add value immediately hr does not understand how to see if someone can learn quickly so they just lean into already knowing everything that needs to be done tldr just lie and study like crazy for the interview bang out a personal project if you need to throwawayrandomvowel federated learning is amazing and i am excited to see it out in the wild lmericle you are really certain you will get filtered out based only on the answer of this question how are you so certain interesting this is super shady of them if it is a legit requirement they should have it at the beginning before you have to upload anything sounds like they are not respecting you as a potential candidate so this could be a recruiting firm just gathering cv is or just another hr person who understands nothing about your field and the type of knowledge you actually have and that w your profile it would take you days to learn it and be more useful because of everything else you know vs someone who just did dabbled in that fireinmybones if it is your dream job do not give up find employees on linkd in and add them look up their research and send them a message or email about how much you like their paper do what you need to do to get someone to refer you random incident do not lie people can learn new things but you cannot make a liar honest pdxmom that is what is happening these days i applied to two positions last night and before am the next morning was rejected people are not actually looking at resumes or anything then the companies say we cannot find people it is weird thefirstoldmanriver as we learned from winston in the original ghostbusters when someone asks you if you are a god you say yes shot at my previous job i have seen a number of people who lied about their qualifications the people who interviewed them never bothered to verify their claims and funny thing is the company then had to spend money to train them big corporations often work like that one person does the interviews another hires you and still another is your boss the sad truth is it often pays to lie on your resume doc_ i would say you have experience a few years ago but you honestly have forgotten most of it since you have not used it for a while however you can relearn it fast and easy hydrevv no threshold on experience so even a couple hours of experience is truthful in an interview you can discuss how you familiarized yourself with the topic and even reference a side project you made if you can stand one up before your interview yes to glorkvorn some of this is just a cultural difference doing a science phd you are trained to report your results with crystal clear transparency did you create a sub micrometer laser no the best i did was micrometers did you discover a new comet no only an asteroid did you prove that x y well i found a ton of data to strongly suggest that it is but i ca not say i actually proved it no and those distinctions are important for scientific research but corporate bureaucracy does not work that way it is expected to make strong bold statements and you just have to take everything with a grain of salt we are the greatest company in our field every company says this my perforce this year was exceeds expectations everyone says this every comployee in my group exceeded expectations our product is great and everyone should buy it so when you say lie i think you mean like slightly exaggerating which would be taboo for scientific research but it is the stuff corporations do all the time without even thinking about it but when they hear you say lie they think you meant like a really gigantic lie like claiming you had a phd when you do not different culture cowboyspunk so as long as it is within reason lie during pre screen you never know who the recruiters are and sometimes recruiters who have never even worked in the field ie harvard graduate in hr and human services recruiting for geotechnical firm generate questions guided by the aid of an appropriate staff member to weed out candidates most of the time you never make it to in person because there is rounds of phone online interviewing respectfully and appropriately lying during the pre screen granted you are confident in your ability to learn the requirements you lack will allow you to make it to the in person interviews where you can showcase your skills portfolio or swoon them with whatever desirable attributes you have the weed out questions generated by ignorant and misdirected recruiters is a huge reason why so many people in this day and age do not have a fighting chance i know so many good people who are incredibly hard working intelligent and determined who have an incredibly tough time just getting to a point where they can actually explain who they are to the company think outside of the box when it comes to these applications give the company a call stop in and hand them something physical make a portfolio do everything you can outside of following their hiring protocol honestly you will get the job funny thing is they probably hardly know of the people they hire at these bigger firms they are clueless renokarchnmy i always lie on those kinds of prompts for the same reason you point out saying no auto rejects saying yes just means the onus is on them to determine what level that experience is through conversation as in yes you do have experience with federated learning in so much as you know what it is and googled it maybe did some tutorials or whatever before the interview not to the extent that you did that stuff for an employer and made sweeping profitable changes with it it is kinda like those kids who put java level out of sql level out of level out of all over their resume like their range of values coincides with whatever the employers expectations and range is rockingtits this is the way the question did not ask for professional experience williamrosebud i came to say this as well if it is not something that requires months a new coding language just say yes and go straight to learn it while you wait to be called for the interview which might take a couple of weeks by the time you talk to them you will have some of the learning under your belt and the opportunity to talk to a person about it mrtickle hr does the pre screen and often has no idea what the requirements would even mean i have done interviews where hr say it is data science and you get to the hiring manager and they are hiring for data engineering my policy is lie within reason on any pre screen and have an honest conversation with the hiring manager hiant you are letting someone that knows the least amount of the field weed you out on something that probably do not understand what it is renokarchnmy it would make so much more sense to ask things like how long will it take you to get up to speed with federated learning to provide xyz results could even be a multiple choice type thing also is less subjective when rating the truth to the answer you say days i am an expert in the domain and it better be day you are turning a profit or making big strides towards the org goals if you get the job uchimata generally i agree with wouldo not lie on a job application but i do not think is necessarily true the quality of hr teams varies wildly from company to company the data science team might be amazing but the recruiter they got assigned is not that great and does not structure the screening well i do think that unless an application asks for specific experience levels or a work history if you have got a topic you are familiar with but not expert in it is totally fine to say you have some experience with it after all the worst that happens for anyone involved is that you do the interview and it turns out federated learning or whatever is a must have and you waste minutes of the interviewer is time and yours as an interviewer unless someone misrepresents their skill at something that i list as absolutely essential in the jd i do not really care if they turn out to just be familiar with more ancillary material rhagho that last point is very similar to the mark twain quote if you tell the truth do not have to remember anything crabclaws backfinomy lying on a job application is never a good idea it can be used as grounds for immediate termination if you do get the job read the fine print that you sign at the end of the application breadlygames if it was an immediate rejection rejection email one second after submitting i think op can safely say it was an automated rejection nerdyjorj i would say it is worth the effort to reach out to the hiring manager to find out for sure if this is why op was rejected before making any more assumptions cocodirichlet even though all jobs are competitive you cannot equate a job looking for a phd in physics in a particular subfield which oop also does to a junior ds job there will not be phd in physics applying wouldatastoryteller do people even have office phones anymore i have not had a work phone number in over years milleuros it did ask afterwards for references and for a short list of pros and cons of federated learning the latter is easy enough to provide after having digested a few blog articles the former is much much harder renokarchnmy it did not ask for a quantitative representation of that experience either googling federated learning and reading the wiki article on it is technically experience it is up to them to determine if that is enough with other experience and skillset to do the job not the applicannot renokarchnmy i have a hard time getting interviews but when i do get to talk to a recruiter i always get to the next stage with a technical hiring manager pdxmom that is the thing someone is screening and many times it is a resume screened by filters and no one actually sees the resume and then the companies are saying they cannot find people it is crazy wallymetropolis so were you to get that job imagine who the coworkers would be imagine what the leadership is like that allows such a thing to happen this kind of thing has been a really useful filter for me to avoid shitty jobs tarehman companies where hr drives the hiring instead of the hiring manager where the tail wags the dog usually have larger cultural issues those issues ultimately tend to preclude serious progress do not get me wrong i worked on an incredible team once embedded in an utterly stupid company but because of our embedding in an utterly stupid company we spend endless hours and time fighting the organization to make progress that does not fit my definition of a dream job at least tarehman i think i was paraphrasing that without realizing it ducksaxaphone i was an astrophysicist for years i know what op was up against believe me you can easily find yourself filtered out of a role by more experienced or more appropriate candidates mostexitthey usually do not require a phd in a specific topic it could be in physics applied math or any related topic so yeah you can easily find yourself competing with phds iminfornow some companies make that difficult you either call the reception or sales and from there request to speak with hr if they protest say it is urgent hr people love talking to applicannots for both my current and previous function i do not meet the degree requirement initial image what do they mean by references someone they can call to ask if in your previous job you worked on federated learning your academic publications in the domain it seems that is a box you can leave empty if they then reject you because of this maybe they really do need an expert with applied work experience in federated learning in which case the job actually is notright for you but probably not and you will be able to show your relevant skillset in the interview nraw i guess there is a difference if something is just a checkbox or if they are actively trying to get more information about it if i would still deem it a small part of the whole package i would learn whatever it is that they ask for and try to apply it in my references i would write on how i failed at that and mention my limited experience more than that it is lying that would not benefit you nor the interviewer cocodirichlet put your advisor etc for references this is the most weird application form sounds like a start up if you really want this job contact the recruiter or other people there hiant just have friends mentioned they do not know specifically all the things you know but know you are good and will learn quickly references are just a sanity check only an insane person gives a reference that would say something bad and you do not want an insane person clearly convoluted this is unethicalbut i would have a ds friend or even a non ds friend be your co worker or manager the manager would be easier because management does not really need to grasp the finer details or even be an expert they just have to manage people manager friend i asked milleuros to join my team for a research project i was leading i asked for his help because of his knowledge in federated learning get a simple story about a research topic that you guys worked on but the paper is still in the writing process this will sound very cynical but i have learned in so many ways life is not fair cliche i know and people will use shady ways to get to the top it is who you know without doing the work truth is you have done and are doing the work bending the rules a bit seems like a minuscule evil in the grand scheme of things if you had to lie throughout the entire process my answer would be very different get a friend get a story and bend the truth lol slothvibes i will be a reference if you want dm me nraw that is an oddly specific boast if it changes your view a bit in our process you might get through a step even though the person that interviews you would deem you not capable because in the end there is a decision call with everyone involved so the fact that you continue does not necessarily mean you are good just that you are not so bad that someone would directly ask for the time to not be wasted anymore therealtiddlydump ding ding ding uchimata i agree that hiring managers should be driving things but it is very hard to get around the existence of ta teams and their screening function i like to think my team is a pretty positive place to work but i have had to take ownership to the degree of doing screening myself because my ta folks were idiots not everyone can do that even in otherwise good orgs but your point is well taken ratatouilleartist i would ask another data scientist to be reference and you can do the toy project together and it can be professional development together renokarchnmy that is what i meant hr does the pre screen and often has no idea what the requirements would even mean basically just saying i am terrible at getting interviews and my experience and resume suck but if i get to talk to a non technical recruiter i can easily get past them to the next person who promptly rejects me not so much that i am good just that hr is very easy to game wallymetropolis do you also go around commenting this is the way pdxmom either the hiring manager put the question out there or they did not think about both ways and then whether you would actually want that job therealtiddlydump depends if it is indeed the way wallymetropolis cannot argue with that",
  "aggravatingpudding bro go touch some grass there is no single generally accepted definition of data science it is a marketing term which has been over used to the point of dilution people have been building predictive models commercially for decades with the recent last years or so surge in interest in data science companies have been hiring and would be practitioners have flooded the field with the obvious effect on quality there are data scientists who build models and know this field at the algorithm level there are also data scientists who have recently learned a scripting language and build models by calling other people is analytical code it is my observation that these two groups have enjoyed very different experiences in the labor market especially recently if you are serious about doing this work i suggest knowing the fundamentals and ignoring whichever language algorithm or tool is trendy this month i also suggest ignoring people doing slinging lingo stacks and those doing unrelated work dashboards for instance inevitable frame i have also been through years studying for something new in my case a web dev job so i relate a lot to your story in spite of some differences i guess there is one thing i would like to share beware the blogosphere i have never been much into social media before reddit i guess but when studying development during the pandemic i got very much into technical blogs and all things related to technology and the technology market matters of information aside can really all the trends become reality consuming too much media is anxiety inducing and that seems to compound with other sources of anxiety figure out what is it you need to spend a day doing nothing and not feel anxious about it besides that i have learned a lot with them blogs that still seems valid a year later doing projects end to end is good network learn in public etc just beware the extrovert bias in all communication if using web technologies with graphql for dataviz seems like a fun side project dm me i have been meaning to do that for a while and can also use both the socializing and collaboration gaelisk find real world problems and create projects on them avoid kaggle you will want to learn how to gather your own data and store it set up a simple mysql server or microsoft sql server to hold the data and you can play around with querying it either through a workbench or through pandas i slapped in a tb harddrive into my pc for doing my own side projects for example at this stage just get comfortable working with the tools and coming up with projects i cannot speak for others but where i work if i can find a problem and come up with a solution they will adopt it bonus points if they can productise it read up on what others are doing in the field as well try and replicate what they are doing or have done you will learn loads there i do this alongside a colleague and he is using what he learned for an article we read a few monthes ago in his phd go nuts try different things learn to think like a data scientist i have boiled it down to being a problem solver personally haha well maybe going out might clear my head thanks in ur perspective what fundamentals do you suggest the thought that someone else has experienced something similar and is able to give advice honestly it makes me feel much better thanks i have no experience in using graphql so i will see what is it is about thank you i will start with setting up a mysql server i installed the workbench once and deleted it mainly cz i was not using it i mainly used a software known as popsql to practice some sql commands djrickert why do you stress out with learning everything about ds on your own before starting your ds masters seriously relax a bit this is mainly applied mathematics as a start i suggest learning the followingr r statisticsr probability distributions basic manipulationsr statistical summaries univariate and bivariater hypothesis testing confidence intervalsr linear regressionr r linear algebrar basic understanding of arranging data in vectors and matricesr operators matrix multiplication r r calculusr limitsr basic differentiation and integration at least of polynomialsr r information theory discreter entropy joint entropy conditional entropy mutual information character that is great advice practical sql ed is a good book it uses postgre sql but he calls out when it will deviate from ansi sql so you know when to find an equivalent function for sql server or mysql when i started using sql server at work i was beyond prepared gat nothing better to do lol i see thanks i did some of these in my bachelor isbut i believe i will have to revisit and understand the concepts in much detailonce again thank you i have gone through the theory of these things but when it comes to the application of these i am not able to find any proper application for thismostly all the things are done by machine learning algorithms so i kind of feel that the eda that i did was worthless can you help me with this maybe suggest some project wouldatastoryteller try out some hobbies spend time with friends am no expert but when it comes to application i would say it all revolves around the type of data you have intelligentputi generally use kaggle data but after finishing my current coursera course i will be using either data sets available online or data scraping but nowhere are we using statistics right mostly i clean the data remove the outliers do scaling for some models and then put it into a few classification or regression models so here i am not using maths anywhere right quantpsychguy you are doing stats in the modeling part you might not have any clue how the classification system works but they are doing stats behind the scenes the stats relies heavily on matrix math so they are doing math as well when you remove outliers there are statistical methods for deciding how to define what is and is not an outlier scaling is applying a statistical concept such as what scaling technique to use it sounds like you take a dataset run it through a basic set kf python code that does it for you and have a result if that is what you are doing you may have some trouble in the job market",

  "consciousstop r askeconomics is utter garbage i do not know why people still post there auto mod and responses since op asked the question ago yet not a single response have been approved by the mods subjectadhow is your econometrics and r or stata knowledge if you have good background and experience in these i do not think the leap to becoming a data scientist is that big especially if you have cs math stats as an added major i know some econ programs like mit is becomes insanely mathematical once you move beyond intro level courses which is why it is probably considered stem at some schools now your domain knowledge about economic concepts like pricing elasticity or focus on causality via econometrics might come in handy as well depending on the business and team some advice focus on econometrics if you cannot take cs or stats courses learn a programming language preferably python or r i know a lot of econ programs use stata but it is pretty useless in industry and it is a shitty language you have to pay for try to take a ml course if you can so you get exposed to things like random forest i do not think most econometrics courses will have those topics play to your econ strengths in the job market it makes you stand out from the cs majors there is a lot of work done on creating pricing models and causal inference as an example here is such a role at petco if you read the job description it fits an economics trained data scientist very well good luck drakkur advice from a fellow econ background masters in econ it is easier to get into ds through analytics but not the only way take a mathematical statistics and advanced probability classes if you can otherwise consume every econometrics class possible teach yourself r and python now my program was sas and stata luckily i found my first big job programming pricing models in sas cs classes will not help much and any basic classes that fulfill a minor can be taken on mit is open courseware your bread and butter as an econ focused ds is pricing forecasting time series and causal inference but do not limit yourself to those economics provides a great generalist education on how to think about interconnected systems markets and identify solve problems that arise in those systems have a good understanding of macro economic drivers for the world around you and eventually you will learn how to apply that to any given business to help drive value i built a niche for myself in fp and a teams by leveling up their sophistication from excel to advanced forecasting and pricing models to help drive decision making endogeny as someone who graduated with a degree in econ you need to make sure at the very least you take technical courses stats math cs and learn to program preferably in r or python it sounds like you may have this covered since your program may be more math stats heavy than some econ programs and you mentioned r a double major would certainly help you stand out but obviously the workload would be intense when you say you have been on the job hunt i assume you mean internships internships are obviously super competitive but if you can get anything even part time unpaid during the year yes i know it is absurd to be unpaid it will help you land a better internship in the future consciousstop you bammycat you have a few good responses here statsnpolisci econ major take all the econometrics courses possible take applied courses that require a research component that includes data analysis the more data projects you work on the better cs courses at least to get a foundation in programming a machine learning course is desirable a major if you want to program more than analyze in your future job or if you want the job opportunities it provides i am pretty sure that lots of cs courses will set you up to be a data engineer more than an analyst data science or stats minor recruiters may not look at the minor but they will look at your real world data experience either of these minors should provide you with real world data experience which is may be the most critical skill employers want data science program quality varies drastically from university to university find a data science prof and ask them whether they would recommend a stats or data science minor for your career interests stats profs may not have the same insight as a data science prof math major mostly useful if you want to pursue higher education in stats data science or economics it looks impressive but may not be a very efficient path forward you would need to feel comfortable with spending a lot of your life on proofs but take linear algebra understand matrix manipulation and multivariable calc understand multivariate equations which is what statistical modeling equations are if at all possible they may seem abstract to you now but will give you insight into how your statistical models work later research apply to the fed find professors who are working on data projects and ask if they could hire you to help with their projects do your own data projects and post them on your website github none this is why i reposted someone is post here none

  "datademystifier you will have a very hard time i fear good luck though bikeskata probably not the field has become increasingly professionalized remember even from india you are competing w iitians

require at least a four year degree if a degree is out of the question try building a really good kaggle portfolio over the next couple of years moving to the us with just a bachelors degree from india means you will be in line for a green card for to years from the moment you land in the us to the moment you get your green card if immigration is not seriously reformed with a masters it might take a couple of years less with a phd you might be able to do it in or it took me about and i did not enjoy a single one of them i would not even think about it nancyapple it is impossible as an indian national without an advanced degree to find a job in data area in current us market just give up and try in europei know nothing about europe but i know the chance is in us unless you have special advantage we do not know like bill gates is your uncle anarkittensurprise i have hired us and indian data scientists for a us company while a lot of people are right in that there is a lot of competition out there i still find that it is difficult to search through the applicannots and find someone who is going to be a good contributer if you are naturally curious and can communicate well then you have definitely got a chance my recommendation is to find a us company hiring in india and build us relationships with coworkers over a few years to work towards a transfer this is still a hard path but i have seen several friends do this successfully soft skills are critical things we have struggled the most with in new candidates being comfortable speaking up in group settings especially with questions when something is not clear or different opinions is important and hard to find being proactive not just in solving problems we know about today but in finding new ones or ways to avoid future ones building skills on the art side of data science access to all the data in the world is useless if it is not reliable or takes weeks to get into a format that helps to make a decision that needs to be made tomorrow ability to quickly learn and build expertise about a business or products many data professionals seem to like to insulate themselves from the day to day of the businesses they support and this seriously limits their value build leadership and management skills early this will get you access to a larger network and more mobility opportunities traditional degrees are still preferred by recruiters but not required once candidates get past the initial referral we do not care about formal education at all when making the final decision you will have a lot of competition but my last observation is that many people in want the same thing that you do but few take the time and effort to work on both the science side and seriously focus the social soft skills piece of it relationships are the most important factor in landing your dream job in any field you want people to value your opinion and to believe that you can step into a new problem and quickly contribute if you can build that kind of a reputation you will be surprised at how many people will contact you with new opportunities most job posts in eu i have seen for data science roles demand msc with some even writing phd preferred not to say it is not possible but it is highly unlikely that you will make it with just a bootcamp just to make it more conrete how do you plan on competing with someone who graduated from berlin university with an msc in statistics informatik physics what advantage do you offer the employer a better question would be to ask why do you want to do data science if moving to eu is your goal there might be easier routes to break into dev unless your gonna try to go the the uk or ireland you will probably have to learn the local language before you can get a job here in germany it is very difficult to find something unless you have a language proficiency certificate which takes months to get picapaodiablo there are countless bootcamp folks you will be competing with i realize i am going to probably get downvoted heavily but after having interviewed countless people for ds positions a bootcamp is usually a negative at this point learn something it does not matter what really learn something regression kmeans interacting with databases r markdown whatever and get really good at it like go as far as you can go with it then branch out into other things if i were in your shoes honestly i would focus on learning sql and etl as there is way more jobs for data engineering than people to do them use that to work your way into a ds

generally different or generally the same if they are generally different why this is only going to be known by someone who investigated the data good luck unseemlyturbidity what is the goal here are you aiming to be able to rank players and teams against each other if so you should research elo are kdas going to be distorted my leagues so that someone at the top of a league would have

distributed for each player are they wouldgrsmith can you share histograms woulddanieltan classic question you will need to address is how do i compare what looks to be count based metrics kda between a player with many games vs a player with few games do you swap over to comparing a proportion instead of a count well you are still going to see skew do you only consider kdas past a certain limit how do you choose that limit are you potentially excluding the data points you might find interesting do you want to use mean median depends on your distribution as elaborated below by you dfphd the

what type of aggregation you need whether you use median vs mean generally is going to depend on whether they are different to begin with and why they are different with many confounding factors this is so hero position matters this is also a mixed elo amateur league players resources are distributed by an ordinal position ideally but player skill is a big determining factor though all players should have similar strength of schedule if you have long tailed distributions or distributions that are non negative and very close to the the mean may be not be representative of what you are trying to capture but if the mean and median are essentially the same then it does not matter yea i am getting a distribution in many features where the mode is in the minimum values as most players are in the ordinals resource position and most low skill players are also relegated to lower values here i have defaulted to using average for now but only of the games have been played thank you for the good luck i have plotted the distributions by both aggregates and they seem similar enough so far i will wait for more data and see what outliers are created for each grouping method not hard programmatically to report on both players generally already have an elo rank mmr but i do just in general want to descriptively state x player performed the best in kda over the season with a valid approach to aggregating same with team the teams rankings will be easy to see at end because they will have a record of w l i assume most of my features will be multicolinear to win or loss here are some features in histograms classic question you will need to address is how do i compare what looks to be count based metrics kda between a player with many games vs a player with few games every player will have the same amount of games due to a round robin season where every team plays every other team in the instance of player substitution a player of same rank so the subs data can be used over normal player do you swap over to comparing a proportion instead of a count well you are still going to see skew do you only consider kdas past a certain limit how do you choose that limit are

looking for is dependent on the purpose of your analysis consider formulating a detailed sentence describing what you wish to look for compare and it will be clearer what type of aggregation you need i want to be able to say x player team had the best overall season in y metric i know different metrics may need to be used for different features for now i will stick with mean until end of season and re evaluate the distributions wouldgrsmith ordinal and ranked data is tricky here is a summary paper giving suggestions what is your goal it may help to see which helps you identify the goal wouldgrsmith goldpermin and xppermin are the only normally distributed distributions where an average and median are interpretable on their own denies may have something interesting going on as it appears possibly bimodal so can be described with two modes right now most of the distributions are quite positively skewed so an average value is not going to be super meaningful so those could simply get a median you could do weighted mean trimmed mean or winsorized mean but it depends or your needs edit added adjusted means wouldgrsmith the bimodal distribution may even out but my assumption is the other ones will remain positively skewed i just want a sound way to say x player team had the best y metric for example i will want to highlight the player who had the highest gpm over the season currently that feature has a major positive skew as has ordinal positions for resource distribution players in this league almost sit at the passive gpm minimum while some exceptional are able to achieve that another feature however is xpm which has a normal distribution though i would expect position players to nearly all sit at the highest here as well this is before aggregating at all btw aggregated data creates a much smaller set this may change as well as there are about of games remaining before final analysis can be done wouldgrsmith the bimodal distribution may even out but my assumption is the other ones will remain positively skewed",

scientists right it is such a myopic view i have to assume they do not actually know how any of this works throwra i am so tired of these questions savethepandabears because picking the best model based on the quality of future predictions is usually less than of the job in my opinion if you want to future proof yourself start focusing on causality and prescriptive analytics good luck trying to get ai understand whatever my clients want cause half the time they do not even know themselves what they need trbigstick mods please start deleting these threads it is getting obnoxious barkwash chatgpt cannot even do advanced math and you think ai is replacing us i think they found it has up to a grade level of math understanding therealtiddlydump for fuck is sake stop_ autisticmice i think you are assuming most of the data science problems out there can be solved by throwing a bunch of different algorithms and choosing the best performing one this in turns assumes there is enough data it is clean and reliable and people know where it is how to access it and what each file column means in reality almost none of this is true or are only true to a degree and you will find yourself putting all of the data pieces together and adding a lot of prior information into the modelling in the form of common sense decisions of domain knowledge embedded into the models i do not think we will see ai that can do all of that in our lifetimes or at least not in our working age years dude what line of work exactly is responsible for building and maintaining these ais yeah hermitcrab for decades programmers have been told they are going to be replaced by software there are now more software developers than ever and they are paid better than ever i would not sweat it insighteous models are just tools to solve a problem the hardcore theory is what helps you to decide and communicate which tools to use that never goes away miketythhon did google search wipe out any careers i mean it gives people all human knowledge right at their fingertips seems like any knowledge based careers should be dunzo otherwiseratiolmao it is coming i think we have already gone from building out the models ourselves to using libraries the next step which is already here is click and drag there are going to be plenty of people on here that will say but data cleaning if we can automate an aspect of data cleaning there will be someone making a generalized tool to do just that here is another thought why pay a data scientist a year to build a model when you can have an analyst use azure databricks dataflow automl to build the same model at a fraction of the cost perhaps the model is only as good but maybe that is worth cutting the cost of a data scientist what will happen is that data scientist will be reduced to using these tools which is a good thing but the programming skills required is not as high this will cause the field to be over saturated which it already is and bring down the salaries of data scientist georgecodes_ we are not moved by such myths and we must become data scientists sygnon if you are bad enough at data science to think ai is coming for you you probably should change careers if you play your cards right you are on the ground floor with relevant knowledge to hop on the ai train and ride it up anyone who gets salty about the purity of data science and doing things manually will likely get automated away by better algorithms over time i would wait to see ai perform data data preprocessing cleaning properly and negotiate decisions and trade offs with stakeholders before making any rash career decision i agree it is not just dealing with outliers and missing values feature engineering based on business knowledge can be very powerful also i have yet to meet a client who wants to talk to the computer on star trek yup i agree it has to stop maybe the real problem is folks not understanding or sure maybe they do not care to learn how to search on reddit otherwiseratioto be fair before calcuators existed companies did hire human calculators which largely did the same thing and those people did lose their jobs presumably they found new ones though autumnotter pretty sure they are all students trolls or managers trying to find justification for firing people lol leonardodicathode what is the other you would think that data cleaning organizing feature selection etc can be automated with ai what of the job is personalized and cannot be automated leonardodicathode at some point the time will come where the prophecy becomes reality it is a matter of when how close are we in this current state of ai leonardodicathode playing devil is advocate but is not theory what ai is already supreme at textbooks research etc based theory taguscove understanding the business goals and the drivers of profitability creating metrics that approximate the business goals collecting data that can move these metrics selling leadership for the analytic staffing to apply the data to move the metrics training and motivating a team to have that capability predictive modeling with the appropriate software engineering to do so repeatedly communicating results such that your team gets credit and additional resource in the future so long as the ceo and executive team is run by humans the vast majority of that can not be automated to a meaningful degree when you have ai as the ceo of google or microsoft then i would be seriously concerned so the real question is how long until ai automates the ceo job savethepandabears dataset creation data qa experiment design and analysis feature engineering this can be automated to an extent but oftentimes the most important features are bespoke and incorporate domain knowledge metric selection causal discovery to an extent this is a great area where domain knowledge can be incorporated are all areas that will likely require a dsitl for the foreseeable future even some of the things you mentioned probably cannot be fully automated by ai detailed data cleaning probably cannot be fully automated since it depends on contextual information about fields model selection can be dependent on constraints aside from simply which model predicts best tarehman not every prophecy becomes reality see squaring the circle statsnpolisci yup and there is a massive open ended question about what it means to predict best",
  "sentiment analysis and topic modelling are typically nlp type analysis for text data are you trying to look for alternatives to analyse text data if not what kind of qualitative and unstructured data are you referring to heartofcinders you could ask chatgpt for its opinion on text input not even kidding pandasiloc what kind of questions do you want to answer about your semantic data depending on what your response is you could use n grams document word embedding tf idf etc character make a good ole fashion graph undefinedthing yes since sentiment analysis and topic modelling is typical in analyzing qualitative data the data is from survey responses scraped fb and twitter data i tried reading some journals but all i could search is sentimenr analysis with different approaches thanks",
  "mattlovesmath mentorship collaboration and contributing valuable work are three cornerstones of a successful career you do not have any of these right now do not underestimate the risk to your job security too leadership does not value your work and it sounds like your contributions are not large enough to motivate expanding your team proofrequired but i would feel bad about just completely ditching the company that should not be the reason to stick around i know it does not sound very diplomatic but that is how it goes employers do not think much when laying off people so i think it would be very bad if i just quit one day even with a two week notice again not your fault employers need to account for such things yeah you can try asking for raise if you want to stay but it does not seem that is something you are looking for you have kind of already made up your mind and i also would advise to move somewhere else with more support and guidance ds world is plagued with such issues so i cannot say you will find what you are looking for but still maybe you get lucky only thing you can do is to vet whatever new place you would like to move and see how much infra people they already have dedicated to data team brandco think hard about what you would need to change to change your outlook hiring another team member data quality person for the cfo if you honestly think that the changes are going to improve your attitude towards your company and your job make a business case and present it to your boss this is an opportunity to get a promotion a raise etc if there is nothing that can improve your attitude leave you do not need to feel bad because you need a job that is engaging and they need an employee who is engaged i suspect that you are past the point of trying to change things there for the better however because you listed several issues that are not possible to change pretty common everywhere actually and that is a sign that you have already decided to move on eliminatingcoasts start looking for an alternative job then lay out all these issues to your boss see if they have any idea of how to fix them criticise the solutions honestly then if they do not want to fix them then they ca not guilt you by saying they need you because they chose not to do the things they needed to do to keep you and in addition you are giving them information about what they need to do to keep the person who comes after you so for example the auditing you want someone else who enjoys that kind of detail oriented fiddling stuff with the time saved for that you want to do more professional development and find ways to expand your skills those two things come together as a proposal reduce drudgery and increase professional development secondly you mention that a lot of your work is bringing together different data sources designed without your intervention that is something that can be reduced by giving you more authority about how data is reported within the company if people already tell you what they are measuring and are expected to then you can save a bit of time on the back end trying to get them to fit together that one is risky because you might not actually want them to give you that kind of management role anyway would rather be less senior but paid better in another role the final problem of overall direction listening to you and trying to get you back on board with it is not something that gets solved as a problem of direction but more that comes from just having an informal conversation about the way things are going general dissatisfaction etc but in a way that opens the possibility of them convincing you it is still worth it when you come out with other criticisms people in leadership will often default to this because just talking to you about the mission or whatever is easier than hiring people and so they will hope that you have a general problem that can be talked out if you already bring up the other two problems two or three times but if you can listen to them talk about it honestly and still emphasise that the other two are distinct problems and reject when we eventually make money type arguments you can end up articulating all three problems distinctly and together then after all that you will have a very clear thing to say to the next company about why you left the previous one v0archnemesis ceo wanting yes men yeah get the fuck right out of there and do not feel bad thewallie sure leave i did not even have to read the post title says all i needed to know quantpsychguy tldr this feels like a simple mismatch between what they want and what you want i would just look elsewhere they managed to function before you showed up and they will be fine after you leave if you are highly concerned give them weeks instead of but i do not think you have to do that if you do not particularly want to this might be a somewhat unpopular opinion but i think this is just a difference between what you want to do and what the company wants it seems pretty clear that they want a one man analytics function that may or may not be reasonable but finance wanting you to help with reporting does not seem odd to me at all and leadership wanting you to generate insights from datawell that is kinda the job of an analytics group that is supposed to be insight driven i think you want to be a wouldata scientist and you think that is different than an analytics function that is just a purely subjective distinction on a practical level unless you are talking big tech then it is legitimately very different im not saying this is right but i am saying that this is the difference between what you want and where you are i would be thrilled to be in an environment like that because i could help build it out i am reading between the lines i do not think that the ceo only wants insights that he agrees with he wants insights that further his understanding of the business if you go against expert belief you need to have a lot of good damn proof in my experience most technical folks non business folks do not understand what that threshold looks like and they feel like folks do not listen to data when the issue is often that they are not presenting good enough data via good communication lanky if you like your colleagues then start making a to do guide for when someone else comes and help with onboarding of course when you are on the job and paid for it job hunting takes a while never submit a weeks notice before being accepted at a job offer be sure to add preparing of procedures to aid in reporting whateveveryouuse among a company of teams on your resume when you do this it actually takes longer than you would think also i am so surprised to hear that people is considered a small company i work for a person one and we are no longer consider a start up or even a small one at this point it was people when it was a startup and yes definitely leave your job if you feel demotivated and are not learning anything from it there are times to settle into a cozy and boring job but early career is not one of them you need to take advantage of your to learn new things since it becomes much harder later on improving becomes easier since you have got a better routine and know what works for you but learning from scratch ugh personally i always suggest early trying out vastly new different things and jobsmid trying out specialised jobs and preparinga nice emergency fundearly settling into a specialised career and prioritizing long term savings and eh whatever does not stresss you out and keeps you saving is fiiiine bikeskata op i have been there and my advice line something up and then leave do not feel bad the role sounds like a good first job but you have hit the limit of what you can learn from it having more experienced coworkers who can teach you is invaluable as is the ability to specialize on a bigger team a lot of people ask why of data science projects or departments fail from what the op said the causes are no buy in from the c suite lack of data infrastructure business has low data maturity ie descriptive phase focusing on what happened via dashboards powerpoints one data scientist ca not change the business if it is at the wrong time along it is data maturity cycle i would suggest looking for a role in a business that is either in the predictive or prescriptive phase of its data maturity i am in the same boat just reading this makes me think of my day job i am on my own with very little buy in from the higher ups i have very little motivation and almost no direction i made a post a few weeks ago about how to move models into production with ml ops because we have no structure or organization around data it is all ad hoc manual or excel workbooks and access dbs because that is how it is always been done im finishing a my first production ready models this week and maybe that will start to change when i show what i am capable of but who knows wouldaredick you are describing exactly my experience a couple of years ago in a series b startup i was the first hired data scientist there is no data pipeline or data platform product teams dump their own data into with no regard for any data quality or integrity measures no and lots of data silos the dashboards are direct queries with a lot of joins and inconsistencies the cto does not understand the role of data science and neither does the ceo i was doing data analysis data quality and data engineering work i was shocked but the only reason i joined was that the founders who were sort of friends assured me that they want to transform into a data driven company that applies machine learning and experimentation to improve user experience months and no progress in my job the ceo does not want to hear what the data says if it contracts his assumptions he does not even want to hear what we need to build to be a data driven company i could not walk away because i thought my friends needed me for their data work guess what a year passed by and nothing happened the company tanked its target so the ceo had to start laying off people and they started with me since i was the orphan in the room here is my advice if the company does not contribute to your career leaves to find a better place unless you are happy where you are then it is fine do not attach personal reasons to your decision since your relationship with your colleagues should be only professional slothvibes you should build a data team road map bro with the c suite give you more motivation and maybe even iron out a few concerns about expectations and timelines you sound like you are killing it and this is a wonderful opportunity starting here is big because you will get full control of all results being on you when you job hop if you are bag chasing significannotairdid not bother to read the post if you are irreplaceable to the company make them pay you more because it will me a much tougher job to train a brand new person to replace you so get that salary boost asap pristine test leave i once got an offer from a similar type of startup where i will be the only person to do analysis and stuff they gave me around raise also but my friend warned me that if there is no one to guide you then learning will be limited and you will be able to implement only what you know or what you will explore yourself so i choose to not go and still looking for another company here you have learnt a lot so now look for other options best of luck do not feel bad they will manage and you are too young to settle for a job lots of things to learn and experience to have go theghostdetective most all of these concerns have me just saying leave ceo looking for a yes man having no direction past insights and feeling stagnant yeah only one i will say is that second to last point about doing all this stuff because only you seem capable and answering questions about numbers from stuff you did not buildi will be honest that has happened at every job i have been at haha it should not be all you are doing but that has come up for me at both startups and big corporations issiriana wow you have just described my job and my thoughts i am planning to leave right after finishing my master is in half a year however in my country we have months notice so i guess they should have enough time to process me leaving thesameg this post is so familiar to my last job i could have written it myself you have gotten a lot of good advice here as strongly as possible i urge you to move on it is not healthy and does not benefit your career to stick it out and suffer because your employer otherwise is not sufficiently supporting your coworkers i waited too long and ended up having to suddenly quit without another job liked up due to burnout took me months to recover my basic cognitive function start applying to new jobs you absolutely deserve to work where you are supported and will have mentorship sanscliche find the other job you think you might like first then quit do not feel bad about it pay no attention to people breaking down real life in mechanical steps maleficentgoldi can tell you this from experience loyalty gets you nowhere if you are not happy look elsewhere on the same token though apply apply apply before you just up and quit work on your skills by freelancing taking some online courses blogging about topics you are passionate about in data science build up a network in the data science community and jobs will start to appear before you leave have something lined up ideally my number one piece of advice do not feel bad about leaving they do not care about you as a person i promise best of luck my friend braveforevertldr but leave poooolooo sometimes it is good to be a big fish in a small pond i personally like it as i get to decide what projects i work on i like being a try hard yes man and all the advantages that come with it get promoted to the top be important make i was consulting for a smaller internet retailer that wanted to me to provide insights they wanted me to calculate out their customer ltv but could not wrap their minds around the fact that their average orders per customer were heavily heavily skewed towards and done so instead of focusing on how they could get consumers to buy more things in one order transaction they told me i must have been calculating ltv wrong lmao unfortunately you ca not change a shit data culture peacefullyfighting fuck em you probably feel this way because your the only one and now have the work of several people on your plate either get a new job offer and use it to ask for a raise to re motivate you or just leave up to you sound like normal work to me you will be lucky to find the perfect job does not hurt to create side projects to help you grow where your job will not but you should not stay loyal to a company so start looking if you feel it is right wallymetropolis i promise you the company is not going to fold if you leave several months after you leave they will not even really notice that you are gone i have worked at places where the ceo changed if ceos can quit you can too bokchoysockcoy your post could have been written by me months ago felt exactly the same got lowballed at my annual review and it motivated me to go all in on the job search found a great job and am so much happier but do not quit it is a lot easier to get a job with a job mentally prepare for more months job search interview prep can be a grind but so worth it good luck noobgolang how about they ditch you first tho look at those guys with all star profle in open source and software respected by everyone got laid off after yrs in google why would you feel bad for a company it will ditch you any day dalmutidangus work a job until you can get a better job and then go work that job until you retire you do not owe those nerds shit carrtmannnn not a great job market but good luck cscanalytics mid is and only data scientist at the company was all i need to read i suggest you quit and find an established company with experienced people to learn under that or demand a subsidized master is phd in lieu of the company denying you a single mentor senior in your role i rose from intern to cto over a few decades due mainly to mentorship forget data science a young is professional needs someone to show them the ropes of how to run a meeting how to communicate with executives how to make small talk at a business conference etc etc etc every day that you do not have an experienced professional to absorb technical non technical skills from is another day you will fall behind other data scientists your age karmaissues a the company would not hesitate to replace you with a cheaper person if they could b get another offer and bend your current company over the barrel with pay make them pay you twice as much and if they do not leave at the end of the day getting paid more means you can make your life outside your work better whether that is holidays savings etc edit i wanna add a comment to this cos i feel like it could be misconstrued at the end of the day op you have to consider what you really care about what other options are out there what kind of reaction will this move get can your current company damage your future job search etc this is just an option but seriously tho you seem like you know what you want to do but do not want to go through with it in which case no amount of advice would help and you should either do it or accept that you will be unhappy at work deatholder are you hiring i could join your team learn a few things show them it is not your problem make the turnover smooth krasnomo i have felt this way before i waited it out longer than you have which i am not sure if that was good or bad you can probably make more money elsewhere put out some applications and see what opportunities are out there only switch for a significannot pay increase and a role you know will be interesting and fun to you longjumpingeggi am in a very similar position i am the only data person with around people at our company when i got here we were not archiving any data now we have a basic system with basic data but without more data it is tricky to find real business insights on the plus side my back end data work has really improved and i feel i could land on my feet at another company eddyofyork get out of there you toughed it out like a team player and developed yourself they gave you the opportunity but you put in all the effort i would not tell them anything other than hey i am swamped i think we need another person maybe somebody senior enough to mentor me if they hired that person i would consider staying big congrats dude people come on this sub all the time and want jobs but cannot hack it you hacked it despite all this you really love data you belong with us but it is time to look outside your current company while you may be getting shortchanged wrt datascience it is very good learning for knowing the ins and outs of a company since you have access to a lots of aspects of the company if you r facing difficulty in explaining stuff to ur higherups you will have to explain the same to very ignorant people later on in ur career who basically have a one track mind this exp will help you then for sure redditrabbitrobot find a new one first after finding the one you actually want you will be so hyped up that leaving the current one will be an urge rather than a pain leave now for one of the companies i worked for i was the only engineer i asked for a junior engineer or whatever to work with they said no they had money but they just did not want to invest they had marketing people all aspects are important but if a company invests only on one aspect then it is problematic leave document all your processes that will help with the guilt maybe even right a rec for your position to help them hire someone new but they will not start that process until you are gone leastuselessredditor then leave how many people were laid off this month because employers saw someone else cutting no seriously for no other reason besides everyone is doing it do not feel bad biojake do not feel bad about leaving the company it seems like you know what is best for you that is all you should care about everything you mentioned but lack of mentorship is common in many ds roles modafaca it takes time but you will learn that if you are already thinking that much about leaving it is better for you and for the company not that you should care that much about any company at all because remember they wo not have to think twice to let go of someone to just leave already you should never limit your progress thinking about the company or your peers i know it might sound selfish or something like that but it really is not just business nothing personal and i am not saying that you should not care especially about people just to have that in mind always elus if it would benefit the company they would dump you in a heartbeat here is a question if you are so important would they offer you equity in the firm not options but actual stock steaknsteak do not feel bad just because institutional knowledge would leave with you if leadership cared about preserving that knowledge they would have hired a team around you to create redundancy if you are so crucial to their operations that leaving would be disastrous in theory they should offer you the moon to stay when you come to them with another offer in hand otherwise they will pay someone else to figure it out it is the company is problem not yours okay leadership if they were to have to fire you they would feel bad maybe but it is a decision that is made based on numbers not emotions the same applies to you now you can feel bad that is okay but if it is the right decision for you you should take it regardless of what the future of the company will be said future is also not your responsibility it is management is responsibility find another job and leave been there several times you have paid your dues long enough to try again somewhere else and cross your fingers actual ds work with a like minded team with strong technical skills is harder to find than you would think hang in there you are def not the only one notparticularlyanony i was in a similar situation and now am starting at a job with lots of great developers as part of a team cannot hurt to look i gave weeks notice so they have plenty of time to look for a replacement i would say start applying for open positions in your area that appear more in line with what you want to do and if you get accepted make the switch dunno how much you have saved up and how long your personal runway is but generally it is better not to burn your bridges before you have crossed as they say from personal experience i would say that i have grown professionally a lot faster since i moved from a smaller company where i was pretty much the only data scientist to one where we have a strong team of them wow i could have written this post myself i am also at my first job out of graduate school at a small fintech startup the first year was nice even though i had a small team consisting of my manager who is technical and another colleague my age just out of school as well now that we are into my second year the pressures and workload have increased substantially we have numerous projects that are all nearing release into production and we are barely managing my colleague that started with me just left the company for a increase in pay we were massively underpaid and i still am and i am now the only hands on data scientist as my manager does not code or take part in the actual implementation i am currently managing five projects all at the same time and for all of them i am the only person in the whole company who actually understands the code my job has gone from being fun and having a great team environment to an absolute grind im in calls all day sorting out one issue after another i still find the work interesting and challenging overall but the biggest insult is twofold first that i am ridiculously underpaid especially for the fact that i do feel that i am excellent at my job for my level but also that the coo of the company still refuses to hire anyone new into the data science team we were swamped before my colleague left and now literally everything is on me with no guidance or experienced data scientist to learn from we barely use version control there are no code reviews and almost no documentation so when i do inevitably leave they are completely screwed my manager knows better but he is also under such deadline pressures that he cannot give me the time to go back through the mountain of code products we have developed to actually document anything frankly i am tired of this cheap company that talks a big game about revolutionising their industry but refuses to manage itself competently im actively talking to recruiters now to look for a company that is hopefully better run and with an actual experienced team that i can work with despite all this i too have been hesitant to leave as my manager is genuinely awesome and so are most of the other people i work with but at the end of the day the higher ups are running a business and if they are even somewhat competent each department team should not be so bare bones that a single person leaving can doom the company it is their fault and a consequence of their inability to manage business risks effectively if you leave and they cannot move forwards without you i would echo what people said here if they decided to fire you and you said ohh but guys you cannot fire me because i just bought a new car and i need this job to continue making payments because i put it all on credit do you think they would think twice no they would simply think you were financially irresponsible and it is not their problem you want mentorship and people to learn from that early in your career sounds like you want to leave you should do not feel bad business is business as far as alot of the complaints like doing work that is beneath youthat is par for the course at smaller companies you all wear several hats good luck so i think it would be very bad if i just quit one day even with a two week notice well if that is really a concern for the company then they can always put longer notice times in the contracts markilgrande i am going to be more empathetic with you if you still like it enough at least get more money or better conditions for it banjaxedgazumper make sure you get another job before you quit unless you think you want a long break between jobs morebikesthanbrains you have an opportunity here you do not necessarily have to take it but it is leverage before you leave come up with a plan for what you think your position should look like what your company should be doing with data take that to your boss and their boss and tell them you can do better and they should be doing better and you feel like you cannot stay is things do not change they may be open to the initiative you take can you find analysts at similar firms to work with my industry has a monthly hour bs session for the data folks and it is great fluffygreenpillow i feel like i could have written this listen to and more importantly act on your gut instinct leave you need people to learn from to grow i did the same move from small company only ds to larger company ended up in big tech but moved at first to a mid sized company in my mid and it changed my career and comp totally do not feel bad about ditching also do not be surprised when your next role also includes a lot of the same type of requests from people who are too lazy busy senior to look up basic info themselves zornslemons the only thing to adjust is this get a job and then quit this one levenshteinn this is a common experience due to the murky definition of a data scientist use this experience as a leverage to join more mature data team companies that rely on their data capabilities to directly generate profit will have such teams if data is not the core business you will always end up in this situation where you have deal with many ad hoc data requests clicketrie some of what you said is true of most analytics roles and some of what you said is quite common in startups but if you are bored you might try a new role in a different sized company and benefit from a team and some leadership that understands ds dexterhsu do not be if you feel like leaving just leave it is just business i bust my ass for my boss few years ago and was promise a promotion for manager role she left for better opportunity before giving me that promotion lol plantpig i am in very a similar situation except i am much later into my career i still want to learn and i miss having technical teammates to bounce ideas off of the only reason i am still there is the work life balance and i am given complete freedom to how i do my work because no one else is able to give me technical guidance wondering if anyone has had experience negotiating a much higher pay and or eventually building our your own team what would make it worthwhile to stay in a situation like this pzivan if you feel bad just leave more detailed handover notes but do not feel bad people come and go citizenbloom wait a second how is the finance team outsourcing their reports to you that smells badly because usually finance are very exact and punctillious about their numbers and who touches their data that there would be a reason to leave sovindi my advice do not think about it if you think it is in your best interests for you to do so just do it hackingbricker great post let them know data science is not a help desk you need some semblance of a team and project management good time to have a frank discussion about the strategy and teamwork even if it means not agreeing with everything the ceo wants to say kittenwhocodezz is it a good idea for your first ever job to be at a startup i am genuinely asking olderthanyoda oh boy you remind me of my first ever job leave working with colleagues is an important part of growth ds needs proper data engineering to be a legitimate teams otherwise you are most likely just a data analytics team at that point you need proper dbs connections and what not to actually utilise data science the finance team ceo paragraphs really resonates it is always urgent with both always it is one of the most toxic traits a company can put upon ds ml people and you will only realise after you leave but yeah even if were not factors the part where you are bored and not learning is enough of a reason to leave find a job and quit it you should not feel bad about this you will rejuvenate your career bruh i am the only de data person on my team i feel the pain as well man unlucky have you considered mentorship outside of your organisation and training courses funded financially by your company bring up your issues to your manager and make a suggestion on how these might be addressed at least then you have tried to fix the problem if they do nothing then you really should not feel bad about moving on you have tried own if you do not care then get that linkedin profile cleaned up and get the hell out asap stop working anything more than hours a week if you do care about the company or people walk right up to your manager and tell them you need a team or they need a new data scientist if they say no be ready to walk if they try to negotiate with you on the team size tell them you are the expert and this is what they need or they are going to drown anyways if they try to hire someone horizontal to you be ready to walk do not just sit there and train your replacement or someone else to manage you they only other solution i would consider beyond this is if they give you full autonomy to prioritize your work and tell everyone else no including the manager pushing for insights and while your at it tell that person to give you a data engineer every time they ask for insights my point is startups are occasionally crazy i would not hate the company for that but you seem to see something valuable in this group of people so you may as well at least give them the opportunity to do something about it but if this does not sound like anything you want to or unable to go through with then ya get another job and move on ladyemaskye start looking for other jobs and see what is out there do not put in your notice until you have actually found something to move on to throwitfaarawayy start doing kaggle projects you need to learn how to create machine learning problems out of business activity and do it your self stick it out diswastingmytime op should pay extra attention to this the early stages of the career are critical for growth sticking in a company with no lead team and defined contribution to help growth will handicap his career for years to come every day op is wasting alone without guidance without management support without meaningful contribution is a day his junior competition in normal team is gaining all of those and learning a lot more when you are late into your career you can afford to be nice and hold out in places that are less than optimal early you need to fight lest you end up with no job prospects nobody wants a senior mid with the experience of a junior agree had a job that is similar to op is quitted after just worked for months avocadoalternative i have had the i feel bad for ditching the company every time i switched jobs everybody was understanding and happy for me when i gave my notice never regretted making a move in hindsight fangxianfu right it is just business that is what they say when they lay people off and it is what you should say when you leave as well if you are set on quitting do it and do not feel bad if you really believe in the company is mission maybe talk to your manager and just be honest hey i am thinking of moving on can we talk about that or should i just move on younggamech best response here i actually disagree growth is key and if your conditions were met they would become more and more stuck in the current company you do not want to climb further up a small mountain move to lower down a big mountain pimemento exactly if they cannot see this it is not your problem curohn the beauty and horror of the employee employer relationship is that it is at will want to leave leave trying to find happiness and failing will be better then sticking with being unhappy given you have some financial cushion i am reading between the lines i do not think that the ceo only wants insights that he agrees with he wants insights that further his understanding of the business yeah unless the ceo is completely unqualified you can probably convince him with a good arguments a firm stance and a subtle approach the fact that the product has changed beyond initial recognition shows that they are flexible and probably smart you need to meet that level of competence or you can grow into it if you go against expert belief you need to have a lot of good damn proof in my experience most technical folks non business folks do not understand what that threshold looks like and they feel like folks do not listen to data when the issue is often that they are not presenting good enough data via good communication very wise very true but it is very difficult for a junior person who needs a mentor to pull off if the op can grow too be that person in that company i would encourage them to try it if not i would still encourage them to try and grow into that kind of person just at another company mrdarkcircles well put op appears to be early in career and wants to gain more experience building stochastic models in my years of career i have learned that the value add from these models is incremental sometimes marginal or even negligible over statistical models built with domain expertise the unsexy models have been yielding the biggest returns data science has is very misunderstood by a lot of people ahsfav i am in this situation too its miserable and they push ridiculous timelines on me without consulting or asking me what is it at all feasible ktpr did you end up in a better place minaturejuggernaut this is not helpful op wants to enjoy their job not get more money worse it sounds like a place that is not destined to be around long so while they could be off making better professional networking they end up more isolated when it does fold making it harder long term besides the best pay bumps come from moving companies gunnersthis is bad advice leveraging another offer is a good way to put a target on your back because they know you were unhappy enough to interview elsewhere you may force them into a raise but they will not be happy about it and your days could be numbered after that if pay is the main issue which it sounds like is not the case do a little research on some job boards then schedule a meeting with your manager and tell them what you want and why your current rate is too low if they do not give it to you calmly accept it do not make it an issue or push back and start interviewing hey i am swamped i think we need another person maybe somebody senior enough to mentor me if they hired that person i would consider staying this is great advice modafaca in this case which is fairly simmilar to mine i would say we do not even leave the junior it is an x years late junior with the experience of a junior xylon yeah thanks for depressing me and ramping up my anxiety levels bro modafaca that is the answer just look at any lay off and it will never be personal obviously just business as always eliminatingcoasts that is interesting point not risk getting stuck somewhere they have already evaluated is broadly not where they want to be i mainly suggest these expecting that most of them will not be fulfilled but using the negotiating power you have as someone actively searching and able to quit to improve things longer term people often do not rock the boat in order to maintain relationships and suppress thinking about how their organisation or position can change and when you are swapping positions is a great time to practice dropping that habit i am afraid that once i deploy these models and start making projections with them they will either shrug their shoulders and say so what kid or at the opposite end of the spectrum expect me to be able to tell the future wouldaredick much better my own company karmaissues okay then he needs to leave it was just a suggestion op knows the answer they just feel bad about it i was giving them another option i disagree that we can make a judgement on wether the company will be around for long given that we only have a reddit post typically the best pay bumps do come from moving but this scenario is not typical if op is this important to the company they can leverage that for a once in a lifetime kind of pay bump they could also keep looking after the company gives them a pay rise and be more selective karmaissues yeah i am just offering op another option they can do whatever they want but they hate this company anyway if op does it respectfully then it comes across as them demonstrating their value not as them taking the piss diswastingmytime maybe it is a wake up call you needed it is one that i got years ago which i am great full for this is just a career not some heavenly turmoil it is entirely within your grasp to get a better position minaturejuggernaut fair enough on long term viability of the company and sure it is an option but like you said at the top i think they know they have to leave and just want a push inertia is a powerful force",
  "i am not a lawyer but my understanding was that in the united states anyway such non compete clauses are very difficult to enforce depending on the state these non compete are mostly non enforceable because a company cannot stop you to earn a living in exchange of nothing question is is that a contract or part of the offer letter paperwork if you have a work contract like executives and people who know where the company dirt is different story but usually you have attached some form of compensation for that non work period a particularly shitty company might come after you just to set a precedent and give you a hard time bullcitypicker in several decades of data science and software engineering and seeing or signing many of these contracts i can only think of one case where it was invoked that was against a sales guy who went to a competitor and tried to take clients and hot leads with him i recall it just being lawyers sending each other threatening letters some of the agreements i have seen have been so broad they pretty much excluded working for a company that uses computers i would just sign it and forget it that is not what a lawyer would tell you but those agreements are so overly broad they could not be enforced viitatiainen i am not a lawyer and if i was you i would consult one but if it says in competition with the company would that perhaps only limit you from working from another consultancy it would seem unlikely that a company with their own data science department for implementing some product is out there competing with a consultancy but i could be wrong depending on the country you are in it may also be questionable whether they would be able to enforce any such clause in some places they can but from what i understand in others it is just words on paper that do not really mean anything timelyparadox in most cases if they want to force it they have to pay whatever amount you would be getting paid at the said competitor in most cases this is why they never enforce it but you migt get a paid month vacation character that was in the first few nda is i ever signed my first job i got an offer from another company in a similar industry and they said sorry we cannot match that salary you should take it so i did i think the biggest thing is they do not want you poaching clients or fellow employees wrob the scenario you need to worry about is your new employer does a reference check on you with your old employer the old employer says yep they worked here but they are under a non compete your new employers says to you sorry you did not pass our reference screen so we cannot hire you right now if you get that non compete sorted out with your old employer let us now and we will hire you it puts you in a really tough spot regardless of whether you can theoretically win in court or not that is only true in ca elsewhere non competes like this are enforceable i think there was an onpoint episode about this again i do not know the law of such things but i imagine that some former employers might also try to embarrass a departing employer by somehow roping their new employer into the mess most do not but a particularly resentful one might that is also why there is a legal fight to restrict the use of non compete as a matter of fact they are something truly anti american but again usually even in a state like texas which is employer friendly as it gets a judge will favor the employee in most cases because a company cannot stop your right to earn a living the risk is that your new employer might drop your ass because it is too much of an inconvenience having you spending time to fight it and they might get sued as well",

  "emergency agreeable that sucks bro if you have a lot free time you can use it to build your own project portfolio find a problem you would like to solve and crack on when you finish it you can add it to your portfolio even if you do not finish you will learn a lot in the process and the learning process itself is very rewarding today i found out that i can fine tune chatgpt to give me the output to specific format and i felt like a hacker i have been unemployed for months now with a lot of rejections and only when i am working on my own stuff i can complete forget how fucked up my situation is what i am trying to say is try to have some fun while using your skills and eventually you will figure things out do jobs take a contract role they are easier to get compared to full time ones esp when you work with a recruiter blacksnowboader i am in a similar position maybe you should think about being r overemployed apart from the advice about your job situation i would also consider seeking professional help specifically for the burnout demotivation depression part i have been in a similar situation for the last four years but recently got a borderline dream project but it did not improve my motivation at all in fact it was almost demotivating to get what i wanted and not feel better ddanieltan have you tried looking at sparkhome seriously though there is nothing wrong with taking a break for your mental health the burnout you are feeling suggests you have been doing tasks work job applications etc that you do not enjoy with the expectation there is a pay off around the corner this is not sustainable and i think you know that too lobglobgarschlom hey first of all i am sorry to hear that it is always sad to see someone who does not feel fulfilled what are your interests and your strengths when it comes to working have you considered roles more akin to that of a project manager does your resume look good i mean even just the formatting go on r resumes a bad looking resume which does not pass ats scans could be the determining factor in you not getting noticed let me know man ornithopterbob been an analyst doing a variety of forecasting planning reporting roles for ish years and i have learned that the spark is a myth there is no single job or role or project that fulfills on an ongoing basis no single job role project yes you get your fix from time to time as things come together and life gets very interesting but it is never permanent circle of job the people that are saying to find personal projects to work on are correct when i was in a similar state of burnout i found a dataset on kaggle for hotel reservations and built a python program to determine maximum hotel capacity based on day to day occupancy i have also done side jobs on upworkcom the point being you have to find something that you like and do it if you are like me finding answers in the data is the thing i crave does not matter if i do not get paid for it but that is an argument i still have with myself not sure what my point is but you are in a much better place right now than if you were unemployed it is worth the time and effort to appear to play the game while building your own skills continue to look for other positions get a cat watch shoresy find something you like to do and laugh about getting paid to do it just my opinion i could be wrong what is your current salary euphoricthought are they hiring lol dm the company name renokarchnmy are you the version of me that can afford a phd can you volunteer in your local university to conduct research for them like making data pipelines setup simulators etc lullansenpai if your job pays and the company allows moonlighting then instead of leaving find freelance projects that you are interested in the key is to identify why you cannot get any job offer and focus on improving that so you can land one coconut coins comfort is the enemy of success you have been to comfortable not sure how this was ever possible when making the tenth percentile of pay advice buy a lot of modafinil and start actively studying it helps with burnout boredout and depression also accept you were victim to title inflation and move on huzakkah yeah i have done a little bit of the portfolio thing here and there with a few projects listed on my resume most recently i web scraped some data and made a few power bi dashboards with it it is still a work in progress but i just have not had any motivation to work on it in months i would like to take a good messy dataset that i can use to create a predictive model and just slap everything i know how to do inside of python r but i do not even know where to find a good dataset that is not one of the same tired old things from kaggle i have had other ideas for projects but the data just does not seem to exist i also know someone i would like to work on something with but he has his own issues so it is been hard to get anything going with him i am hoping that changes soon because i think we would create a positive feedback loop with each other huzakkah that is actually not a bad idea do you know any good contractors to look into grapeflavor_ what type of professional did you reach out to huzakkah i have been doing therapy for a couple of years now but i am not sure how much it is helping it is basically impossible to find anyone where i live but i think that is the case in most of the us these days speedis notfree came in hoping for this response huzakkah have you tried looking at sparkhome you are right though my situation is stable enough right now i should not force myself to do something when i am burnt out from it i feel fine to do job apps interviews right now the other stuff will come when it comes i guess huzakkah i like anything stats related especially building models clustering and data vis i am not a big fan of the de side of things and my knowledge in that realm is lacking i would be happy just making power bi dashboards honestly i had a fancy column resume until recently i switched to the super basic word format that seems to be popular these days it is still too early to tell how well the new one is working have not considered project manager what does that entail huzakkah there is no single job or role or project that fulfills on an ongoing basis no single job role project yes you get your fix from time to time as things come together and life gets very interesting but it is never permanent circle of job that is true but my situation is pretty extreme when i was in a similar state of burnout i found a dataset on kaggle i have also done side jobs on upworkcom just been hard to find anything that really inspires me is the problem maybe i just need to go down the rabbit hole of user submitted datasets on kaggle until something catches my eye i will look into upwork as well find something you like to do and laugh about getting paid to do it the last couple of days i have gotten paid to play octopath traveler a bit ha ha i have been meaning to get back into making music as well but i cannot find much inspiration there either huzakkah it is below huzakkah pretty sure we are in a freeze right now lol holyragumuffin phds in the sciences and computer sciences are usually stipended i am not paying for mine huzakkah i will not even consider doing it if i am not funded huzakkah i am not sure how to do that when a nobody ever gives feedback and b all the advice on resumes interviews etc contradicts itself the only thing that immediately comes to mind is that i am usually lost when i get asked a weird question in an interview that i have never been asked before but there is no way to account for that beforehand i cannot come up with quick snappy answers on the fly like that even worse when the question is about something i have never experienced tek systems there are a lot more you should look for ones who specializes in tech recruiting lobglobgarschlom as a project manager you would take on much more responsibility but and some may disagree you technically do less so you are responsible of overseeing and keeping everyone in check making sure that the project is delivered on time and correctly very little to no coding but you have to be very knowledgeable and see problems before they arise it can be a very stressful job but also very rewarding good idea on switching the resume format have you tried applying to jobs where powerbi is listed among other things frequently with those listings what happens is that they say they want de as well but you end up not having to do those things food for thought renokarchnmy what location what is your actual title and what do you do when you are not doing anything renokarchnmy that stipend ai not covering everything else i have to pay for huzakkah i am not really the type of person that likes being responsible for things so i think being any kind of manager would stress me out yeah i have been applying for jobs that have power bi listed in the description it seems like most da ds positions have tableau and or power bi listed in the description though huzakkah i work remotely in western usa huzakkah it is either data scientist or data analyst but i am not sure which my company is a giant mess of bureaucracy and i switched departments a couple months in these days when i am not doing anything mostly going to the gym or screwing around on youtube holyragumuffin i mean sure it cannot pay for everything but i should mention there is free health and dental insurance if that is what you are thinking stipend is around plus free tuition some programs in physics comp sci with the military stipend at a year with all that stuff the faustian bargain is that they require you to work for them after for like years or somewhere about that bruh are they hiring renokarchnmy too old for military and not keen on killing people for a living i mean other debts transportation housing retirement savings clothing food utilities entertainment etc all the normal life stuff then making up for so lost income if we gotta move where she cannot work that kinda thing lobglobgarschlom could be a nice side gig for me as well huzakkah lol i am pretty sure we have a hiring freeze right now this job would not be so bad if i had something else that was mentally stimulating and paid more character i was working in a field where i was fulfilled and then i had no life no sleep my family did not recognize me i am so stoked to clean data and provide insights that are forgotten by the end of the week my pay is probably about the same as yours and it was barely livable here with my fulfilling job salary the grass is not always greener if you do not have a ton of family obligations and are remote take up an analog hobby like woodworking or welding fill your down time with something fulfilling that is not an obligation fulfilling work that is obligatory can become old real quick especially if you have a major life event huzakkah yeah a job with no work life balance would be even worse i do not mind having a slack ass job but it would be nice to use my brain for like hours a day character good luck i wish you the best",

  "autumnotter if you hate debugging and optimization you should probably not do any kind of coding honestly data science libraries are sometimes a total disaster when it comes to debugging because they are so high level you will find yourself constantly trying to interpret extremely technical or poorly written errors or stack traces maybe consider product development management or project management it is important to understand what coders can do but you do not actually need to do it acceptable milk do not use chatgpt for refreshing knowledge it has no guarantee to be correct it is just a bullshit generator cptahmadknackwurst frankly debugging is nearly as pure of a logic problem as you can get scientific method if you are having trouble with syntax then i would say recompile much more frequently dont wait until the program is fully written to find those flaws test each part as you write it it is much more frustrating to have a wall of interdependent syntax errors at the end then to keep rechecking and fixing each in turn along the way also fluency matters so do not offload of the syntax knowledge to chatgpt therealtiddlydump i do not find the point in learning about the code for the sake of coding itself literally nobody does this code is a tool i like the math data and logic that means you need to code sorry rbno one uses java for ds ml you might like more practicable languages more otherwise agree with others that coding is part of the job timelyparadox in data science a big part of the job is debugging data slashdave if you do not like debugging and optimization you are going to be disappointed when you start practicing data science galacticbyte unless you do purely theoretical work you will probably need to deal with code one way or another heck even for theoretical stuff you probably want some computer validations this is just the reality of doing any kinds of substantial work involving math and logic the human brain can also do so much computation so it is inevitable that you need a more powerful tools this is true even in highly theoretical non ds disciplines like physics and math now if we are talking about data science data literally live on computers so even theoretically you will have to deal with coding so basically to hate avoid the coding process is the same thing as hating avoiding ds itself also especially if you become a quant you are gonna deal with probably loads of c libraries for doing heavy computation and also code optimizations for sifting through tons of data better to get that false expectation of thinking coding would not be a major focus out of your mind unseemlyturbidity you sound a bit like me i do enjoy the logic and coding but i am no data engineer or software developer i will happily debug a query or a chunk of python code but once it veers toward software development and i have to debug a tangled mess of things across a whole tool probably written by someone else with a different way of thinking and no documentation i am less keen in normal times i do a combined data analyst data scientist role in an industry where things change too quickly for most models to be productionised i usually just need to get to a big picture kind of explanation with a recommendation about what to do with it because next month the product will have changed enough to invalidate everything anyway i enjoy working like that bored right now because the balance in my job has shifted away from analysis and i miss it willietrombone_ my interests lie primarily in mathstats and econcomics finance what tools are you using for those currently how much of your time is spent really doing the basic software development coding tasks like debugging and what not and how much of you are time is spent really analyzing data it seems like you are working with large blocks of code at a time have you tried using python notebooks like jupyter notebooks they let you build a python session one step at a time so you can pseudo code each step and then debug any steps that do not run as expected so the analytics usually come down to ensuring i have written the statements correctly to return the results i expect if you ca not trust your code to ensure the validity of your outputs your decision making tools you should write better code tarehman data science is a form of software engineering if you do not enjoy software engineering you probably will not be very happy with the actual day to day work of being a data scientist no do not do data science however you can consider being a statistician or mathematician miketythhon either you are like or you have a terrible attitude definitely find an easier profession aldjfh ah that sucks i am actually a civil engineer and one of the reasons i considered data science was cause i did not want to do project management to advance my career so i was looking for alternative paths guess i will keep looking liljondoe strong statement imo i would bet that most people hate debugging yet here we are aldjfh what should i use python and r i have used matplotlib and pandas library for hyrdologic modelling in python tbh i found it kinda dry but maybe if it was more math intensive i might like it more but yeah i can kinda see that maybe practicable languages may be different from languages likes java aldjfh alright thank you for clarifying that for me as an engineer who does not code i guess i underestimate how much coding is require for other more math heavy fields autumnotter fwiw project management product management and management management all vary widely in how they work i know a lot of data scientists who get frustrated with always having to keep up to date on dozens of technologies and techniques who move into one of those areas and love it might be worth looking into before you get discouraged and similarly might be worth looking into data analyst jobs with low code tools generally though the strongest data scientists i know love to code love to learn new things are comfortable with syntax debugging and are strong programmers traditionalpearyou autumnotter s comment is a bit of hyperbole imo op there are plenty of ds roles where code optimization debugging and productionization are not requirements of the job there are many firms where quantitative analysts or data scientists simply handoff their research to software engineering teams to be deployed into production sounds like you have a decent math background so give it a try before you exclude yourself based on one commenter is opinion autumnotter i do not know most of the excellent programmers i know view things like that as interesting problems to solve definitely not all just to be clear of course it can get frustrating when it goes on too long but when someone tells me they hate of what a job entails my general advice to them is not to do that job edit i am just going to add here that the op specifically says that they find the structure and syntax of coding difficult and that they do not like learning about coding for the sake of it i am sorry i just know very few programmers who enjoy their job and are good at it who feel this way

  "nymanow i actually tried it twice recently and it worked for these positions i got a call from hr and scheduled interviews i would not bet on this process but experience proved me wrong lol boldedbowels when i was applying for jobs i would do like easy apply and traditional applications a day i honestly do not remember if i got any interviews from the easy applies but it takes only a second so there is really no downside to it i have personally never heard back from a linkedin easy apply job but as always it is a numbers game when i was on the other side and had to assist in hiring we had over applicannots to sort through the highest qualified would never respond the take home assessment so if you can get lucky enough to get to that round your chances might actually be good the person we ended up hiring was probably no better than the top of applicannots he just happened to get his resume viewed at the right time and turned in his take home assessment you would be surprised how low quality many of those applications arethere is definitely some kind of indian resume ring that caught hold of our posting and was spamming candidates with nearly identical resume templates and wording quick aside i just want to be clear that i am not pro tha it was not my call and it drove away so many applicannots anecdotally i have never even gotten an interview from an easy apply job or linkedin either renokarchnmy generic resume because no one has time for customization in a world where you are in a pile with hundreds of other people half an hour after they post the job easy apply has many applicannots because it is easy i would wager arent even in competition with you from a skillset and experience level they are just noise you can literally automate applying to those so yeah also at least in ca easy apply on linkedin is qualified efforts to job hunt when you are on unemployment and since tech is obsessed with this idea that you do not need any qualification to work everyone without quals spams those things because they are just barely doing a mooc as career development for said unemployment i paid a career coach and she basically said find one dream job per week and do the hard work for that a few not so optimal but still good jobs and put less effort into those each week then bulk up on the easy apply types because why not it is still a numbers game ampanmdagaba yes the rate is much lower but the effort is waay lower so ultimately it is worth it you do not tailor your resume for applications not worth it or maybe you can pre make types of resumes and upload the one that fits more but honestly one good well prepared resume is enough you do however tailor your cover letter if there is a field for a cover letter or maybe change paragraph out of two this is worth it and it can usually be typed right in the form so it is really fast bothwaysitgoes if you do not tailor your resume for them i think they are worth it it is a low risk low reward kind of thing i know a few people who got good jobs through linkedin easy apply but you should not rely solely on them find recruiters ask friends for referrals write emails to hr if they solicit it in the job posting apply through traditional forms yes i have had multiple interviews for roles i really wanted through easy apply jobs do notyouloveme definitely yes i made a bot that can apply to thousands of easy apply jobs per day i can get over messages from recruiters in a single day and a lot of those recruiters have other positions that the bot was not capable of coming across etc i can fill entire days with interviews getting a job is a basic data access problem how can you find a position if you do not even make a connection to get more information about a potential job the more applications you pump out the more potential avenues you have easy apply makes it easy to pump those applications out greenerpickings i usually never use those only as a last resort if i cannot find the actual listing i guess a better question is anyone know one person that got a job through that then i guess itd be worth it jobs i have worked i saw openings in a job site i go to the actual company site find the opening and apply there i found on craigslist p worked there for years theshogunsassassin i got my first titled data scientist role from an easy apply granted i had y relevant experience as a data scientist in the exact same domain do the premium trial it tells you how your profile stacks up to other applicannots subjectadi apply for them anyways but i would not go in with high expectations tbh i intentionally submitted resumes to companies that were using shitty hr systems because i theorized that there was probably less applications ppl do not want to go through with filling out all the stuff on workday or oracle hcm lol i got pretty good call back rates thefakinkaze no bequietimthinking i think it gets rid of the jobs you clearly are not looking for from your job search results so i apply for jobs i clearly will not get given my experience wouldatmadx if you meet of the qualifications just smash that apply button you never know confused alpacca i focus all my job application energy into linkedin easy apply i do other applications as well but as a principle i think it is silly for companies to need more than my resume it also helps me play the number game that is job applications especially since i am pretty early in my career i do longer applications for nice jobs but it has to be worth it i got my last two jobs with linkedin easy apply just want to add that during my first application round fresh out of college without a work permit i did over job applications because of easy apply littletoke i am going to contradict everyone saying it is not worth it i got my first data scientist position after grad school through the linkedin easy apply button i have been here almost years and even got promoted to senior level obviously i think you should expect the odds are low since the barrier to apply is low for easy apply jobs meaning way more people can spam their resume but that is not to say it is not possible to get a job through it cyazid got my current job from easy apply i would say just do it when i was applying i did a ephermerality extremely worth it the three times including this time that i have done a job search i literally wake up scroll the easy applies in linkedin for minutes just clicking buttons and then go about my day in about a week or two doing this i probably have initial calls lined up that i just ride until i get a job and compensation is generally fairly good nyc it is also so much easier now that it is just flooded with remote jobs just do it yunikarn hard to generalise once i applied through linkedin and got shortlisted but did not get an offer maybe wearing my star wars uniform was not such a good idea autumnotter i got my first job out of academia using easy apply job was great my new boss told me later on that my resume had looked terrible but that i was the second applicannot indiancaptainamerica i applied to linkedin through easy apply and i heard it back tarehman i have gotten plenty of responses from easy apply jobs in the past i love that it saves me time naughtydismutase idk that is how i got my job i have actually heard back from easy apply before a couple of times no boldedbowels just apply traditionally to the jobs you really want mind sharing the bot tigerslovecows you do not have to share the bot with me but can i get some guidance on how i can attempt to build my own would be a nice project at the very least njstatechamp clever realrustom this is the way robinhoodtis s that i applied to i never even hear back i find it incredibly unlikely that i will stand out and it makes me wonder if it is even worth submitting an ad hoc resume highlighting my relevant expertise if i am not going to hear back what do you all do take time to tailor the resume for each position submit a generic resume that kinda fits the description in hopes that it will get you through the door by traditional applications do you mean through the company website like what the first reply mentioned tonkotsuramen_ i am so sorry if the question is stupid but you could explain what traditionally means like going to the career website contacting hr applying and job boards wouldo notyouloveme i can take a search term or multiple search terms and run a search on linkedin for easy apply only applications you should be able to figure out what url will produce the results that are easy apply only then cycle through and you should be able to capture items per search term i dump those urls into a database i use puppeteerjs for the scraping and then i pull the urls out of the database and queue them up to process the applications i used to apply and save any questions on the applications that could not be answered so i could manually answer them and rerun but that seemed pointless eventually i just answered the questions with please contact for answer and put years experience for everything the recruiters did not seem to care it is definitely a great project that i do recommend especially with what you can learn about botting and scraping and programming in general it is something you can really invest yourself into making a project out of finding a job is a self fulfilling prophecy type situation kudos if you can do analytics on it and whatnot subjectadtbh it really was annoying filling out all that stuff out lol but i found it easier to do when i blocked out time to actually just apply for those boldedbowels yeah like go to the site retype your whole resume and send a cover letter boldedbowels it is in a comment above but basically just going to the website and retyping your resume and submitting a cover letter tigerslovecows thank you for your detailed comment one more thing do you know any other sources i can use i am already building a reddit bot from some online sources on github and what not but any other detailed sources that you can recommend renokarchnmy we got fucking chatgpt but companies cannot do anything better than forcing applicannots to spend an hour retyping their resume and tailoring a cover letter to get an auto reject email days later in toddthewraith is there a such thing as a good cover letter cuz so far i have no idea how tf to do one despite staring at glassdoor tutorials legit easier to figure out why arcmap gave me an error than how cover letters work at least for me tonkotsuramen_ thank you so much kind stranger do notyouloveme for the type of bot that i am using with linkedin definitely study up on css selectors and whatever library you are using puppeteer or selenium etc knowing as much as possible about how the library works makes your life so much easier also knowing css is very important if you are manipulating elements from the dom so use the youtubez if you are not all that familiar also helps to understand http codes and asynchronous programming personally i used my own servers for portions of the the linkedin bot you can take cookies from one session and serve them out to another browser instance for example and that will allow you to stay logged in so you do not have to keep logging in and you do not get flagged juanitovaldeznuts you said it yourself we got fucking chatgpt offload that mindless shit and automate the boring stuff life is too short brother boldedbowels i am by no mean an expert but if you message me your email i will send you the one i got my first job with renokarchnmy chatgpt makes a pretty suck ass resume though it is okay for cover letter if you prompt it right and proofread before submitting",

  "raglub it depends are you involved in production deployment if yes knowledge about server architecture and linux being the most popular server os is advantageous dylantmb use docker blacksnowboader honestly just the slash being in windows is enough for me to never want to use windows couldusesomecowbell holy shit to me part of the beauty of linux is that it so willingly allows me to learn how it operates using linux changed my life and advanced my career though not for data science related purposes i just think everyone should learn linux but i get it some people prefer ham and others prefer turkey i have worked with plenty of people far smarter than me who prefer windows do not fear the penguin edit i will add that for server administration i think you should be thankful if your services are running on linux windows lets you perform a lot if tasks by dragging the lollipop over the rainbow and powershell is truly powerful shell but linux just runs forever reboots are for kernel updates brandco yes you need to know how to use a linux shell linux is what almost all servers are running most data science software is written for linux before its available on windows that does not mean your laptop must run linux as a primary os however a linux desktop with a gui interface is not usually relevant to this discussion on windows you can run wsl windows subsystem for linux docker or ssh into a linux server remotely you can also pick up a raspberry pi if you want to learn about the hardware interface on linux in a home lab type environment i would recommend starting with docker therealtiddlydump are you under the impression that aws is spinning up windows machines for people to use my company always gave me a windows pc but the server where you do the heavy lifting are always linux however i still use outlook excel tableau on my pc bridledbronco i have not touched a windows os in many many years i have a mac i use for general things but my work horse is linux and that is just never going to change uchimata use linux much easier to manage all your tools and shell scripting itself can be really useful for some data wrangling if you have any aspirations of being more than an analyst scientist not really able to deploy models into production yourself then you should know some linux gypcasino linux is the operating system of the internet and high performance computing developing a model on your pc for your own purposes use whatever os you like hosting a model as a rest api or in a web app so that other users in your organization or on the internet can use it will need to host it on a linux server fitting an expensive model on gpus and or with parallel processing will need to do this on a linux server you will most likely continue to use your pc for some initial modeling but shift to linux when scaling up the model fitting or deploying the model mbel_ yes just install ubuntu on your computer it will help you get familiarized with linux and it happens that deploying code will become very very easy i cannot see a compelling argument to use windows for data science unless you are forced to all the tooling just works worse less compatible more complicated worse for building for deployment more messing around with every aspect of it just use linux if you have a choice and wsl or docker helps if you do not final use linux more than probably repositories are linux you probably can use mac they are very similar except macs do not natively support nvidia gpu fluttertubes evidence based reason for a person to switch of course not os is a matter of taste you will however be wise to get comfortable with linux source studying ds and have lived in linux since george bush was president actually one of the few areas where the linux desktop has an advantage over windows is development the linux desktop is very good when you develop code since you often have all the tools you need easily available delicious view i am going to say in reality you kinda need linux but not as much as some of us make it out to be some things are not going to work on windows most of the web is linux so working in the professional setting means you are going to come across working with linux having said that you do not need sysadmin level knowledge of linux and you can learn as you go logisticspock in my experience using python for data science over the last years with and all the common libraries frameworks and packages everything just works smoother on linux especially dependencies on windows i used to run into issues with things like wheels whl or anything that required gcc for local builds plus any data science team i have worked with was centered around linux and linux environments for development and production i use windows subsystem for linux on daily basis for all my ml work it also works natively for ssh and working with bastion hosts that are required for working with linux virtual machines in the cloud where we deploy rilut geek pedantryr serious namkniesh it is wotth to try it out with windows subsystem for linux wsl presented at windows helped me a lot to have familiar windows gui on the one hand and full power of unix at the other i would recommend to read unix programming environment by b w kernighan quite old but helped me a lot to get involved into it during my student times oh honey i have not used a windows machine in like years coldhellfire machine learning engineer here we have several legacy windows vms which are an absolute nightmare to work with we a kubrnates cluster which we deploy dockerized solutions to and its an absolute delight tldr linux good windows bad disastrous i do not think it makes any significannot difference for ds i use windows of the time i prefer not to deal with the terminal at all but that is just my os preference no impact on what i can do for ds character your work computer is going to be the one they give you because lame things like security and deals on buying everyone the same machine or spefic models for different departments you will be forced to learn it eventually not the entire ins and outs but definitely how to navigate it i have gotten to the point now where i much rather be in a linux environment caksters linux is definitely worth learning because you will be doing data science on cloud servers on cloud servers your jupyter environment will most likely be installed on some limux based system knowing how to navigate linux is essential if you have macbook there is very small differences as macs are unix based pretty much all servers are linux based eventually if you have developed a model that will be used in production then your model will be run on some sort of linux container knowing how to navigate and do basic operations is very handy lastly if you want to progress in your career you probably want to learn how to productionise your models for this you will always use linux given all of this you do not need to switch from windows to linux but you definitely want to be comfortable using linux if you want to progress and deal with big data stuff that does not fit o machine and deploy your models in production calminky really depends on how fluent you are with linux if all you know is windows then i would discourage it if you already have experience with running code on a linux machine go for it there will be challenges that you simply do not have with windows or macos so be okay with that wouldatastrophey try if you like windows i use mac for a lot of my work and have the advantage that most things that work with mac work with linux but when i want to use my desktop pc for something that requires a little more grunt i mostly use as then i can have office etc all running well as well as the frankly superior window management of windows but get all the benefits of working with a linux kernel it integrates really well with microsoft terminal and vscode and the performance penalties are almost nonexistent now alternatively use docker just do not use windows for development is the key advice here nerfyies usually if you are running notebooks in the cloud where the data is it will be probably running linux picapaodiablo as a data science what would evidence based reasons be exactly yes you should learn it roastmecerebrally download virtualbox and install a linux vm on your windows computer and never look back afkforlol dockerize is all you need jokes aside yes if you outgrow your local pc everything should be containerized and run on lightweight machines linux is great for lightweight gpu server cluster work anonamen unix based systems which includes osx are much better for a lot of programming languages and libraries makes building things easier you will find things library package etc that are effortless to install and configure on linux and a massive annoyance on windows there is a whole website devoted to compiled windows binaries for common python libraries because it is a pain in the ass to compile a lot of things on windows maybe it is better now i have been off windows for years plus burning all that extra ram and cpu just for the pretty clickables and whatever else windows does behind the scenes is wasteful windows os overhead is comically massive anyways do you need linux i suppose not but it makes life easier in a lot of different ways if you are not willing to make the leap just use a mac the actual question should be why should i use windows as a technical computer user and honestly the only good answer is because i play games on the same system and they wo not work on linux mac which okay fine but nothing to do with ds functionality greenbloodedamazon honestly it is the way linux works and has lower overhead all servers i have worked with are linux and back in the day when i was doing econometrics work we did it all on unix machines in the end even us mac lovers are connecting to linux machines because we can manipulate the required data there as the really big stuff needs that sort of power that you will not get on a local machine so the beauty of mac is that it is nix bases and that makes working the command line familiar us older ds folks tend to prefer the command line because we cut our teeth on it and while tools like jupyter hub jupyter notebooks and the like are nifty and have a use at the end of the day ipynb files have to be converted into py for deployment and pushing up to prod or whatever will require work in terminal so linux understanding familiarity will be needed but the tldr if you are going to be doing real ds work in industry you will need to learn to work the nix command line to an extent to be most successful weareglenn i would not worry too much about it but i would invest some time into learning bash if you end up having to interact with linux servers at work it will be via bash so having some familiarity would be helpful thewallie my cents as a ds who used to develop on windows and switched to mac i can honestly say that everything got easier in terms of setting up the env linux is not a preferred operating system for development but you need to know how it works to an extent because most docker images use it and running macos as your base os will allow you to learn linux much faster than if youre using windows because of the huge overlap between how those os is work setz_ i am starting my graduation and i do not know in which area i will work i think it is amazing that in my two years of doing work on a linux machine i might have turned the computer off twice lol foxbatcs comparing linux and windows would be more like ham and hot garbage on a stale humid day microsoft uses so many of your clock cycles to gather gigs of telemetry on you every month they force updates down your throat without consent and it is a security nightmare to say nothing about the in built advertising gross that is was my case too but take me a lot of time learn and control linux for data science i am aware of the complexity compared with windows of mac mindmech even when i preferred windows now mac i still used linux for work either just ssh to a work machine or with windows subsystem for linux picapaodiablo hell even azure is spinning up a lot of linux machines setz_ i did not get it setz_ yeah we also lose power bi when going to linux setz_ brave person setz_ yeah bro both games and audio visual production software such as ableton live and photoshop does not work in linux im sorely tempted to dual boot or run windows on ssd for not losing those gigant softwares pentinumlol you should probably learn some simple linux syntax in working environment rarely will you be using your own computer is power to train model instead you will use vm from a cloud provider these vm run linux thus requiring you to know the basic of navigating a linux os not knowing linux is fine starting out but you will be expected to learn fast and on the job so be prepared therealtiddlydump i have crashed stuff more times than i have purposefully restarted things colickingseahorse any good resources for learning linux for data science couldusesomecowbell that is how i got started i realized i could actually do a lot with about to bash commands i learned how to use the vi text editor long before i discovered the wonderful vimtutor that comes built in then my head really exploded when i learned that everything is a file saltysarcasticjohn i downvoted you because you did not understand djrickert we cannot accept that can we professorlust just use r which power bi is built on top of greenbloodedamazon meh powerbi is for data analysts and business analysts it is not a big loss and i have not touched anything like pbi or tableau in years my last company the data science team used plotly dash anything pbi was done by analysts same at my current company my team might land stuff in the cloud that data analysts will then use in tableau otherwise we use ploty etc this is the way and just use basic docker koshersloth just learn linux i have no idea why people keep saying linux for data science as if there is some special distro or something

  "itiskaro i think your career advisor is just trying to help this field is extremely oversaturated at the entry level so you should be applying for jobs with different jobs titles most people start as a data analyst it is definitely helpful to stay within the industry you have some experience working in as many firms look for the combination of technical skills and business understanding notungvr i guess your counsellor thinks that role will let you leverage your sales background and combine it with your new tech skills it does not mean that they do not believe you can do well as a data scientist just that maybe this will be an easier transition and use more of your accumulated skills vs starting from scratch and competing with others as one more entry level data science candidate but of course ultimately you should go for the career that you are more interested in robinhoodtis i think you should look for a senior data analyst role that role is more about what insights you can get out of the data and your sales experience will complement the technical skills you are currently learning pretty well more and more these days i am seeing people going for data analyst jobs instead of data scientist after their masters degrees in data science because data scientist roles are just too competitive and entry level jobs are only available at startups that give you little salary data analyst jobs at bigger companies are easier to achieve after getting a data science masters these days for both entry and senior level and pay much more and there is always more demand for data analysts than data scientists because not many companies really require predictive analytics as long as you are not hell bent on becoming a data scientist i think a senior data analyst role will suit you the best you do what you gotta do to make money that is bad advice i could have been pigeon holed to sales had a recruiter in an in person meeting pitch me a recruiter role before talking about opportunities for what i asked for and after i just told him i was not interested in sales roles literally in the same meeting all for him to tell me they did not have any role that i was looking for at this time like fuck off guy colibriweiss not very common i would say did they explain their pov when suggesting product management i can see it being a better fit for the soft skills so it could allow you to get a job closer to ds where you could transition in the team company i looked at your background and as someone from sea to my knowledge data science is not exactly popular here we do not have the tech startups who want entry level ds or a lot of positions in large tech companies there is a lot of banks or some ai startups looking for phd it is just common in sea to be driven into meaningless work i guess tough times autumnotter i would not expect your career counselor to know what they are talking about having significannot domain knowledge in sales could be a huge help for a data scientist one of the major things new data scientists are missing is domain knowledge this does not mean it will be easy to fund a job but i do not know why you would be any worse off than anyone else if you have successfully completed a master is degree in data science and it was a good program i cannot answer your question about having a sales background but data science is principally an applied math discipline to some extent computers are just tools for carrying out the math liko product manager doing a masters in ds ignore your counselor poooolooo ignore people follow your dreams go somewhere else if needed raharth so to address you being discouraged it is a very wide field and there is definitely a need for a profile like yours edit one thing someone mentioned which i want to add your recruiter might just wanna push you towards the positions they have because they only make money if they fill one of those i work as a data scientist for more than years by now and i speak only about my personal experience also i state general things i have come to realize they do not necessarily apply to you that you have to judge yourself to those who downvote and i am sure there will be some tell me where you disagree would be really interesting to hear about your experience from my point of view as a data scientist you need a good mathematical background and solid coding it is easy to run some models on some data for that you only need basic math and coding skills they become important though if you work with slightly more complex models or when you run into issues for example i recently had a colleague using xgboost it worked perfectly fine on train data but predicted values wrong by magnitudes on the validation to understand why it does that you need to understand the algorithm another example we had some computer vision model using an attention mechanism not transformer it did not work at all an small images where what we wanted to identify was in the middle of the image though if we embedded it in noise it worked great the same model then learned until it randomly decided to run off to never return which was related to some gradient and momentum issue in combination with rare statistical events for all of those issues you need to understand the algorithms on a mathematical levelcoding is important when it comes to productization many data scientists produce horrible notebooks of hundereds of lines of sequential code with all kind of stuff in between which you can barely integrate in any product the way they are this assumes that you actually have a team doing that worst case you are by yourself so you also have to do that when i stated at my company the colleague i was working with back then was not as skilled we had a system that never became stable for years until it was shut down for that reasonsomewhere you stated that you have a econ background the math you learn there is very very different from the math you need here i have studied physics applied math and econ which i never finished tbh and the math used there was a blunt simplification so econ background by itself is not sufficient as a math background but you might have a good background from your masters program so imo it really depends on your skill set where to go to in the field if you are strong in coding but less mathy i think data engineering ml engineering or ml ops engineering are good choices if you are less strong in terms of coding and math but have a strong background in sales or econ i think analyst positions are a good match there you need less code since one does a lot with a large set of tools and a lot of your work is about communication and business understanding you also need that as a data scientist no question but i personally think that it is even more important for analysts for engineering positions this is much less important miketythhon do you have data on the career being over saturated at entry level popular how can i find a job in ds i just started my masters raharth that is a good point they wanna make money off you so they will try to push you towards what positions they have recoveringphysicist might just be that ds literate product managers with background in sales and degree in ds are no ten a penny entry level ds are might be that op is career prospects would just be better from the get go leveraging his education and experience in a pm role if money and progression are their primary career goals fewestablishmentmainly due to my background in sales and because of that my counsellor said that recruiters are likely going to pigeonhole me into a non technical role even with a masters degree in data science fewestablishmentthank you for that fewestablishmenti did economics as an undergrad so math is not too far fetched fewestablishmentdo you mean you are a product manager who is currently pursuing data science fewestablishmentis not statistics also required for data science raharth only my personal experience i got applications for a single position within days the first arrived in less than a day itiskaro all of my friends that are graduating with masters in data science this year in the us are saying that they sent over applications so far and got zero responses i only know people that got an offer and they both knew someone at the company they applied to this is what i would consider a good beginning for data science statisticsr probability distributions basic manipulationsr statistical summaries univariate and bivariater hypothesis testing confidence intervalsr linear regressionr r linear algebrar basic understanding of arranging data in vectors and matricesr operators matrix multiplication r r calculusr limitsr basic differentiation and integration at least of polynomialsr r information theory discreter entropy joint entropy conditional entropy mutual information liko yeah currently a pm working on a masters in ds i will probably stick with pm work but look for pm roles in the analytics and ds spaces raharth i do not distinguish between algebra analysis and statistics to me all is just math but yes you need all three of them miketythhon maybe it is easy apply that is the problem cocodirichlet what shit is this op has a ba in econ and a grad degree in data science data science is not principally applied math how about narrowing a business problem doing research design how about figuring out potential business decisions and recommendations insights from any empirical results and conveying that to a team stakeholders etc raharth honestly not sure why you are downvoted all you mention is necessary and not even exotic fewestablishmentis there are reason you do not want to pivot to become a data scientist itiskaro could be or the tech layoffs make it harder to find any jobs this year raharth all important stuff but i you wanna do more than just applying some libraries you need to understand the math i see that in colleagues of mine they even have a cs background but little to no math and they fail to understand why certain algorithms do not work on certain problem or what causes artifacts they see in the predictions edit i work in this field for more than years by now so i am reporting only on my personal experience and i am also responsible for recruiting so to those downvoting it would be nice to share your experience and where you disagree might have more impact than you think on the next hiring d liko i kind of want to keep my options open i am fairly new to pm the pay is good and i generally like it as far as ds i was accepted to the program shortly after becoming a pm but decided to stick with it because it is something i have wanted to do for a while had things gone differently i would have definitely taken a hard pivot anyway i really do not see it as an either or situation and i think you are counselor is sort of right about your sale experience but that should not stop you from doing what you want your sales background could help you with business aspects in a ds position my recommendation is do the ds stuff if you get bored or burnt out pivot into a ds pm role fewestablishmentthanks all the best to you",

  "renokarchnmy so there was this entire world not but years ago where basically every job was in person with the exception of executives consultancy and a few lucky devs that world started many centuries ago and people fucking hated it they spent tens of thousands annually just to travel to the office thousands annually on shitty fast food because their commute did not afford them time to meal prep before hitting the morning traffic jam they had to buy clothes wash them iron them every morning take them to the dry cleaner get them tailored all so they could look like year olds at the junior prom or old men in clown suits they developed respiratory conditions from moldy ac systems that were last serviced before you were born and disintegrating ceiling tiles snowing fiberglass and homasote powder all over their desks they had to stand in unison and recite company slogans they had to attend team building training exercises while wearing poorly fitting embroidered polyester golf shirts from lands end on fridays they could wear jeans sorta it was always highlighted that jeans were a privilege once in a while they were served cheap pizza from some rando place that gave hr a discount oh and bulk costco ice cream tubs do not be lactose intolerant vegan or halal and you get a reward they got fat the developed blood pressure issues they developed cholesterol issues they missed their family they missed their hobbies they missed their friends they sat in the car in traffic more than they held their lovers or their children in their arms all for what the mbas idea of professional relevance so they could be chastised and patronized by some shitty ego maniac middle manager meh it is infinitely better now that is has been normalized to be remote all that remains is some homogenizing of compensation across all locations so we are not stuck choosing between income and affordable housing which honestly will never transpire few if you really want an in person job look at government or defense positions macornvidia in person is overrated go build yourself a healthy work life balance and utilize the luxury of remote work clanatk my company uses data scientists

go back to remote once everything calms down my manager who likes remote work thinks it is all bullshit as well mizmato these blanket policies are pretty bad for morale i wish that managers who actually interact with ics on a daily basis could set the office requirements colorlessgreenidea people can be trained via screen shares slack channels etc we are not all going back just to make something slightly better for a small minority of people who would only marginally benefit from it in first days anyway guilty good for you fight for remote for as long as you can im speaking from strictly an american perspective and can forsee a world where the large firms are in office days a week my employer iswhich is why i am leaving for a smaller org with remote but i am sure smaller scrappier firms will poach talent by offering wfh i have not enjoyed my brief stints in banking and would definitely not advise it from a cultural or tech perspective to anyone in data science but i likely ended up working on a poor product guilty i absolutely agree but with the banks dimon moynihan and solomon have made their opinions known they are not going to allow their offices in top real estate markets nyc london singapore etc sit empty they are vehemently anti wfh and are fostering a culture of they ca not fire you if your ass is at your desk it is incredibly short sighted of them it is objectively less effective and more interruptive to do everything over zoom in a learning environment in any case this is not about forcing you to do anything i am simply saying there is nowhere near consensus that nobody wants or will benefit from in person collaboration metalibro it is certainly an interesting dynamic where smaller companies offer even more flexibility but certain teams within large companies get more flexibility than other internal teams",

  "hogebifneond use github more try building something with a friend read the free pro git book learning git is easy and not worth stressing over making contributions to open source is also a great way to fine tune your skills but you should have a pretty good handle on git before doing so otherwise it will be a discouraging experience renokarchnmy i feel like the basics are enough if your team needs more than that yall have some bigger issues going on that would require googling anyways just use it for all your homework and group projects tijdvoorpils i recommend this interactive tutorial as introduction think someone from the sub created it colibriweiss on learning the theory of git i echo the suggestion of the git pro book complete and very well explained the practice is more of a social convention based on what you know in theory contributing to open source is good to learn some of those but it can ve quite shallow since the code owners will control the aspects that makes a big project tricky in gh you will spend more time learning about the codebase itself than git and you should do it primarily if you care want to contribute to the project a tutor can be very helpful imo you will eventually learn more in the job and there is not a single way of working with it in large projects so it is normal to need some adaptation time beneficial sky if it makes you feel better i have gone my entire career without using github i am taking an intro course now lol biogeopaleochem one of the best experiences you can have as a junior ds is to do a live pull request merge request session with another person just having someone show you how to tweak your code or format it etc can be extremely helpful but beyond that just try sticking to the general git workflow to learn the basic rules marcusesses this is a good interactive tutorial that teaches the git basics i think there is an installation required but it is pretty short so you can always uninstall when you are done solvermax find an active open source project in an area that interests you and contribute to it bug fixes testing documentation etc puehlong imho git is not rocket science and most of what you need is stuff you google when you need it i have been using versioning control tools for almost years now and i still have to google most of what goes beyond pull checkout b add commit and push because i almost never need more than that apart from that it is good to understand why you use branches why and how you organize software with versioning control and how this plays into ci cd principles try this for starters bezoomychellovek lots of helpful answers here but just wanted to clarify that git and github are not the same git is a version control system that can be used locally without github github is a code storage service with excellent git integration and tools acceptable milk use it you all are great i am honestly glad i posted about this in this particular subreddit i really appreciate the advice what would be considered a good handle exactly i have built something with peers and friends but it seems like small repositories are not nearly as sophisticated as larger collaborations this is what i have been doing thanks yes this makes me feel better lol yeah this is a great point and i want to be clear actually i understand basic git commands but i think what is overwhelming for me is github and some of their integrations for collaborations for example i do not understand hooks bezoomychellovek gotcha i see the mistake a lot so just wanted to be sure",
  "true and it is not just on linkedin shadowsurge do not listen to this guy he is just a fake reddit expert you can trust me i wrote a medium post about how chatgpt is coming for every job except mine bikeskata generally my heuristic is that people who tell you it is hard know what they are talking about people who tell you it is easy do not it may sound gatekeep y but you never see mds or engineers saying you can learn to do this in weeks and you certainly would not take your family to an md who went to an week medical bootcamp tvicker often they have a non data science background and very little experience working as a professional sounds like of r datascience commenters ah yes the infamous backdoor fork by copy pasting the code over to a fresh repo chandaliergalaxy there was that one guy who was leading an ai ml school but then got caught having plagiarized other people is work cannot remember his name but it was already a while back edit it was siraj raval artgor that is why you should subscribe to my newsletter with the best information about ai hit the like button right now you will become the best in no time s k seriously as someone that is starting what is the difference entropyrx this applies to pretty much any topic i think the finance influencers self proclaimed experts are even worse it is important to differentiate between those who are in a given industry data science software engineering ai from those who are in the attention economy anyone on youtube or social media is by definition competing for your attention most of them never even worked professionally in the industry a very few of them have some actual experience but regardless of what did or did not do their incentive is now having your attention so they can monetize with ads and or selling you courses it is the attention economy the fact that you learn anything useful is not a direct business metric they have to care about unfortunately selling shovels when people are digging for gold is often more profitable than digging i think scammers such as siraj raval should have already taught people how the data science space is full of smoke and bs one thing about chatgpt it is really brought the influencers out of the woodwork timely cupcake met a girl on a night out who said she worked for tik tok asked her what she did and she said machine learning thought that was a weird way to describe the job then i asked her if she used r or python and she called me a dickhead and walked away i feel proud to have a job that people lie about doing toastenjoyer i agree for the most part people selling courses upsell what can be achieved with what they are selling however i think it is important to stress that data science is not the hardest thing in the world many people i know that work in academia life sciences are completely intimidated by this stuff but actually could learn a lot of it pretty quickly at least enough to apply some methods to their current position for this reason i always react badly to posts that emphasize the importance of intense academic training as a prerequisite to applying any data science tools people who are already insecure might misinterpret the message and reinforce their pre existing insecurities that the material is too hard for them in many cases this is not true influencers care more about the titles and know they can make more money selling the playbook to land big tech ds jobs and really that is all they need expert to them does not mean shit so they are going to use those titles to further their bank accounts pnwuncleiroh be careful with ai influencers marketing themselves as data scenarists or data experts just saw a video titled how to learn python fast using chatgpt honestly these content creators will sell their soul to the devil to make trash that can be consumed by a majority of the community like fast food chains rudescheduleany recommendations for quality numpy and pandas tutorials i have been reading through the documentation but i personally learn better watching examples than reading concepts giuswestside from experience i would say that even people with a good and long professional background can make shitty paid content professional bar lol bro it is just a job just land in the space as a data analyst data engineer data scientist mle software engineer in a data team and work your way around things feel for what you like i took all these machine learning algorithms big data and distributed systems classes none of them really help in the real world survivorship bias maybe just get a job in the space and navigate from there based on what you like my expert advice boom ladywinterbear well then how hard is it to actually be a data scientist a lot of people do make it out to be easy honwave very true witty check basically all influencer platforms these days alarmingbookif anyone falls for these you deserve to be scammed mrrqaz and it is defo going to get worse over the coming years open respect why u need someone else to teach you i believe in self learning thefriendlyfaceplant yes it is obnoxious their follower count is only huge because they share flashy videos about wouldata visualised as beams of light flowing through society it is an esoteric cult that has never seen let alone worked with even just a simple database almeldin ai experts how to make money from chatgpt they are scams oldenoughtodrink totally agreed also on top of this there are many things to be careful about like someone can get an online ds degree and claim graduated from cs master

with stock planetpudding on a similar note lex fridman is seen as the ml ai expert on youtube yet i have never seen him go past college freshman level of understanding of it jsweetienerd the doctor i see only spent weeks to get their md oh wait years i meant years chandaliergalaxy data science is a different animal though you can be a domain expert scientist who learns algorithms and programming on your own maybe more than weeks but then actually become a true data scientist but what is often missing is the algorithms part there are a lot of scientists who can code in python r etc but are able to program a script to call a bunch of popular libraries but often do not understand the algorithms to rationalize their choice in a new problem where there has not been someone who is done something very similar before their pipeline is then often heuristic and lacks what i would refer to as elegance to some extent with real world data beautiful models just do not work and you have to cobble together some combination of tricks but often the people without proper training either through formal education or self study start cobbling together these tricks from the outset and miss out on the more general solution delicious view not to be gatekeepy either but this is why i suggest that masters or phd in stats maths cs ds from a top university almost should be a requirement for public sector or consulting firm data scientists i still think and suggest that one can learn and do data science without degrees though it is just for those senior professionals who are entrusted to provide advice or guidance should perhaps be formally educated cytokinestorm does it count if i have hacked together shitty python scripts for bioinformatic workflows entotres i am curious to all the self proclaimed gatekeepers in this thread what exactly qualifies as a data science background rudixor whole repo initial commit and to make it look not that suspicious some editing of the readme in the other few yeah i know some people save their work like this but you still see it rudixor not sure if the r or python question was the reason maybe she just does not date nerds like us i understand why we are being called nerds but dickhead seriously i do not have a clue about why asking about programming languages could offend people this to me is really a nice topic to break the ice then i asked her if she used r or python and she called me a dickhead and walked away well that is pretty fucking rude i get asked this all the time and usually answer with what i am working on and how much i have been using each language recently minimaxir no that is just being condescending rudixor agreed data science is not a magic skill that only few chosen ones can learn but it is also not something you can learn in a few weeks toastenjoyer if you are looking for good advice look for experts with a clear professional track record several years academic publications or talks at industry conferences and articles blogposts about specific expert topics i do not agree with this say you want to learn how to apply a certain method you have a colleague who uses it pretty regularly it can be very helpful to ask them how they do it and to watch them do it a few times that colleague does not need to be an expert on the method they just need to have a good understanding of how it is applied and be able to communicate that clearly do you have a link i wanna see this ruskihaxor years at google and years at amazon all in data science thundergolfer if you get career and technical content from instagram you are a megafool idenowl and twitter last time i saw an expert who sells his own training he tweets goodbye machine learning welcome ai really lol nailedit i do not doubt the man is qualifications since he has a phd works as a researcher for mit and worked for google with ml but his target demographic is probably not people who already have experience in the field not as lucrative of a market why would he discuss complicated stuff when that would negatively affect his audience is ability to learn from and enjoy the podcast saufundlauf only thing i have seen him do at any level of competence is simp for elon musk most overrated tech influencer imo not counting actual scammers like siraj of course itsmestp_ the dude is not selling degrees or lessons he is interviewing some people that are experts on some fields so i do not think you can include him as a paradigm astrdeca did you not bother looking up his publications at all he is first author on over a dozen papers in ai research with hundreds of citations why do you think he was invited to lecture at fucking mit in the first place cthorrez he taught ml classes at mit before he got mainstream popular he definitely understands it but does not ever talk details in the podcast because he wants to have a mainstream audience edit since this post was downvoted i thought i would add some proof here are lectures he gave in and covering rnns and backpropagation through time and reinforcement learningq learning are roughly at the level of sophistication as i had in my senior undergraduate and masters level coursework in ml definitely more than freshmen know forfooinbar do you think he just brought the coffee every day and they let him slap his name on them cytokinestorm self learning is valid and if you can do it shows that you have impressive skills worth being paid for but yeah structured formal training provides a really strong basis for working in the public sector or similar ipsocranius missing a few viable degrees but otherwise a good heuristic tvicker i do not know i am in this too tvicker how to start bioinformatics tho you arrive to boston and bioinformatics starts you limebabies having been paid for data skills instead of a student timely cupcake explain professionaltopi actually agree in this context you are double checking that she actually uses certain programming languages honestly people do this with me in my field all the time usually from dudes and it can get a little irritating when they do not take me seriously i know you mean well but sometimes there are other ways of answering and being polite rather than testing them rudixor absolutely maybe it was a bit missleading what i wanted to say is more targeting inexperienced people who do not have any colleagues if you have personal contact to coworkers or friends it is even better if a colleague uses a certain method regularly dosent that make him an expert of applying that method needlzor you have a colleague who uses it pretty regularly it can be very helpful to ask them how they do it and to watch them do it a few times that colleague does not need to be an expert on the method they just need to have a good understanding of how it is applied and be able to communicate that clearly i disagree on this because i have seen a lot of people both in academia and industry doing stupid shit just because that is how they were taught how they have always done it and because it has not failed spectacularly yet one should definitely seek experts whenever possible yu go pristine test it just pops up there man crazy recommendation system and advertising not that i follow any such content creators there any suggestions how can i limit that ummyeahok_ i get interview tips on instagram but more like questions to ask the interviewer and how to negotiate salary etc those have been useful but most general job advice does not translate well to technical fields minorcontribution is that really the case i do not use instagram so i do not really know what it is like but i am on r cscareerquestionseu and is reddit that much better than instagram i think as long as you remember the source it is very possible to get value and insight from sites like this loaderd works as a researcher for mit did this get verified i skimmed a few of the threads that followed taleb is comments but did not really get bother to follow up past that target demographic is probably not people who already have experience in the field it used to be before he became a joe rogan orbiter the early episodes of the ai podcast before he renamed it were really good and he used to take feedback really well like when he removed siraj raval is episode when people pointed out that he was a scammer and an academic fraud planetpudding phd in computer engineering not ai he lectured a few times at mit on a introductory deep learning winter class weeks not saying he is not smart but he does not seem to be the expert in ai he and other influencers make him out to be maxtothej people do that because to get the most out of the guests curt jaimungal does it for his guest planetpudding he was and has been shilling tesla for a number of years minderbindercapital he is selling a brand which he uses to sell products mainly athletic greens which is partially owned by joe rogan part of his brand is being an mit lecturer and research scientist which is technically true but not as impressive as it seems when you really start to dig planetpudding did you only a handful of those at best are actually ai related most of them are pages long with half of them being images there is a reason multiple actual credited experts have called him out as being fake planetpudding kim kardashian is also a first author of a scientific paper with the second being an actual mit grad who do you think did the heavy lifting tothepointe you were interrogating her about the tools of her job asking very basic questions while on an evening out it is not the appropriate time or place minimaxir unlike on reddit social media no one in real life actually wants to play the python or r game and it implies that they are not a real ml engineer if they give the wrong answer which is indeed condescending especially to a woman in tech who has likely received the same questions for years if you are genuinely interested in what a random person is doing in ml and not just setting up a trick question ask them what do you do for work which will likely answer your predispositions anyways toastenjoyer i see your point my point is that there are many more people who know how to reasonably use a linear model than there are people who have a track record several years academic publications or talks at industry conferences and articles blogposts discussing them most statistical techniques are tools that are used by practitioners many of these people could reasonably show someone how to apply these methods despite not being someone who themselves develops new methods so her insight is you have to ask the ai very specific questions to get good answers sure i can do that based on my knowledge and experience that came from learning the stuff the hard way thundergolfer right i said get when you should have said seek not much you can do if instagram does not offer a stop showing this topic option minderbindercapital he is a contract research scientists there basically he is affiliated with the university but he is not a professor there or anything he also said he worked for google but there is little time before he graduated and started working for mit medylan lecturing at mit is a badge of expertise in the subject in my book i would not expect classes at the undergraduate degree to be done by someone who has a phd in ai or ml either just having a masters in cs or ce is often more than enough if you then get up to speed with the literature but i agree that he is not something we would call an expert in ai he is about as much of an expert in those fields as i who is seen as a wizard by the marketing team at my company saufundlauf yeh constantly simping for everything musk itsmestp_ did not knew that astrdeca lol way to move the goal posts i have never seen him go past college freshman level of understanding of it to his papers are not long enough try harder citation i need it forfooinbar a machine learning model given that that paper was auto generated is full of nonsense and was written to highlight predatory journals that accept anything but yes that is the same thing as someone with two dozen serious papers citations and different co authors all apparently colluding to help boost fridman is image by adding his name to their papers in the event he one day became famous timely cupcake would it be condescending if a lawyer met another lawyer and asked did they work in defence or prosecution or the guy simply wanted to be social and build a conversation its not r vs python its just asking what she is doing to keep talking timely cupcake based on your reddit karma i doubt your judgement on how best to conduct a conversation in a nightclub smoking area i asked python or r because i was genuinely interested its not often you meet a girl in a bar who works in the same field at that time i would worked in the industry for month and was trying to learn as much as possible from my limited experience speaking with people in other companies it is the question i ask anyone who says they work in ml regardless of gender most say python some say r some say sas only one person has called me a dickhead i found out later that night she works in marketing i doubt i have as much data science experience as you but deducting i was being condescending from a short reddit comment seems like overfitting make content make money loaderd he is a contract research scientists there i get he has a faculty page but where does it state he is currently on their research team other than a static directory page it does not seem that he is had active publications at all in the last years generally like lex but it is hard to find proof of a lot of claims maxtothej a it is a badge of some expertise but not necessarily ml bwinter courses are not like regular mit courses a lot of special courses by guest lecturers happen then things like bot competitions ect it looks like his nitch is less ml and more human driver interaction minderbindercapital pretty much anyone affiliated with university can teach those courses am i an expert if i give a talk in the mit parking lot and write lectured at mit on my resume medylan most classes at university are taught by phds even lecturers at much lower ranked universities than mit are phd holders and faculty definitely are planetpudding it is literally the same point but okay a page paper with of them being pictures is something you would expect from a undergrad student not a postdoc mit researcher tothepointe yes especially judging from the way you communicate if you are on a night out they may not be wanting to talk about work or maybe they made it up but either way who cares when it is not a business setting people use what do you do as a way of sizing people up and deciding how much respect they will give them lordskellig based on your reddit karma i doubt your judgement on how best to conduct a conversation in a nightclub smoking area this is an even bigger hot take lol tothepointe based on your reddit karma i doubt your judgement on how best to conduct a conversation in a nightclub smoking area excuse me what minderbindercapital yeah i am not sure i know he got slammed for publishing a paper praising tesla is autopilot which mit made him take their name off of he later took the study off his website too fair enough but it is common enough for a class to be taught by someone without one that i would not automatically expect it and i see it as evidence that someone does not need a phd to be qualified enough to teach at the undergraduate level astrdeca jesus do you really work in this field timely cupcake grow up i was making conversation where i come from people say what do you do as a way of avoiding an extended silence in a conversation prestigemaster the dickhead said based on your reddit karma i doubt your judgement on how best to conduct a conversation in a nightclub smoking area now tell me about the car you bought that was on display in a casino loaderd hey just wanted to follow up that i appreciate your engagement with my questions and the answers you provided thanks for the discussion planetpudding alright bud i obviously hit a nerve when i went after your daddy sorry you are so gullible tothepointe you do not sound like a pleasant person to interact with maybe you need to reflect on that and it might explain why someone called you a dickhead tothepointe oh i have been waiting for years or since yesterday for someone to ask me about my saturn minderbindercapital any time none deleted timely cupcake fair enough maybe i am just a dickhead ruskihaxor i think you might find a mirror extremely beneficial prestigemaster haha i asked you yesterday as a reply to your comment but you must have missed it about to read the story now thank you planetpudding awww how cute look at you lurking through my history desperately looking for something to discredit me and it went fine ig i graduated tothepointe it is what it is tothepointe the casino car part was not as interesting as the buying process they also did not want to tell me exactly where it was lest i decided to go down and tell people to keep their greasy fingers off my new car haha",
  "thegreenbackpack the best story i have is one of malicious compliance employees were asked to self report task time over the course of the year sample size it was the most consistent data i had ever seen in my life all the employees in their own ways were logging the exact same times every day it was some of the tightest clusters i have ever seen statistically which shocked me because for self reported i expected it to be all over the map no person ever had a single time entry over standard deviation from their mean in this case the data was so good that it was bad pandasiloc a lot of companys data infrastructure is like this unfortunately even in faang the problem in general from what i have seen is that data engineering is both often siloed away from data science and also seen as a cost center rather than a profit center so in many cases the people responsible for data management both a have very little understanding of how the data they are in charge of is actually supposed to be consumed and b are not paid enough to care i think about half of my meetings these days as a ds lead is just talking to de it is a lot of back and forth with me desperately trying to figure out why it is so hard to get simple sales data and them trying to explain to me that they need to update their arcane processes involving different tables with slightly different names with zero documentation explaining the difference purplebrownupdown it takes a lot of effort to setup consistent and stable data pipelines that is why data engineerings is such an important part of ds the analysis is most often the east part the hard part is getting the data into a matrix or tabular form where you can just hit a button and plot regressions and correlations there is not enough talk or perhaps even awareness of data governance and data management practices so many says they are or want to be a data driven organization yet most are so very archaic chaotic and backwards smh data captured by a machine is generally good for example web pages anything captured by a person inventory is always terrible i work across many clients one of them weeks ago couldnt tell me how much money they made every week they eventually pointed to a monthly roll up from a intelligence vendor which they used for their assumption of revenue this is a company you have heard of they have a brand awareness they are hands down the worst but for the most part they are all pretty bad semantic satiation garbage in garbage out perfect data is a unicorn but data engineering teams can strive to reduce as much error as possible in data usually a company will hire a data scientist when they actually needed a data engineer or dba first do you have many data engineers on your team the whole process of data also need to be cyclical without a data scientist or analyst digging into the data and finding issues then you would not know if your data is garbage there should be a healthy eco system where issues you find are fed back into software and engineering teams but that is a culture which is difficult to foster i used to work for a candy manufacturer they wanted me to just do a basic sales data analysis descriptive statistics and the data they gave me was hundreds of pages of handwritten invoices i had to manually input all the data by myself in order to do any analysis they called it the first step of the digitalization of the company i resigned within a few months ticktocktoe ranges from atrocious to awesome i tend to think of data in buckets historical static data this is a mess probably collected over some extended period of time different ways different people data collection methods changed etc could be stored in any kind of format sometimes across formats etc this data is a nightmare but often a big part of any organization often your best bet is to approach this with a lot of cleaning prep understanding simple statistical analysis and a lot of caveats new evolving data this data is where you want to play its new and hopefully being collected at a much higher rate things like customer transactions sensor data satellite imagery etcthe most important thing is that you can guide how this data is collected stored documented oh we need a new feature lets start collecting that and can often be decoupled from business processes that create shit data to begin with unfortunately you are never going to get away from type and is usually integral to adding value but the more you can dip your toes into type the better off you will be pretty good because it is my responsibility to make it good my current position senior data scientist actually advertised how bad the data is in my experience many large companies have terrible data infrastructure partly this is because many of the grow through agglomeration and the total obeys no over arching design have you ever seen an old hospital same thing also the individuals with the authority and money to make changes to the data situation are not the ones writing queries joining tables filling missing values and feeling the pain anonit is never going to be perfect but the key is to work for a place which takes strong ownership of the data pipelines and for which ds has a lot of de responsibility at least for monitoring fixing failing pipelines ramblinginternetnerd data is often alright documentation communication is scary tangentc depends on what data you are looking at broadly speaking we do a good job of keeping a lot of data but we have terrible data governance and things are kind of all over the place and horribly documented there is also a lot of parts of our data warehouse and data lake that are abandoned by people who moved on in their careers and of course nothing is documented at all so knowing how things fit together is all tribal knowledge you do have to always be careful that whatever data means what you think it means but in general it is not that_ bad for a non tech company it is probably one of the better operations in this regard comfortablenut a bit of a rant like i have been discussing with our cfo and cto since they took their roles about years ago much of our data is okay but one piece of it is so bad it is amazing we are still profitable our pos has an interesting feature where when the on hand count of a product goes negative say we sold it before we received the invoice for example the average cost of the item defaults to whatever it says on that invoice and ignores all historical data so for example if there is a price increase or a discount it appears as though we made either much less or much more margin over the life of the item than we actually did so we actually have no idea exactly how much money we made or lost on items impacted by this we can estimate but wo not know for sure i have been relying on the cashflow to guide us since item data does not work get this you can run the exact same report weeks apart and get different numbers same parameters and time frame also our employee records will go years without updates so our employee roster shows about people who still show as active employees and have an active discount and such but have not worked here in years our hr team uses a google sheet i feel like we should not be having these issues as a company with revenue annually slothvibes very very good it is super clean biggest issue is when they change a status type or have a data shift because somewhere in the chain a type was changed and it is no longer coming riffilah i left a job because the data was so horrendous our operations team had a directive from the ceo always a good time to measure how modernized our clients were with out software problem was we did not capture any data on how out clients were using our software what version they were on what extensions they bought etc we relied on the client success people to self report this information further problem was that there was no incentive for the cs people to do this regularly no process and the form was only about required this was emblematic of most processes there i left after months worked at supermarket management company lots of skus it had been undergoing a merger with three different chain stores back end was a mess no clear direction on whose data is correct one chain even still had running if i needed to price check i had to look up on one by one skus became a headache when there is limited edition flavor drinks or the manufacturer changed the sku most items were imported from japan through a third party so you never know when you get a new sku until you crack open that shipping container tchaikswhore yesterday my boss sent me a page pdf of survey responses and asked me to analyze it chzburgerrandy if they had to self report for years would not you expect them to grow weary and begin cutting corners standardizing blocks of time copy pasting previous days or weeks forward be interesting to look at the spread of say the first quarter and last quarter i worked at a place which used data from work orders us data scientists complained about poor recordkeeping by mechanics at some point we were asked to start logging our hours to attribute time to different customers and all of us whined and moaned and kept terrible records the irony longjumpingeggthis has happened to me too now i spend most of the time verifying that the data being put in our system is true regular is that possible standard deviation contains of the population what about the remaining of points they should be outside stdev witty check mangeytrashpanda i had this exact conversation today which inspired this post lol grish_ it really do be like that always huehuehuehue bullcitypicker sales data required for compensation is pretty good mrbrambles machine collected data still needs a human to name it plenty of good data used incorrectly lol does this candy manufacturer happen to be a chocolate factory okvermicelliis data engineering more valuable these days i am still undergrad and considering both ds and de thegreenbackpack would not you expect them to grow weary and begin cutting corners standardizing blocks of time copy pasting previous days they started doing that almost immediately on their own which made it super funny which is why i shared i was asked to do the analysis after i came in and they had been doing it for a year already then they were asked to stop doing it like that and they did not i got a good kick out of presenting that data panshrex this assumes normality which is almost certainly not the case with the variable in question undeadprospekt required for compensation doing some power lifting here gartlas anecdotal but from my experience from talking to recruiters lately and my recent experience job hunting its definitely less saturated data science was the new sexy thing for a while all companies decided they needed data scientists now lots are waking up to the fact they have bad data and bad infrastructure and are upgrading their systems and processes the recruiters i spoke to had a lot of data engineer roles and not enough people to fill them the process of extracting the appropriate information from varied data sources filtering on this joining with that is more important than ever data repositories have only grown and there is a large and growing market for secondary data sources whether this translates into jobs with the title data engineer is another question in my experience it has much more often been the case that data scientists are expected to know how to do such things also i notice a rise in tools like alteryx which are intended to take up some share of this effort thegreenbackpack you are going to have to do data science analysis and engineering in any of the at some point no matter which way you slice it most companies just get data guys girls slap a title of data insert name and make you do it all",
  "quaxi_ write sure this is cool but how does it make us money on a post it and put it on your monitor repeat enough times until you are a senior ds none deleted mrtickle management consulting case studies drakkur best way to get business knowledge is working as an analyst avoid purely reporting analyst positions for finance or operations departments they will have pretty board purview of the business and you will get a good sense of what are key drivers and how to make impacts you will have access to data as well which can give you the ability to do some independent discovery my background is economics so i had teach myself the cs part of ds but the econ education helped me acquire a board knowledge of how businesses run regardless of the industry they are in wignerville i am not sure how to do it as a student or by courses but i would recommend to get a role were you work really close to the business or your stakeholders so avoid centralized teams as they in general have less interaction with the business taguscove the overlap between challenging data problems and business impact is surprisingly unrelated estimate the money impact of each major effort probability of success x revenue made cost saved pain averted be likable practice listening engaging in small talk remembering personal details small office gifts empathize and understand your boss is problems and motivation she is facing many and your ability to align your work to these is personally and organizationally important aaquad there is a lot of context dependence in different business domains but i think the fastest way to grow is to always consider tradeoffs we want to lower prices but then we do not make a profit we want to give our users this function but then the ux is too confusing push lever a what does button b do space ish in very brief any project whether ds or swe or even creating a manual process begins with business analysis how do you learn this identify stakeholders start asking questions lots of questions also documentation and background reading then comes the science part in ds what is the business problem what is the hypothesis what can you test and measure again go into review with stakeholders if you think you are in the right direction work on a proof of concept get feedback build incrementally milkmanbran the way i learned business is finding a company and asking how do they make money rinse and repeat a few times and you are at the very beginning of learning about business will you know a lot no but you will know what kind of things companies focus on prestigioussorthm so i would think of it a little different you do not want to be a ds that is good but does not add value as you likely know our role is to solve problems and or address questions but there are some questions you should keep in mind so that your work drives value why is this a problem understand the problem and its context a main reason why domain knowledge is crucial do you actually understand the problem well enough including context if not this is the first to grow in your business skills when a problem is surfaced how well can you understand it and describe it in its simplest form are you being presented with a problem or is this possibly a symptom of an underlying problem what factors could be affecting this problem why was this problem brought upunderstanding the audience what is the motivation for this question problem being brought up what is this stakeholder measured by what is sucess in this company you cannot approach problems in ds fully ignoring the motivation for why this person team deemed it a problem as it will guide your work each analysis has an audience you do not need to work on validating their thoughts but you need to always strive for discovering something of value to your audience and communicate your findings in a way your audience will understand this is often severely lacking in school projects so what assessing the value of your analysis any work you do should pass a so what test you should aim to guide your audience on what is the potential implication of your learnings and should be preparing for this during the entire project this framework can be applied to any problem in any domain but seeing problems as these full narratives where you can visualize your stakeholder your audience and can guide and provide value will help you in the business side of the equation you can start looking at big picture cases for examples cnbc and vox do great short youtube videos addresingly seemingly random questions eg how did starbucks win in italy the secret behind amex rewards and they break them down well so you can understand why decisions are made subscribing and seeing those could really help get you get in the right state of mind if you have a very specific area you want to work in then diving deeper into that domain will be helpful but if not iterating on your approach for handling unknown problems with a bias for actionable insights will make you better in business once you are looking at roles if you see a term in a job description you do not know look it up eg okr kpi swot analysis churn if you have the opportunity to take an intro to economics class or any other way to learn basic economics take one because there are pretty big ideas that almost all businesses implement in some way supply and demand opportunity cost and more colibriweiss define business business means industry knowledge you learn that on the job krasnomo internship at a startup you will learn a lot really fast tarneks business portion is more or less how to be a business consultant you need to understand the business practices in field while some say its hard it is not for example if you work in fintech you need to understand financial concepts like risk management value at risk etc these are more or less topics that you can learn in the domain you will be in if you go into medicine you need to understand medicine that more or less starts on the basis of where you want to specialize pick an industry you like and build knowledge by reading stuff associated with it pentinumlol i did not specifically study business but sort of pick it up on the job with the nature of business you need to spend a lot of time just reading or listening to a wide variety of topics ex listen to expert talk about finance taxes entrepreneurship etc this helps you to place yourself in your manager is shoes when assesing the impact of your project however you do not necessarily need to have a strong business domain knowledge when trying to start as a ds as your employer also does not expect that of you when you are starting out it is not really that used either just make sure to use logic and proper reason thinking when working it is not business it is subject matter expertise pertaining to a specific business like if you work in finance doing ds work you need to know finance i am in healthcare what separates me from another ds is my knowledge of hospital operations quality improvement projects and metrics and other healthcare specific data you learn this by having experience first and foremost a very distant second way is a degree or book pertaining to that field i have an mph then i worked in healthcare and then did my ds degree same path could apply for any industry a good analyst can work extremely efficiently with a ds without industry knowledge as long as the ds is open to learning from an analyst and not like some bozos we have making posts here lately not directed at you op i will maintain until the end of days the best path to a well versed subject matter expert working as a ds within any sector is experience as a data analyst whopoopedinmypantz should probably go back and get a bachelors in econ i think it is good to network have coffees or shadow your stakeholders other teams and departments and learn about what they do and how if applicable they use your result aniruddhmaitra most clean advice two months into my first data job and i have seen empathizing with my client is problems and asking them as many questions as possible and making them talk about it feels like the way to go a business therapy sesh you might say lmao robinhoodtis i think this is a very good response maybe we can add marketing to the list as well wouldoge tha kid underrated answer good practice for communicating technical topics in a general business context anygeologistnot just asking questions but asking relevant ones lwlbr general business know how how they work how they profit which methods are applicable to which areas etc whopoopedinmypantz loljk watch some youtube videos about write offs bad debt reserves and accounts receivable push back analyst here not ds so i might be off when people say math stat cs business knowledge for the business knowledge bk part they do not always mean you need to understand accounting marketing finance economics i feel sure you need to understand the basic functions of these departments but a basic intro business class is enough to turn you loose what they mean by bk is that you a understand your industry domain knowledge b understand how to work with users that have no experience manipulating data they are going to make requests that if you follow to the letter will not satisfy their final needs the way to solve a is to spend time in one industry and to work with a lot of users and ask them a lot of questions about their day to day the way to solve b is often harder for technical people you have to manage expectations you have to ask what they have tried before and why it did not work you have to ask how they plan on using the data in the final iteration they may ask for aggregated data and then last minute tell you they want to put it into a visualization software meaning they needed line level detail and it helps to speak with a certain air of authority to users so they do not start to think they can direct your methods all this to say that beyond a intro level business course bk is only acquired from spending time in the industry and learning how to communicate with users mrtickle i came from mc transitioned into data science very valuable niche highly recommend to anyone with a business facing position or that wants to fast track management positions to look into and learn from consulting resources frameworks etc i think what you are referring to is domain knowledge its difficult to learn this as it often covers a whide field thats the reason why ds is a multidisciplinary field colibriweiss i see but still which business a supermarket a car manufacturer a hedge fund darkhumourfoundhere thats why people say tech may become outdated but domain people are hard to replace you can only learn by being the shoes of them and reading a lot and gain exposure from industry leaders ds with business background here good accounting comes from understanding the standards for reports understanding the business that is being reported the standards are derived from economical theory agency theory and finance covers a lot of it most of the business besides finance is marketing so do not feel obliged to shift your major to any of those areas but learning the why is on those subjects will certainly help out you both build business oriented projects that makes us more money and communicating with business oriented agents how do this make us more money robinhoodtis of course domain knowledge can be best gained by working at the industry however for people trying to break into entry level roles i think learning about basic business concepts on top of technical skills can be the differentiating factor that can get them hired as freshers there is no other way to know about the industry after all if you are just starting out i have seen plenty of data analyst wannabes who only have the technical skills and have no knowledge at all of the most basic eonomics business concepts lwlbr yeah but i think many domains have common points thus a general know how knowledge might be possible to learn lwlbr i wanted to acquire domain agnostic knowledge if possible for example i am an industrial engineering student and what we learn is generally applicable to all domains when i am learning programming practices it is often compatible to what we have learned in production courses by the name it is all production well i know ds in finance and the problems you face there are quite specific to finance thewallie that is the thing though you cannot generally learn domain specific knowledge you are going to have to either restrict your search space or get a job and then learn their domain which is typically how it does the good news is that nobody should expect you to come in with domain knowledge you just have to learn on the job quantpsychguy not saying this to be a jerk but this is the kind of stuff you would generally learn either on the job which is a steep learning curve or with the type of coursework you would get with a business minor in college if you apply yourself an mba would be the best bet but that is unreasonable for most folks in a data space if that is the case i would work on soft skills read some books like how to win friends and influence people business side of things is almost always going to be organization specific because you can have a million different businesses that all have a different business plan it would be impossible to learn them all by focusing on soft skills you can learn to network and by building a network you will always have someone you can go to that will have the answer to your business question",

ols it is as valuable as someone doing it with state of the art dl methods sycokinetic bear in mind people tend to post more about the fancy thing they did one time than all the ordinary things they do all the time so your view is highly biased most projects are best solved with simple data and simple models because they are usually fairly simple problems although perhaps very large and important if you get good at feature engineering and applying simple models using easy to productionize code you will outclass a ton of those ivy league phd is bunchobonus points if you can also successfully

histograms that showed we could get more out of some if else clauses than we would out of ml vagabondclast as a hiring manager for ds teams over last years trust me those profiles have given me chills sometimes and before going into the interview i myself thought if at all i am qualified enough to interview these candidates the fact is everyone wants to compete and win in hackathons and improve the accuracy from to and whatnot but what you need to understand is that most of those projects are based on theoretical data where things are clean already and many ways of solving the problem are available on the net reality is harsh that is not how it happens in real business situations and what triumph there is building consumable explainable and maintainable ds solutions as long as you have done it or can show the interviewers that you have capabilities to do so you should be good braveforeveryou serious of the posts here are people who know nothing if this sub is the standard you are

with causal inference unlike deep learning stuffs i will not be able to compete with those people with phd in cs in deep learning language model etc so i feel like its waste of time for me to learn those things product ds making k and i have never used a deep learning model in my role it is what one delivers for the business and not how complicated the model tool is my senior director would not give a rats ass about the way i implemented something as long as it is done correctly ghostofkilgore just an opinion formed over the years working in academia and ds very often when you get someone spouting a bunch of mumbo jumbo about some seemingly complex stuff it is kind of obscuring the fact that they are not too great at the basics archbishopmo you are good most people with ml buzzwords on their resume spend of their time munging data and training regression models anyway datasnorlax there are some roles usually where the model is the product where tooling with more sophisticated algorithms and getting that extra performance is really impactful but for many business problems there is opportunity cost for spending all of that extra time and computational resources to get that extra boost in performance when instead you could pivot to solving another problem fwiw i have interviewed plenty of candidates who list the kind of credentials you describe who really had no idea what they were doing the stuff you described is covered in many data science boot camps but so many candidates i have spoken to in the past has no clue how they would apply these tools to a real business problem i sometimes get a little self conscious about my unconventional background cognitive science and my resulting lack of experience with more sophisticated algorithms stats etc but my company has made it very clear to me verbally and with compensation increases that they see my work adding value at the end of the day the question is whether your work adds more value than it costs savethepandabears comparison is the thief of joy my friend lifesthateasy i am below average at my job i think but i have picked up some knowledge here and there i completely lack sql skills never used it after uni but yeah python tf pytorch and nlp are things i have used not because i have learned them and know all about what they do but because i was trying to solve an issue and those seemed the best tools so i have read some articles and the relevant parts in the doc afkforlol be careful of impostor syndrome after browsing linkedin profiles you get to paint the light that people see you in and a large portion of their profiles make them seem more impressive than they really are i have declined a job offer to many ivy grads and phds because they can not solve actual real world problems many of the high value data scientists on my team have very unconventional educational backgrounds from no name schools ex telecom engineer physicist translator ui ux engineer wouldgrsmith paraphrasing what others have said you do not need to kill a mosquito with an elephant rifle i have worked with a few very very technically proficient individuals and they fall in love with the possibilities of advanced tools being applied to a particular use case but when you have a nail sometimes all you need is a hammer it is at the very least good to know what could be possible with more advanced tools so that you can a teach yourself to implement them if you have the time and it is worth the effort or b collaborate with someone proficient in that tool the key to good data science though is a firm grasp in being able to ask good questions when presented with a business case propose solid potential methods to answer the question and then be able to interpret the results appropriately either on your own or with a coordinated effort not everyone in the manhattan project needed to be einstein but einstein was on the team so they could leave him to his specialty if you are at a good company there is recognition that science should be a team sport i have been lucky in that when something goes beyond our current team is ability i can demonstrate that the question cannot be answered with simple methods so we will have to take the time to setup the appropriate engineering pipeline and even coordinate with other specialists or consultants to get answers that item rule of thumb always strive to be slightly above average sweetloulamour i am a biometrician for a natural resource agency i think there is enough overlap to qualify what i do as some version of

everything detracts from actually getting your job done wriotreho everyone makes their profiles looks like they are amazing and a needle in a haystack type of thing raharth i feel you i would call myself a all rounder i am one of the few data scientist we have so i need to do everything from infrastructure to data engineering ml data analysis and the whole project assessment the field i know best is reinforcement learning and uncertainty but that essentially has no value in the industry i know many of the tools but there are people with much deeper knowledge than me but they often do not know much about the rest outside of their specialization i think that is what you are missing they all speak about their specialization but yours might be much broader tarehman the best model is the one that is in production and adding value to the company you can have the world is greatest deep learning model with the absolute best accuracy using the most incredible cutting edge technology but if it is not deployed inside the business with the full support pipeline it is simply not that useful the data scientist who wrote a simple random forest but who has an end to end pipeline that ingests shitty business data automatically runs retrains automatically as needed and surfaces the results in the right place via robust technical toolingthat is the data scientist making the biggest impact i think what you describe are at least different jobs i do not describe myself as data scientist because i have not touched sql in a decade i almost never work with structured data i got no idea about spark and business intelligence or whatever i forgot most classic methods but i read a couple papers every week work with diffusion models normalizing flows transformer etc i have to keep up with the state of the art or i will be gone soon i do not tackle new type of data all the time and think about how to work with it or clean it best or whatever i have been working on basically the same problem for over a decade with the same kind of data of course the approaches and application scenarios change the former changed a lot from hundred thousands of lines of c and c to everything is a single neural network basically still i am almost a generalist inside that niche because there are people who are even more specialized there are people who just worked in say applying normalizing flow models to one specific problem for the last years of course i got no clue what they are talking about either i have no answer for you excepti feel exactly the same way i have good math and stats foundations but what i know is such a tiny drop in the bucket of what exists that i often feel like throwing in the towel and going to work at a grocery store only a little bit joking innocentnot i am no expert but hear me out do not compare yourself to others all it takes to be good is to solve a real problem with the available tools and you will be on the path to success even if you create a simple model as long as it saves money or improves a process it is great laughingwalls data science is a very large umbrella term most people specialize in something or another if your job does not involve nlp or huge data science there is no need to be doing something like leveraging your gpu is power or deploying a complicated unsupervised language models a good quantitative analysis person is also someone with an adequate knowledge of stats programming that they can pickup things as they go along not every person has a phd from stanford not every job requires a phd from stanford if anything people are over educated they go to school and learn neural net then job is excel i have known super duper smarty pants people who cannot solve simple problems find what works for you i have

mediocre that applies to doctors surgeons dentists teachers lawyers nurses and data scientists mediocre does not mean bad although around are actually bad what makes the other good the most important thing i think is a belief in your job you have got to be interested in your job and think that it is important in the context of data science that means being genuinely interested in data and believing data is important provides objective truth of course you also have to be technically good at your job but i have not met many people who believe in their jobs who are not technically good at their jobs do not compare yourself to redditors who almost by the mere fact they use reddit puts them in the top they care jjhero people brag but they mostly do ctrl c ctrl v watssgoinon my dude you

about being able to achieve great aucs and building amazing ml models but if the models have no practical business significance they mean nothing improving accuracy by pp translates to how much the point of doing data science is to find solutions to business questions not doing it for the sake of the models no this is a classic reddit example of being confidently incorrect and i am disgusted the

especially correct at many small companies mine will not derive much value from the deep neural nets and tweaking the model from to accuracy at a different large company this difference could be worth millions if it would put them above competition we largely run basic regression models with some multi level models thrown in to the despair of our ds team who drool over fotm gazillion parameter neural nets a lot of ds underestimate how far ahead you can go with decent ds skills but excellent domain knowledge and the ability to communicate and translate results to the senior management due to this it seems i am able to explain our ceo what my simple model means to our clients better than our head of ds on the other hand probably half of my team would be better than me in kaggle competitions marianakl exactly helping with critical business functions is what counts robertterwilligerjr do not compare yourself to others highlight reels comes to mind qpylon my latest big important thing was literally just histograms that showed we could get more out of some if else clauses than we would out of ml i would be curious to hear more about this were you showing off a bimodal distribution and drawing a big red arrow pointing to the obvious decision boundary you do not always find hiring mangers such as you making hiring choices that are the most sensible to the company many of us including seniors in the industry also do not catch up fast enough i particularly find managers tend to hire the ones that could brag about themselves knowing the latest technologies or transformers i sat on that side of the table few times knowing other colleagues having no clues about the details of the models explained by the candidates some would not give a follow up question because they do not know enough and and they do not want to give away they do not know there is some psychology going on then there is a bigger chance they end up being hired also possibly for finding a new guy to replace that existing embarrassing xgboost to stay in fashion footballfanabc and how to convert ambiguous problem how to improve revenue into hypothesis feature product solution hasuteras unpopular data science stuffs bayesian stats and causal inference is causal inference unpopular i ask as my background is squarely within economics worked in policy analysis for years and am now finishing up a phd in economics i have an outsiders interest in data science but do not really know about the industry practices and preferences as an applied economist causal inference is my wheelhouse and am semi tempted to try and leverage it into an industry job in data science after finishing but if the standard econometrics toolkit is not popular then that does not sound too encouraging wignerville i could not agree more causal inference is on the rise there is a lot of good research coming out and it simultaneously becomes more available in terms of packages and libraries itsallkk i can totally relate with you all these sota nlp models gave me enough fomo that i often felt like an imposter so i started focusing on marketing data science with which i could make real business impact and do not feel like crap 0illapplied deep learning actually needs tons of domain knowledge too for example when its used in the biomedical area cs is also taking over causal inference to an extent too with pearl and all and other stuff like causal gan vae footballfanabc can i send my cv to your company meta footballfanabc binary classication woulddanieltan generally nearly everyone is above average jballoonist too true i can write thembut i still have trouble knowing when to use them despite taking multiple courses on them maybe someday it will click oddapplicationyeah but in an undergraduate course you will only get the basic notions of deep learning it actually takes years before you master this subject character i was pretty triggered until i saw the end of the second sentence this is the way sycokinetic pretty much yeah we have got some items that need processing and we need to process them from different perspectives there happen to be just a handful of trivial features that determine how important a sample is and how difficult it will be and as a bonus we can evaluate those features independently thanks to domain knowledge so you plot these things and get something akin to log normal distributions and looking at them in the context of the project is goals you see that the nasty stuff is not important while the important stuff is easy to process so you just write simple logic to separate them simple logic for the important stuff and then just brute force the nasty stuff because you just proved that will not cause any scalability issues the value of course is that we now have data that strongly justifies the simple approach and i do not have to worry about someone coming in later and trying to make me spend a month fighting an ml process that cannot possibly yield enough improvement to be worth the effort wignerville it is not really popular now not too many people knows it at all but i think it will become super popular it is very useful and answers more questions better than a lot of stuff being used at the moment weonlycryalone ignore linkedin and focus on what you enjoy your company needs or what a recruiter says they are hiring for it is not unpopular so much as unknown data science has always been a composite of contributions from multiple fields and i dare say the computer scientists and engineers have a lion is share of the attention because of cloud technologies selling the latest and greatestwhich drives the conversation put another way i can more readily sell my boss on transformers because the pump is primed than i can on causal because that is not as loud of a conversation however for our use cases causal stands out as being able to contribute more to the bottom line boombillys no causal inference is far from unpopular a huge part of data science consists of casual inference prediction tasks are typically ones where the context during the problem is well defined and the decision to make given some outcome is relatively straightforward if predicted class is a then take action b otherwise do something else some business problems are structured like above but there are many arguably more instances where it is important to understand either underlying drivers for something we observe or if some intervention has an effect on the potential outcomes of a population a clear example of the latter is a b testing which many modern data science divisions end up doing after all it is hard to beat an rct but it is also quite difficult to properly set one up there is also plenty of room to use other tools in ci such as near experimental designs and observational studies i think you would be very valuable to the industry none deleted none i am by no means an expert but my impression is that econometrics does more causal analysis than basically any other field if i had to hazard a guess this is because the requisite assumptions are based on theory for the most part rather than statistics statistics are just applied on top of the methods so you see causal inference in econometrics epidemiology and other fields where there is some domain knowledge to base your assessment of what relationships are plausible on hence it will naturally be less popular with more pure statistics cs people but that does not translate to it being less practical if anything it may be a leg up since it is applied by nature but then maybe i have no idea what i am talking about i am half posting this to see whether someone contradicts me hrokrin i think the fallacy that is often projected is that there is a single advanced set of skills that is beyond calculus probability statistics linear algebra a programming language usually python but r is still relevant and some sql i think most can agree those are required to have a seat in the casino but there are a whole lot of different games i knew a former tenure tracked professor who got picked up for a chief data scientist position because he did a deep dive of time series data that would be great unless he wanted to do nlp models and just to be clear i am talking about deeply understanding the topic including the mathematical models underpinning them and not just being use a library or platform so realistically i think you are fine however were i in your position i would look to identify what sort of problems you can solve with your mix of education and interest then i would look for where that intersects with either business problems that are somewhat similar if you are going for the cash or questions that you think you could answer if you are thinking about being the academic daywalker so to speak if you are not already familiar with this take it as word to the wise or perhaps an area to consider monte carlo and monte carlo markov chains from there you have things like applying it to high dimensional linear models which is huge because we say things are computationally expensive but that tends to mean just plain expensive as things scale also i would note the harvard data science initiative calls causal inference out as a specific area of research firm hard hand anyone who says causal inference is unpopular can say that at his own peril the way i look at ml its a giant correlation machine as compared to causal inference though of course its only when you tease out cause and effect do you get a semblance of an operative model of this world wouldgrsmith please share some sources would love a good review article or two to help get me prepared sure but we are not hiring and just did layoffs as you might have heard sorry tier tech meta is tier pre layoffs peanutinthebutter but have you ever been hired on as a program analyst in the government with just an elementary statistics and college algebra background then asked to design a pseudo database in sharepoint lists then turn that into useful project management data i used to want to become a data scientist but god damn its actually sort of satisfying working on the little solutions and developing data culture for an organization that is in its infancy when it comes to data and now i can probably just go learn some math for the funsies you know any good phone apps for learning math useful i find it cool it is definitely on the rise according to google trends although yeah its not all the hype as neural nets at the moment hasuteras honestly depends on your background and level of mathematically capability if you have a good grounding in undergrad maths stats then you cannot beat a good textbook others might be able to offer pointers from their respective fields but econometrics is undoubtedly either woolridge introductory econometrics a modern approach for more undergrad level and woolridge econometric analysis of cross section and panel data for a more senior undergrad or graduate level alternatively if you do not have too much math or stats background angrist and pischke is mastering metrics and mostly harmless econometrics are both good online resources that i have enjoyed using recently have also been scott cunningham is causal inference the mixtape which is available online free and has repro exercises with stata r python code snippets none i am in the same position as you not knowing much but i will share what i have done in case you find it useful i have three textbooks fundamentals of causal inference with r brumback elements of causal inference peters janzing scholkopf causality pearl all tackle relevant topics from very different perspectives statistical rethinking mcelreath also has a lot of content that relates to causal inference im not in a position to give advice but i feel reasonably competent to read newer papers having gone through these books wignerville i agree but it is still unpopular you do not see udemey courses implementations discussions or similar that is comparable to almost anything else related to ml production data engineering and so on that is not the same as saying that it is useless it is just a statement about how widely it is being used prlnoxos search for causal inference and susan athey she has some nice lectures on this topic also take a look at causal inference literature sycokinetic i do not know any apps sorry my starting point is usually wikipedia followed by

  "cocodirichlet if you need a job faster and do not have time to learn a lot of things i would focus on federal jobs if you have us citizenship some do not pay much but others pay pretty well and you might find some in which your domain knowledge is relevant too not just federal government but also national labs the only issue is location because for most you have to be in the dc area a couple of my friends with phd in engineering got jobs in dod cdc etc even before graduation edit you should also look into monsanto they hire many people for data sciencebecause the environmental science aspect another options is that if you are at a university check for any workshops available or pay a computer science graduate student to sit down with you to show you best practices also check codeacademy to improve your coding the issue with your other questions is that it depends a lot on the field and the type of ds job i recommend that you narrow down the type of job that you want the field and even have some companies you like would be a good fit for domain knowledge then do some research into what they require what they do the type of people they hire i would not start learning anything until you are able to figure out what your advantages are and where you would get a job ravingneuroscientist beyond python and sql i would add data cleaning standardization dealing with missing data git version control parallel processing regular expressions for text string data feature engineering is a key skill that is underappreciated and can matter as much or sometimes more than the model architecture see for more info data visualization is even more of a key skill outside of academia a great resource for best practices is learning to work with datasets that do not fit into memory at once via arrow pyarrow in not sure what you meant in terms of scope by training and testing models but time series analysis and forecasting are often valued for business planning dashboards depending on the job spatial data processing and analysis depending on the job also document your code so others and future you can more easily understand what it does and write unit tests for functions you create putting models into production is something that is increasingly being done by ml engineers rather than ds but it depends on the organization and their definition of ds ominousanenome kinda depends on what types of ds roles you are applying for some more statistician type ds roles only test for intermediate coding skills r or python the product analyst type roles often test for sql and maybe a bit of r python most of the ml interviews i have done focus more on theory and have a practical component eg with a toy dataset in jupyter notebooks and coding component typically python but i do not think many expect you to be very knowledgeable about deploying from the onset especially if it is clear that you are coming from research if you want some practice you could use sagemaker or something",
  "itiskaro i work as a data analyst and i have to communicate with business people a lot because they are end users of all of my reports and dashboards therefore if i will not ask them a million questions and gather the requirements right i would have to redo all of my analysis it is true that i can work alone once i have clearly stated requirements but it is also part of the job to gather them and to ask for feedback so i still have to attend a lot of meetings therealtiddlydump i have autism honestly analytics people are generally weird enough that you will blend right in if you have the skills to be a good analyst data scientist you can always work with your manager on good communications strategies to minimize this weakness do not let this one thing about you that you cannot change limit your ambitions recoveringphysicist good communication skills are fairly essential to analytics and data science but i am not sure that a general struggle with communication as an autistic person will automatically make you bad at technical communication as an analyst or data scientist if you have the technical skills and attention to detail to be able to get relevant and correct insights out of data then you are already valuable sufficient communication is a requirement but great communication is just a big value add you might find yourself on a team where communication is one member is strong suit and you have specialised more in ml engineering for example not everyone is great at all the skills in this field it varies regardless of the position better communication skills will help individuals whose roles focus on management of others or communicating results will fare better with improved communication skill raharth as a data scientist a lot imo communication and storytelling is a fundamental skill if you only want to code though i would suggest to go more towards an ml engineer or data engineering position i have worked as both a data scientist and data analyst and will say that communication is very important in this field more so than in other tech fields that i have been a part of a huge portion of your job is to take all of this data and turn it into something that non technical people can understand and use presentations to leadership are pretty normal if you really like data but not the communication aspect you may want to consider becoming a data engineer you get to work heavily with data it is very technical and the compensation is just as good as a data scientist blacksnowboader honestly in this field i think you would be in the majority not the minority being neurodivergent but here is some practical advice if you are struggling to communicate you can always use chatgpt to help wajw data science or data analyst roles can be great for folks who have neurodivergent traits i know several neurodivergent folks in fang companies who do very well in these roles it is a slightly difficult one to advise as everyone is experience of autism is different and different companies roles managers will present different challenges potential communication scenarios in these roles meeting stakeholders to understand the requirements of an analysis in person zoom email chat this can often be urgent and you will likely experience a whole range of pressures from folks with high expectations advising stakeholders on what the analysis should be sometimes they will not know exactly what they want other than give me some numbers that validates what i am going to do anyway this can require an element of informed persuassion this can be tough for anybody let alone people with autistic traits however it is something that can be learnt and over time as you get more confident in your technical skills and subject matter you will find this easier as it starts to feel like less of an argument and more like you are explaining something you find interesting and know lots about to someone new to the subject responding to quick asks one of the joys of these roles is spending several hours getting really stuck in to an interesting problem this can be suddenly ruined by a tap on the shoulder from a stakeholder asking you something technical this situational change can be difficult especially for neurodivergent people presenting your findings to stakeholders this can be daunting but it is often one of the most rewarding parts of ds da i have found that when in these situations the stresses of unstructured social scenarios are not there and it feels much more like nerding out about one is special interest much of these scenarios can be found in many jobs if you have a great team and manage to find a great manager who understands and is willing to help clear roadblocks for you and set clear expectations then these roles can be really enjoyable looking through your posts your written communication does seem very understandable so i certainly would not advise against these roles based on that lassypo you want to be a data engineer dfphd communication is important but the standards are low and that is because a lot of analytical people are generally introverted awkward and in some cases potentially somewhere on the spectrum i have worked with people who were almost surely on the spectrum and they tended to lean into roles that were more technical and where they primarily interacted with a more senior data scientist who did more of the heavy lifting in terms of interacting with businesspeople so if you are considering ds and you want to limit your need to communicate focus on the areas that are more theoretical and that are more geared towards individual contributors working alone inthegale communication is really important however i have found being autistic actually helps in the kind of communication a ds needs we have a lifetime of practice of needing to be super attentive to how we come across and understanding the knowledge base that others are starting from i think this makes explaining complex topics to diverse audiences easier technical communication needs people who make no assumptions are extremely precise with their words and a healthy disregard for social norms autistic people are great at this where i find myself being challenged is in understanding the right level of detail to go to and when to cut to the business use case immediately however i think it is not that hard to get better at this with time and attention sendmepuppy point of da ds is to communicate patterns and info from data better off looking at data eng swe or mle scarlettemaker it really depends on the level of your job and if you report to higher up is for instance my boss will take my reports and keeps asking me for no more then points for her csuite reports because they do not care for little difference i have learned to condense to fit her models but i still provide her my original report and she appreciates that if you are good enough at something everything else is not important if you expect to be in the bottom for smarts expect to spend more time than anyone else the first few years i personally did hours for year and then dropped to i now know the data better than all but a few people in a person company if i switch jobs i will work hours again because i am not smart enough or a good enough speaker to simply coast imacpamd there are many different types of communication even within the verbal realm what is accepted in one industry is totally unacceptable in others so this would vary speaking as someone who made a and switched from finance to medicine entirely different social rules miketythhon try data engineering instead none deleted josiahwalker if it helps my experience is that analysts usually make slide decks while ds also have to present them fantasticquestion so does autism you mean the chat bot right i am not at all familiar with it so out of curiousity how would i use it to help with communicating exactly wow extremely well put it will still take some thought but this post made it sooooo much easier i will certainly look into this thanks marykeay i mean this with kindness but you really need to educate yourself about asd before you make comments like that substitute the word autism with any other disability and you will see why eg everyone in this field has blindness but it was not acceptable to use that as an excuse im autistic and have had a very good career so far but no amount of pushing past it will ever remove the challenges i get from being autistic any more than a blind person is able to stop being blind if they try hard enough what i can do is play up my strengths some of which come from autism and some which are thankfully very useful in technical fields blacksnowboader hey how do i say this insert statement in a professional manner edit given you have this job and you have written this post i am going to assume you know how to speak so the real problem is what to say and when to say it and since i am a believer in automation the easiest and cheapest way to solve that problem is with chatgpt wajw no worries dm if you have any questions none deleted okay that is a really interesting way of handling it that i certainly would never have thought of that would probably really help me when comes to setting up presentations i will keep that in mind thanks marykeay i was not going to reply because there is little point but i am giving the benefit of the doubt just in case autism is not about being able to talk to people and not everyone in data science is autistic you or anyone else reading this may find this link helpful ps if you are autistic and have somehow learnt not to have meltdowns or shutdowns can you please teach the rest of us blacksnowboader i would not have either one of my friends wives is a teacher and she told me she used chatgpt to write a sensitive email to one her students parents about their child is behavior at school none deleted marykeay if you are legitimately disabled my grown nephew is non verbal autistic then of course that does not apply oh so people is struggles are only valid if you say so i see have you tried telling your nephew to try a little harder so he can push past it and grow or you know maybe your experience is not the exact same as everyone else is where i work someone with ageist views and obviously lacking in empathy would not make it past the first interview autistic or not because they would not be a good fit in our team there is more to functioning in society than being able to use words none deleted marykeay ageism and intolerance borne from ignorance are not disabilities you said you can somehow manage your shutdowns lol sure but you cannot manage your ageism that is completely unrelated to autism anyway no point to this i hope you educate yourself and try a little harder so you can push past this and grow none deleted marykeay your point as written was that apparently everyone in data science is autistic lol wut and that people use it as an excuse and that you are apparently autistic but learned to deal with it because yeah that works so well when your brain does not filter out sensory input the same as for the average person eh you are practically a brain surgeon also that it is supposedly overdiagnosed it is not understanding of asd is still evolving and that people under constantly lol tell you they are autistic or whatever see no point in this i hope you never experience autistic burnout though with your superior mental brain surgery apparently you cured yourself anyway but i really really hope you never have direct reports i have already said to the op what i wanted to say so with this i am out",

  "laughingwalls i am a model developer in a bank i think the easiest route is to do that masters degree and then get into a quant risk role at a big bank its pretty easy to hop to that into big tech data science if your at a major bank masters degree is a hard requirement in most banks fintechs and tech firms were actively recruiting from our teams they are the biggest exit oppurtunities for people in the quant risk teams riceecrispy in a pretty similar position to you graduating in finance going into a data analyst job but really want to push into a scientist position was looking into masters in ds but many of them need a technical bachelors going to take some advice from your comments and work on some courses asleep dress i can give you an authentic answer as i did the same and i also work with colleagues who did the same you do not need yet another master is doing a master is is obviously a benefit but it is a huge investment both financially and effort wise i am doing one i am happy for it but it sucks really the most efficient way is probably to do andrew ng deeplearningai courses from coursera they have now a mathematics for ml then the famous machine learning then different versions of deep learning you do the courses put them into your linkedin cv and certificate wise it is enough i believe if you still want to do a master is then cs is less relevant in this field statistics or data analytics or data science or machine learning are the proper graduate courses in this field the most difficult is to start your first data scientist job if you work for a big corporation you can ask for a job visit job rotation this is the best way to do this is how i started too you can also start a project in your current position time series prediction but it is more difficult if you have no experience with time series for this i highly recommend jose portilla or the lazy programmer from udemy cdadydx you could probably invest in a part time program while still working in finance and then eventually transition to a more data science related role you can look into gatech omscs or omsa program or similar ones and to answer the question yeah it would help but of course there are other ways you could go about it which does not involve a ms subjectaddoes your company have a quantitative analyst type of job could make a transition with that as a bridge job to data scientist datanewbie graduated with bs in finance degree worked as an equity analyst for a year and financial consultant for a year and half then i went to graduated school and now i am a data scientist since i had a strong statistic background in college and ap in high school i am easy to catch up with statistical concepts my road map years ago was learning ds concepts through datacamp before attending to graduate school getting a master degree in ds joining competition datathorn hackathorn obtaining a immersive bootcamp getting an internship getting a return offer through intern program above alarmingbookopen to chatting more via dm annonymoussaff this is super helpful thanks eventually i would want to do a masters do you think online has the same benefits as in person for data scientist also how was your career transition from finance to data scientist was comp and career growth much better that is one of the reasons why i am switching i started to feel like finance and banking just was not as functional of a career as finance with tech is also what is your masters degree specialized in tastyanteater is master in economics proper mizmato in many companies they are sometimes the exact same it is a good lead if op is company has a qa position or jr qa position open annonymoussaff thank you did you do your masters degree in person or online is one more beneficial than the other or not really which ds datacamp did you attend is udemy a good option for this my goal is to work for a tech or fin tech company do you know if they also offer master students programs like banking or you would just apply to entry level laughingwalls i would rather not asleep dress i would say a master is in econometrics or actuarian science yes economics is very good as bachelor is degree but it is not enough on the master is level for data science i would rather go for statistics econometrics or actuarian science or data analytics data science degrees or vocational degrees such as financial data science marketing data science etc laughingwalls masters of economics is fine for working ds in finance and probably better than some degrees banks tend to use bread and butter statistics econometrics then things like artificial neural networks you want a masters that is econometrics heavy and that aims to send at least a few people to phd programs in economics these places tend to have better econometrics training datanewbie for career switch i highly recommend attend to a top in person master program to show your dedication which i did take for my career transition does not matter what program do you take you need to have a touch base to know your strengths and weaknesses before the master program start people above did recommend a few datacampcom udemy coursera etc are great to start i used to have a thought that financial background would help me to land a job in fintech companies it is not true because it is good to have a reality is different products of each company are different on board training will provide it as a fintech company standard requires a strong computational programming business acumen are a must for working in its data remember you are a data scientist not product manager nor business analyst technical backgrounds to handle business problems are more important alarmingbookok laughingwalls and you obviously do not know no offense i know a few people with masters degrees in economics who are managing teams of ds at places like american express target walmart or work in actual ds banks like pnc wells fargo or jp morgan asleep dress lol i work in a unit which is specialized in financial time series forecasts for this very reason the majority of my colleagues are economists including myself as a matter of fact i even taught data science for economics students last year at university my students were actually working at jp morgan citibank morgan stanley as interns so thanks i exactly know what economics students are studying and this is why i proposed to get a master is in econometrics statistics actuarian science or econometrics if you take a look at phd program curricula you can see that universities offer phd in economics but inside it they let candidate specialize in financial data science or econometrics this does not invalidate my opinion that it is good to specialize in statistics or econometrics on the graduate level no offense taken i just do not get why you have to be immediately so arrogant without thinking twice laughingwalls your opinion claimed that an masters of economics is not a suitable degree so yes it not valid if there are people that actually can successfully find careers in ds with the degree i have actually been involved with interviewing side for whole intern classes of some of the places you listed i know exactly what these places hire a masters of economics is just fine would a phd make you a stronger candidate sure would a cs stats ms be better depends on the role but you can work just fine in a quant team in a bank with ms in econ most of these roles are just ols logistic regression or time series and not really that sophisticated one your in the space its quite easy to internally transfer to ai ml teams as i have written i know people who have with that path moved quite far in corporate america with only an econ ma you claim to be an economist but seem to not know that most american schools do not even offer something called masters of econometrics maybe your european i am also an economist and know very well what an economics ma and phd covers asleep dress yes i am european and here we have degrees for mathematical economics but it exists in the us too is not it is econometrics and also phd programs in economics can be specialized in econometrics statistics or data science asleep dress on the other point i still hold the view that an economics bachelor is is a very good undergrad degree for data science but on the master is level more specialized degrees statistics econometrics data analytics data science or explicitely machine learning and ai are better i know that actually master is degrees are also evolving last year i myself taught data science for applied and mathematical economics students although it was an elective course not the part of the main curriculum but the classical economics master is degree is a bit lean for data science eg is a classical economics curriculum and while it is very interesting it is really lean if you compare it to statistics or data science master is courses which have several courses on advanced statistics bayesian statistics monte carlo network science multivariate analysis statistical machine learning deep learning advanced r advanced python c etc etc again the topic here is not if an econ master is would be bad no it is not it is very good or if someone could not do a data science career with it i have colleagues with philosophy physics political science degrees as well but rather what is our recommendation for a future data scientist to study and here my bet is statistics oriented courses on the postgraduate level laughingwalls the topic was on how to move from finance to ds ms econ would be find for this purpose my response was to your comment that ms econ was not a suitable degree i already acknowledged that other degrees can just work as well in my original comments my only comment is that you can get a ds role just fine with ms econ not that it was the optimal path if that is your end goal my assumption is if someone asked about econ ms they probably are more readily qualified for an econ ms than they are for cs stats ms i also think you over rate ms degrees of any type i have interviewed plenty of ms ds candidates from places like penn stanford columbia etc my and my colleagues impression is students are not trained in traditional statistics and many of these programs lack depth candidates can have interesting ml projects and are plenty smart but many just do not have adequate mathematics training the mathematics candidates may not know any statistics or ml the cs candidates may know about coding concepts than anything else no degree teaches everything and different majors have different strengths and weaknesses the one thing i will say that credits of an econ ms is that they actually force people to go into depth with regression etc then again so does a stats masters at the end when you at ms phd level of candidates people are well educated and its mroe about do they have the right foundation to pick up new tricks that depends on the role",
  "mizmato this is a commonly discussed question on the sub the answer is that it depends since ds degrees are relatively new there is very high variability on the quality of the program statistics is much safer in that you can get a better idea of how good the program is based on previous cohorts if you see that a ds program is offered by a reputable university taught by good professors has historical evidence of previous successful cohorts teaches many advanced courses on technical knowledge and has a strong staff to support you post graduation then you should consider it as a possible major wouldatastoryteller depends on the type of job you are going after for roles focused on machine learning ai computer vision research designing experiments no a bachelors in ds will probably not be enough for a role as a data analyst or something in business intelligence it can be enough i would take a look at where alumni from the programs you are considering end up and what other degrees they have azdatasci go with stats you will learn more not only application but also theory and know what you are doing when your modeling and why i strongly advise you to go for statistics there was only this kind of masters seven years ago when i graduated it brought me an understanding in statistics incredibly useful on a daily basis i learnt cs all alone and am now considered as good as my co workers with a cs degree but it was a lot of work budgetalgaei feel like this is similar to the discourse of software engineering vs cs degree for swe jobs",

  "narabedla personally i like thinkpads went from an to now a refurbished refurbished thinkpads are really good deals power money thinkpad keyboards are generally some of the best keyboards i have used on laptops they do not look hip though if that is important to you however i would not recommend a blindly as it is quite the heavy laptop but having an actual nvidia graphics card is nice for cuda gpu training of machine learning models overall i do not think it matters all too much except for the ram on your pc please make sure you have of ram to save you headache later down the line my current laptop has woznyyyy i cannot recommend asus zenbook enough got mine in what is great about these is you get a inch screen in a laptop body they are really light and yet big enough built like a tank mine once fell from a desk while open not a scratch also the keyboard feels just right i bought it specifically for college and i have to say it has been doing its job well lostphilosophy_ personally i like the lenovo yoga line of laptops my last one lasted years and just picked up the updated one this month and it has been great so far thinkpad is king johntsaou i presonally have a dell inspiron with the and an i am very happy with it and it has some nice specs without a gaming clunky look like someone mentioned already i would argue that right now the best laptops are the apple silicon macbooks the first and foremost job of a laptop is to be a portable computer and nothing really comes close to the macbooks in that regard as they have some of the best battery life in any laptop whilst also being on the upper end of performance especially in that form factor if you were going for a windows linux laptop i would steer clear of a discrete gpu i would not recommend training dl models on any laptop and if you were going to insist i would say it needs to be one of those large form factor desktop replacement style gaming laptops a dgpu is going to spend of it is time just chewing up extra battery and adding extra weight for the rare occasions you need more power use a cloud service like colab or paperspace for free or pay a few bucks for something beefier like what is on vastai or jarvislabs or remote into your universities resources or generally just do the work somewhere else other than your laptop imo steer clear of ms surface devices everyone i know who has ever used one likes the laptop but goes through more than one charger a year if they do not want to sacrifice a usb c port often the only one to charging honourable mention to the existence of framework laptops could be a good option good form factor strong community actually repairable devices sycokinetic i recommend a macbook of some sort a ton of data science stuff works best on nix systems and mac does not have as much risk of compatibility issues as a linux system windows and wsl would work fine too i just think mac works better for work if you do go with windows i swear by lenovo particularly thinkpads and ideapads definitely stay away from anything clunky and heavy because you are going to hate yourself after lugging a pound stealth fighter jet around campus for two weeks a ish inch screen is probably about right no smaller than ish and no bigger than ish do not worry too much about a gpu especially if it means you can get a lighter machine with a longer lasting battery if your school does not provide access to gpu machines you can always spin up something like a instance on aws for an hour and that will probably be overkill for a lot of your gpu computing for the love of god do not forget to turn it off when you are done do not skimp on the display it is the part of a laptop you interact with the most no matter what you study tijdvoorpils macbook surface or a windows ultrabook do not be the guy that arrives with a clunky gaming laptop at lecture tywinasoiaf regular laptop cloud services subscription okdependenttldr if you have the cash to build a high performance gpu enabled workstation and could use it for another reason like photo video editing or gaming it will probably be cheaper in the long run to go this route especially if you find a passion for anything other than the smallest neural network tree models however there is still a chance that even if you spend a lot of money you will still need to pay for cloud services if you do not plan on using the gpu for other reasons then the most economical way to go is probably a high ish ram workstation and just plan to use the cloud for everything that needs a gpu i would suggest for pc and if you can stomach it the same for mac strongly consider mac or linux because knowing the terminal language bash etc is a huge skill you will want to have everyone has made a suggestion of purchasing a well spec ed laptop as a development environment for writing data pipelines and testing code but have not really addressed how important gpus are to training most models neural networks transformers gans natural language processing and anything beyond the simplest trees it is likely that you will need want to have a gpu to train models especially if you are studying data science you can get access to gpus through a cloud service but i wanted to expressly call out how important gpus are to training models cloud costs for gpu enabled machines are in the whole dollars per hour range you can pay more than this or less if you are skilled enough to build asyncronous processes for the things like aws spot instances that have no guarantee for how long they are available to you as these come online your system will have to detect they are avail continue training and continually save your progress for when it becomes unavailable i just finished my masters in ds and have a little extra space to have a dedicated desk so i have both a laptop thinkpad would recommend and a desktop alienware i regret getting an alienware my desktop has a high end gpu and until recently of ram when training computer vision problems on relatively small neural networks i exceeded my resources and had to switch to the cloud so you might wind up spending for the cloud anyway basically the same as the tldr unless you shell out a lot for a high spec gpu enabled computer you will probably need to pay hourly for using aws gcp azure resources anyway your uni may have some credits to use for cloud services or a on campus lab you can access as well but some do not if you are ballin and or could justify the cost for other hobbies get a high end desktop and a decent laptop otherwise just buy once cry once and get a well spec ed laptop with as much ram as you can afford shoot for but do not exceed you will find will work great for of everything you do but i have tapped out a few times and wish i would sprung for a little more if you are doing a pc aftermarket ram is usually a lot cheaper which might be a budget way to get the specs you want dont get alienware they are hard to upgrade customize later they have some long term ownership problems check out r buildapcsales for prebuilt computers and read the reviews relevant rhubarb some different approaches if you have access to a server with graphics cards then using a nice thin client interface on the laptop would be perfect while you could use a chrome book and web interface that paints you into a corner when you may need some thing like or jupyter or what else comes along so id go with a linux box if you want cheap or a mac if you want a user friendly computer for other purposes if you want to do the computation or exotic viz graphics on the laptop itself then you need a powerful laptop linux cheaper especially at the low end no restrictions on compiling code easier to override safety and security for some brutal codes or drivers and most of all you can get an industry standard graphics card for maximum support and optimized code mac in the not too distant future the bus speed and integrated memory between gpu and cpu is going to be a game changer for ai ml and viz it is not currently exploited and most drivers and libraries are still locked into the mode where gpu and the cpu have some gulf that is hard to cross this for example ai codes use a lot of matrix multiplies but avoid conditional branches like the plague that is because shifting data from the cpu to the gpu is considered slow and a context switch and uses different memories macs architectures are not limited as much but the code to exploit that does not exist yet in most libraries similarly most neural net problems eventually are limited by the size and speed of memory not the number of coprocessors thus an integrated memory with a fat fast bus that can hold say is going to crush a nvidia card in scalability so someday mac is may rule but right now the libraries do not exist presidentofserenland ryzen and gb is good for big data edulcorantexd and what about the ram is okay or should i go for gb edulcorantexd

training locally is going to be way harder for a new person to work through anygeologistbig data on a personal computer is a no go anygeologisti would go for if it is affordable ram is quite the

  "ducksaxaphone this is a really important skill so i would work hard on it ask yourself questions like this to practice or explain your projects to imaginary people the key is to avoid maths altogether even going off on linear regression is too hard for many people stakeholders with little to no maths education knowledge are common so i would do something like logistic regression finds simple relationships between the odds of a binary outcome happening and changes to some inputs imagine i have a lot of patients and want to know their chances of a heart attack logistic regression uncovers relationships like being male raises your chances by over the average or that your chance of heart attack doubles every years older you get it can learn those effects and then add them up for a specific person to tell you their probability of a heart attack logistic regression is really good because it is simple enough to be done without much data it is also nice to know exactly how a variable affects the outcome logistic regression is downside is that it cannot handle complex effects such as being male and being older synergising to be worse than the individual effects of age and maleness added together do not worry about it not being perfectly rigorous we use mathematical language with tech people because it is so hard to be precise and rigorous without it as long as you give the right intuition and give a fair summary without being purposefully misleading you are being helpful to your non techy stakeholders olavla it is actually simpler to explain logistic regression than linear regression explain it visually via the concept of finding the best for logistic regression a linear decision boundary fantasticquestion it calculates the probability of one of two outcomes and is required to give one answer or another based on a simple rule where if the probability of being true is then the prediction is true also if i am wrong somebody please correct me seriously in any way just let me know clldataethics i would have responded with something like glm stands for generalized linear model and is simply a tool that allows the user to input the type of model and data and then returns model coefficients happyalexst explain that logistic regression is linear in the log odds then that a linear model is a weighted sum of your variables so then a logistic regression is just a way to make the thing give you a if the sum is big or if the sum is small miketythhon it is a function that performs logistic regression in r load the data run the function and you get a bunch of output wouldatastriker audience is likely business stakeholders and to explain glm i would lean on the explanation of classification if we have a set of labeled data this function enables us to learn infer which attributes are associated with a data point being in one set class or another with reasonably high probability we can then use this inference to predict the classification of unlabeled data points oddapplicationsuppose you have a fifa world cup match between france and england you support france and you want to know whether france will win you have some data at hand the french players and their respective characteristics and history the english players and their respective characteristics and history the results of the previous france x england matches the last results of both squads etc you run a logistic regression model that takes into account all these data and the output is whether france will win or not this binary result is given depending on the ratio of the odds of france winning to the odds of france not winning if this ratio is above a certain threshold the model says that france will win otherwise the model declares a loss the numeric result of the ratio is displayed in a sigmoid curve statsnpolisci the logistic regression fits a curved line surface to the data allowing us to predict a range of possibilities between impossible and completely certain glms allow us to fit more complex curved lines surfaces to the data this can be necessary when the data does not allow us to fit a linear regression lassypo logistic regression is downside is that it cannot handle complex effects such as being male and being older synergising to be worse than the individual effects of age and maleness added together interaction terms would beg to differ not that that matters much for the target audience pitrucha you can create interaction variables but good luck explaining them bothwaysitgoes i would say that the downside of the logistic regression is the linear relationship between explanatory variables and the odds that is why it is simple not because of your last point which is simply misleading as was mentioned by others ducksaxaphone yeah totally and if i felt that given time we might be able to improve the model with interaction terms i would alter my explanation a bit i would add that we could investigate ways to include interactions if they felt the time was worth investing to possibly improve the model i would just caveat it may come to nothing and they should not pin all their hopes on it if the current model was not good enough i think with any info i am always trying to think what decision do i need them to make and what info do i need to give so they can make a sensible decision ducksaxaphone yup i would only bring them up if i thought they were a viable route of investigation for the project at hand we can actually investigate how variables synergize by creating new variables that are just combinations of things we think interact for example an age variable that is normal for men but zero for women to account for any additional age effects that only happen to men it will take time though and some careful thinking so we have to be sure we want to spend a week or so investigating this for a likely modest improvement to the model then the stakeholders can decide whether to pursue that for better auroc or move on",

  "teetaps at first i thought this was homework for which i was like yeah that is totally reasonable especially if you are given up to two weeks for it but no as a take home exercise for an application i agree that this is just doing their work for them not to say that a role cannot have a take home challenge but i would trim it down a lot and suggest the candidate focus on one or two of those tasks for their proof of competence randomramman i am generally not a fan of open ended take home assignments they disproportionately favor candidates with more free time young child free etc you can imagine the many ways in which they ignore great candidates with other responsibilities it is hard to say if this is fair without knowing the complexity of the algorithm they are asking you to develop or are you only evaluating a given one that said the rest of this does not seem totally crazy to me for example assuming it is done in python i would expect a senior level candidate to be able to easily create python package to make this reproducible reproducible in most cases of course bonus point for writing a docker file but absolutely not expected write clean commented code in a script run said script on given data generate a few useful plots summarize in a slide outline thoughts on deployment not actually deploying imo this just gives them an idea of where you are at in terms of deployment if the answer is hand off to ml engineer that is fine that may or may not suite their needs this is a good faith interpretation of the assignment and again it really depends on what kind of analysis they are asking you to do but the rest of this is very reasonable to me and in line with your average take home assignment i would expect any work from a senior candidate to meet these guidelines the problem is that the actual analysis is probably open ended and could take an indefinite number hours and that bullshit favors people with an indefinite amount of free time wonderwanderrepeat i posted this on another thread here before but thought i would share my experience with you i made this mistake for a major insurer applied recruiter spoke to me for min to explain the practice set i spent hours on that damn set i then did not even get an interview they said my auc was too low my auc was their cutoff was i later found out i missed the cutoff for an interview i was devastated such a massive waste of my time and huge moral killer took me a long time to recover from that blow now i flat out refuse unless it is the last step and i really want the position edit clarity around the auc values zykezero i would reply with my hourly consulting fee fantasysymphony last point is kind of a red flag but how do you even integrate an analysis into live production in our app first five bullet points seem fine without context i am not sure what algorithm they are talking about i assume you have transaction data from time window here and a specific question to answer and they want to re run your code on the same data from august to check your predicted answer against their actual observed values the sixth bullet point is a bit too vague as any sensible answer would depend on knowing the internal structure of their app and tech stack beyond what an applicannot would know autumnotter not a huge fan of take home interview exams but that is fairly reasonable sounding as they go i would say that the only major ambiguity is around what properly packaged means most data scientists i know do not know how to properly package their code in a software engineering context thephoenixrisesagain if the analysis itself is somewhat complicated this is a week project not an assignment this is ridiculous to all the but this is a senior position sayers yeah sure a senior ds should of course be able to do all that but not as a freebie to the company as an assignment dfphd here is the thing whether it is too much or not depends on the person and the job if you are offering me a job that is a raise and this is the last step hell no this is not too much if this is a shitty job and there are more like it that i am almost sure i can get an offer from no thanks also me years ago looking to get his first job hell yeah i am doing it me right now with a year old son fuuuuuck no questionaboutpsy for context this is a digital bank in europe the position is a senior data scientist this honestly discouraged me from continuing my application as the requirements for their take home assignment will take me some considerable time to finish i feel sad that i am not continuing with them but i just felt too overwhelmed as i am also applying at other positions and already have a home assignment to give back next week but not as demanding as this one budget puppy as a julia dabbler it is nice that they let you do it in julia sendcumulus too much from their perspective it is going to be difficult to find a candidate that can do all this and is willing to take the time to do all this they are probably shooting themselves in the foot with their own hubris spankymebottom given that it is for a senior position i think it is okay however this should be done in the later rounds when they have a handful of candidates to choose from as opposed to everyone coming in through the door this is assuming that everything above is even remotely close to what they do final i think questions are reasonable they are not too hard test different aspects of your skills analytixguru almost the same instructions for an in person assignment that i had hr to complete in an interview less the putting into production part the actual purpose in my interview was the technical skill second the problem solving process and communication of results was the primary goal obviously did not know that going in but now that i have interviewed others i like the approach for the date thing we had something similar where certain values were not the correct data type to see had to coerce to the correct data type to visualize properly and get the insights that were there this is kind of wild i wonder if data science employers just give these out and get pretty sweet free labor because of it picapaodiablo not a fan of these things but hours would be enough to make it pretty i guess i am of mixed mind on this because having interviewed so many people that are so absolutely full of s and or have no clue what they are doing despite having really insane looking resumes this is not that much to ask ive had the same experience with a big consulting firm they gave me a task with questions which are all build a model do full analysis and presentation each one was long enough for an home assignment but i really wanted the job so i spent like on it eventually they dismissed me and i emailed the interviewer for a review of my task so i can improve and she did not even reply its a very large company so i highly doubt they have this trick of giving you home assignment thats basically doing a free work for them but it was very fishy suitupyo this is straight up asking you to do their work for them while they dangle a carrot on a stick really wish candidates would stop entertaining these tasks fractorial the post provides very little additional context as to what kind of dataset they have been given and what the task is but i suspect it is something like here is a month of transaction data with n covariates including indicators for fraudulent transactions build a model that flags likely fraudulent transactions in the next month is data transaction x anonymized user level data and predict users who churn transactions x some kind of product market characteristics and look for opportunities predict where to focus efforts in next month etc all of these are obviously toy datasets years old or completely generated no financial institution would ever give anything remotely resembling real data in such a format the task is not onerous and is not looking for a overly sophisticated model yes doing this properly in production would take significannotly longer but no one is looking for that it is an exercise to demonstrate process and a modicum of technical skills required for the job let me break it down what is being looked for properly packaged source code table stakes this is basically provide some source code that shows how it ingests datacsv and generates whatever output you are making do not overthink this if you want to put all the components into a container and ship that go for it but not expected mins commented clean data analysis table stakes again you are sending someone code of what you are doing this should be obviously commented and readable mins to cleanup function that accepts august transaction data in the same format as provided here and evaluates performance of algorithm based on this holdout set i think this step probably should come after the eda work but this is just a test of the external validity performance of your model on new data this assumes you have already done the relevant eda to figure out what is a good candidate model to make predictions for your task based on the data you have been given key thing here is to look for whether candidate knows how to assess model performance knows the appropriate validation metrics for their approach does not overfit etc the expectation is that based on your experience and knowledge you should be able to assess what type of data you are working with apply some data science domain knowledge and ideally think through the business problem at hand and identify a suitable predictive algorithm for your model perhaps you consider and try a few different approaches and document tradeoffs for a more senior candidate no one is expecting groundbreaking model performance here remotely free labour lmao it is a test of whether you can come up with some reasonable decisions about the data and modeling choices in a deliberately short amount of time and whether the assumptions you make in your choices are appropriate and considered i am not a fan of companies using some kind of model performance benchmark as a cutoff for progression for a take home but if they set it up that way it is because there is an obvious structure in the data and that should be evident from eda the more challenging ones are deliberately more ambiguous hours a few visualizations part of the eda but testing for ability to break down the data and business problem and visually communicate what is relevant suppose this is a model predicting fraudulent transactions then maybe something like a time series of fraud rates over time to check for stability outliers useful for your model some crosstabs by transaction covariates maybe you fit a model on some of your training data and were able to generate a feature importance ranking viz great for non technical stakeholders mins hours including eda slides probably the most important part because it gives you a chance to clearly communicate your process and results with potential stakeholders think about what is the business domain space of the company you are interviewing with articulate your process highlight key assumptions and limitations talk about what could be improved if you had more time etc hr many companies that give a take home will have you present your take home exercise as one of the on site stages integration i do not believe any company is expecting you to have an understanding of their systems or infra unless explicitly provided to you in the assignment what they are looking for here is for you to signal that you are familiar with a ds production process think about a pretty abstracted deployment process for your model if you know how to worthwhile to put together an abstracted high level system diagram in your slides for bonus points i do not usually post in this reddit but the discussion here is ridiculous senior ds roles in the us have tc even if in europe these are very well paying jobs this take home looks like something stripe or adyen would do and those roles pay euro base same amount in stock if it is not worth your time to apply for these roles that is up to you many others with plenty of skills and experience will the take home is just a screening exercise for competency and commitment to the application because an onsite loop is a costly time commitment for the hiring company as well to the commenters sending their hourly bill rates and talking about free labour pleas do not think so highly of yourselves that your context free hour model doodles have meaningful business value i have taken many such take homes as a candidate and now work as an hm for a faang competing company that has a similar take home as part of its hiring process we pay near the top of the market we have no shortage of extremely strong candidates who knock stuff like this out of the park before coming into an onsite loop keeneyarcadia sounds pretty standard for a consulting firm first test your coding proficiency next shows your ability to understand key metrics about the data slides to test your ppt ability good for client relations skill set and last tests your knowledge of model deployment and monitoring do all the code work in something like virtualenv or miniconda and just extract the project to share doc_ how long do you have to do it scitechboom this is a bit too much but i have had more tangled ones in the past with a long list of dos do nots along with style guides example code commit instructions and so on overall it was still better than leetcode type of selection process i might be weird but i actually like these especially for higher positions it gives you a new project with a chance to learn and you may even get a job out of it if not it will go on the profile and you will keep the experience you learned chasinggreenroads as someone who does not do take home assignments anymore yes shadowylurking not bad for a take home project for school that gives you a week or two to do it rroth i think the first points are fairly reasonable it is completely insane past that a cursory analysis in a jupyter notebook meh sure you should not be expected to do a detailed analysis and report or even think about a hypothetical production deployment bathroomworld the job market is not this competitive for jobs to be asking this but generally i do think it is getting more competitive lots of jobs but also lots more graduating data scientists so now jobs are demanding specific domain experience ex years in optimization in manufacturing experience and years of experience i was afraid this would eventually happen because now the job market is becoming tougher and we are probably seeing the salary growth plateau i got laid off two months ago and just got my first offer for less pay than my last job i am probably going to take it too meanwhile the past two jobs before i experienced getting hired in the first round super easy interviews and a huge salary increase comfortableslipif they can get candidates to write their code then they will not have to hire anyone altonmain this looks like a solid assignment that an employees with a few years of experience would be allotted week to complete sherlockholmesi think it is fair aside from the last point knightgrim i get the take home assignment but this one place wants a minute video saying the same things they need in written form we have lost our collective mind as a community i feel put that joint on chatgpt dylantmb if the data is really nicely formatted and there is a time limit of maybe hours i think it is okay i do not think there is potential to steal work and all the skills listed are fair however i think the first bullet point is weird considering people may not have a unix system i would expect them to either accommodate both or request you use docker and have experience with docker evenmoreconfusednow it feels like they outsource their work to candidates i thought companies had stopped doing that if that is not the case it is still excessive professorphi depends on complexity of task i have had stuff like this but the task itself was not super difficult was just some regression and visualisations the only new thing is the productionising part there i would include that as part of the follow up question since that answer is very dependent since they just ask to outline steps it does not seem to demanding as opposed to actually getting docker etc up it does not feel too bad if the data is mostly in a good state this is probably a hour task which is not too bad lumpynatureno not for a senior role notparticularlyanony i would send them link to my consulting llc no client this should take a few hours max weonlycryalone depending on the dataset it would be a half day to a solid day of effort assuming that ingestion function is not too complex and you do not have to set up your environments from scratch i would expect this in an upper level undergrad or first year grad course far signature i would do it but only get it to show a sample selection of results enough to prove it works with the subset of data they supply then have a link at the bottom of each to say if they wish for the full report then they can buy a subscription to unlock that feature bisdaknako i remember when blogspam was a big deal a butcher was asking for blog is about meat as part of the application i asked if i could send about bread no reply strangely enough that ad never went down their website sure had a lot of blog spam about meat looool they ask you to do their work dexterhsu depend on how much i want that job and how good is the pay kestrel99it is completely unreasonable to expect a candidate to do this amount of work without compensation this would be a hard pass for me since it would suggest they are not going to respect my work life balance should i get the job sorry cannot say much yeah that is too much at that point you are doing work for them for free was this a consulting firm out of curiosity hahah take home assignments sound great in theory but can be excruciating for the interviewee especially if the task is too demanding i was asked to complete and end to end ml assignment in minutes with a synthetic dataset with a focus on data cleaning there was missing data and all sorts of problems to deal with and i barely managed to train a model i had to understand the application domain what the data meant and then figure out what would be an appropriate way to deal with say missing data for each data point potential feature did not get the job sadly one of the things that affected how quickly i could do this was that most of my proficiency in data cleaning is working with huge datasets and snowflake redshift and i had to lookup how to do similar things in pandas take home assignments can be arbitrary and making them smaller providing less time does not always work either aguywithvision yes it can be stressful for your day dm me to get help with your take home exams we will not disappoint you iceprimcess if this is how they hire i will not be getting a job in data science and it is okay i need to know that i should take my skillset elsewhere independentdot_ outline steps which would be required to intergrate to our app how on earth you can do that when you are not work for them i mean you even did not know their tech stack look like cannonboi this seems relatively straightforward and easy as far as takehomes go my response to this is lol bye bradygilg no it looks pretty reasonable to me blindedyo ridiculous miketythhon i dunno it seems pretty simple to me simpletest they are learning not asking prehensiledick what is this font eye cancer giga condensed i have definitely had more involved take home assignments than this i mean how much time is this hours bc yea that is bs if it is like hours it is fine think about fte when you are working this would be like full days of work chaluliss i am very inexperienced in this field as i am a soon to graduate data science student but i feel a little thrown off by the attitude towards this assignment i do not honestly understand the difficulty of every aspect of this process but as others have pointed out most steps appear to be basic competency verifications from my understanding the requested actions should be routine here and thus are really just a way of reducing the risk the employer takes when hiring presumably high paying high responsibility positions i feel as though anyone who is skilled enough to be considered seriously for this position is not likely to be financially needy unless they are making questionable life choices or are a real outlier in life circumstances and thus there is not some moral onus on the employer to make the job easy to acquire it is not as if they are withholding something essential to anyone is what i mean its an opportunity that they create as an organization if candidates are not willing to make the necessary scarifies to reap the rewards of the position i think that is fine it is the choice of each individual that sets the bar of what is acceptable which means if there are people who want this bad enough and have to skill to make it happen then that is a fair result when they get hired and when companies seek such talented and willing individuals my overall point being i do not think this assignment is socially unacceptable but if you are unable to make it happen maybe you have met some kind of a challenge which will not fall for you on your first try maybe if you want to take on a highly skilled highly paid position you need to change some things about yourself to meet those demands i do not want to come off as accusatory or rude or plain ignorant but i do think its healthy to recognize that not everyone can do the same work nor can everyone thus have the same social status or pay it is not a fun fact to stare at plainly but its a fact of our world nonetheless as far as i can tell goldennomad i am firm with recruiters that i do not do take home assignments no big tech firm asks for them afaik and the people that tend to do well in them are people with nothing else to do morebikesthanbrains if a manager asked their subordinate to do all that for a task at least where i work it would be a colossal waste of resources this is for a job interview dance monkey dataciensultra naw bro if you want and or deserve the job you should be able to do this for them why should they hire you and give you big bucks yearly under contract if you cannot even prove to them that you can do the work they need you to do it would be silly for them hire you if you cannot do something like this as you mentioned this is a senior level position not entry they need to know they can rely on you to get projects done independently and effectively in a timely manner i do not understand how this is considered to be an unreasonable request yes its a lot of work but it should not take more than hours of time so sure its biased against someone with free time but its not their responsibility to create a hiring metric that supports people who do not have time to make it through the necessary tests its just not worth the risk or reasonable for them to hire a person without material evidence of competence if you cannot spend hours on a take home assignment then theres no reason for them to consider hiring you if you believe that is too much work for a job application then that job is just going to be given to someone who is willing to do it period this is how the real world works winners take all be a winner just do it snauriyal just check the glassdoor reviews about this digital bank and their interview process and you will be glad to save or invest time for your other interviews sendmepuppy seems reasonable did something like this and landed senior role also used across other roles we hire for and it filters out people who are not a fit this kind of task is minimum expected expertise for client projects much prefer showing off what i can do in realistic example rather than drawn out unrealistic leetcode every time purplebrownupdown this is asking too much of the candidate is time imo apprehensivebadwhat was the level of experience and pay for this assignment laughingwalls unless this is for a top company i would not bother i can say as someone who is ds adjacent i have never done a job that requires take home task and i would not do it now ncoder if i am going to ask a candidate to do more than a long toy problem i am going to pay them for the time that way they know we are serious about them snowmaninheat at first i thought this was homework for which i was like yeah that is totally reasonable especially if you are given up to two weeks for it but no as a take home exercise for an application i agree that this is just doing their work for them i was given a task like this and fucking hours to finish it along with a word report thank god i was on vacation when i did it because it took literally full hours every day and i misunderstood one question that was poorly written read they wanted me to do something wrong and i did not and because of that i did not get the role anobscurequote agreed take home challenges might be useful but something like this is a big red flag that the hiring manager sucks at their job a good manager should be able to get a sense of candidates with a reasonably short interview process if they need you to waste a whole weekend proving yourself to them this is a sign that they probably do not have a good grasp on their own responsibilities and that their team is a mess too hard pass i will take a job at a more professional company instead randomramman i disagree i do think take home challenges are flawed and have described why elsewhere in this thread however if you are given a take home challenge these are totally reasonable requests packaging a small analysis with the environment is trivial if you have done it before clearly commenting your code is expected at all times generating a few plots showing results is also part of the day to day summarizing in a few slides should be easy once your have the plots explaining thoughts on deployment takes a few minutes copied from a comment i made below these are the day to day duties of a data scientist i would not expect less of senior level candidate packaging and commenting your code are not optional dataciensultra really you think this is being done to get free labor this is such a victimization delusion its ridiculous they the company are not going to go through these take home assignments then assign some entry level ds to integrate them just to save money lol this is a real candidate screening process for a high level job a competent senior level ds banking individual is going to finish this in two days then demand compensation and live happily ever after everyone on here is not seeing the situation for what it is and is just whining because they cannot pass the test drakkur open ended or not the amount of time to complete a task like this is a day minimum for passable work the analysis and model parts alone take a couple hours to generate something of value light eda model validation prediction pipeline then doing slides and recommendations for a fictitious environment is another hour the easiest part is packaging this because you can easily use github to autogenerate a python package framework asking a potential new hire before a technical or any real meat of an interview is a non starter the best seniors are going to be ones who do not have time or avoid this because good seniors are in demand teetaps i agree i think it is the open endedness of this whole thing that frustrates me because you are right this is a project that if its data is rich enough could actually balloon into taking months to complete if it were direct tasks or discussion questions it would be far more reasonable appalachianhilltoad exactly this take home problems of this nature weed out qualified people with lives outside of their job i honestly think this hurts our industry overall because the way that people look at data and approach a problem is highly informed by their work academic life experiences work done by a diverse cast of characters is usually in my opinion better than work done by highly similar individuals thegainsfairy i figured was just create a python package that does x was create a jupyternotebook with it described test it against a validation set create a pretty chart create a pretty powerpoint summarizing for executives who do not understand what we do either incorporate package into production code or create standalone service for it it seems pretty straightforward but i am still pretty new to this this is not very senior right i have the stats background and software engineering background but separately its hard to judge if i could get into ds weonlycryalone it also favors unemployed workers if i were interviewing while holding down a job taking a half day off for a panel interview while covering my ass at work is a chore asking me to throw down another day of effort on top of that would be a queue for me to withdraw candidacy graphicteadatasci but it sounds like they provide an algorithm in which case it sounds kinda okay they need a reproducible environment if they are going to run the code even if it just is a requirementstxt file framing it as a package is weird loading data is probably a good idea and so is evaluating the outputs of the provided algorithm and the rest of it but it is really hard to read it in good faith especially with the last point if it instead had said that they wanted to discuss broad strokes wrt incorporation and model choices in the interview then i might be inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt keeneyarcadia i do not think there is bias in the amount of hours spent these are usually standard data sets and models and just a competency test it is more focused on understanding the end to end process of creating models and articulating the value to your stakeholders it rarely comes down to the actual code but the thought process behind the candidate can they confidently talk through their code and understand why they got the results they did most of the time should be spent in eda and not model development cause i would throw some bad data in there to see if the candidate finds it for me it is always how long will it take this candidate to get up and running with us in consulting there is a lot of slide building so if they blow me away with the slides i would be more confident suggesting them for a client facing role right off the bat if they are a really great at the model deployment aspect but not great at communication aspect they may be better fit for a mle role that does all the hands on keyboard work and less strategy but point is these can be done in hours if you have all the relevant experience hours if you really want to go the extra mile i would give them weeks to turn it around but willing to set up an interview sooner if they would like if we do not have a pool of candidates cause ya i do feel some companies jump at the first person that checks the boxes and people who may take longer to get those hours in may be at a disadvantage footballfanabc you should tell them multiplying your auc by they will get sufficient auc very simple model maybe same position that i applied to i am like i am not doing this shit for this type of pay so i just did not do it im doing a set of challenging questions for a startup because they have better pay and they actually have an exciting product but for an insurance company with lower than median pay hell no none removed wouldataciensultra lol see another victim who even admits that it took him hours to produce sub par results and its their fault that they picked a better candidate lol i think they want the steps to generate the model file the scoring script the environment and containerize it so they can deploy on osrsaddicted i do not think it is red flag seems straight forward theu are basically asking how to deploy model dashboard and monitoring seems standard the issue if any is that you can dump however many hours into this question if the jobs pay really well i would put an entire weekend to it if it is shit i might just put it to chatgpt lol caksters why is it a red flag it is a perfectly reasonable question to ask for a data scientist position to find out if they have any experience understanding in productionising the code or are they just jupyter monkeys dataciensultra if you guys actually think that this hiring process is being done to get free labor and not to screen job candidates then you are being ridiculous i am literally ready to unsubscribe to this whole community lol clearly there are not many competent ds here haha footballfanabc what happened if just using sagemaker i would be one of them i have been a ds for over years and never had to do this or seen someone else do this i am currently the only ds at my company and have deployed apis in azure but have not done this randomramman granted the error bars on the time on the analysis modeling are huge but do you really think the rest of it is that time consuming packaging a small analysis with the environment is trivial if you have done it before clearly commenting your code is expected at all times generating a few plots showing results is also part of the day to day summarizing in a few slides should be easy once your have the plots explaining thoughts on deployment takes a few minutes i do not disagree that take home assignments suck but i do think these are reasonable requirements for a data scientist is work bradygilg this is like hours of work max i think you are strongly overestimating the intensity of what is being asked dataciensultra if it takes you weeks to get this done then they probably do not want to hire you lol this project could easily be done in a week this sub is making this to be more difficult and consuming than it actually is a senior level competent experienced ds in the banking sector could sit down and get this done in a single weekend if they cannot and instead would rather complain about it on reddit then its not the job for them ducksaxaphone if this is the kind of toy problem people normally assign for a take home it is a few hours work for an experienced ds it might take four weeks if the candidates were given a vaguely worded business problem and access to a data warehouse but that is just not how take homes work it will be a neat table of data that they are given and asked to do a simple regression classification model then they have to make some plots and tidy up the codebase it is an hour or two out of your day if you have done ds work enough to be a senior wouldatastoryteller that is totally fair i had a takehome this weekend that really only took a couple of hours to do but honestly the last thing i want to do on a weekend i cannot imagine for folks who have kids that they are able to find time to do a takehome or do it well at least if you do withdraw you should let them know it is because of the takehome let them know they are losing qualified interested candidates over it avelak as a matter of principle i just say no to any company that requires a take home assessment i am philosophically opposed to them as they are a time sink that does not translate between recruiting efforts incentivize people to not follow directions many people spend four times the required time which favors specific candidate types and are not at all reflective of how work actually gets done in the workplace johnnydaggers how complex is the actual dataset and task everything here is very straight forward if this is all very challenging to you then maybe you are jot quite experienced enough for this position for context i have about years experience and i would be able to do all do this for a non complicated modeling task in about hours sendmepuppy seems pretty standard for senior ds role often take homes are indicative of the work expected if you cannot do the take home in comfortable speed probably not a fit for the role i see these kind of tasks regularly for presales type activities have a template for that kind of assignment and you can turn them around in an afternoon footballfanabc so what is happened if you applied for positions at the same time and all requests take home assignments while a senior ds had family and he had to take his kids out on weekend or studied with him in the evening and he still had to perform at his current job questionaboutpsy i am happy it made your day haha synthphreak what is ijulia i know of ipython is it similar but for julia questionaboutpsy that is what i also thought and all of this before even having a technical interview with the hiring team so it is possible that after a lot of effort you just get an automatic rejection email their salary range is good but i am too overwhelmed and busy to do their task before even having a chat with a hiring team acceptablypotato exactly questionaboutpsy a week questionaboutpsy i like your positive mindset this is indeed a constructive way to i look at it win win but if only i did not have other responsibilities in my life this mini project will take too much of my free time wouldataciensultra and that is why you are not the senior data scientist at a digital banking firm lol dataciensultra well here is something for you to learn today most of the people on this sub are not competent educated data scientist people like us who know what they are doing and talking about are the extreme minority in this community so yeah your right but the people here do not see it that way they think they are the victim of unfairness and do not realize they are just not good enough to succeed at the challenge thephoenixrisesagain seriously what is wrong with you funnypilgo if you cannot spend hours on a take home assignment now lets do of those in different applications vagabondclast the interview case study on campus mins prep and min presentation live coding round and other ways of testing candidates worth are laughing in the corner it but its not their responsibility to create a hiring metric that supports people who do not have time to make it through the necessary tests i guess this company and candidates like you are a match made in heaven op do refer so that you have a contact inside if you change your mind as for op it is the best decision to move away from the company if they are not taking into consideration the time and effort investment it takes on the candidate is part you get the idea of how they will treat their employees culture beats everything which is sort of surprising as typically european companies and particularly banks are known for providing better wlb and good care of their employees politicalfishbulb if they did not think op could do the work they would not have reviewed their resume and then invited them for an interview this goes beyond a validation of skills and into making op work for free rougeapple on vacation no you were not chawkyou worked during your vacation then it is not a vacation nekokeki thank god i was on vacation i did not get the role i feel like i would have a different outlook than being thankful i had a vacation to sacrifice in order to meet the unreasonable time constraints for an assessment of a job i know i did not get also this did happen to me too lol a much lesser extent thankfully i was in spain and spent days working on a take home assignment they said would take an hour and a half after submitting they ghosted me for over a month after repeated contact they final responded that i did not get it while they apologized for the delay and i have moved on from it i was extremely frustrated at time roberteyeah fuck that theregicidalmaniac i did not get the role and this is why no one should be subjecting themselves to take home assignments you did free work even if it was not productive work it was still work for you and all you got was the chance at a job alarmingbookcertified is what you are weonlycryalone it is also a sign that the team itself does not respect personalboundaries the work we do is mentally taxing you want your people to be able to rest off work time to be ready to roll the next day gpbuilder except you are getting paid to do this stuff at work isarl nevertheless you are effectively doing work for the company at this point while it is not out of the question to set a task like this for the right position such expectations would sit a lot better with me if the candidate was being compensated for their time irrespective of whatever hiring decision is made or since a positive hiring decision will likely be accompanied by signing bonus etc even just a consideration to pay the candidate for their time in the event that they are not chosen lemonbottlesyeah but would not it be more appropriate for them to ask you to provide samples of work you have done before that meets these requirements or giving you a mock dataset similar to what they would expect you to do not literally asking you to do new work for them before you have been hired dataciensultra lol thanks someone who is not a lazy moron being upvoted how can people in upper middle class be so worried about compensation and free labor over a small fucking project its so cringe wouldeong agreed this does not sound at all unreasonable side note do you have an email address where a senior level data scientist could send this sort of thing for a offer asking for a friend bestucanisgoodenough it is not clear if they have to come up with some algorithm to wow them that would be a red flag that the company is being run by morons because there is very likely some guy saying they are going to data mine that and make millionsand they will not but if they gave you an algorithm even a description of it and not the actual code and a data set it would be a smart screening technique imagine you are a bank that lost a ton of money in september and that is the holdout you give someone august you give them the algorithm if they cannot predict the future fine but if they deterministically get it wrong and say you would have made billion in september having up to date x data it would be either good to avoid them or to evaluate how they do on being confronted with that fact questionaboutpsy yes exactly what is putting me off exactly is that this is task that i need to do in order to see if i make it to the technical round and after that god knows how many other steps also the fact that i am applying for other jobs and the market is tough might have added to my stress and my availability and ability to finish this task on a different note creating a python package was what was scaring me the most as i never did that before in my ds career i have years of experience i will check this github trick thank you so much for suggesting if you happen to have a good enough learning source for this do not hesitate had to do one of these open ended interview questions for my current employer i dumped hours into it honestly if i had to choose between this format and leetcode i would prefer leetcode uggsandstarbux yeah i would say this is a reasonable task for someone with years of experience this seems like a project that might take hours of work but hard to tell without the full scope and task wonderwanderrepeat my auc was it was too low their cut off was wonderwanderrepeat my auc was which is well within range of acceptable fit criteria every other fit metric looked good no signs of over fitting and the precision and recall all looked solid given the business case jokes on them tho i ended up taking a position with a bank making more than the insurer was willing to offer caksters yeah it is a good question to ask in order to find out how experienced the candidate is mikeycyrus how do i get experience containerizing code if i am currently a script monkey with no data scientists around me fantasysymphony might be a wording not being able to read the whole assignment thing but i would imagine the jupyter monkey test would be pretty easy to spot given point or something you would grill them about in the interview afterwards if it was not clear enough and as others have pointed out companies using take home projects to get pro bono consulting work is a thing that happens sometimes and this absolutely has that smell grandzooby the red flag is that they are asking you to develop something and tell them how to put it into production this could easily be something from their to do list that they do not have the resources for and you are doing free work autumnotter right it is certainly not something many ds are expected to do and i would suggest that even to an engineering enabled ds it could mean many things given the widespread usage of jupyter databricks notebooks conda type distributions and the widespread use of procedural scripts in ds work simple good place to start for packaging python code that there are many flavors of additions modifications to simple packaging approaches do they want it containerized docker but this is the basic idea that i would guess they are looking for dataciensultra exactly everyone here is missing the point the hiring manager wants someone who can do this in a reasonable amount of time with effective results if this is a week project for you then you probably are not the best candidate for this job a senior level experience ds should be able to get this done in less than two weeks easily i do not think more than a week is really necessary unless op is really really busy unseemlyturbidity even so you typically get a week to do this kind of assignment and perhaps you have got other things to do with that weekend voxmanns my response is always sure we can set up a quick work agreement and i will charge you my hourly rate it does come with an emergency premium though since you are looking to get this done immediately it astonishes me that companies do this honestly most of these people cost at contract rates and most of them i have seen would take people at least a few hours to properly develop im not about to give away bucks and i am not about to ask someone else to canbooo this if you cannot measure my ability to meet your expectations within the interview time you are obviously slacking in the best case and incompetent or trying to get free work in the worst thank you but no thanks budget puppy the job poster is using it to refer to a jupyter notebook running julia ijulia adds the julia kernel to jupyter basically suitupyo even if the candidate is results are insufficient for their needs if they can get enough candidates to throw some pseudo code at a few issues their swes are working on then they may have just saved themselves a whole workweek of labor hours let the candidates do their research and design for them and then the swes just wrap things up in a sprint and management can get credited for the results to be honest this does not sound like a company i would like to work for if this is how they treat candidates imagine what they will saddle employees with doc_ yikess that might work if they pay you overtime but even so it will be shotty work i have my dream job so it is all good i did not do any take home to get it i refuse any take home regardless of company or role you cannot pay me enough to suffer through that i value my time wouldataciensultra nothing is wrong with me i am just seeing the situation for what it is not what people want it do be in some fantasy ideal world where job applications are far and ubiquitous to all those with time constraints lol how is this so hard to understand dataciensultra again you are making the situation more difficult by complicating it an making extraneous assumptions on part of the applicannot this is a simple question does op want this job or not if so do the project if op wants to explore jobs and does not think its worth doing this one take home assignment that may be a good choice but not fault on the company for protecting their payroll investment dataciensultra again that is your personal choice and hierarchy of values for someone who really wants to work a bank make big money and values cuttthroat competition a project like this is just a trivial challenge to get what they want in life if you see it differently then this job just is not for you that i agree on you do not really know any thing about the company or the position its easy to say to just move on but this is probably a very sought after position with well compensationanyone who would really pass over that opportunity because they do not want to do a hour project just is not built for it period dataciensultra again its not more than hours of total work in order to get a job where op is presumably working hours a week for large compensation i do not see the concern here you are worrying about op working for free i do not think that its what is going on here they are just trying to screen canditates as effictively as possible not trying to get free labor that is just ridiculous paddyalton tangential but when i was at uni they referred to the time outside term as vacation instead of holiday which struck me as oddly americanised for a traditional british university when i asked i was told holiday implies you are resting and not doing any work vacation only implies that you are not here_ you have vacated the premises makes you think right snowmaninheat it was not technically work since i did it for free which honestly makes the whole thing more depressing now that i think about it but he did complete the work for the company so they can prepare the next batch for new candidates tothepointe i used to work in fashion years ago and what was the scam and still is the scam was manufacturers who used to create pieces that would be sold in places like forever or in the wholesale clothing district would advertise open assistant designer positions they would then have applicannots submit a portfolio based on a certain design brief including technical sketches then they would never hire anyone produce the designs that would then get sold and the designer would get nothing clothing designs cannot be copyrighted so the applicannot would be sol paddyalton this takes it too far a fair hiring process requires a proper assessment of whether a candidate can do the job if the process is competitive this assessment needs to be substantial enough for it to be possible to identify the best candidate a take home is often one of the best ways to do this it can be done at a convenient time so avoids coordinating calendars and creating time pressure the question here is whether what is been given will take the average candidate too long to be reasonable and more cynically whether it is not just similar_ to the work they would be doing if successful an example of real work they have done before but rather actually_ the work the company needs doing right now i usually address this by giving candidates a somewhat open ended task and telling them to spend up to x time on it frogparch the incorporation into our production app was the flag for me iwantagrapeinmymouth how little do you value your time and effort that you do not mind doing projects for for profit companies for free why not just spend that time helping a non profit or working with open source instead of donating your work in hopes they will pay you in the future picapaodiablo i guess that is what i am having trouble with too i get that having a company try to get you to do free labor is completely f up but this is like hours of work if they are trying to get someone to do free work for them they have to be the most incompetent people on earth i mean there is specifically stating it is august data it is one function it is a summary in armarkdown and the gg plot could be incorporated into it for all the downvotes that you are getting op please post a link to the dataset and let us time it there is about times the amount of effort that it would take to do this well in the comments here im not going to call anyone lazy for not wanting to do stuff like this or make any judgments like that but i have to be missing something cuz this is really trivial stuff that would be completely fair game to do on site in an interview so how the hell is it not fair to give you this as an overnight task to do and before anyone downvs me i admit i might be missing something here but my point is that in a hour interview giving you this task and seeing how far you get it is pretty common if you are going to downvote me tell me which one of these tasks you see is taking so much time lemonbottleswhat is with the assumption that everyone here is upper middle class wouldataciensultra come to us and go to any financial institution is pretty standard for senior level in finance drakkur download github desktop create a new project using it it should give you the option to choose your language the python one auto creates a basic directory structure with a gitignore and a setuppy best advice is to read open source package implementations in github you like simple things like setting up a good directory and modularizing your code gets taken for granted mindlace this should be the technical round my rule of thumb is that tech interviews take days and the company can use those as they want but they cannot double up if they have not told you the full process ahead of time they may very well be milking you for free labor mindlace another option just use poetry it will make the package for you ououwen tbh for something like this i think day is reasonable but they should be willing to pay senior level if that is the expectation randomramman the open endedness is the problem often they say we expect you to spend no more than hours on this great well candidates who can spend more than hours will often have a more impressive result does that mean they are a better candidate maybe but also maybe your best candidate has the most demanding job and also has a young family they cannot or will not spend the same amount of time interviewing is super noisy and imperfect you can find good people using take home assignments i just worry about those that we leave behind i can usually tell a lot from just speaking with candidates and probing deeper and deeper thegainsfairy who knows what entails but are you thinking hours for hours for then an hour or less for haha i misread that in the same manner i was thinking i would never hire someone that provided a model that predicted worse than a random guess and did not even know that is ridiculous if they want to waste your home they should have their time wasted too pryomancermtga candidates can be very experienced without having had to do that part i can see that as a de task switchorganic you do not need a ds or ds background to learn containerization it comes from software engineering download docker and start going through some tutorials like this one you can learn basic docker then move on to kubernetes aka i would like to know this as well shit i have a python api deploy in azure currently and i did not containerize any code caksters i do not agree that this is a red flag this is actually a very standard question to ask a candidate data scientists often do not know what it takes to productionise the code if you think this is a red flag then every data engineering interview is a red flag because you get ask these sort of questions you can literally just google what needs to be done to put this solution in a production it is not like they are asking you to actually develop a containerised application with an http end point and send them the code this sub is turning into a joke tangerinelion yes this does not strike me as ridiculous provided that the data is simple spin up a new docker instance setup a basic requirementstxt file with the tools you are using create a notebook now make a couple plots that show you have explored the data make a model not the world is best model not a production model just a model to predict whatever it is that should be predicted now measure the performance on the holdout data using whatever metric is appropriate if the data is not simple like iris dataset level simple and has to have actual domain knowledge to answer it then yeah that is ridiculous but for simple data the point here is can you setup an environment and build a little program that others can use can you make it clear what you are doing and why rather than just spawning a bunch of plots without a story behind them can you show that you are able to do data exploration can you measure the success of a model thephoenixrisesagain if your quality standards for you work are that low that you do all that in a couple of days i will not hire you you are either doing something trivial or at the lowest standard possible psssat have you actually ever given that response vagabondclast if you are associating making big money because one is working with banks then i do not have anything productive to add clearly you have not got an idea of payscales for data science in any eu bank vs other sectors the problem is you can push anything under the banner of cutthroat competition and competitiveness and imbeciles will buy that but this is nothing but another slaverish practice to make candidates work for free if absolutely unsure then do not hire and if have doubts then there will be a probation period of min months in every organization that can be utilized to thoroughly scrutinize the candidature but this practice just needs to go the most british americanized use of english weonlycryalone this is where sites like glassdoor come in handy for calling out bullshit like this ninjakannon you were not employed but it was work_ activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a purpose or result the distinction between work and vacation is important because vacation is often used to refer to a time of low mental or physical effort without enough of which you may be in danger of burn out of course this is not always true and we do not have any more context here so cannot judge theregicidalmaniac i understand the need to make sure that a candidate is actually qualified for a position i just do not think that take home assignments accomplish that goal efficiently if hiring managers need to make sure that people have basic coding skills then that can be done in a live interview and by basic coding skills i mean the kind of things are actually expected to be known well enough to do off the top of your head like data manipulation with sql or pandas if hiring managers need to know if people have the problem solving skills then having a or hour conversation about past projects and hypothetical question will tell them far more about someone is problem solving ability than a take home ever will if a position really is very competitive and requires particular skills that are assessed well with a take home i can see giving one the vast majority of positions out there do not fall into this category job hunting is difficult enough without adding a half day is work in the mix just realize you are filtering out your candidate pool of likely qualified candidates if it is been working for you that is great we stopped doing them because it did seem that a lot of qualified candidates lost interest at the point of some take home assignment even minute simple things appalachianhilltoad agreed analysis is not unreasonable but the integration work is vacuouswaffle probably where they fail the candidates for not already knowing their app and then take the free work picapaodiablo how could a for profit company actually use this this could be done five different ways all of which are much different from each other it is one month is data from a few months ago they would be absolutely insane to try to incorporate whatever you did here into their production code base well you are doing it you could point out all the potential shortcomings and all the follow ups that would need to be done just to make it abundantly clear that it is a silly ask i practice stuff all the time especially just to tighten up my skills on rmarkdown and ggplot it is not like it is one or the other i mean this is what we do for a living so a small practice example is hardly anything big what task specifically do you see in this that would take more than an hour individually dataciensultra i value my time and effort more than most of the people on this planet why not spend that time working for non profit or open source bro think about that so your okay with spending hours on an open source project that provides you no benefit but not hours in a project so solidify a job oppurunity that is it i am logging off this site lol pretty sure i am smarter and more successful than literally everyone on this post rn so no point in arguing with you people thanks for reminding my how pointless it is to try and speak sense to any internet community wouldataciensultra just let it go these people are morons lol most of the time there is any talk of salary here everyone commenting treats it like anything below is complete garbage and might as well be minimum wage meanwhile i dream of eventually being able to make at least questionaboutpsy thank you xamorphous days of unpaid time jesus christ anobscurequote my first rejection ever as a little junior analyst to be was to digest a bunch of data from various locations put it in an organized spreadsheet and make some visuals and analysis to present along with that in an interview they said that i should spend no longer than hours on it naively i set a stopwatch for hours and did as much as i could when i went in for the interview they said that they were terribly disappointed with how little i had done and that others accomplished so much more in hours lmao if a job says we expect no more than x time and you only take x time you can be sure that you will be passed over for people who will commit many hours than that uggsandstarbux tbh i think are done simultaneously the timeline for that part is what is most variable to me should not really take that long assuming a fairly simple dataset are done simultaneously and if you are qualified for the job i do not think it should take more than an hour and then is literally just a few bullet points of what steps you would take if you had more time to implement wonderwanderrepeat i must have worded it poorly your the third person who misread it so definitely on my side i agree about the time waste honestly it was the personal sacrifice that killed me i gave up a vacation that weekend to do it because they gave it to me on fri and wanted it on mon then to not even get an interview never again caksters i agree but that particular company might expecta data scientist to do as well absolutely but i think having an idea of the potential pains of productionalize a model is not going to hurt you it is like design engineers having an idea about what it takes to manufacture what they design just because it looks good on paper it does not mean it is a good idea minimaxir make a model not the world is best model not a production model just a model to predict whatever it is that should be predicted tbh with the capriciousness of hiring processes you will probably fail here to an uninformed hiring manager regardless do a linear regression data is blatantly not iid rejected do xgboost neural networks model is a black box rejected if the data is not simple like iris dataset level simple and has to have actual domain knowledge to answer it then yeah that is ridiculous but for simple data the point here is i once had a interview question on a popular known dataset that benefited from domain knowledge which i had so i was able to create a validation accuracy linear regressionthe interviewer accused me of cheating dataciensultra hast to have the domain knowledge to answer it uhh so its unreasonable now for ds managers to want senior ds to have domain knowledge lol why am i even on this sub lol wouldataciensultra lol okay bro sure literally laughing out loud right now you people come up with any excuse you can find lol voxmanns yep the response is usually we are not doing that with mixed levels of incredulousness never got a contract from it wouldataciensultra imbeciles will buy that just another slavish practice as someone who comes from a culture and country where my people have been through slavery your comment is absurd there is nothing slaverish at all about working extra hours at a desk for millionaire amounts of money lol trust me no one making a year is complaining about the hour take home assignment they had to do to get the job lol you people will whine about anything paddyalton live exercises can be very useful i typically run them for more senior roles take homes can be less effective there a major drawback is that you create a great deal of time pressure in a live interview if handling that is partly what you are testing for fine but it can favour certain types of candidate over others in a way that may be less relevant i think it is especially hard on junior people who do not yet have the muscle memory plus if your interviewee already has a job it can be a real imposition on them to arrange something during working hours i strongly disagree with the suggestion that a hypothetical conversation tells you more than an exercise that simulates the day to day of the actual job however i would certainly time box it to hours i agree that longer is not the best use of a candidate is time there are limits to how complex such an exercise can be of course paddyalton i am surprised to hear that i have rarely had anyone drop out at that stage very occasionally people have emailed me back to say the task is beyond their abilities which is fair enough one thing i wonder about we are not doing this as the first stage in the process it is usually one of the last things is that the difference people are seeing i agree that asking for a written exercise is too high a barrier to entry to a hiring process there is typically been an assessment of the written application and an initial call so we are down to single digits candidates at this point wildogg it is not integration work it is integration recommendation or outline or schematic as in do you know how this would be integrated and the answer tells the hiring manager who has done full stack engineering not saying it is asking too much but i would clarify in my answer that i can only go so far on integration recommendations given that i have not reviewed their back end nor their roadmap for what their future preferred state looks like iwantagrapeinmymouth they are literally asking for something that they want to be implemented into live production see the last bullet point any of these things could take over an hour except for like the visualizations like you honestly think this entire thing would take you hours wouldataciensultra there is no real argument for these companies using hiring practices to get free labor its just a justification people use for not being competent enough to complete the project just gotta stay off reddit bro allezcannes i am not doing hours of free labor for any company that is going to profit from it any company that would do that shit both does not value your time and is shady as fuck and you absolutely do not want to work for them how a genius like you fails to see this is beyond me iwantagrapeinmymouth are you pretty sure i am smarter and more successful than literally everyone on this post rn so no point in arguing with you people classic argumentum ad verecundiam teetaps you probably do not have time for this for the purposes of your task but i will also throw in the recommendation of nbdev especially if you are a python person i have not had a project to use it on yet but i have gone through the docs and the walkthrough and it seems like a great framework for starting potential projects with all the infrastructure needed for if when they eventually get big and need all the packaging and stuff mindlace well clock days the recruiter vetting is like the tech screen is hr then there is usually the to full day of interviews and maybe another day of take home stuff every time i have had another job at the same time i have been able to make the new gig break the interview into small enough parts that i can do it on the side thegainsfairy huh maybe i should start interviewing then pryomancermtga i did not disagree that it is useful i disagreed that it was an indicator of how experienced a candidate was how did domain knowledge improve your model to such an extent isarl even though you have not got a contract out if it you have pushed back on hiring managers and made them think twice about how reasonable their hiring processes are and you stood up for yourself and by extension the whole industry by refusing to lower your standards just to please poor interviewers thank you vagabondclast first of all it is not a personal attack on your culture or country as it is not known from one is reddit account rather if you come from that background and have known the adverse impacts of it should not you be more responsible towards avoiding it altogether than justifying it under the big money banner ironic is not it also it is an eu bank and no eu bank will pay you for just ic ds coding role it is laughable that you can even think of that number you people will whine about anything sure mate work all that hours that you want to remember this someone accepted the norms forced down on them under pretext of better lives or false sense of security and that is how slavery prevailed generations have lost their lives and time because of it but hey anything is justified if the amount is big enough to buy it out ai not it theregicidalmaniac i do see the untility in very junior roles where candidates do not have on the job experience and a hiring manager wants to see them demonstrate that they actually can use the tools they claim to especially because junior roles are going probably going to be relatively simple tasks that it is reasonable to expect people to be able to do in short amounts of time i would argue though that it is better if junior applicannots have portfolios with projects where the interviewer can ask them about why used the tools they how they used them challenges they faced conversations like that are much better at demonstrating their ability to learn adapt and problem solve a major drawback is that you create a great deal of time pressure in a live interview sure but the difference is that live interviews give you the ability to discuss the problem and how to go about solving it whether or not someone knows the exact syntax to solve the problem is not as important as knowing how to solve the problem generally i think it is especially hard on junior people who do not yet have the muscle memory outside of basic data manipulation muscle memory is not that important i have been in this field for years and i still regularly reference documentation because outside of basic data manipulation i do not do anything often enough for it to sink into my memory what matters is being able to understand the problem and how to solve it generally everything else is just syntax plus if your interviewee already has a job it can be a real imposition on them to arrange something during working hours interviewing is already something that someone with a job needs to make hours of time for if the take home is something that should take hours to do then that is still doing half a day is work on the weekend or nights just for the chance at a job that is a lot of time effort and stress just for the chance at a job and if the take home only take hours then how much are you really learning from it that you cannot get in live interviews i strongly disagree with the suggestion that a hypothetical conversation tells you more than an exercise that simulates the day to day of the actual job this is not what i said what i said is a conversation tells you more about their problem solving skills specifically problem solving and planning are more important than whether or not someone can do some eda and put a nn together in hours also a take home assignments do not simulate a day to day job no take home assignments ever can because tasks in this field do not take or days they take days and weeks from planning the project to understanding the data to eda to model building etc etc the whole job is more complex than just doing some data manipulation and putting a simple model together however i would certainly time box it to hours if all take home assignments were hours or less i would not really mind but that is not the case most that i have seen are but i would ask how much youre really learning about a candidate if you are only giving them hours to work on it tell me if this is accurate but it seems like you are interested in testing if a candidate knows the code well enough to do it quickly i do not really care about that i care about whether they know how to problem solve and whether they know enough to know which tools to bring in for the job they can figure out how to use the tools on the fry i certainly do all the time especially since every environment is a little different there are quirks to using the same tools in different places work in this field is collaborative and that is another aspect that you cannot get from a take home assignments my point is i just do not see the value in a take home assignment outised of very junior roles a one hour live convdding sessions and a conversation tells me more about whether they are actually qualified than a take home assignments ever could could be the minute screen i mentioned was an early on thing we were doing to try and whittle down applications it was also years ago so maybe a different environment appalachianhilltoad fair but this is a take home for a ds role not a full stack engineer the hiring manager needs to be clear on what they are looking for at the start of the hiring process op did not put any details about the job posting so it is possible they are actually looking for someone with full stack skills picapaodiablo being that there is no way this person knows the production code base i think that last bullet point is figurative also i think it would take hours to do and hours to do very well i actually asked off for details of the data set if he has it i would be happy to prove the point less effort to do well than was exerted on this comment thread and totally a normal ask for something on an onsite interview each of these would take you an hour seriously picapaodiablo so after rereading you believe companies and this one in particular get interviewees to write code and then take that and put it into production i am sure some insane weirdos have done it once or twice but it is such a spectacularly stupid idea on so many counts you cannot seriously believe it is common what code would call this what if library references varied from their prod which it almost certainly would how did it pass smoke tests or get integrated into the build why would they need a one off visualization that was not integrated into their bi stack any company that would do this would be so inept and incompetent they could not be in business wouldataciensultra lol is that supposed to be an insult because it feels like a compliment lol dataciensultra bro they are not going to profit from this project lol if you cannot see how stupid that is then you do not understand what is going on here the take home assignment is not valuable at all its just a simple weekend task if you think otherwise then you are not the right person for the job lol seriously you guys are all morons you really think that the companies are out here laughing at candidates for all the free labor they tricked them into doing as part of their application process that does not actually happen where is reality being factored into this conversation they do not give a shit about this project they are just trying to find someone who can do the job if you fail to see that then you are not a competent ds candidate yes this is a big request if you have the appropriate project portfolio or any connection with the hiring manager that is references of your competence for personal sources then this is not a reasonable request but if you are complete stranger applying for a high competitive job what the fuck can you expect you want them to hire you because of words on a resume yall are really really entitled asf eatsbananassideway bro they are dis many vacuouswaffle probably less authority and more dunning kruger dataciensultra does not make me wrong lol feurbachsock this is why i love this sub if i scroll down enough i find kernels like your comment thanks for the recommendation minimaxir the problem explicitly said you could not use a feature in the dataset because it would have made the problem trivial but since i knew the dataset i knew what other features were very strongly correlated with it vagabondclast this could not have said it in a better way thank you for saying it out loud voxmanns you are too kind much love homie fractorial and then everyone clapped dataciensultra lol slavery prevailed because people were put into chains and kept as chattel in the cargo of slave ships many refused to accept these conditions and chose to killed themselves by jumping ship as that was the only alternative shut the fuck up you complete moron jfc i have to get off reddit i am just arguing against morons who cannot even see reality clearly paddyalton that is not quite_ accurate the point about muscle memory is that i do not_ care about it but it correlates somewhat with performance in a live exercise by contrast a timeboxed take home gives juniors a safe environment to browse stackoverflow to their heart is content which is good because that is a skill that i do_ want to test paddyalton ah makes sense yeah i think the problems start if total candidate time expended total manager time expended i sometimes feel like half the point of a screening call is to signal to the candidate that they are now in a small pool and so their efforts have a reasonable chance of success wildogg hiring managers are always looking for broad skills and deep skills this is a kind of question that tells me more about the candidate given a choice i want someone with broader and deeper skills and the answer helps me rank order otherwise qualified candidates iwantagrapeinmymouth the analysis would take me far more than an hour yes glad you could get this done in hours lmao iwantagrapeinmymouth any company that would do this would be so inept and incompetent that they could not be in business incredible amount of faith in companies not being idiotic when a company that was recently bought for billion dollars has done things far dumber than this allezcannes it is a depiction of your delusion of who you think you are if you truly did not care you would have certainly left this thread and really deleted your account no it does not in fact i agree with some of what you have written the passage quoted above in itself however does not lend any credence to what you are saying would not pca prior to the regression reveal that or could you not use the cheat feature for that either vagabondclast that is a classic and cultured language and your openness to accept counter view points is applaudable s jfc i have to get off reddit i am just arguing against morons who cannot even see reality clearly but you are not arguing against yourself yes do run away and do not conveniently play your background cards to justify the unhealthy precedence that is being set by companies even if the pay is which no bank gives for such roles and squeezes your day with little to no time left for your own self and familythat is a modern day slavery understand where it is leading the field and people working in it when you come back to reality from your high horse appalachianhilltoad makes sense goes to show how people think differently about hiring beyond the not psycho can code requirement i would hire people with overlapping skills rather than full stack engineers i think people coming to ds from hard science have a different skill set than those who came from software engineering and i would want both on my team completely understand why you would want full stack people it is so interesting that both of us plus anyone reading this would use the same set of questions to hire an entirely different group of humans picapaodiablo care to comment on the absurdity of how taking this code and integrating it into production would work exactly one function on one month and writing it up no devops issues no unit tests nothing more than hours lmao right back at you picapaodiablo plenty of companies do stupid things they are mistakes doing something this flagrantly flawed would be a different story there is no one to blame when it inevitably blows up which is antithetical to how greedy an idiotic people work most of the stupid outrageous stuff happens because they are barriers that insulate them but because a couple companies do some monumentally stupid stuff that means that most somehow do so that the default assumption is something this absolutely crazy we clearly do not work in the same industry you would be lucky to get your code through a pull request in the first days you were at a company let alone going straight to production dataciensultra so because i press the notification button on reddit when it appears and i respond i must be obsessed with this reddit post huh naw bro i do not give a shit lol i am playing elden ring with my laptop open surfing the internet lol yall are a bunch of goons lol literally laughing out loud right now lolololol minimaxir pca would not help with feature selection in addition to the fact that pca has its own caveats to be correctly utilized wouldataciensultra bro its not modern day slavery slavery is being raped tortured beaten and kept in chains for generations working hours a week and sacrificing personal life for large amounts of money is a choice you are a moron iwantagrapeinmymouth i mean maybe the problem is your code would be garbage because you spent hours on it and it is entirely useless i think you will find that even boilerplate code that starts a process can be incredibly helpful and labor reducing for the people on the team even if it generates a new idea it is still useful labor to the company that is getting it for free i do not get why you guys value your work and time so little that you are normalizing doing work for free because it would not go live in production which i do not remember ever claiming that it absolutely would just that they literally ask for an outline on how to put it into live you are the one saying that as if that is the only useful thing we do this is stupid dick measuring iwantagrapeinmymouth you do not think there is any company that has ever used any part of work created during an interview you think that alone would end the company and is above and beyond mistakes like literally turning off two factor authentication they do not have to survive forever to make dumb choices during interviews and i think you are vastly overstating the impact of this allezcannes it i am logging off this site lol well politicalfishbulb you are all over reddit trying to justify working excessive hours and grinding if it worked you would not need to be trying to convince everyone go work your hundred hour weeks while the rest of us get compensated well and have work life balance picapaodiablo here you go with the snotty comments and strawmen nonsense you think i am the one with an issue valuing my time you are the one wasting time raging about it on reddit arguably the least productive use of time there is so please miss me with the snark and if we are going to be assholes i honestly cannot believe a professional would be this pressed about something simpler than things you no doubt do every day the problem is maybe my code is garbage i already repeatedly offered to do this for op if he posted the dataset i am more than happy to have you go through it and tell me what you would do better and again since you want to be so rude i am willing to bet i appreciate my time by at least four times as much as you based on what we go to work for and that you could not write comprehensive unit tests for anything in my github repo whereas if you want to post yours i will gladly record anything you wrote you should really lose the attribute picapaodiablo i cannot tell if you are being intentionallly argumentative or just missed it i already answered that question a few people doing really dumb things is not the same as it being so common it is the default assumption and turning off two factor authentication is misguided but there are plenty of situations where it could be warranted that is a totally different discussion and issue than getting someone to write interview code so you can push to prod again it is possible but compared to the simpler explanation it is what it looks like an interview ask for a tiny task from start to finish it is a huge leap instead of going into hypotheticals and unrelated anecdotes what about this other than the word prod at the end seems so convincing to you you are the one with the rage boner snapping at people and erecting strawmen left and right it is such an easy thing to he specific instead of being all over the place with generic terms writing a function for one month would take x hours bc i would what exactly does reading a csv take hours does coding a function with one parameter take hours wouldataciensultra you right i will get off now need to do my math homework anyway gonna go learn some real data ciens instead of kewkewing with a bunch of noobs in the internet lollolol dataciensultra lol okay bro i am just having fun on a sunday talking shit and playing elden ring trust me i am doing okay i wasnt even talking about working excessive hours or grinding except in this one comment in general i am just saying that anyone who is not willing to do a hour project to get a job does not deserve that job you can kewkew all you want while people like me get it done and reap the rewards its that simple lol im not trying to convince anyone of anything i just see red bubble i click and i speak truth gotta love reddit bro dataciensultra and if you read the conversation you will see i am not trying to justify anything i am chastising the other person because he is really comparing something like working long hours at a bank to fucking slavery which is insulting to a people who have actually endured slavery my people endured slavery in my country for years so comparing something like working at a bank for money to slavery is just purely fucking offensive period iwantagrapeinmymouth yeah i am sorry i forgot i was the only one mocking someone on reddit in this conversation which makes your time four times more valuable than mine i think that will be on our headstones when we die how much more valuable you were than me idk why this field is like this why everything becomes a stupid dick measuring contest and no i do not actually think your code is awful but i think that talking about this as if it is a hour project is needlessly braggadocios and pretentious like how is this not dick measuring iwantagrapeinmymouth what are the situations where it was warranted at twitter where they literally did not know it happened until after musk just ordered microservices to be turned off i cannot understand how i am this day and age we are running under the assumption that companies are full of rational decision making as the norm when it is absolutely not math homework lmao picapaodiablo i only got snarky back after quite a few barbs i am not looking to fight with anyone and i repeatedly explained what i thought and why did you do the same dick measuring is pathetic but if someone is going to fire insults they opened that dope i was not in any way bragging when i said it although i guess on text it might look like it from where i stand it looked like a pretty straightforward ask with the focal point of one function and one month honestly that is why i repeated it and asked where anyone else saw the complexity when i offered to do this for op it was in good faith not to dunk on anyone or fluff myself this is not a public identity the only reason i even touched salary was bc of the assertion i do not value it let alone as a slight dick measuring is stupid on countless fronts anyone that engages in it is begging to be humbled anyway bc a sensors going to go bad a new data source is going to go gremlin or other nightmare things and they do not care in the least about credentials salaries or history picapaodiablo what in the f does that have to do with this example literally nothing they are completely different types of issues i mean they are not even in the same stratosphere yes corporations do dumb stuff of course they do no one is disputing that that does not mean that every stupid thing you can imagine is reasonable to assume if someone posted that it is reasonable to assume that some director only approves pull requests if the ouija board tells him it is okay maybe but it is not in any way something one should assume bc it is nuts the ridiculous strawman that bc some dumb thing is done than all dumb things are likely is too goofy to take seriously how long have you worked in data science be honest iwantagrapeinmymouth i have been talking about twitter this whole time to give levels of incompetence above and beyond pushing code to live production lmao picapaodiablo but to be fair twitter was not like that this is some egotistical jackass who has no real chops larping and getting a pass bc he has the money to anyone other than his sycophants knows how ridiculous he is fuck did not i just read that he was replacing c with neural networks as a grand finale to his microservice stupidity iwantagrapeinmymouth that is my whole point though that this stuff happens all the time due to the fact that higher ups are regularly egotistical jackasses with no real chops that is an absurd amount of any ai related jobs because the field is hot as fuck right now and maybe his goal was to lower time cost spent on microservices calls and i cannot imagine what world that would make any sense so par for the course with elon",

if the right learning attitude is there particularrulethere are some really good answers here i would also add comfortable working in ambiguity and disparate data sources dealing with ambiguity is really hard to teach but oh so valuable it is really shocking that my company has hired people straight out of ds masters programs who have never seen or dealt with incomplete and disparate sources

immerse themselves into it obvious secondaries are python sql know how and a good understanding of stats this is such an awesome list thanks to all who contributed followyourvalues i would apply moist agree with all this except without cynicism or pessimism any kind of seasoned scientist is cynical and pessimistic in nature it is a good thing it keeps you questioning your own results if you gleefully accept the first positive result you get without scrutinising it that is likely to lead to a lot o tears further down the line mathymate i only see python for data analyst and data science roles now can you suggest where i can learn ml and what projects to do on it bravo bluesubarucrew can you be more specific about systems and systems administration citizenofdanksburg i like this answer i mean i am definitely biased because i am an employee but oftentimes in math and stat degrees my background the stuff we learn is r matlab and maybe sas i took a python class so i could get exposed to the language but it was a cs class in oop not for data science or anything this was fall of as a sophomore so a different time i went from pure math to a master is degree in stats and during this time i learned more python definitely got pretty good at r but research was using python and learned some c as well but i did not learn sql until i got my job as a statistician in may of im taking a course from amazon on aws now but yeah it seems like as long as one has some basic skills all the other stuff can be added on top that is what my boss has done with me all that stuff with mongodb spark pyspark nosql etc aws people do not learn that in school or at least in math and stat degrees maybe aws but i am a pretty recent grad and this was never offered as a course or existed in one it seems like companies do not want to train employees anymore but i am fully willing to admit i might be totally off the mark here and wrong purplebrownupdown best and least pretentious answer brandco i have seen this comment before what is the reference lmao these comments will never get old may i know where do you work at least the tier of org mathstatgal i really need to reevaluate my life choices based on your response here sorry why do i need to know airflow is not that de is job thanks but i can i assume that this job description is for someone with at least some years experience and that not all the data scientist in the department actually know all the tools you have mentioned at least not perfectly any suggestion where to learn about ml algorithms aws basics airflow sadcampaignthanks for sharing this helps a lot wouldataciensultra literally lol rn brandco i understand your point and agree that there is a a healthy amount that all analytical people will experience my point was about the motivation to work not being cynical and pessimistic the bigger picture the why are you here question as a manager i have been unsuccessful at managing and directing people whose cynicism and pessimism bleeds into all their thinking if we are going to do hard things together we need to be able to motivate each other when things get difficult none there is a difference between skepticism and cynicism pessimism skepticism is necessary pessimism cynicism are not this is a small but important distinction hackingbricker could boil down to a semantics question but still the hype around data science is well established so if you are not a bit cynical i too might question your understanding about what makes your work meaningful obviously varies by industry sector the humility and compassion part goes without saying however spartanork disagree i have seen many who kill the idea in their minds before giving it a fair chance if you do not believe it it will not work you will sabotage it subconsciously tukdu for learning projects i can recommend kaggle for learning ml it depends on how much time you wanna spend on it there are vaious possibilities from university over certificates by google or ibm to youtube videos i would suggest two tracks one would be to take some courses udacity coursera datacamp to mention a few would help here for the second track i would strongly recommend learning by doing look up omdena and datakind they allow you to participate in real world projects it is easy to fall into the trap of endless courses and tutorials brandco sure if i am doing analysis for myself i can run it on my laptop if i need to update the analysis i can just run it again i can use reproducible research or literate programming strategies for my own benefit but that is about all that matters as soon as i am delivering my analysis data product to someone else i will struggle to run it on demand using only my local equipment it is possible but does not scale any better than spreadsheet based reporting and analysis what i really need is a service for my data product that my users can depend on i can design that service to provide a service level that my users need real time daily interactive dashboard static report over email push alerts programming interface for integration into other software etc there are a ton of options for data teams but they mostly run on linux servers or cloud platforms some have web front ends for administrators databases scripting interface log files etc on my team i might need some help debugging a docker container that is running a python script as a daily batch job digging through old log files on azure blob storage to find the first instance of an error figuring out why a report is not updating on tableau server etc at some companies all admin tasks are handled by people outside of the data team so the data team might not be able to ssh into a server and install dependencies for example on my team we do many of these tasks tldr data products run on servers and the server need maintenance and administration hotplasmatits some ass hat came on here a few months ago and whined about how applicannots did not know the harmonic mean among other things and he was torn the fuck apart found it the dude deleted his account over it exospectra there was an unironic post a few months ago where a hiring manager was telling her tips for how to succeed in her process she said something along the lines of know the basics in and out including harmonic mean it should be a popular post here vituluss calminky publicly traded company in it calminky why this is just one data point one opinion by one ds manager maybe this is the outlier calminky sure you do not need to know airflow data preparation training modeling post processing can all be triggered separately and manually but i just enjoy automating as much as i can calminky all of the data scientists in the department know all of these tools and more since we work with them daily so anyone can quickly write an airflow dag etc even our most junior ds straight out of school the key portion of the skills that you have overlooked being okay with not knowing everything we are also okay with a ds not knowing everything but there has to be a willingness to explore and learn new tools as necessary this seems like a small detail but we had very qualified candidates interview and outright refuse to learn certain things for a jr role i would say that the tools could be optional but the rest is basics helps not to sleep at night you mean moist good point as other comments have indicated it is about semantics to me what you describe when cynicism impacts motivation i would call disalsusionment when the cynicism overrides any motivation to try new things cynicism and pessimism imo do not do this per se they just temper what would otherwise be unregulated optimism and idealism they allow you to maintain enthusiasm to explore new ideas but you are more cautious you have lower more realistic expectations on what you can achieve you still give things a go but you know the idealised outcome you envisage is unlikely to be the end result it stops you trying to achieve lofty goals and making unrealistic plans which is the best ml certificate tell best certificate for beginners in machine learning please okayy which projects to start as a complete beginner bluesubarucrew thanks for the detailed response unfortunately for me this is something i have less experience with i have used apache airflow to productionize some scripts at work on a linux server but never dealt with aws azure and most of the docker stuff we use which is not a lot is all done by more swe oriented people i recently downloaded the free version of tableau to try to get some experience but have not had much time to play around with it i have a lot of experience with linux but mostly just as a personal operating system instead of a server mathstatgal oh no offence to you it is just that i come from an analytics background working in consulting companies and never really had the chance to work with the spark requirement you stated and also airflow aws part everything else i am a okay on but what do i know here i am sitting on almost months not continuous did have a job for months in the last years that i had to quit so as not to lose my mind of being jobless and looking for one it is been so disheartening and my mental health is in the shitter but i have got to keep on keeping on none deleted thanks for your reply this softens it a bit from my short experience years willingness to learn and curiosity are the most important factors fir the long run for a ds it is especially important since experience in tools is acquired from using them which depend on the previous jobs as well quantpsychguy you are asking the wrong question if you want a well rounded education in machine learning you should invest in a

  "maximum mission everytime you are interested to control the overfitting during model building training so pretty much always what the other person is right in some senses but not completely it is not always needed regularization comes into play mainly in the high dimensional setting when your data is large p small n it is used a lot in regression especially when you have a model with lots of predictors and want to penalize the ones which are not associated with the response check out the book islr and read chapter on regularization more specifically in the high dimensional setting there is not unique solution to the least squares problem as the x tx matrix is rank deficient to adjust for this we add a term lambda to the matrix to make it rank deficient and control lambda through cross validation a larger value of lambda penalizes the beta coefficients more and in turn reduces the variability and increases the bias of your model as you decrease the value of lambda you retrieve the least squares solution and have low bias and high variability regularization is a technique that effectively balances the trade off between bias and variance in statistical modeling the inclusion of a large number of explanatory variables reduces the model is bias but simultaneously increases its variance which can lead to overfitting and an unrealistic representation of the data thing it like every estimation error has an effect which are increasing by the size of the estimated partial effect and thereby if we regularize our partial effects to be a bit smaller than the variable will fall and the bias will increase but by introduce a regularization parameter into our models we can now better control the trade off by introducing a regularization parameter it is possible to control the magnitude of the estimated partial effects and prevent overfitting while alternative methods such as ensemble modeling are available to handle high variance many ensemble methods also incorporate regularization to further improve the trade off between bias and variance it is important to note that the explanation provided here is simplified for intuitive understanding and a deeper understanding of the theory may reveal additional complexities in short regularization help you optimize the bias variance trade off and thereby improving your models accuracy rule of thumb if you do not want to read out loud your estimated parameters values because there are too many you should do regularization therealtiddlydump there are many techniques that just naturally regularize eg mixed effects models additionally many feature engineering techniques do this and some analysts do not even realize it such as a variance explained threshold when retaining principal components",

math hoping to get into industry and would like some advice to help pivot into it ideally would love to do so in data science i am familiar with programming since i have taken multiple cs courses in my undergrad and continue to use it in my research i am familiar with c python and java and mainly use mathematica in my work for the cs courses i have taken mainly programming and which focused on c and oop data structurse intro to computer graphics intro to database sql oop with java i have taken an internship in the past on machine learning for a space center in my country where used tensorflow in order to build a model that could identify meteors in the desert for my math related achievements my main focus was combinatorics i have papers published in graph theory and working in the field of knot theory currently which my thesis should hopefully by my published paper if things go well with my results my current worries is that i am severely underprepared for working in the industry since i do not have alot of projects under my belt i was planning to do freecodecamp but was wondering if that is sufficient to try to get an internship position or junior position as a data scientist analyst have a phd dabbled very lightly in machine learning and analysis it was a tool for my end product not the actual focus got contacted by a recruiter and they want to talk today wish me luck people it is been over six months since i last looked at anything related to my dissertation and my current job is unrelated to data science at all and barely covers the analysis part wish me luck i am definitely throwing a yolo here i really do not think this is going anywhere but at least i can use this as a learning opportunity for when i actually have prepped remarkable seesaw i am curious how hiring managers look at resume gaps in the ds field i have heard mixed news and i thought maybe this sub would be a good place to come and get field specific advice some more details i am currently a math postdoc but when my contract ends i would like to transition into data science however i am honestly quite burned out academia has been tough i would like to take a few months off months in order to travel latin america and improve my spanish i had always planned to do a trip like this between finishing the phd and starting a postdoc but could not at that time because of covid also in case it is relevant both the phd and the postdoc are at state schools in the us not like an ivy or anything any input would be appreciated honestly i will take some amount of time off regardless of the outcome i do not think that i have the energy to start a new career without some sort of a break but i will shorten lengthen the amount of time that i take off based on responses that i receive here legolasiam which websites you guys use to search for data science data analyst jobs i am using indeed and linkedin are there any better websites out there newcareerperson i have a friend of a friend not myself lol who has a degree in music education and has been working as a music coordinator at their local church for the past couple years they recently completed the google data analytics course and have reached out to me for advice on pursuing data science jobs how should i encourage this person to continue to develop given their background without breaking their spirit pun not intended lmao or would you say they are ready to apply to jobs since they have completed the google course almostfreitag hi all a couple of years ago i found a site with machine learning and statistics tutorials but it had this cool graph interface linking related models in a learning path well did not saved the link and cannot find it again came here in the hope anyone knows it what is your opinion on two year data science masters programs that are being given by top business schools in europe such as essec hec escp ie etc i know some of these programs are in collaboration with engineering schools from the same country but i am wondering if anybody knows what is their quality and if they are worth it especially if somebody wants to work in data science analytics additionally i would like your opinion on whether or not data science is a field worth getting into if your bachelor is degree is not from a stem major for background i have degree in mis which is a business degree but i am considering to get into data science if i could have a somewhat of lucrative career any input or help is greatly appreciated 1cb i am nearing the conclusion of my master is degree in mathematics some exams were about machine learning statistics quantitative finance quantum computing and optimization my university is a top math university in my country but i do not think the same is true for the rest of the world i would like to start my career in ds with an internship which are in your opinion the best companies to start from what can i do in these months to increase my chances of being hired securedropthewhistle it blows my mind how this industry is full of so many intelligent people and yet so many of them lack the ability to recognize that their colleagues are also smart and do not even get me started on the mansplaining not gender specific i see this come from all genders be directed towards all genders one moment you are at lunch trying to have a casual conversation with a co worker and all of the sudden you say something that does not align with how they live their life and so now all of the sudden they think you have a problem and then they try to proceed to indicate why it is a problem and that it should be changed to match the way they operate i do not even understand how i have seen these things in all of my most recent organizations yet it is not something i experienced very often before getting into data science sirpentyna i have in my development plan at work airflow jenkins we use neither but i still want to learn it how to quickly learn it for machine learning can you recommend some online resources which one is better i also mean better for a beginner to learn we use mostly azure and i have seen that airflow is developed mostly for aws and gcp is there maybe something better out there than airflow or jenkins that i should learn instead apart from that i am trying to learn docker could you please recommend some content regarding docker in ml projects i have been through some basic tutorial deploying web app but i would really appreciate something more related to ml thanks somekoreanhusky i have years exp in python r

are newly released and it could be that these roles were scheduled to go up before the layoffs hey all i am in a data science program at mit is professional school i have a good understanding of stats translating data into a story basic language etc the only thing i struggle with is retention of python code although i have no trouble reading it any suggestions i am only on my fourth week and it is a new topic every week so this program is fast and not super in depth like a masters would be i just graduated my mpp last spring and do not want to pay another yet tia pikachuforeveri have a question about what kind of roles are suitable for me about me working as a quantitative analyst at an asset management company for about years prior to that i worked a sas programmer at a cro main tool used at job is sas and excel but i have done some certs applied machine learning in python and r my skills and education ms stats sas certs specializations from cornell and columbia engineering in applied

degree that is not in stem every time i look at job postings the requirement seems to be a degree in stem or a related field how rigidly defined is related my context is i am hoping to change careers into data anything i am older and i have a kid so i do not want to waste tons more time i left grad school over a decade ago i have a master is and most of a phd in a field that was sort of a hybrid humanities soft social sciences my department was going to close so i quit while i was ahead no regrets a class i taught for a while in grad school had a research methods module and i edited dissertations on the side so i have some background in relevant areas it just probably does not look that way on paper so for years i have been freelancing mostly writing tutoring and editing more recently i have been doing some digital marketing stuff that involves light analytics and i have been putting a lot of time effort into ds self study i have tons of domain knowledge and i am trying to build up a portfolio but would i be excluded from the vast majority of jobs because my degrees are not explicitly related i would argue that the skills knowledge i gained from those degrees helped me learn how to learn and build the soft skills that would be useful but i suspect that hr filters would not see it that way does anybody have experience with or insight into this i would appreciate it so much radicalguy_ i am an entry level data analyst with r i took courses on datacamp for hours spend weeks have my own projects too but it still feels like i am very new and i am seeing myself using google or chatgpt for very basic stuff i can not go to masters as of now but i want to improve my data analysis skills and be an actual data analyst who will not have to google everything what should i do any advice fetalpositionalwaysz i am currently a data analyst who wants to be a data engineer or data scientist in the future as much as i want to self study in the field of the both career prospects i find myself using low to no code tools such as alteryx and excel though we use vba i am not very much motivated to use vba for my current job since i do not i will be able to use vba in transitioning to a data scientist or data engineer my question is is it right for me to feel unmotivated in using a tool that is not in line with my career prospects or should i still practice and use vba since it is still technically a transferrable skill and is used in my job thank you for any opinions cyrillite i am an entry level data analyst in a team that does not need sophisticated data analysis skills per se but would readily benefit from better data visualisation we pull data from open source data sets from economic data to ourworldindata to whatever else we often use data sets which are perfectly manageable inside of excel a few hundred or so rows at a time maybe rarely a couple of thousand i have access to powerbi i hear it is a significannot upgrade to the capabilities of excel and a friendly starting point for data visualisation for those used to other microsoft products is it where should i start do you have any recommended materials brutalboost i am a software engineering major set to graduate this fall i just started looking into the data science area and i have a few questions i only need more math classes to get my math minor i am thinking of taking classes in the fall instead of the normal to get the minor how helpful would the minor be in securing a job secondly i am seeing that a lot of places are requiring a masters degree would it be a good track to try getting on as a data engineer somewhere do my masters while working and then try moving to a data scientist position haplessoverestimate i am a software engineer turned graduate student

experience i have been given more significannot responsibilities in the company and i feel i am keeping up with them would it be reasonable to ask for jr to be removed should i wait for the year mark looking to switch jobs and could use some recommended resources so i finished a masters degree inn statistics in immediately after i started a phd in pure math and left after two years because of covid related reasons i got a job at an economic consulting firm about a year ago but it has not used my stats math background basically at all much of the work has been more like being an accountant and the rare times i do use my background it is for incredibly simplistic things my masters program did not place a huge emphasis on the cs side of data science much of it was focused on what to do after you have a nice clean data set moreover between the phd and my current job i am a little rusty have not used my background in a substantial way in a little over three years now i could use some suggestions on projects online courses etc that could dust off my skills and better acquaint me with the more cs side of things and help me move into a more engaging and better paying job divergingloss how would you phrase the action of researching and implementing relevant algorithms architectures from academic papers for a project into a resume bullet minorenji hello i am currently a year undergrad double majoring in cs and mathematics wanting to break into data science i am considering getting a master is but i am not sure what degree i should prepare for i was considering an ms in data science but i have been reading that maybe one in statistics or even cs might be better something convenient that i could take advantage of is that my school offers a year master is program for current cs undergrads and i could try to specialize in something that would help me find a job later syzygy_ i am a professional engineer in the aec industry looking for a life change i graduated from a well known engineering university in where i had some exposure to matlab and learned coding basics over the last year i have been learning data science in python through dataquest and have been hitting the books to brush up on statistics i have not been that serious about a career change to this point but i am ready to change that and want to get myself ready for serious job searching by the end of the year i have a year old child and do not have the means to leave my current job but i can commit at least hours per week to my goals as a complete newcomer to the domain industry how can i prepare myself to be taken seriously when applying for jobs what is the value of analytics and data science i feel like analysis products do not make a significannot impact at least the average analytic roles it seems like software data engineering provides tangible value to a company and data science is the icing on the cake how do you provide value in your current job i would like some advice on how best i can transition my skills into data science a little about me graduated with a bachelor of science majoring in mathematics in im halfway through a year supply chain operations graduate program proficient in using r with some java and python experience at my current company there is not a data scientist role yet as i live in a small country but there is certainly a push towards digitalization and i have heard whispers of senior management looking into this side of things i have got a year left and plenty of flexibility within my program to undertake a few courses what is my best starting point to gain a more rounded skillset as well as begin to prove the worth of a data scientist within my organisation stitchhwitchh i am hoping to make a career transition into data science and i would love some advice and perspective i have a bs in environmental science which was a biochem degree at my school and i work in tech i spent years in tech support but transitioned last year into software asset management i have been working on learning python and sql but i really struggle with self paced learning would a bootcamp be a good idea should i go a different route vortexcock i am working in the construction field for the last years as a civil engineer however i did not like my field and wanted a change im learning data science for the last years with the help of udemy youtube and other bootcamps and have done projects in python sql power bi and tableau i just want a suggestion that how should i update my resume that i get good amount of calls from the hr should i put my year civil engineering experience in the resume or just put myself a fresher because right now i have updated my resume with experience and i get a lot of calls from the hr but they do not proceed further when i tell them my current salary anyone from a non cs background ideally a statistics background become a machine learning engineer here what all did you learn i am heading into a ms program in statistics and would consider mle as an internship to gain experience however with my lack of cs knowledge i do not know how easy this will be ryandine anyone have some good resources on data science in the biotech or life science field i have been looking around for decent datasets or good articles that explain it i teach mostly the tech business side of things and i always have a few students interested in life science i want to explore this field more or play around with data from it so i can better support these students crystallitex how normal is it for a sql query to take minutes or more to load im currently learning sql with a coursera course called managing big data with mysql i am on the end of week where i need to work on left joining two or more table and one of that table contain million rows and the query takes forever to load is this because of bad database using teradata for the exercise or this is a normal thing when you work with big data as data analyst i will be starting my bachelor of data science in february next year what should i start learning now to help me get a head start on my degree fetalpositionalwaysz hello i am a geoscience major fresh graduate who wanted to enter the field of data science and analytics although my major did not involve a lot of programming i self studied for like months to gain basic to intermediate understanding of machine learning statistics data processing etc i successfully got my first job as a data analyst recently but the tech stack that is used to do the tasks alteryx vba were not in line with the tech stack that i want to use python r and practice now since i want to be a data scientist or data engineer i would want to gain experience on using the tech stack that i want to practice should i incorporate python r in my job to able to get into my career prospects or not if so how abdoughnut i jumped right into deep learning and only briefly studied regression methods are there any courses or learning avenues for learning and applying data science fundamentals my goal is to land an entry level data science position ms applied physics background el pistolero i have a couple of doubts can you please help me clear those i am have completed my graduation in btech mechanical with cgpa this is a red line i want to pursue masters in data science or ai from germany as i do not have a very high budget so is it possible for me to get admission there in a public university with low grades and a background in mechanical engineering also i have work ex of around years around year in supply chain and year in python sql excel mongo db not purely as a data analyst but an overall mixed kind of job cocodirichlet this is going to be country dependent it sounds you are not in the us so you should reach out to people working in your country and talk to them because of the math background that you have maybe look into the financial sector you do not sound underprepared mizmato it sounds like you are pretty well prepared if you are interested in finance i would suggest looking at the quant career track for a company that uses ml ai we have had hires that have had backgrounds in econometrics to condensed matter physics the common denominator is that you have to be an expert in math colickingseahorse ds interviews are notoriously all over the place from being a stats cs style interview to a vibe check good luck and do not beat yourself up if you do not perform well if they have a technical section legolasiam good luck cocodirichlet i do not think anyone is going to bat an eye with a gap on your resume particularly now mizmato indeed monster linkedin i also looked up the top companies in my domain and went directly to their websites and applied to them colickingseahorse you can tell them to apply but significannotly temper their expectations it might take a few months to a year to find their first role ds entry level market is stiff and most entry level roles from what i have seen which is only a sliver of the market to be fair are filled through recruiting channels that already exist i am part of a company and helping with recruiting this year we almost exclusive recruit from schools we already have relationships with or provide return offers to interns you should gently let them know that they will have an extremely difficult time getting hired in this market with that experience troublepuffs i had a ba in information science and the google data analytics certification when i applied for my current data analyst role i had a portfolio of projects that i could showcase as well as some student work experience working with data the certificate alone is not going to help them get a job and they are going to have to work really had to showcase their skills i would also recommend they get ace the data science interview it was really helpful for me to see what a technical question would look like and to know where i might be lacking in skills wouldatastoryteller i would encourage them to broaden their job search beyond jobs that have data or analytics or analyst in the title accept any role that touches data no matter how basic i was able to pivot to my first analytics role at my last company because i was doing data analysis in my marketing role but i was pretty much only working in excel haplessoverestimate i think that dataquestio used to have a graph well a tree if we want to be technical of their different learning paths data analyst data scientist data engineer i took a look at the site recently and it does not appear to be there any more though troublepuffs i have a ba in information science and i now work as a data analyst at a major us tech company and i absolutely think data science is worth getting into my company as well as others are focusing more and more on all the ways they can use the data they produce or get and are expanding roles in those areas im applying to grad schools in europe and while i did not look at any of the business schools the other top programs that i found seem to be much more focused and intensive than in the us even mid tier schools have some impressive programs wouldatastoryteller what country are you in cocodirichlet are links to a tutorial at the end datamasteryacademy you have a very good chance of transitioning into data analytics since you already have knowledge in python and sql and also you have stats degree these are ideal conditions i think you can benefit from getting into a bootcamp or a program since they teach everything you need in to months or so you can put the bootcamp on your resume too which would solidify you skills the good ones also help with portfolio building if you go with self study route and find online courses here and there this could take longer but it actually depends on how much you will spare time to study and also how much you know about what you need to learn either way i think your chances are very high for transitioning into data analytics good luck colickingseahorse i am sure you have already looked into this but can you look at opportunities within your company colickingseahorse apply anyway layoff or not the worst response you would get is a rejection cocodirichlet check twitter i saw they posted some recently there like in january someone that works there had also posted it so it was not just an official spotify account cocodirichlet code academy for python code also buy a book and follow the book read it copy the code into your computer do exercises colickingseahorse i think analyst roles at big pharma and in finance are your best bet they still use sas and your experience will not count against you once you actually get in though i would push to use languages that are more versatile so your exit opportunities from your next role are still good mizmato what did you do during your msds any projects or research papers what domain do you want to work in finance there is a lot of variables to consider i would suggest taking the lower paying jobs and that is very low just to have ds on your resume while there continue applying to other jobs and networking that will put you in a decent position when the job market turns for the better you will have a hard time until you actually get your first ds job at which point your education will not matter nearly as much network a ton and try to find someone who can understand what you have to offer cold applying to jobs online is not likely to be successful for you finetrainerfrom my perspective it would be tough to be given a chance without either domain specific educational or work experience at least for anything more than an entry level position a big part of the job is usually also communication in a business context and that is hard to have via self study colickingseahorse i have got a phd where half of my thesis project was writing code my previous role involved writing code and my current role involves writing code i constantly google the simplest stuff i google a little bit less than before but i still google a lot do not worry about googling is it affecting your job performance aka are your bosses and teammates mad at you because you cannot turn around an analysis fast enough if not then keep googling eventually you will google less and less but you will still google a bunch also chatgpt is awesome for writing code nothing wrong with leveraging it being a data analyst is about taking a business requirement and coming up with an analytical solution with the tools you have do vba if your job requires it it will not make you much more attractive for ds roles study python for that what is your end goal impress your boss build skills to get a different job cocodirichlet if you did software engineering there are a lot of paths you can follow so why ds you said you just started looking into ds have you taken machine learnings courses did you complete a capstone project related to ml i would look into different avenues and because you have software engineer bachelor degree look into certification you can do like a cloud certification which would help with data engineering if it is between having a cloud certification and a math minor having a cloud certification is probably better switchorganic how helpful would the minor be in securing a job minors do not really move the needle when it comes to jobs think of them like icing on the cake if you already have a strong profile then the minor is a nice bonus if you do not the minor will not do anything for you would it be a good track to try getting on as a data engineer somewhere do my masters while working and then try moving to a data scientist position sure a lot of people do part time programs while working myself included troublepuffs i got a data analyst role right out of school and now i am researching online grad programs in data science if you can handle the workload i would go to school while working wait months before you begin not only will you have the formal education and those projects but you might be able to find mentorship within your company and that is and invaluable resource switchorganic i think this is good overall but this bullet does not really fit with the rest can you expand on it a bit assisted with pitching proof of concept to cto and senior vps legolasiam looks amazing switchorganic if you mean on your resume linkedin you can remove them whenever if you are asking hr to change your official title it is worth asking but i would not be surprised if a title change required a promotion or something cocodirichlet finance is a sector in which they often look for strong math skills i do not know what you mean by cs side of things if you know python and can do modeling then that might be enough for some jobs that require strong math background rather than start a project i would find which field would it be good to go into look at the job ads and then do a project aimed at that area implement worried ideally you would tie it to the project and what the project results were year could be valuable depending on how advanced you are how much you can learn and unfortunately how good a school you go you may able to go straight into industry can you take ml courses before you graduate cocodirichlet you are a year why are you thinking of a grad degree now the year masters could be useful however in my experience doing a ba and ms in the same subject at the same university does not add a lot to your growth you have the same professors the same focus curriculum the advantage of studying in different universities is that you have a different environment and focus if you were doing a ba in business and planning an ma in accounting all in the same university okay that is useful but in your case you will more like do a longer bachelor degree i have seen undergrads in honors programs taking graduate level courses so that is a possible avenue into doing something different also see into being an ra for a professor or professors prepare your portfolio for internships and apply early moscowgordon typically software engineers do not like doing r and d or data analysis they are most effective when you give them exact specifications of what a system should do so they can focus on implementation data science analytics involves a lot of investigative work trying to figure out why some number came out the way it did and a lot of trial and error to get some mathematical procedure often along the lines of regression or hypothesis test to give you a result you are happy with colickingseahorse i work in finance data science has overarching use cases that are interrelated reporting run of the mill reporting on how marketing initiatives are doing etc experimentation setting up well designed experiments to learn something could be about our customers the macroeconomic condition optimizing ad copies etc machine learning identifying customers most likely to respond to marketing predicting profitability risk scoring customer segmentation fraudulent transactions etc finance has afiak pretty mature uses for data science the data is often messy at varying levels of documentation and institutional knowledge aka the most tenured ds knows which tables to query to do x thing but the needs are mature and i have seen pretty good outcomes in delivering value from models frankly i am not sure a bootcamp will get you a job either the market is flooded with fresh bootcamp graduates who honestly are mostly pretty useless when they first start their jobs stitchhwitchh i would prefer for money reasons to try and stick it out with self paced learning but i am hesitant to struggle for months only to find out my resume is not enough on its own without any formal schooling in the field cptcongcong i come from physics background and work as mle if you are focusing mostly on deployment then you will need to improve on some programming skills they are not too hard it is not like you need to develop complex graphs binary trees it is more like knowing oop programming monkeyunited million rows oh yea this is going to take time it is definitely not rare to be working with millions of rows on sql server but there are ways around it such as creating an aggregated view that is refreshed overnight securedropthewhistle some queries can take somewhere between and hours and generally depends on things like rdbms queue how queries are prioritized how efficient you write your sql query rules that your company has in place to prevent long queries that consume too many resources etc and personally i like to break the queries up into smaller chunks such that they get prioritized by my companies rdbms cptcongcong learn python monkeyunited islr it was with a recruiter and it actually went really well he seem very enthusiastic about forwarding me and told me there would be two interviews with the company does not sound like there is a super in depth tech portion but i am still worried about that luckily it seems like i will have time to prep if the company likes my resume remarkable seesaw thanks i am glad to hear that nicksinghtechcareers author here really appreciate the mention and glad that it was helpful to you thank you so much for your input could you name a few of the programs you were viewing 1cb italy sirpentyna thanks thanks throwawayghostall of my classes were projects and i produced two research papers i have of my presentations uploaded on youtube and described and linked on my resume i have the bigger paper described on my resume too i left off the other paper my capstone because multiple people told me they could not understand it even after i reworded it a couple of times the presentations were developing an ad targeting strategy using knn on store sales demographic data predicting demographic data using random forests a series of tableau dashboards about journalist media worker deaths worldwide in the last years the paper was about predicting financial hardship during the covid recession again using demographic data i also predicted changes in median income within and credit card debt within clearly none of this is the least bit impressive or enough to get me a job im actually open to any domain i currently work in corporate customer service adjacent to higher ed and would like to get out of the higher ed part i just want to find something practical that an employer will pay me at least to do throwawayghostwhat is very low another problem has been that it does not seem like these jobs have any potential to turn into anything else it is not like a job at amazon or something for example one of them was at a small university on a three person team i currently make and get days of pto this place was paying with days of pto and it seems very little chance of moving up two other places seemed to be very demanding about their tech tests one expected me to spend my weekend doing theirs at the last minute emailed me friday night if it were a bigger org that might be something but you know i got this degree to try to make more moneynot less with a month less of pto lol surely there is something else i can learn that would at least actually get me over the mark soursensuousness thank you this is helpful if you do not mind here is another question when i was in academia i was involved in a lot of conferences professional organizations because they were generally a great way to network and get involved and sometimes get free foodand to always get tons of tote bagsbut not all conferences organizations were helpful good as relevant as they sounded based on descriptions or even legit is it similar in ds are there any conferences or professional organizations that are welcoming to newcomers or is that not as much of a thing in ds soursensuousness thanks i really appreciate this radicalguy_ thanks for your comment alright then i will continue to work and improve myself cyrillite be useful and build skills that will prepare me for more serious roles brutalboost i am actually in a neural networks course and an artificial intelligence course right now my capstone is also ml nn based so between those that is kinda where the curiously began i am actually getting an aws certificate for a course project as well i also feel like i do not have a super clear path on the specialty i want to pursue in the industry i am a very data driven person and really enjoy numbers so i figured it might be a good fit haplessoverestimate most of the jobs i have applied for have explicitly mentioned comfort communicating results to non technical audiences as a requirement so i wanted something on there to get at that i will see about reworking that bullet any recommendations minorenji yeah there are a couple ml courses you can take as an undergrad but i am not sure how in depth they go i do plan to take as many stats probability classes in math and ml data related classes in cs as i can my school is pretty known for its cs program uw seattle not sure about data science that is great thank you for sharing your perspective i am still new to the industry so i am still learning would you say data science as a whole provides monetary value i have yet to be a part of a project or company whose ds department provides experimentation ml which equates to direct economic value it usually comes down to some software or proprietary data that generates the most roi then some data scientists or analysts leverage those tools and datasets within the company for customers consultants self paced learning is difficult especially in parallel to a full time job do not give up you are awesome keep going crystallitex i see i thought it was because of bad db system or something thank you for the answer crystallitex thank you for the answer i see if the need arise to join a table even with smaller chunks i figure this still take some minutes to run is it cocodirichlet there are remote volunteer opportunities so you could also do that while you are traveling if you can put a couple of hours per week that could lessen your gap and get you some hands on experience in data analytics or data science mizmato i think those papers are a good start while you are open to any domain i think it is a good idea to really narrow down to just one or two sometimes it is better to be a specialist than a good generalist for example i aimed at finance and i pivoted my research experience in the context of finance and that got me some interviews better to have something that gets your experience on your resume even if it is heavily underpaid and you cannot move up then have nothing at all when you get experience it will be easier to get noticed for some of the higher paying job there definitely are lots of conferences but i cannot tell you which ones are legit probably the bigger the better for your purposes switchorganic if you find yourself looking up the same things over and over it might be worth it to make your own cheat sheet i keep a markdown file with snippets i semi frequently use that i reference from time to time troublepuffs if you boss says they do not care about the enhanced data vis can you still use it i do not see how gaining that skill would be a bad thing as long and it does not make your work more difficult i use udemy only buy the courses when they are on sale for everything and they have great courses on powerbi here are the ones i used power bi desktop for business intelligence power bi the practical guide microsoft certification course da power bi data analyst cocodirichlet there are positions that are cloud data engineer with a focus on machine learning for instance check linkedin for cloud data engineer professional services google cloud or also strategic cloud engineer conversational artificial intelligence those are examples but there are many similar ones i just know the google positions but they are software engineer positions and i know they are hiring and will keep hiring this might be something you are interested in you can check for this type of thing in other companies switchorganic sorry i think the concept behind the bullet is good i more so meant the bullet felt a bit weak relative to the other bullets with the lack of details or metrics could you add some context to the outcome of the pitch or how you created the presentation visualizations and tools used cocodirichlet uw has one of the best stats departments i would do stats over ds colickingseahorse yes but it is more like a turbocharger one way we quantify the value add of an ml model for example a model that predicts propensity to respond to an ad is to usually do a small holdout that contains the full population rather than the targeted bunch we can compare response rates within the holdout and the ml model targeted population if your response rate is higher in the ml targeted population you can tie that back to a direct dollar value add of the model existing from what i have seen our models perform reasonably well and drive additional value to the company when the model stops performing well we collect fresh data and then build a new one remarkable seesaw i had not heard of that do you have any examples of what you are talking about throwawayghostfinance sounds a bit conservative for me although of course i am not picky do you know what other options there are and what did you specifically do to gain domain expertise in finance throwawayghostwow wish i would known all the stats about starting salaries in this field being were complete lies i would never have bothered with another degree radicalguy_ thank you thats really a good idea i am planning write some couple of functions for reproducibility i will also do this brutalboost awesome i will look into these thanks for all the info haplessoverestimate i see maybe something like pitched and demoed proof of concept with a custom frontend to a panel of ctos and senior management cocodirichlet hackforla code for america google things like data science for social good colickingseahorse datakind delta analytics mizmato out of my msds program i was mostly a generalist i had some project research experience in medical ds and military intelligence ds i tried and applied for quant ds roles with minimal financial knowledge just a week of studying the very basics i think quants might be the outlier since all they require is strong mathematical knowledge in fact one of our more recent hires studied condensed matter physics not related to finance at all as for other domains ds analysis is everywhere you could also consider government work or working for non profits but the pay will definitely be lower switchorganic they are not lies i think you just have a very strict criteria based on your previous posts and there are not many opportunities that fit your criteria at the entry level please correct me if i am wrong but it seems like you are looking for a role that pays starting has comparable pto to your current role is fully remote not open to relocation or hybrid work has a low barrier to entry or less competitive interview process i think you will need to compromise on some of these to get a higher paying role right off the bat switchorganic just an idea but i think you could shift some of the details from bullet into bullet and expand on the recommendation engine instead example demoed a proof of concept book search and recommendation engine for pearson is digital product catalog to cto and senior vps as part of a product pitch developed a rank based recommendation system for e books and online texts with tech stack throwawayghost_ and after reading about median starting salaries around i was hoping for at least to leave my current job i am now being told on here to accept or lower which is even less than i currently make i have stated multiple times that i know i will never find anywhere near my current pto that is basically out of the question remote is preferred yes because i have been working remotely for almost eight years i have also been applying to jobs local to me with no luck i am open to relocation in certain circumstances what i have been seeing is contract roles that require you to move around the country at the drop of a hat that sounds sketchy to me i have also seen some that do not pay for relo and still pay in the range that is not going to happen like the pto thing i do not think your last point is realistic and never said anything about that i realize i am going to have to do technical interviews that are hard af my complaints on here have not been about doing them in general but being expected to do it last minute over the weekend told late friday night apparently needed to have it done by monday morning it is really very frustrating when people misconstrue everything i have written to make me look demanding all of the above is perfectly reasonable haplessoverestimate demoed a proof of concept book search and recommendation engine for pearson is digital product catalog to cto and senior vps as part of a product pitch oh i like these definitely using them thanks for the feedback switchorganic i think all of your points are reasonable but the roles that meet all of them at the entry level are few in number that is why i am saying you may need to compromise at least for the first role i apologize for inferring you were looking for an easy interview process is the median for ds or da roles i could believe it for ds roles but i think the median da role would be much lower while not a perfect reference glassdoor lists the median entry level pay for a da at and for ds you may be able to leverage your previous experience to get a senior role in the same field if you are open to relocating look for companies listing full time positions on the company is website i do not think i have ever seen contractor roles listed on a company is own career page companies will typically be more willing to foot relocation if pto is really important to you i would consider looking at government roles or roles in finance banking as they typically follow federal and bank holidays it is a good way to get an extra days off per year on top of your pto i work in fintech banking and i get days off per year between bank holidays floating holidays and pto it is obviously not as good as your current situation but it is probably the closest you will get at entry level throwawayghostjust months ago i was interviewed for a contract position and an fte position both ds both remote switchorganic just months ago i was interviewed for ds as mle roles at faang paying over but those same roles are unavailable now if you are confident you can get an offer for one of those contract roles or fte roles then keep doing what you are doing if not you may need to figure out what compromises you need to make till you can get one of those roles best of luck to you",

  "high variance you get very different different parameters depending on the data sample thus it fits the sample data very well which goes hand in hand with a low in sample bias high bias the parameters dont fit the sample data very well as they dont change so much if you use a different data sample thus you have a lower variance this is the reason why one usually refers to this as the bias variance tradeoff basically its about not to overfit too high variance while also not to underfit too high bias your data the phenomenon commonly referred to as bias in regression analysis refers to the issue of omitted variable bias when an important explanatory variable is omitted from a linear regression model the estimated coefficients for the included variables can become biased leading to incorrect forecasts and predictions to mitigate this issue one may consider using a large set of explanatory variables to minimize the bias however this approach can also result in an increase in the variance of the model as the parameters are estimated from a sample rather than the entire population therefore it is a trade off between reducing bias and increasing variance the use of more variables can reduce bias but it also increases the variance and vice versa the explanation above is a bit simplified and centered around ols to make it more intuitive bayesianking check the bias variance trade off statsnpolisci it is very similar to the difference between precision and accuracy highly precise consistently hitting the same spot this is similar to low variance you may not hit the bulls eye but you will not have very many arrows spread out across the board they will all be in a very similar location on the target highly accurate hitting close to the bullseye most of the time but not necessarily all of the time this is similar to low bias your arrows will be centered around the bullseye but may be spread pretty far around the target sometimes we choose a low variance slightly biased measure it will be slightly off of the bullseye biased inaccurate but we know that most of the arrows will be very close to the same spot low variance this can sometimes be better than a high variance unbiased measure where the arrows will tend towards the bullseye unbiased but be far away too often high variance the issue you are having is defining what the bias and variance are of i think most of us are assuming variance and bias are referencing the estimates of coefficients bias means that the forecasting method has a tendency to lean in one direction if this is the case if you had data that would say anytime the x direction moves y should move then a biased estimator would result in samples frequently being closer to than variance of the coefficients is referencing how much the coefficients would change if you took another sample this means if truth says if x moves y should move then a high variance estimator may swing between and for the value of y depending on the random sample you take high variance gives little opportunity braveforeverhave you tried google i hear it has great explanations therealtiddlydump this might be the easiest thing to google ever",

  "colibriweiss not using git is a huge major flag from both sides company and candidate therealtiddlydump git is non negotiable thephoenixrisesagain of course i use git and i firmly advice my team to do it it is in fact way easier to handle than local files you need like day okay maybe a week to get used to it and you will never look back i have been using git for years and would have it no other way it is especially useful for the process of transforming raw data into useable data for the org taoudi i couldnt imagine working on anything in a production environment without git johnyjames not using or resisting using git for any kind of reason is the biggest red flag in the industry please do not mention any arguments about not using it at some interview in any kind of way because the whole purpose of using version control is to improve your development cycle and productivity i would instantly reject candidates that resist using version control thedagomick i manage a team of data scientists at a fortune company and force my team to use git and github heavily without question the established ds teams where i am at those that have technical leadership all follow the same that said there are many teams without technical leadership that are hiring ds now and the use of version control software development patterns is not being adopted by those teams quite as in depth you correctly called it out they care more about having results as soon as possible with nothing or very little documentation rather than doing things properly this is very real my boss gives two shits that i use git and github despite it being the very reason many of our reports models and pipelines have persisted the test of time and many developers iterating on them despite little incentive and little reward getting git used requires someone in middle management to make a stand that git github will be heavily used because they see the long term need of it lyscannothrope i have been using code versioning well since i have started working years and i ca not imagine working without it there are only advantages and no drawback apart for the time to learn it up to very basic level your code is safe you can switch back and forth it makes you remember what was the last thing you had done on this project i usually have too much project going on or long wait time before new dates it allows you to work with colleagues without fiddling with files just to name a few to be honest every trainees or junior needs to comply to our best practices or it wo not do git is part of it of course any newcomers can help and improve on these best practices oh and btw i request that external companies that work with me push their work on our git it makes it so much easier to review the code and be efficient in the project all in all you can say that i use version control and not just local files barrycarter just yesterday i discovered git branch and git merge squash and i now see how people can use git for everything basically i can edit and save files in my own working branch to create backups and say things like this version gives only errors which are helpful to me but not to people on github or whatever then when i feel i have made enough progress to push to github i do a squash merge and am good to go related tip do not go git add or similar to the branch you push okay to do it in working branch if you are anything like me most of the files you are using are just for stuff you are doing not stuff others would need i joined a fintech startup in the uk around a year and a half ago after a three month ds internship during the internship i worked with a team who were religious about using git pull requests and proper code reviews it was daunting to learn at first but i came to appreciate how vital a tool it is for organisational purposes when developing any kind of software the fintech startup i joined after graduation did not use git whatsoever within the data science team which was just my manager myself and one other junior data scientist when i joined i tried my best to impress upon both of them why we should be following proper procedures and organise our code files appropriately and my manager did listen somewhat but our use of it has been very spotty over the last year my impression is that in small startups there is such pressure to get products up and running and into production that there is very little focus on taking the time to properly create version control history and useful documentation for the future it is honestly a huge business risk right now we have multiple products that are nearing release to customers and the junior data scientist that joined with me just left for a significannot pay rise my manager is not hands on whatsoever and so i am now the only person that actually knows how the code works for multiple projects that are vital to the company is success even worse there is no documentation about nearly anything and each time i bring this up to my manager i am resisted because we have urgent deadlines to meet im looking to leave too as i am massively underpaid tldr my anecdotal experience about small companies matches your own but i probably would not say this in an interview i would likely talk about how i joined an early stage company and pushed to bring in proper software development practices even if i were only partially successful in that endeavour picapaodiablo any company that is not using version control should be avoided like the plague back in in that means that there is no devops or ml ops production pushes are manual and i cannot even contemplate how qa works they are clearly could not be a branching strategy so i am not sure how hot fixes work or most anything else of consequence lambradio if you do not use some kind of version control you have never written enterprise critical production code po handz i try to use got as much as possible and use it of the time for school personal projects but at work i have never been given a github repo which i find to be wild typically given very little resources it is like companies think git is only for deployment and engineering teams then they wonder why data science has such reproducibility issues meankingi guess it can vary for company but i would imagine most there is absolutely no way my company could go without git johndburger i have used git or older version control systems for even my hobby code for twenty plus years frankly seems nuts to me not to cowboykm i am analyst scientist i always use git even in adhoc analyses in which i work solo there are plenty of advantages to it it is a good habit even working alone you keep everything tidy someone might wish to review your work even your future self summing up the analysis on the readme you have a backup prehensiledick once you use version control you never go back to not using version control pryomancermtga total side note i am glad this is a discussion rather than can i become a ds after boot camp x that said currently a small comp and trying to transition away from the local caksters i hope you are joking sounds like you clearly havent worked with git git does not slow you down in fact it is the opposite git helps people to share code you always know who made the change if someone makes a error you can immediately revert back to the working version in matter of few minutes version control helps you to be more productive it baffles me that today there are professionals who write code and do not use version control to store it edit it baffles me that there are data science teams where management do not encourage using git they care more about having results as soon as possible with nothing or very little documentation rather than doing things properly so i did as they ask come on bruh umbrelamafia git is mostly for file storage for me i almost never need to return to old versions i only use local files and have never used git anything goalhuman i will just say this without using git and using local files you have been doing it the hard way this entire time so good for you your life is about to get a lot easier at work sendcumulus definitely use git next level would be requiring review of pull requests requiring commented code requiring tests using a linter etc i have been disappointed these have not been used at some startups but git cmon ravingneuroscientist in the organization i work for we use git with all data science projects i also use it in like of my personal side projects minimaxir the only reason to be hesitant about version control is jupyter notebooks with messy large outputs since that can create large diffs the amount of effort and time necessary to get productive with git is near zero and the benefits are immediate so i would never not use it except for something i am writing as some one off test example of something there is a lot you can do with git but you do not need to something like six basic commands init add commit clone push pull are all i need on a regular basis and using them costs near zero time compared to writing the code the benefit of being able to experiment with changes without fear of losing something that was working is immediately felt as well as the ability to back up code remotely in case of something like a hardware failure pryomancermtga saved on shared drive finalbuildver3_ edit finalbuildattritionmoddtver4r well contrary to the other people my org will not let us use git because is open source version control is pycharm history of the script which works fine i guess delaynomorei can actually share the same experience with you i was working on independent project within the academia and no one in my field will ever use git i got the same question and honestly it is kind of embarrassing to answer the truth and and another problem with my team right now commercial setting is that my boss uses excel to do modelling tarehman it would be unthinkable to do data science without version control systems in every place i have worked for the better part of a decade if i see a place not using version control for their data science it tells me a lot about their maturity level weonlycryalone this is something i see at small companies not just in data science at my last company i was part of the rollout of devops and there was serious resistance it was an extra process unnecessary we all work fine together etc but it makes sense for scaling in analytics it is harder to version sure if you have functions and models check those into version control but actual weekly runs of analytics and their results are better suited for writing to database been there teams that use git get long term compounding returns not using git is symptomatic of leadership that does not care about quality or consistency of the work which is a terrible place to be as an engineer find a team that values git bamwhamkapau the only time i did not use git was when i was working at a social science research lab as a data analyst the director knew what version control was and all of the data analysts including myself tried to push for it but our director did not think he could reliably teach the phds how to use it i still think he is wrong but not much we could have done without his support i have had push back from cs interns about using git properly some do not want to use it at all others do not see the point of using branches and want to push everything to main they always use the same excuses about it slowing them down usually they will have two disasters losing code or breaking the code base before they finally listen to me morebento_ all the time even for simple stuff it is good discipline like backlog refinement and attending daily stand ups firstbullfroggit is non negotiable neither for me as a teamlead nor myself as a data scientist and even though we are a really small team it is so easy to scale and implement in projects for example we do not use a rigid pull request policy since most projects are done by one person but still it is so much easier safer and best practice to use it for standardization and general best practice i cannot see any downside to it since it is also really simple to include in one is tech stack edit typo this post gives me war flashback when my teammates send me their works via chat email use it op it is very useful caksters totally agree if op said that to me in an interview i would not hire him purely because of the attitude that he thinks it is for big companies and he thinks it slows him down aminelemaizi yes it is an industry standard now version controlling and ci cd because git is open source my org will not let us have it lmao eegocentrik art of the deal how so i have never used it we test code locally and deploy it on the cloud what benefit does git really have kingdomxander i guess that was one of the reasons previous teams in the past did not bother to use it jaja kingdomxander i mean i did not say i am not going to work with git i was just honest saying i did not in the past because the team did not do it and me as a junior was following instructions in fact i said i think i should get used to easily but think that as a junior at least for me i expect to learn some stuff from the team and i simply was unlucky that previous teams did not now i am in more powerfull position and i want to do things properly so as said in the update i will try to start using it this week kingdomxander yeah i am happy to all the mates that were taught since very beginning about it but that was not my case anyway i am glad i am asked so now know that i have to learn properly and start using it as soon as possible therealtiddlydump all programming is collaborative even if you are just collaborating with your past self version control is one of the most important technological developments of the past years full stop kingdomxander i think you nailed for me normally i do not really add too much except for early versions so i will take a look to those commands after watching some tutorials if they do not conver thank you very much for the tip kingdomxander yeah i think our history is kind of similar about why the no use in git in fact some in the company i worked the longest for after my team disappeared workmate left for pay raise and later boss left for her own business i had to take everything being the only documentation the one i took notes when asked them luckily we were friends so it wasnt like i am leaving f you not my job anymore i joined to other team bussiness control that of course had nothing to do with data science but at least was analytical when i left it was a disaster for what some friends told me but what can you expect when i was working on projects do not let me time to document properly keep adding more projects and i was basically the only one that knew python so they had to ask for help to others teams kingdomxander thats true i said that in the update missionstaryou can still use git locally without github kingdomxander i think my case was that even though they are big companies the department i worked for was starting with data scientist so maybe others departement did work properly kingdomxander i wish i was joking but unfortunately in previous where i was more junior they did not use it so i do not say i am right in fact i am asking just to see real opinion rather than possible pay ads about why use it and i am seeing i need to change that so i will definitely waste time changing that whether they like or not ps just to add some info i think i did not have deploy anything in the past because if you can run it locally daily weekly why waste money lyscannothrope actually this is one of the reason that i ask junior not to use it at all then once they get a bit further with a correct project structure we explain our way to use it as a way to document the existing codebase kingdomxander i will take a look to pycharm too thanks chitinid wait what why will not they allow open source kingdomxander run away as soon as you can long story short when i had to move within the same company to another team my new boss at first was happy with python then worry about what if i leave so he tried to make me do my python scripts in excel i had a serious talk about why was a bad idea because he studied business so no tech guy and that my future is python not excel so if he continue pushing it with excel i am leaving he said they wanted to implement bla bla but they need time guess what after weeks he asked me again about some excel stuff and i started job hunting until i got one offer and half later approximately brisketsundae i once had a team leader a peer at the time say something like we do not use source control because our code changes to often the team was a team of sysadmins who had moved into a devops engineering he was dead serious that was years ago and i still cringe kingdomxander oh i do not say it slows me in the day by day but it needs some preparation at the beginning as said before i kind of know how it is but only because i am curious unfortunately in my previous companies i did not have any senior lead that wanted to used it i do not know if i express myself wrong since english is not my first language or maybe you read it wrong but what i said is that i worked for big companies in my country top but not that big outside that did not use it at least in the department i worked for but as i am reading all of you i think i should bring it in my current job gatdarntootin i do not understand autumnotter that is like saying that they will not let you use python or c or sql nofarcastplz so you are saying that you deploy it to a different environment and you expect it to work you really sound like a fresh grad who calls it worked on my machine how do you revert when you have production issues you have multiple local versions what if you work with multiple members on the same files you ask them to send their version over teams or do pair programming only sounds like i am hiring dev for the price of how do you check code standards integration benchmarking validation you run local scripts to check each time before sending it to the production environment johnyjames yeah and documentation is the single most important thing in any kind of project and some practices are like that for a reason not using version control is not obvious to some why it is not used but if you think down the road it will bite you pretty hard same for project documentation delaynomoremy boss is better in this case since he is a scientist by training so he did not pus me to use excel and allow me to use whatever i see fits but still the overall tech level of the company is even worse than the academia even tho most of the people are master phd in science i think i am gonna quit once i finish this part of the project couldusesomecowbell perhaps you do not quite understand why revision control is so important even if working solo it is so incredibly easy to make changes that have unintended consequences it is also easy to lose records of what your own code looked like before one or more changes now imagine trying to understand what is been changed over the course of time when multiple people have been making changes or imagine it is late on friday afternoon you have had a very busy week and now you really need to restore things to the way they were on wednesday so that you can go home for the weekend oh shit with revision control you get to see not only what changed when it was changed and by whom but you can also enforce pull requests so that code changes must undergo peer review before implementation i hope that helps some very old way orgs want to have someone responsible for the software their employees uses if something breaks you have who to blame and who to ask for it to be fixed asap pryomancermtga you really sound like a fresh grad i have been doing this for years and the only time i have used git is in my masters ds classes just because that is the only way you as know how to do it does not mean it is the only way version control is important and git is a solid system but it is not the only way and it is not the universal way i create scripts locally and then test it on the live environment before deployment you are incredibly short sighted to believe that git is required in every use case i develop slack integrations and data tools for internal business use what production issues that is what testing is for kingdomxander oh i do like to document my code not only for my mates but for myself of the future jajaja vacuouswaffle i imagine in environments without source revision controls you just never undertake significannot refactors vacuouswaffle that sounds like a candidate for getting them to purchase it as a subscription service from a vendor like gitlab gatdarntootin ah yea that makes some sense i guess nofarcastplz yet you fail to answer my questions yeah we are getting that sometime this year",
  "adduser name i came from a background in climate and environmental science and first started with python for working with data now i have moved into more data engineering and software dev focused roles and python was a good intro to that world it is very versatile and you can do everything from basic data processing stats and visualisation right up to web scraping pipeline orchestration interacting with apis etc i would also always suggest adding sql to your data toolkit as most organisations will house some if not all of their data in a sql database sql is great for fetching or organising your data before you jump into more advanced stuff with python nerdyjorj r is a better gis system in its own right but qgis uses python plugins for you working with maps is gonna be quite important a lot of sensors are easier to interface with in python than r so it is probably going to be more useful than r to you if you are doing direct measurements callahandsome r is more a language not a gis and even then python is more beneficial in a gis because it can not only do the stats and modeling but can also interface with many programs api is etc r is for more for statistics and modeling it has many use cases but is not as versatile when compared to python i think it is important to distinguish what you want to do before deciding on a language i would always suggest learning python if you are working in gis since it can be used for many other things while r is a bit more specific but if you specialize in the math side of things in the field of gis r might be the better option tldr python can do the same things as r but is a much more powerful language if you have no coding experience python is probably better as you can use it for many things if you only have advanced maths and modeling to deal with and do not care about learning a language to interface with other programs and such learn r nerdyjorj there are so many_ good r packages for geographic ds built off the back of sf it really is quite good at the maths side of gis work and pretty decent at the outputs too with ggmap etc that said i would probably use python if i were op callahandsome right i mean it is for working with data within the statistics and data visualization realm of things but because it is so specific it is often just tool that you might need to complete a project if you have other things to do along with your data analysis r will fall short and some other tool will likely need to be picked up to finish out the task no hate on r it is an amazing tool for what it is statistical computing and visualization as always the language you choose is dependent are what is trying to be accomplished pristineconcertthanks a lot for discussion for now i have tasks typically statistical for r analysis visualization and computing tbh i do not know what future will bring to me so i am also looking for most useful tool is it complicated to switch from r to python one day does it make sense callahandsome i mean it is tough to switch to any language but i think the hurdle many will face going from r to python would be that r is more functional whereas python is more object oriented this brings in aspects of programming that are less about syntax and more about structure and design it is not a concept you can just learn immediately if you are hoping to do more with the language choose python r is not able to do a lot that python can which is not a bad thing because it is for a specific purpose if r suits your needs and you do not want to get into programming all that much then go with it it is a fantastic language for data analysis that being said there is a reason python is a language associated with data science and machine learning from what you are saying i would say python would give you a better cv and more versatility r looks good too but requires more of a hunt for positions that care about it and ultimately you can just do more in python yes you need more packages for python to do some stuff r can do but that is not a big deal tbh",

  "delicious view very few points essentially a regression boss does not know and probably wo not care it may be wise to use a bayesian method build in some assumptions through the priors or if it is a time series just chuck it into excel and use the forecast function who cares my suggestion gaussian process regression a it is fun b it works well with few points c can give you the conf intervals d you can play around with the hyperparameters to make it look and feel more sensible dl ml ds aspirant right now i am trying a simple ann not for data points you need a gaussian regression using the scikit learn library sycokinetic if the problem can be solved with samples then it can be solved without machine learning your best bet is probably to use your domain knowledge to build the best heuristic you can manage slap together the best piece of crap neural net you can in a day and hope that you can demonstrate that your heuristic does better than the ml thing also make sure he does not get tripped up and come out of the meeting thinking the ml model did better because the last thing you need is for him to advertise it as ml when it is not maybe you can use a prediction with confidence interval to explain what the result will look like i would imagine a presentation along the lines of to give you a bit of a background anything below fifty data points is considered little data what this means is that you can still do a statistical evaluation but the precision of the prediction will likely be very low and i want to emphasize that i when i say very low i mean exactly that i understood that you want to use a neural net for neural nets to work however you need a data set that has at least whatever data points that is a hard lower limit so this method is not applicable to our situation because we do not have enough data so based on the number of data points i chose linear regression as one of the most robust tools available something something based on the available data we ran a prediction and as a result of the prediction we can be confident that the business will grow anywhere between percentage points that is currently all the information that you can get out of these data points you can probably already see what the problem is here like i said in the beginning a low number of data points leads to a low precision in the prediction this range reflects exactly that in order to give you a bit of a better insight into our work i have also tried another well established method y that is also applicable to this situation little data in the context of z and it comes to the same conclusion that tells us it is a question of data not of methodology now we will be getting another data points and we will have another look this added data may reduce the uncertainty in the prediction may give a more precise prediction but it also may not it is important to know that we can only know for sure how precise a prediction is when and only when we have the data in hand and had a chance to look at it speaking from experience though i would realistically expect only a marginal increase in precision it might still be possible to derive decisions from that but i wanted to let you know up front what the data situation is currently and that the insight might be qualitative only semi quantitative at max maybe you can also prepare a series of prediction intervals from and data points to show how the precision increases as a function of n tomomcat presumably you have plotted some graphs and used domain knowledge already to rule out more simple methods there are plenty of situations where samples would be enough to see a clear relationship which your boss might be happy with just use basic statistics when collecting samples is expensive is time to open the dusty book of design of experiments and go back to hypothesis testing imho ceo wants to use ai here is where you need a chat and understand the problem to be solved ceo wants to tell customers they have an ai in place to predict how product x will perform in situation y ceo wants to know what happens if they change process x to y ceo wants now talk to the ceo understand the want so you can define the need we get paid to do the impossible i guess finding a new job is still easier than doing the impossible i go for my far out hypothesis here ceo wants ai to oversell a service to the customers with so few data points the prediction intervals are going to be so broad that mathematicians will have to invent an entire new field to contain them you will end up making a bullshit model which works only when a butterfly is fart invert the spin of a tornado ceo will serve your ass on fine austrian porcelain sliced thin with a good chianti any way i can explain to my boss when this inevitably fails why it is not my fault first of all i recommend you get your concerns down in writing so like an email with an short and concise explanation in ml a few hundred samples is considered too small for any meaningful predictions with such small data sets you run the risk of what is called over fitting if we are lucky we will have just samples so instead i recommend we should use etc so you can refer to it later keep it simple and maybe cc someone else as well also i suspect your boss just wants to be part of this hot new thing called ml ai which is understandable though misguided are there any other aspects of your work where it could be better applied maybe look for something and suggest that instead bigdoggene this is a design of experiments problem durooduroo if any one of those samples has serious anomalies the model will fail to offer any sort of prediction just one sample will have a large amount of influence the sample size is too small for any sort of ml application what are you trying to predict bizarrejellyfish literally burst out laughing when i saw he wants a deep neural net off data points garbage in garbage out xchgre as a general rule samples per feature are needed for a regression model therefore at least samples not counting the fact that you will probably need to do feature engineering statsnpolisci it is not just hard to work with this data it is impossible to have any idea of the accuracy but my best guess is that we have a or whatever number you think is okay chance of being in the right ballpark my final report can provide that best guess but i cannot in good conscience phrase it as anything other than a best guess with minimal accuracy or do what he wants have the predictions fail collect your salary and move on mimprocesstech i find montgomery scott to be a great inspiration for this the notion of building this model without enough data is like trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet whilst wearing a blindfold riding a horse bonus points for using a scot accent tell him you will do it but it will not be accurate or reliable and there is nothing anyone can do about that im barely scratching the surface of data science just do it lightly as an aid to the job i get paid to do and even i understand for something like that you will need much more data venustrapsflies he says that we get paid to do the impossible i felt this in my bones one of my least favorite trends is executives equivocating the word impossible with a little tricky irimae would experimental design have a place in solving this never done it from a coding aspect other than in minitab but it could work here from what i know small sample sizes and high costs per sample seems to be the purpose of it what about just doing a regression analysis you could show if there is any predictability effect size etc if boss does not care about terminology why use the more complex modeling that would not be appropriate here wetorangutan upvoted just because this is a real ds problem refreshing spiritualquestions you should generate synthetic data i feel that would make him happy could be an interesting project as well then make sure to do an error analysis on the original samples or you could keep the original data points as the hold out set all together you can generate synthetic structured data using gans there is no way to ml this and you can explain that to your boss times and he is not going to understand just use linear regression or even excel to make a prediction do a neural net just to say you did now he can tell everyone we have ml that is all he really wants start looking for a new job it is not going to get better look into design of experiments using software like minitab or jmp for response surface modeling fitting a regression model to the data and designing what experiments samples to run next that will give the most statistical information cocodirichlet use this as an opportunity to make some toy examples on how to do these models i would tell him that you cannot do a neural network with data points but i do not think he would pay attention there are papers on how many degrees of freedom you need for neural networks and other models show him the papers and highlight where it says that i do not think he would believe you though you can fit some models and compare them and show him that but honestly this guy is an asshole and you need to give zero fucks about him think about how you can make this experience useful for your next job use it to study about other models make some toy examples for yourself straightbackward there are only features to this dataset but unfortunately there are also only samples he originally wanted us to use a deep neural net please tell your boss to keep his mouth shut therealtiddlydump you sure as shit do not want to use a super data hungry model like a neural net much less deep learning you can send your ceo here hey ceo guy you are a dumbass listen to your people well i think you should atleast discard even the thought of using an ann it will be super useless jorrissss your comment about anomalies is not besides the point if it is that hard to collect data is it because it is high quality expensive measurements if not you may be able to construct a reasonable model with data points using a combination of domain knowledge and your technical skills if not then it will be a struggle wouldgrsmith i think that it is our jobs sometimes to say no but in a respectful manner i have given a number of presentations that were significannotly dumbed down but got the point across that what they want cannot be done with what is or will be available if they want it they will have to invest x time and y dollars i have a pretty understanding cto who is willing to listen though to just train a model though i agree with others that bayesian methods or an attempt to build a model based on domain expertise is a smart plan if a model must be built if a model must be built you can also use a synthetic data approach nfmcclure you are in a small company maybe even a startup be very clear with the ceo on what you can and cannot deliver the ceo does not need to know the difference between regression vs prediction vs ai vs ml that is for you to communicate have you tried finding other sources of data web scraping paying data brokers i do not know your exact problem but the web is a massive source of data i have gotten free data just by googling things like site githubcom csv problem name data or searching repos of web data like the common crawl sorry just use a neural net with purely linear activation functions aka a logit sell that says that we get paid to do the impossible originally wanted us to use a deep neural net you are going to have to try harder to put this in terms they understand salient points have a short conversation about why they think you should be using neural nets frame it as getting everyone on the same page not as one of you dictating a result to the other is it because that will sound fancy in an investor call investors do not want fancy they want results and using the wrong tool for the job is not what is going to get the results we want here he is not paying you to do the impossible he is paying you to apply your domain expertise to know how to choose and implement solutions to business problems he is paying you to get into the weeds of the technical topics that he does not have the time or the training to get into but you do have that expertise and it is why you know neural networks are not the right tool to use for this problem if you want to include a simple feedforward network in your solution do not do it to placate the ceo do it to have two slides that say we tried this too and it does not work as well as the method we went forward with here is a graph showing why explain why this is not the right tool for the job in a different way most likely he is not convinced that the sample size is a real problem because that sounds to a nontechnical person like a difference in degree not a difference in kind trying to fit a deep neural net to a few dozen samples is like trying to make a paper airplane faster by strapping a rocket engine to it yes rocket engines make planes go very fast yes you have the technical skills needed to build those rocket engines and can put them on this plane if he really really wants you to but you also have the technical skills to know that that is a waste of everyone is time that is not going to result in a faster paper airplane it is going to result in a plane shaped pile of ashes and a bunch of wasted labor costs the ceo should not want to be paying for wasted time they should want to be paying for efficient solutions you know how airplanes work it is why he hired you build a better paper airplane and then down the line if the data availability situation changes we can circle back to this problem and talk about rc planes or gliders or whatever but jumping straight to fighter jets is not going to help anyone here 1verfassungszusatz rely on information outside your sample for example build an improper model and use the data you have for backtesting use delfi method or rely on a bayesian approach with strong priors lordsemaj is this time series data anygeologisti do not think it would be hard to pitch a bayesian regression model using mcmc as ml bestucanisgoodenough use of them fit it predict on the remaining one and tell him that with ai the incorrect predictions if there are any in the future will self correct over time also would be cool for that to be true sometimes your boss asks you to make a hamburger never seen or tasted one but all their friends rave about it so he gave you a whole side of beef and some flour and says make me a burger a meat grinder yeast and stand mixer are all too expensive and you are a genius so make it happen you can spend a week slowly cutting through the carcass collecting ambient yeast and giving all the reasons why this burger will suck and take forever to make boss will hate it or you can just roll the carcass around in flour and say here is a burger they will love it put it on your resume and gtfo asap wildogg small n is less important if your measurement is highly reliable and the underlying effects are strong based on the data you have now you should know what your r square is and if it is above then you are on the right track if it is below the not so much prehensiledick your ceo sounds like an idiot my boss is an idiot too he thinks ai is the best thing since sliced bread but when i mention critical issues about our data pipelines he could not care less terektus tbh when i had to do with a boss like that just lie if its a regression and limited samples just use excel get a nice graph and tell him its ai he will clap and tell all his ceo friends he is in big data now phantomsummonerz disclaimer not a ds so no technical advice do you have hard requirements on the accuracy i mean not being able to do something vs doing something that is okay are light years away if your boss does not have high expectations maybe the resulting accuracy will be just okay and you are just afraid of a just okay end result not being enough sometimes we as experts set the expectations bar too high and management gets pissed off it is a matter of miscommunication if the requirements cannot be met your leader is essentially asking you to create a machine that spits diamonds from wood input since your boss does not understand that such machine cannot be made there is not much you can do just try your best red flags ai ml is not his expertise he says that we get paid to do the impossible he originally wanted us to use a deep neural net and if we admit something is impossible how does getting paid make it possible that looks like a failed attempt to boost the morale although the rest of the context indicates otherwise my general recommendation is to not antagonize and throw more fuel into the fire play along and try your best he will either give up fire you for being in his own mind ineffective or hire a contractor and find out the hard way that this cannot be made and cheers bathroomworld i like the idea of using regression because a tree based model is predictions would be limited to the y values it has seen before i definitely would do bagging sample with replacement to train multiple models whose predictions are averaged bootstrapping is know to enhance stability for very small datasets evaluate performance on out of bag samples also consider using ridge or lasso regularization to enhance stability too curious are the distributions of each of the variables forming normality that would be a good sign you have representative data zoidbergjohn it highly depends on the physical system if the features have some physical meaning and can be described by specific probability distribution polynomial chaos expansion could be a right choice apccheme there is no way to get future data after the contract ends is the regression tool being used by you or a client after the contract ends if its used by the client could you update your regression with a bias term when knew samples come in in the process industries we develop predictors called inferentials to predict variables that are expensive to measure or are measured infrequently typically you do not have much data to build the model sometimes you get lucky and the regression for the inferential has an r of or which is very good in this field other times your r can be garbage like or surprisingly they can still predict very well because when a sample comes in the feedback of the difference between the prediction and the measurement is used to update the bias term typically a fraction of measured bias is used to update the predictor bias and it works very well without the bias update the predictor would naturally drift very far from the measurement allglowedup agree gaussian process regression you will want to do leave one out cross validation with such little data no point in doing a test train set with both gp models and also with such little data the other option is bayesian linear modeling with that you get an idea of how uncertain your polynomial model coefficients can be and still describe the data tvicker maybe after deep learning courses people think that you will have gigabytes of data to apply transfer learning for a brand new nn from google but no the real world is when you have points of time series and need to make a forecast for points this is perfectly normal problem other details depend on what you really need to solve mreloi unreliable samples ask or guess what your boss wants to see and then find a regression model to create that goodness okdependentit miiiiiight be possible to generate a little synthetic data depending on the distribution of your features worth exploring to increase your sample size i would not do more than of your original dataset n also there are some things in experimental design partial factorial where you can extrapolate intermediate values if you have some mutually orthogonal treatments this is a huge stretch and your data is likely not suited for it samples and serious anomalies take your shit and run roflmao if you really have to use ml i second the gaussian process an ann is useless for this little data as any good predictions would be overfitting a gaussian process will give you an estimation and uncertainty though you are likely to have alot of uncertainty about its predictions depending on how spread the sampled data points are and where new data points lie in the sampled space good thing is that with every new data point the prediction accuracy increases likelihood with samples and anomalies is that it wo not give you much best bet is to try and increase the data sampling from any other available data not sure if there is anything in the public domain or from other machines processes at this point though you are probably better off using some simpler statistical domain knowledge approach as there are just not enough data points to train anything reliable and as your boss does not sound too reasonable i am not sure how well he will take to your ai machine giving incorrect predictions better to have that conversation now than later when alot of time resource and worst of all expectation have been given to the problem shnibu second gpr historically it was used in geostaostics look up kriging for interpolating mineral density between limited core samples very appropriate for small datasets cyandean thank you for this response i have only read a few articles on gpr since you mentioned it but it looks promising coming up with priors will be challenging and my boss hates making assumptions but i might not even mention that this method uses priors i mean in a sense choosing a kernel for the svm is kinda like making a prior so it will not be too different in that regard i especially like the built in confidence intervals for gpr it is hard to avoid over fitting and i have no idea whether performance on the data we currently have will generalize having wide conf intervals might help me explain to the boss better why i do not trust the predictions we are currently making cyandean presumably you have plotted some graphs and used domain knowledge already to rule out more simple methods we are working on dependent variables some of them display linearity so i am actually somewhat confident that we can make accurate predictions on those with four features though it can be hard to visualize and so in some cases it is hard to tell what the relationship is in some instances there does not appear to be any relationship whatsoever our domain knowledge is limited as this is a fairly unique application but what knowledge we do have suggests that all of the labels should have some kind of consistent relationship with the independent variables this is part of why i do not trust our data cyandean i guess finding a new job is still easier than doing the impossible oof good point though ceo wants ai to oversell a service to the customers i have not been with this company a full year yet but i am beginning to realize that this is the entire business model at first i started to think the ceo is a bullshitter now i think he just does not understand ai and is being fed bullshit by some pms under him i look like the debby downer or unambitious guy when i try to temper expectations privatefrank i find montgomery scott to be a great inspiration for this the notion of building this model without enough data is like trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet whilst wearing a blindfold riding a horse the full scottie is to say all that and then do it anyway_ adeelinator there is a win win here do a regression and call it ml i mean what does ml mean anyways nowadays how different is a regression from a single neuron neural net then everyone can walk away happy cyandean thank you the next big task on the docket is determining which samples to collect next and i am in charge of doing that based on the results of the ml model this software may help a ton with that wouldo notyouloveme this is why society is messed up the idiot ceos should not be in control of who gets paid and who does not it always amazes me how data folks willingly adhere to these old school societal classifications why is it your job to cower to the idiot ceos there is really no good reason beyond being a dog with its tail between its legs wikisummarizerbot delphi method the delphi method or delphi technique del fy also known as estimate talk estimate or ete is a structured communication technique or method originally developed as a systematic interactive forecasting method which relies on a panel of experts the technique can also be adapted for use in face to face meetings and is then called mini delphi delphi has been widely used for business forecasting and has certain advantages over another structured forecasting approach prediction markets delphi is based on the principle that forecasts or decisions from a structured group of individuals are more accurate than those from unstructured groups faq opt out opt out of subreddit github downvote to remove cyandean the problem is i can get an arbitrarily high by tuning hyperparameters i do not know when to stop and how to determine if the model will generalize a validation set of is still only samples and k folds shows lots of variance in results i also do not know if the measurements are reliable but if they are not we are just totally fucked anyway so i am trying to assume that they are osrsaddicted i second gpr i would also explore if it is possible to interpolate the features through metadata for example if your features correlates with weather data which are usually of higher frequency you could interpolate your features to create more data points besides metadata engineering disciplines usually have domain knowledge involved it could be possible there are existing models for the underlying features you use which could be used for interpolation to generate more data also anomalies are not trivial it will mess up your model esp with so little data i find it helpful to understand what caused the anomalies and explore ways to remove anomalies via domain knowledge typically involves setting thresholds in engineering i also worked in applying ai to engineering i hope it helps mimprocesstech well i mean he is gonna and like scottie he is got a chance if it works he is the hero of the hour if it does not well it will not be his problem anymore no pressure op wildogg

  "implement worried the author is issues really come down to advice often given by those answering questions in the weekly thread for what to look for in the first role look for an organization where data science is part of the main product try to find companies that have the tech stack that you want to work in use glassdoor or ask entry level employees at the firms you are targeting about the early career mentoring experience we see similar threads on the disappointment of early career on this board as well if you are data scientist number one with no it support maybe even no management support you are going to have a bad time delicious view some important points to consider especially now that there are young people getting into the field as their first job rather than the old physicist economist etc turning into data scientists for those doing a bachelors degree in data science and are entering this field as their first profession it would be helpful to have a clear expectation of what the job is like however i think the opinions in the blogpost is misleading and here is why re master of all trades jack of none there was an old saying about how data scientists are people who know more about computer science than statisticians and know more about statistics than computer scientists while this statement probably served the early data scientists i think it may oversimplify the expectations somewhat most universities teach statistics with many electives in computing and many computer science degree comes with statistics units as well most graduates wanting to be a data scientist come with both to stand out a data scientist needs to know equivalent statistics as a statistician and have equivalent computing skills as a computer scientist the famous venn diagram should now consider the union rather than the intersection and yes in my career so far excel sql tableau powerbi python r scala java c javascript typescript julia were all used though i must admit that i wad only an expert better than others in the company in python r and excel i still had to fix sql and other dashboards developed by others so i guess i still had to know as much sql as the data engineers in the organisation econometric analysis of time series for economics teams developing serverless apis on the cloud developing etl elt pipelines designing olap databases conducting bayesian survival analysis designing a custom interactive visualisation using javascript estimating driving distances between sets of millions of different postcodes natural language processing facilitaing workshops to develop data strategies teaching data analysts how to use r identifying why two powerbi dashboards were showing different numbers optimising a sql query that was clogging up the data warehouse there was no limit to the range of tasks in each of those roles we are expected to be as much of an expert as the previous person who was supposedly an expert we are brought in because there is an issue which means that the expectation is that we can understand and fix whatever the expert had done i could go on forever with these tasks that are seemingly outside the duties of a data scientist i hope that some day i data scientists can be specialised to just one set of tasks but if everything else in the domain of data was functioning i would not need to be called upon to fix things so i need to dabble in tasks other than exploring data and modelling re no or inadequate data infrastructure just going by the description in the post i am going to assume that the author never actually got to be a data scientist unfortunate that he had to give up before even getting a taste of what it would have been like google drive and sharepoint do not tell me all the analysis was done in excel and powerpoint i would have asked during the interview what their tech stack is re expectations vs reality of being a data scientist of course the cleaning of data is a regular part of the job same goes with physcists chemists biologists etc who need to painstakingly conduct experiments meticulously cleaning and maintaining all equipments data collection can take weeks months and even years analysis and modelling maybe takes days i know because i used to be a chemist physicist if you want clean tabular data just handed to you you should become an econometrician or a political scientist other people will do all the data collection for you and more often than not clean it for you too i know because i had to fulfill these data requests for them sometimes do the analysis too because stata could not handle a million rows of data re customer service agents data science is a non essential enabling job not the core business we are always servicing our clients or stakeholders management need to manage workloads and priorities this balancing act is similar in other areas positive takeaway is that data specialists are always needed one way or another re isolation and monotony this point again applies to many jobs especially since the pandemic meaningful relationships are hard to forge if it is of any positive it makes it easier to hop to another job if a better opportunity comes by re lack of guidance from senior data scientists and domain experts lack of guidance is unfortunate and i have experienced this too but i would consider this as a plus in retrospect with this freedom you could forge your own path and be able to follow via the internet who you consider to be great data scientists at least in the early days of the boom there were not many seniors that one could learn from more bluntly i would consider most seniors to be incompetent at worst and not really someone i should learn from at best this relates to the first point about being a unicorn if you do not have a unicorn senior data scientist you ca not learn to be a unicorn data scientist from them re politics unfortunately the issue of office politics is universal as well i guess what i am saying is that the author is experience or his conclusions from them are not a relatable or agreeable sure this job is not all rosy but neither are other jobs riskisourbusiness i read this as a matter of professional maturity and suspect the author would have similar frustrations in other fields as well thephoenixrisesagain much ado about nothing this guy has some absurd expectations and worked obviously in a sub par environment so his overly optimistic expectations met with a bad workplace boring i had read about the glam this profession brings one gets paid a handsome amount of money and often gets to surprise many family members when they tell them about their job because your friends and family may not have an idea of what you do nerdyjorj welcome to the real world kid cocodirichlet problems here a reasons to pursue data science as a career according to the post were poor from the beginning ability to change business outcomes hmm this is not a reason to do ds first it depends a lot on the company and your role if you are a junior ds it will take a while second how many degrees out there in which you can change outcomes many business administration hr etc basically any business oriented degree money it is never a good reason to pick a career often gets to surprise many family members when they tell them about their job because your friends and family may not have an idea of what you do what i do not even understand this reason b this person went to undergrad and then directly into a grad degree i am tired of telling people on this sub and real life not to go to grad out of undergrad no there are many jobs you can do out of undergrad that will give you a better idea what you would like to do next and what type of grad degree if any you need no you cannot apply to junior ds for the most part directly from undergrad but there are many positions in which you use quant skills c the part about master of all trades jack of none is ridiculous some aspect there are part of the job but others no you do not have to everything for every job most ds are not using java or javascript and if you need to know that either you wo not get hired if you are doing analytics then learn powerbi tableau but if that is not your focus you do not need to know powerbi some of my previous employers wanted me to know python r java javascript hadoop spark tableau power bi excel scala jira and sas is this a list from job applications nobody uses all of this in their job at the same time sure a team someone can use sas but the same team is not going to be doing r sas tableau powerbi java javascript excel lmao what is this place did their director of ds played tech stack roulette and there is no mention of sql on this list like wtf at least give me one thing everyone should definitely know d the places this person worked had data in google drive okay lol edit if you have no experience and you got a job at a start up and their data is a mess and it is on google drive then understand the context do something about it but quitting a career because in your first job they were using google drive are you kidding me f i got bored and have better things to do so i am not going to keep reading devviewevvieisabear at the core of these problems is one critical issue corporate executives and recruiters have absolutely no idea what they are looking for do not hire analysts and scientists when what you need are architects cloud engineers and software testers it is not the same skillset once these hyperactive moneybags realize that they need to have existing infrastructure first they can stop rapid fire hiring front end jr professionals just because everyone else is doing it and use senior practitioners more efficiently blasketbasket yeah this is definitely a professional maturity issue this medium post feels like the professional equivalent of when someone posts a long rant about why they are deactivating their facebook account asleep dress i feel for the author these are valid struggles of a junior data scientist the medior data scientist is the one who can live together these difficulties the senior is the one who can manage these difficulties and drives the change in his her organization towards a better working more efficient company culture multicm i whole heartedly disagree with the customer service agents section i had to stop reading here because i was really getting the impression this author is self obsessed i went to school and worked with with many of these types of people who believe they are the experts at all things ml and if their day is not spent developing the next big ai or other big buzz word inspired thing then their day was a waste when asked to do something in excel one of my former co workers said i did not spend years in a data degree to work with pivot tables and line graphs i have a masters in data science and my toolset at work is excel sql and arcgis i have seen actionable improvements in my company through the use of a simple line graph i used to have massive impostor syndrome because i did not even know where to begin with ml and i have to google every little thing about how to use r for those rare times i use it for a one off project but in my years as an analyst and data scientist i have realized it does not really matter producing useful reports and improving your company is all that matters synthphreak once again no consensus in the comments about the topic of the post what is it with this sub there is absolutely no coherence to it or it is members aside from the fact that everyone uses to term data science just endless identity crisis and debate about the very fundamentals this place is so exhausting edit fixed insane typo thanks autocorrect what the heck is an applied decision scientist nozadoim i am thinking of doing a huge career change into ds fielda decade into healthcare i must say that this perspective was valuable to me i am already quite used to the common issues of expections and running requests but i find value in this article when it comes to typical roleexpection within a company wouldatastoryteller good luck finding a job that does not have all or most of these problems or something similar many times data scientist expects that they will get nicely cooked data they will use it to build models and these models will be used by the business leaders to make decisions im thinking data science is not for him very nice article i do agree with most of this he said he is absolutely right because that is the reality of many companies and that is okay if he wanted to quit he is not telling that ds is over to everybody but it was over to him what is the point of discussion here discuss about the reality of the profession or about this specific man and his decision he did not lie in any reason that is what makes me quit no absolutely not but it was enought for him and i understand for many companies i have been through almost had at leat or problems lasted as reasons for him and it takes some courage to assume that you do not want to work with that hype profession anymore because of people is reaction as i can read here hahaha tracidity the amount of crab in the bucket type posts here lashing out at the blog writer is really too much instead of having an interesting discussion about the points that were brought up instead you have people who sound like they are insulted and must defend the honor of ds or something sounds like a professional maturity issue or must have been bad at ds lol is just hand waving euphemisms for na na na not listening always be grateful that someone took the time to actually put a retrospective feedback into writing it is information that everyone in a profession ought to reflect on and consider possible ways they could mitigate the issues the blog writer brought up instead of focusing on tearing apart some strawman and waving the criticism aside it would be much more productive to identify the kinds of trends people are seeing in their workplaces and how it may or may not resonate writers like this could have easily just moved on with their lives and while someone might be out here just frothing at the mouth to jump down the naysayers it is simply making it more and more difficult in job environments to be able to have the space to provide critical retrospectives which are the cornerstone of good science save the criticism for when developing a solution when its feedback time just listen to the feedback non jabroniredditor sounds like bro had a bad first job and is blaming the industry candiedyams_ link azevedro i do not get the phd masters fetish ive seen adverts for senior ds that require that at least a few years of experience then asking them to be proficient in deep learning cv nlp classical machine learning econometrics time series regression and statistics retail ds recommended systems ab testing dashboarding deployment and cloud services like who the fuck is good at all of these at once it is ridiculous you want a masters or phd to do dashboarding and visualization it is a joke honesty is it just my impression or the author is really poor at data science he worked years and did not know some of the mentioned tools i work as data analyst for just a year and i am already advanced in half of them martincline i know nothing about data science but know that this guy would have the same complaints in any job imagine that being asked to do boring tasks over and over or menial ones or asked favors by coworkers no shit dude it is called work for a reason bobdope this is not an airport etc etc quantpsychguy unless you want freedom to experiment a d like to build i would be cool landing somewhere with no it support and be the first real data person the lack of management support thing would suck though that just makes accomplishing things impossible maxtothej we see similar threads on the disappointment of early career on this board as well if you are data scientist number one with no it support maybe even no management support you are going to have a bad time every single time i have seen people give the same advice yet the op typically is overconfident and just overrides because all they hear is that responsibility is opportunity to be cso in years moscowgordon yep good tools and competent management are foundational if i could do it again i would not have spent so much time in environments where there was no version control and management did not know how to screen for programming skills so inevitably every process was a series of manual steps proofrequired look for an organization where data science is part of the main product try to find companies that have the tech stack that you want to work in use glassdoor or ask entry level employees at the firms you are targeting about the early career mentoring experience and when the issues are so pervasive around industry that it makes it almost impossible to find such unicorns you have no choice but to join such companies also it is not that easy for people to pick such companies at will this usual advice of vetting company to your fullest desires does not work that well in real life no support and or buy in for any job would be draining maxtothej there was an old saying about how data scientists are people who know more about computer science than statisticians and know more about statistics than computer scientists while this statement probably served the early data scientists i think it may oversimplify the expectations somewhat most universities teach statistics with many electives in computing and many computer science degree comes with statistics units as well most graduates wanting to be a data scientist come with both to stand out a data scientist needs to know equivalent statistics as a statistician and have equivalent computing skills as a computer scientist the famous venn diagram should now consider the union rather than the intersection this hits it so spot on when that statement was popularized ds had a lot of people who were just refugees from one of the areas of expertise to the other cs devs who picked up more statistics stem phds who picked up more cs nowadays with bachelors in ds the same cannot be said thegreenbackpack this is a great post the reality of being a data scientist even in a massive corporate setting is that it is almost nothing like what you are learning in the class room i have been trying to convey this to a data scientist we recently hired who just wants to go full tilt into everything he gets upset because he is not just doing revolutionary ml models all day and tackling massive organizational defects redd zeppelin lol at thinking political scientists just have clean data handed to them the fuck for some of the reasons he gave i would agree for the others it is about expectations i do not blame juniors for being disappointed their school lied to them about the job juanpabloaj i agree he could use the paragraphs of the article to describe many type of jobs calminky up to a certain point definitely however seeing most of the career changing posts here it seemed like this would be a worthwhile share i disagree that he would share a similar frustration of being the only person or nearly the only person on an entire team or department in many other fields as well the second bullet point in the post customer service pc repair electrician apprentice healthcare just to name a few data science is a uniquely niche field within the field of computer science edit statistics this post has me questioning my decision to get a masters degree in this field okunitthe complaint on needing to transform the data you are a data scientist even if you prefer to eat a fully prepped meal it is also meaningful to prepare it yourself so you understand the data better this was the part where i felt eh this is not the right field for you on the other hand i realize the pitfalls of lacking infrastructure or even data and social isolation to some extent i would expect in my first job i would screen it just as they do to me am i the only data fluent person hired will this role be hybrid or fully remote how much it and database support will i have with screening you can avoid wasted time and opportunity costs of picking a lackluster and poor job at the very least if it is remote or contracts it is over and done quickly for something as nascent as data science it may be a great idea to work remote contracts to start i want to get a no strings attached feel for it i will say that social isolation is something that i am curious about what do other data scientists or data engineers feel calminky absurd expectations not so absurd if you regularly read posts here by people that want to start into data science a lot of people have those expectations elminadero some points here a desiring life stability and economic certainty is a valid motivator to choose careers it is why lots of scientists are looking to get out of science and why lots of college students push themselves while in college b while this is true the fact is that talent geography the state of the economy networking complications and a myriad of other reasons can make it difficult if not impossible for some individuals with a bs to learn enough about a field before pursuing a grad degree while it should not be a reason to get a grad degree plenty choose to because in some cases it arguably makes it easier to break into a field otherwise i largely agree with your take cliffdraws i would disagree with the point about money not being a reason to pick a career it should not be the only reason but it should definitely factor in tvicker i agree with you but sadly industry wants ms degrees usually for ds positions it is sometimes ridiculous that they would rather hire a bio phd with experience than bs candidate with years of experience i would suggest to get a ms degree if you want to be a ds to be safe i am a recruiter in the space most recruiters myself included do not make hiring decisions we present candidates and the hiring managers often people who are in the field make hiring decisions if it is a recruiter presenting straight to an executive that does not know what they are doing and they are not consulting with a data science professional then yeah that is dumb calminky yeah it is funny how it is always a frenzy with half being hm interesting potentially valid points that at least should be thought about and the other half goes the author clearly went disillusional into the field and sed at being a data scientist in my opinion the author brought up a few points that are important to consider before getting into ds since this field is constantly shifting and evolving partially because there was never a clear definition of what a data scientist does and secondly because it is really dependent on what a company thinks a data scientist should do i have seen roles for ds that were more data analytics build dashboards software development know c and java data engineering stand up etl etc or you finally found using python r and spark building models however one interviews for that last position and realizes a you are gonna be the lone wolf only data scientist b they have no clue what data infrastructure data maturity is c they expect you to find answers for business questions that should be addressed from the business side and not by training a model the definition and field is shifting constantly a few years ago if you knew python or r sql and few of the central libraries for ml you were on a good path today with the rise of databricks knowing scala or at least pyspark and your basic aws tools mwaa airflow glue might be a good idea seeing them pop up in data science job posts there is plenty of opportunity for everyone and never only one true way calminky that is the newest term or role shift for data scientists effectively using data to inform business decisions calminky you can avoid most of these pitfalls by doing your research ahead of applying at a particular company talking with people that previously held those positions etc there are plenty of good roles out there that even the author would be happy in but there are also a lot of duds where you run into several of the things he mentions data maturity is the first thing i try to get a pulse on calminky it depends on the data maturity of the company i was in a role where i did most of the data engineering data cleaning and a little bit of modeling plus more data engineering currently i work in a company that is way higher up on the maturity scale so little data engineering little data cleaning and a lot of modeling delicious view point taken and good ones too i shall reflect upon myself and yeah posts like these would add value if for nothing else than to provide an experience of someone trying to enter a field and then exiting not long after more people thinking of entering should reconsider too and that is totally an okay thing calminky as below the image calminky there is a difference between knowing about a tool and being really proficient in a tool have this in my company and can confirm working in software engineering and data science just with one other guy there a definetily cool times when you can try new stuff and create something and sometimes you wish you were working in a bigger company where you only would be responsible for a small part and had more people around you miketythhon this is my situation i am the first and only data analyst and i have never been a data analyst before lol i have no idea what to do everyone is very nice and supportive though i just wish someone could tell me what i should do eightstream depends on the expectations put on you sometimes you get a lot of freedom but a lot of the time you just get asked to make bricks without straw somkoala i have been in your setup and it was okay but trust me you can do so much more with the proper buy in and support from the rest of the org even if the company is main product is not data science even if you have the freedom to experiment and have the ability to build things being able to do a proper go to market means a ton that is a big gamble and if it does not pay off you have done damage to your career that could potentially take years to rectify the best way to get on a cdo track in your early career is find somewhere where there are people with deep experience to mentor you the opposite of being dara scientist number one dronedesigner exactly how is that comment the most upvoted comment on this thread many people on this sub and noobs who read these subs just do not realize how hard it is to get into those kids of jobs companies tangentc i actually disagree with this pretty hard it is still very much the case that it is a hybrid position and people fall very much in between a real statistician that is a phd statistician or at minimum someone with a thesis based masters and a skilled software or platform engineer on the cs side i think the barrier for entry is lower simply because the majority of people working various swe roles only have and only need an undergraduate level understanding where they pick up more on the job the same is far less true for stats this is probably less true at the faang level but speaking as one of those stem phds who picked up more cs most of the people i work with who went the other direction have god awful_ grasps of stats and the people getting ds masters degrees have been well unimpressive on average and i mean from highly regarded universities i do not appear to be the only one do not delude yourself we are still very much jacks of all trades unicorns included yes those unicorns are much stronger in both than the average data scientist but they will only be as good as the worst statistician delicious view my bad sorry perhaps not only basing it on two people i knew again sorry did not seem like the same effort that natural scientists had to go through to collect and clean data not really it was a lot of ranting of expectations vs reality my previous career was in engineering and i could also match one by one the reasons he gave for quitting data science as good reasons to quit in engineering as well i hate that it is considered computer science when data science is actually statistics and code for these statistics love programming and dread meetings i am an introvert at heart cocodirichlet yes my worry with b is many people going directly to grad school without exploring other options and then a having difficulty being competitive for internships because of lack of experience b not being able to choose good portfolio projects due to lack of experience c unsure of what track in ds they would like to pursue d not getting jobs due to lack of experience e not liking the job they spent a ton of time studying for colleges and universities do not do a good job preparing students for the job market for the most part which is why many can get lost and many professors use the go do a grad degree as the default advice cocodirichlet that is not true there are many jobs out there that are not called data scientist that do not require grad degree data scientist requires experience which is why they hire people with experience or phd but the experience does not need to be in a ds position many positions can get you relevant experience rather hire a bio phd with experience you do not know what a phd is if you think a phd has experience a phd is years on average and most of that time you are working on a lab or coauthored research plus your own research most of the time you are basically doing the job of a ds minus some tools industry uses which can be easily learnt another thing people that phd have is domain knowledge if you are in biotech i am sorry but a phd in biology is going to be very relevant over someone who has no clue but has years of experience and no experience in biotech do you see doctors complaining that they are not getting hired as surgeons without a residence or certification no because it is not an entry level job i have taught undergrad an class a couple of times and most get relevant jobs and i say most because i only keep track of the seniors in the course i taught did they get a job that had the title data scientist no but they got very good jobs making around at good places that can lead to a ds role if they want to do that these students were very motivated completed portfolio in my class went to career fairs networked got some referrals and landed in good places devviewevvieisabear fair enough i have interacted with some fascinatingly out of touch ones but law of large numbers operating i am sure most are also just as dumbfounded by some of the things they see too thanks for the explanation oh absolutely i did not mean to imply that never happens just that it should not be expected only one and a half of the companies i have worked for had high quality data ready to be used in modeling tracidity hey this is a late response but gotta give you big props for such a humble response you do not get that too often on reddit so appreciate your response breadlygames the good part is you are responsible for everything the bad part is you are responsible for everything quantpsychguy they could hire someone like me and then i could build a strategy and a roadmap to get there and actually help do it all that would be nice delicious view not sure if either of you are in disagreement i mean that the job demands the level of statistics knowledge of a postgraduate degree in statistics and and the level of computing knowledge of a postgraduate degree in computer science ie you are expected to conduct a statistical inference type statistical analysis work to support social scientists code up mc simulations to assist physical scientists code up some genetic algo to support game devs oh the previous statistician incorrectly applied statistical weights on a hierachical survey and they did not even know that the weights were incorrect sure let me fix that up real quick what i am saying is that a level of comp sci is also demanded of this job like if you need every computational juice that you need to use fortran sure you want to deploy this model with ci cd sure you want a flashy web article to storytell the analysis using js sure oh the de team did not partition the data or did not consider the right distribution strategy for the datalake sure let me take a look at that sure anybody from any background can do these things some do indeed have postgrad education in both stats and cs on top of education in more traditional sciences like physics and economics what i am saying is that this profession was always sold as being a unicorn however unachievable that may be it is no surprise that non technical managers demand this level of knowledge from one person edit i realise i am not being clear i also am not sure what i am exactly saying i guess i mean that data scientists do need to be unicorns like i said the union of cs and stats not the intersect what the blog post showed was but a very small subset of skills used in this field not used at the same time of course i often see posts on linkedin listing what people should learn and typically they list excel sql r descriptive stats lin alg and calc they are used for sure but so are ms word powerpoint and how to write emails if using excel or sql is something one needs to learn i am saying maybe it might be a hard road ahead for those people the gap between the expectation and reality of what it entails to perform the day to day job of a data scientist i mean redd zeppelin it is usually a lot harder it is just not possible to control for as many things when people are involved im a social scientist by training and all my professional mentors have been physicists it is different for sure though i have a lot of respect for physics as a discipline cliffdraws i will second this one aerospace engineer here who deals in data as more of a side job at work and almost all of this applies the only one that did not was the bit about being the only one on the team but i would view that as a bonus wouldeltaexdeltatee civil engineer learning data science here that was my impression as well the part about i do not get to do all the cool stuff in particular is something almost every young civil engineer experiences thinking you are going to design the next awesome bridge to spending all your time making connection details in cad is a rough transition for people the stuff about going to a company without mentors managerial support is also true but that is just general career advice in my current role i am the only person in the company working in my particular niche but i am experienced enough that it is not a problem for me if anything it is kind of nice because i can make all my personal preferences the standard p true i forgot about that elminadero b was sorta my case i got my bs in physics because i was really good at it in hs and upon graduation could get shit all really for a job unresponded to job applications near homelessnessand working manual labor on an assembly line later and i decided doing a grad program was about my only option thankfully it was a fully funded one still as you point out there are few incentives for universities to be job preparation programs and even fewer for companies to take on some new grads without direction part of this might be due to the way public education has been eviscerated over the last yrs idk man there are no good solutions here maybe something like a public sector corps for tech that can set people up with relevant experience like the armed services or conservation corps does but that would mean public money would have to pay for it it would also mean that for most intents and purposes a degree is not worth the effort in terms of what you learn subjectad_ i am sorry but a phd in biology is going to be very relevant over someone who has no clue but has years of experience and no experience in biotech it is also not just about domain knowledge biology has become a very data driven and computational heavy field now people who are not updated on the field may not know it but big data from next generation sequencing is all the rage these days pca is a very popular method in the field given the high dimensionality of genomic data just as an example tvicker why do you suggest to get other jobs which do not require ms degrees they will not benefit ds career at all moreover hrs get suspicious if you change your career paths without a reason so i suggest to finish masters if you want a career in data science and doing it right after your undergrad is the easiest thing being a software engineer and then transition to data scientist will not give you any ds career benefits interviews will not even read your se experience in your cv but yes there are a lot of companies hiring data data scientists with only undergrad degrees no i do not think that grad degree is required for ds everything you need is learnt during undergrad now i do not have masters too lol but i am perusing it to make my career easier and broad my knowledge a little tvicker phd in biology is not relevant for biotech ds role unless they did stats ml during his bio phd otherwise any experienced ds can get into the field in a week anyway exactly miketythhon can you just tell me what to do instead delicious view yeah i get it my background is in both physical and social sciences it is just that the very few cases i have seen university researchers straight up ask for data from governments or access data through apis from mega tech companies at the very least the data was machine readable even when it seems like the returned data wss messy there is some poor data analyst again i have experience of being that guy who had to spend over a year cleaning the source data going through all the consultation and governance processes and doing some magic using custom developed sota ml algorithms just to clean it i have seen biotech people grow stuff for months before throwing them away due to infection i have seen chemists purify just one of many substances for weeks before even being able to start their experiments and the list goes on there are computer systems that are different flavours of utf yeah standards are not as standard as they may seem legacy systems using that are incompatible with modern systems databases that clearly underwent botched up data migration in the and all hell broke loose the kind of situations that require a level of data cleaning that needs more than just the typical tidyverse pandas sql stack if it needs less than several weeks to clean the data i would say it is usually because the dataset was already available in a usable level scientists can figure out how to work with it but yeah i get the point it ai not like kaggle for scientists in any discipline maxtothej agree although it should be obvious it is not like a phd is a substitute for a bachelors its something you do on top of a bachelors so the are by definition arent going to have the same level of training if you arent assuming a phd is just twiddling your thumbs for years cocodirichlet pearson invented pca in so i do not know why you think it is like all the rage lmao character years ago all data scientist were from other fields the major university in my area just graduated it is first data science phds last year the field was built on the idea that a software engineers coming together with business analysts and statisticians could develop new ways to handle big data machine learning and all those new areas in computing better a business analyst or a bio informatics analyst is going to have a leg up transitioning into data science because they understand cleaning and preparing data and the challenges that come with having good data to analyze that you do not get playing with toy data sets and running the titanic problem for the time this year i wish you the best of luck but having cross functional teams with mixed backgrounds usually helps an organization because each person has a unique fund of knowledge they bring to the table i mean it too good luck hope you land a job you enjoy cocodirichlet and i do not have masters too lol so you do not have a grad degree but are telling others to get a degree and you do not have a phd but you give unfounded opinions on what a phd is and how phds work why do you suggest to get other jobs which do not require ms degrees they will not benefit ds career at all moreover hrs get suspicious if you change your career paths without a reason since when is getting jobs as quantitative analyst market researcher research assistant statistician consultant in a quantitative oriented role at places like mckinsey business analyst trust and safety in tech quantitative ux research etc etc etc a career change it is not you do not even read what i wrote but not shocked character most graduate work in bio these days requires bio informatics experience to publish the days of a biologist going out into the field and drawing little pictures and naming things is over you still do that but then you are either running simulations to model various ecological systems or you are mapping genetic traits between species and a lot of times when you are doing research there is no budget to buy shiny licenses for new tools so you are figuring out how to do more with less or building out using open source cocodirichlet you are an ignorant person commenting out of your ass maybe look up computational biology misomiso that is just wrong my partner did her phd in bio and she had to know a good bit of bioinformatics and so did all of her coll\u00e8gues quantpsychguy oh sure you engage with stakeholders and find alignment between their goals and the corporate goals work with those stakeholders to maintain mutual agreement on the strategic vision then develop expertise in the domain areas such that you can deliver insights and recommendations then figure out how to deliver a learning agenda based upon gained expertise so you can continue to deliver necessary guidance and make sure to keep everyone in a cohesive group the entire team focused on data derived decision making good luck subjectadlmao i am not saying pca in particular is the rage but just trying to point out how much of a data science that biology can be because people think of lab coats and pipettes when they think of biology but in reality they are probably using r and doing stuff like pca with it tvicker i transitioned from business analyst i do not suggest to do it today tvicker so you suggest masters for ds but i cannot suggest masters for ds excuse me and your mentioned jobs are ds jobs good morning tvicker as i have written unless they did stats ml if you want to argue for arguing you may google that comp biology may be about diff eq and they are irrelevant too i did not ask the question but thanks for the answer you quantpsychguy none deleted character fair enough cocodirichlet i said that people should not go directly from undergrad to a grad degree you are not reading what i wrote and are just spitballing bad advice and yes i think it is hypocritical to tell people they need a grad degree right out of undergrad to get a job when you dont have one it is not going to get them a job necessarily it is going to bring debt they might not even like the job after and there are plenty of jobs that put you in the ds career path i never said do or do not do a grad degree just do not do one without any experience cocodirichlet phd in biology have required courses is statistics literally every bio phd has done a large amount of high level stats work they would not have gotten their research accepted if they had not subjectadno you got the wrong person i am not the original person you responded to tvicker i said that getting masters helps in data science where every other company wants a master degree tvicker statistics courses are given at schools too",

  "rare branch yes there are senior developer sme positions where you may still code and make good money but the highest earning potential is always in management ie the ceo does not do the coding but makes more than all their employees who do cocoapug to not data wrangle sounds pretty good imo xpxsquirrel most companies in both day science and engineering have career paths one that stays technical and one that goes management unfortunately the technical paths do not often go as high or if they do are much hard to get to such a high level admired oregon completely normal there is an important switch that happens as you move into management you no longer produce great results you produce great people who produce great results this becomes increasingly more important to grasp as you move from manager to senior manager to director etc in order to produce results through others you end up doing many things that do not involve coding top things that come to mind though not an exhaustive list ensure reports have clear scopes of work that are high value and have cross fx alignment see the extent to which you have to define scope depends on their level scope should be aligned to development needs see performance manage direct reports they need a clear definition of what is expected to meet expectations or be promoted regular evidence based and outcome oriented feedback coaching from you or mentors you identify to help them work through development areas and opportunities to work on their development areas own the stakeholder relationship to ensure they are aligned with your prioritization are adopting solutions your team built understand the value of the work your team has done proactively come up with new projects etc figure out what investments your team needs to be more efficient or effective this could be technical foundations custom templates libraries for common analyses or team process code reviews at a manager level you might not be doing all of that yourself since some of it may belong with senior manager scope but it is good to keep these themes in mind and figure out what your manager expects to give you as a starting point and what they are expecting you to drive edit typo thephoenixrisesagain in many most companies yes cdtoad from doer to cat wrangler you are paid to make strategic decisions we are going to spend a few million to update our tech stack and whatever you decide we will be stuck with for the next years every option has pros and cons so there is no clear best choice choose wisely madmethodman yeah child daycare already costs an arm and a leg adult daycare costs your soul for a bigger paycheck id rather deal with data and take a smaller paycheck i like playing sports not watching it on the tv but on a serious note this is how many companies are structured as you move up you talk more and have more people working under you independent contributors do not really make much up to a certain point unless your company is specifically in something like r and d where technical matters more than talking subjectadyep i have seen it happen plenty someone is gotta be the middle manager and set strategy roadmap squashedapples if you want to wrangle data you can do it for your personal endeavors projects greenbloodedamazon as others have said it is how it goes when i became a data science translator my actual time coding decreased and i spent more time talking and conceptualizing the work then my manager would lament about how long it was since he did any coding now that i am a data science manager myself the only coding i do is the stuff i do at home on my home network at work i am doing a lot of work to make sure my data scientists can do the work we need to do i still research and keep up as i also advise my team on the technical but my time is now in meetings with stakeholders leaders and technology advocating for my team and prioritizing the work i actually find it quite rewarding plus i find i get as much joy from my team developing a new model or application as much as i did when i was doing it i guess it just comes down to what you find the most joy in doing thetacklezone very normal in fact desirable your job used to be about person getting results now it is about your entire team getting results a junior ds knows how to solve a problem a senior ds knows what problems to solve weonlycryalone this is what i have seen every data science manager talks about wanting to be an individual contributor again morebento_ yes in the consulting big and si is you go from technical to managing technical people then managing projects larger engagements eventually attach to sales commercial delivery capability lead at least in my experience herrmatt most businesses will keep promoting people who stick around and who show aptitude for inclusion in the next social circle aeywaka struggling with this right now i just do not feel productive talking and sending emails all day but i also want to move up wanna switch nativedutch regretfully yes renokarchnmy yes how would the career path for something like this look like for a college student i like data science but have experience managing people and do share an interest in it to my knowledge only a business analyst has a more speaking rolealbeit a business analyst is a very different job therealodb you get paid to make decisions and your ass is more on the line than previously everything has a tradeoff count yo self blessed happytfidf it is normal my boss has a title of sr director and he did not write code or code review us for many many years he mostly has meetings writing doc and presenting slides laserdicks all specialists do ohanse if you go up far enough no roles are technical fredisdeadagain that is true of almost every field manage people manage budgets and projects planning kissing up to other divisions and departments contacting outside organizations entropyrx yes it is the way it is managers do not do technical work it is not their job anymore your role is now to enable your team to deliver advise on projects bridge the gaps between teams and resources but mostly it is people management your past technical expertise will allow you to lead and to foster the growth of ic and last but not least to spot bullshits that technical people may feed to non technical ones but if you wanted to stay technical you chosen the wrong career path it is definitely one of the possible routes i started as a ds for years and for the last now work as an implementation manager managing modeling and data teams nittygrittydiscutant this seems short given the fact that you will be held responsible for some of board decisions devviewevvieisabear this is the trajectory i find far too sus you are cornered into a non productive role with a sizable salary but you are also now looked at as accountable for every screw up below you it is a weird vibe and makes me feel constantly on the chopping block i can see moving up upstream to engineering architecture cloud admin but going off the immediate production line would have me passively applying elsewhere from day one primaryexcuseyes that is often what managers do lol strategize and organize bossofthegame seems like a flaw in our economy thephoenixrisesagain believe me data wrangling is less stressful how long did do these promotions take moscowgordon yep management is less work for more money yes it can be more stressful but it can also be more rewarding having more responsibility i would much rather be wrangling data than spending hours a day on calls now you are wrangling people tho peacefullyfighting what sucks is that you are now responsible for timelines you have no control over if the project task requires any engineering estimating time is extremely difficult pandasiloc i would also add that more senior levels on the technical path also involve quite a bit of talking say a third to half of your workday instead of your whole workday in meetings though more of those discussions will be technical in nature than if one went into management however they can involve as much if not more politicking than management tracks due to the rarity and desirability of such positions jimjamjermy this is a great post thanks i started a lead role months ago and could not find advice half as good when i searched funkybside as a director currently yes yes yes yes do notyouloveme most managers i have seen just have to be good at kissing the ass of the people above them and they have to be particularly good at tanking good ideas and stalling so that they can implement the ideas of the people above them morebento_ aka scrum master remotesafety how long did it take for you to become a manager from an individual contributor matttress same here data scientist at consulting now managing a team of data scientists it is stressful in different ways thatsnottonight right i say stuff all the time and do not get paid nearly strifedecer if leadership was not important companies would not waste money on them morebento_ agreed positively relaxing herrmatt senior something individual contributor is for most responsibility charts a fine and admirable terminal career level you should make good money are known for excellent work but also are not expected to guide the company unless it is really tiny staff sr staff and principle ics have to spend a lot of time worry about the direction of the business and therefore their colleagues livelihoods and that can be properly stressful extra so if you move from the ic to people manager path and are not only responsible for interpreting executive goals into executable directions for the people you serve but also for hiring and firing within your remit until you get comfortable handling the corporate bullshit the only true stressful part is to let people go for stupid reasons aka big guy needs new jet the trick is to ride the wave of your own bullshit until it becomes a tsunami and bailout a little before crashing ashore jballoonist especially for introverts peacefullyfighting yep thephoenixrisesagain in fact it is more money for more work in most positions you get very practiced at finding nicer ways to say you are a fucking idiot admired oregon no problem glad you found it helpful it is not a complete list by any means but hopefully gets you thinking along the right direction congrats on the new role admired oregon if they just want to keep their job sure but the ones who do the most exciting work have healthy teams and have sustained success over a long time horizon tend to do more of what i have shared it is what i aspire to do and try to inspire the managers on my team to do johnlocksthekey tf is a scrotum master scum master devviewevvieisabear agile scrum sweatshops but friendly tm greenbloodedamazon too long seriously my path was not easy to getting here even though i was doing a lot of the management stuff since day one so if you ask how long it took since i officially took on the title of data scientist about six years and three companies the third is the one that brought me in as the ds manager my first ds job involved building the entire platform and program so even there i was not straight up just an individual contributor but i had no title beyond sr data scientist second ds job i took it because the first company was not a good place to be if you were neurodivergent not a white man and if you have a phd not long into the second job i got promoted from sr data scientist to data science translator my manager really was grooming me when he left i kicked up my search and found my current role or rather it found me i did not apply initially and had interviewed before applying part of the too long i fully think came from industry hopping prior to data science i worked as a risk and reliability engineer for nasa and in oil and gas and prior to that i was a professor of applied finance and agribusiness it was a long twisting road and i really thought that the management path had passed me by morebento_ i do not like being responsible for people is lives zykezero is what they want you to believe it is important yes just not at the current ratio of compensation throwawayrandomvowel we have always done it this way it must be right tmotytmoty right bossofthegame i do not entirely disagree but your reasoning contains a fallacy there is a conflict of interest when the leaders are the ones who are setting the pay rate for other leaders it is true that good management is important to help direct a team but i disagree with the claim that they are more important than the researchers and engineers definitely my manager seems to be much more stressful dealing with data in most cases is either interesting or boring but it is more often that the task is clearly defined not wrangling data probably means dealing directly with management and be a buffer between their requirements and the individual contributors seeing the middle management in my organization you can clearly see their exhaustion and stress this guy coorporates thephoenixrisesagain this is a typical immature childish way to look at management cscanalytics funny that many see the only way of advancing in this field as bullshiting your way up why not work your way up as a specialist tech lead instead of management study the new sota methods get a master is phd and work on the actual exciting stuff that all of us serious about this field want to be doing not sure what this idea the only way to advance in data science is to go into a management track is founded on bad company that shoe horned you into it i know plenty of ml researchers who get paid close to figures in salary equity at hot start ups and big tech or go start your own analytics firm like i did i personally enjoyed the management c suite aspect as i went from having an impact on niche models to having an impact on the entire company is trajectory basically the management gets paid for responsibility yes sometimes it ends up being rather ridiculous but overall the higher your responsibility the higher the pay strifedecer i get your train of thought but it is usually harder to find a good manager than a good engineer and that is why they are paid more do they actually deserve that much more pay i have no idea strifedecer yes because it works best the majesty needs to have a good technical understanding to make decisions and that experience comes from working in the industry plus most of them miss doing code i was lucky to have a very good mentor it is a hard switch in the brain to move from i do what i have to do to i drive in part what others have to do the big stress is in the first couple of years but a phrase helped me a lot if the company decided you are good enough for management at this point they have your back to help you succeed that is why you see managers literally getting away with murder and be given the opportunity to try again and again before being let go in some cases the stress is self inflicted as employee you are pushed harder harder harder as manager is all about consensus and interpersonal relationships i would say the most important thing is to be comfortable in your own skin and look confident being confident comes over time once you have consensus on the next actions you do not fail the group did not foresee the issue which prevented the project to go ahead smoothly despise the best effort or if it works out celebrate and move on the hardest part is to accept that you are fighting an everlasting war as a corporation against other corporations losing battles is part of the game and everyone in command understands that sure but management is something you have to want to get into you can be an individual contributor for life if you choose to do so with all the issues coming along at the end of the day there is not a free lunch in corporate life the grind is the grind and it never stops until you retire hopefully wealthy or you die and except few fortunate people working for few companies which pay individual contributors very good money for the rest management is the way to get enough money fast enough to create some sort of financial security because for many to is a good wage and that is what you get in many companies as ds but how much can you save of that while having a decent quality of life in your twenties probably quite a bit but as soon as you want to start a family unless your partner makes as much very little get a couple of kids and you are lucky if you do not live paycheck by paycheck so yes there is stress but there is also reward fuehnix i know plenty of ml researchers who get paid close to figures in salary equity i do not doubt that they exist but i highly doubt that you know them and that there are plenty zykezero which is exactly what i said deto yep tons of people work harder than all of us and get payed crap for it economy does not care about what people deserve appreciate the comment maybe i will give it a try eventually monkeyunited i did not expect to be depressed on sunday so thanks for that besides few simple facts of startups fail in the first years so your equity as employee of a startup might never realize you get usually a subpar salary absurdly long work hours for the

  "ghostofkilgore yes it is even just to get a job interview you will need to communicate to the hiring team why you are a good candidate for the role it comes with experience though nobody will expect you to get this fully at do not think of it as sales talk either it is not about some kind of bullshit schmoozing communicating your ideas and arguments clearly and engagingly to others is an extremely important and serious skill communication is an important part of every technical and nontechnical field in data science you need to be able to translate technical data insights into non technical narratives in order for them to be any use to decision makers even if you are just making predictions you need to be able to communicate with data engineering teams and other data scientists in order to get a job in the field you need to be able to sell yourself which again involves communicating fiwer definitely take a class in public speaking in college and read some literature on how to communicate effectively and so on when you are in college not now right now just live your life and try not to be a jerk a good skill to develop early is actively listening to people rather than waiting for your turn to reply anygeologistat i was incapable of ordering pizza on the phone because it felt too awkward tomorrow i am manning our company is booth at a conference because they think i am good at talking to people in my experience the most important thing in learning how to communicate is to take any opportunity you can to do it you can train yourself to communicate in specific contexts but similar to dating it is hard to do it naturally without baseline practice it is one thing to read about social cues another to recognize them in practice and yet another to pick up react to them automatically so that an interaction flows naturally it feels painfully slow but you can get there by deliberate and consistent practice most importantly you are only and should take it easy on yourself nobody is expecting you to be a great communicator now and realistically they will not expect you to be that great a decade from now you have a serious time advantage right now and if you consistently make opportunities to practice fail and improve you will be miles ahead of your peers entering the workforce mkmass you will be fine most likely the field pushes interaction a bit and you have a long time to develop solid social skills it is not really sales just clarity you are and do not need to worry about it affecting future potential opportunities it seems like it is also mental health related based on your other responses and i hope whatever you are trying to do about those issues works well for you more so that you can live the life you are saying you want not just for job opportunities is awkward and a difficult place to be but it is certainly made more difficult by trying to worry about how soft skills are going to affect a career over the long term again try to develop social skills so you can find your tribe and enjoy yourself in the now the rest will work out with trial and error do you want a career advice at survive high school try to have other interests besides books and computers enjoy the next ten years of your life they are the best from what i am reading work on your relationships make friends play sports if you like the friends i made in high school and college are the most honest friend i have and we have been in this rollercoaster ride called life together for many years do silly stuff in moderation none deleted puntopasta too many people here advising to stay away from books and pcs i think that is bad advice do not advice young people to disengage from their passions you do not need to be a sales pro or an extravert or a socialite for this job you need to be good at it first and foremost and that involves spending time with books and pcs the top ds ml heroes are all hardcore nerds i would even suggest that focusing on blabla skills is just a way to compensate for a lack of real tech skills you will learn to communicate that is what life your studies and junior years will teach you do not worry too much about it though i agree that friends are indeed very important not for being successful at your job but for being happy which is much more important wouldataciensultra this is true for like everything you will have difficulty in general with the real world if you cannot communicate well with other people this is not especially true or not true for data ciens needlzor you do but the good news is it is not as hard as it may seem to you now as long as you do not make the classic mistake of shutting yourself out to focus on computers and maths when you go to university pick up a tutoring job and you will get there in no time notoriousder you are get a sales or customer service job get good at it acewhenifacethedbase both verbally and in writing and if you are you have got like years before you are even entry level so lots of time to prep even to just change as a person iwdxd thanks iwdxd thanks for the help i will try to look up books on this and hear more spiritual when i was in college i got lucky i majored in radio television management which meant i had news reading classes but the program also required classes in theater arts which meant standing on a stage and projecting to the last row in the room these classes do not cure you of anxiety or stage fright but they do give you skills to work you through the dry mouth and the urge to run like hell your success at your job will be based in part on your ability to stand up in in front of a room full of people and convince them that your proposal is the best of all and then that you are the best person of all to lead it you will need to project confidence without arrogance you may have to stand there and persuade a ceo to spend million while making them feel guilty if the do not i have a reputation for being good in front of a room

for the comment iwdxd thanks that took a certain weight off of me iwdxd thanks for the comment iwdxd thanks for the comment dataciensultra i do not know you but psychologists love to label people and for some reason being on the soft side of the autism spectrum is like the new adhd do not listen to them that will just become a self fulfilling prophecy just be you bro whatever you want to do you can do it if you set your mind to it do not let some label from some goon behind a desk tell you what your limits are and who you should be in life notoriousder get a job in the summer do sports after school character yeah the fact you feel comfortable approaching a professional kind way at shows you are ready and willing to learn good on ya iwdxd thanks for the comment i am undergoing treatment to improve my everyday communication this gets in the way at school in my social life and sometimes in relationships even with my parents for a while i thought i should just be myself but i ended up pushing away the friends i had i am trying to be myself but an improved version iwdxd thanks keep in mind everyone of these conditions is on a continuous scale someone decides where the condition needs to be called out and there is a need of intervention that mark on the scale is arbitrary i studied psychology in college and my professor of clinical was very skeptic about the massive increase in diagnoses in the past half century a part is due to reduced stigma and willingness to seek and accept treatment which is good another part is due to being a multi trillion dollar business worldwide in therapy medications insurances counselors dataciensultra i do not know you so i do not want to ruin your life or give you bad advice but in my experience getting treatment for psychological conditions is a pretty common situation that young people are but in these days when they do not really need it and it actually just hinders their development by labeling them confining them and preventing their natural development do not listen to me because i do not know you so i do not know what the fuck i am talking about i am just speaking from personal experience and in my personal experience young people need to be given chances to develop and grow naturally before they are put into situations where a psychologist is involved iwdxd that makes sense i accepted the treatment to change in terms of social relationships since sitting in the chair and talking to the psychologist is very difficult for me iwdxd i will try both ways and decide which one to go with thanks for the

  "synthphreak a sandwich artist by definition is a master of the art of sandwich composition it requires a deep familiarity with the inner workings of a sandwich and the complex interplay of flavors it can yield a sandwich maker on the other hand is someone who merely assembles the ingredients others have supplied they are not an artist no skill or training is required no love of the craft should be expected they merely regurgitate the art of the true masters into soulless mass production a sandwich artist can of course assemble a sandwich just like a sandwich maker but with a key difference the artist does not merely make but creates a sandwich bringing to bear their years of apprenticeship their deep understanding of the sandwich is platonic form and their ability to optimize the

we go again with the man child comments from the last post must have really done a number on him excellentbidthis is one of the cringiest things i have ever read on this sub op if you are not embarrassed by this you should be eljefeky are not you the dude who claimed an academic gave you authorship on a paper because you asked a question in class anyone with an advanced degree would know that is not how that works at all you are not fooling anyone bro i think the obsession with titles is hilarious tech company data analyst roles typically make more than data scientist roles at most companies if you are getting paid well and enjoy what you do you who cares you do you though data science is a marketing term not a field of study this term is not defined by some certifying authority like data mining big data and predictive analytics it will likely float on out when some new label arrives personally i have been pushing for extreme analytics ha ha in practice so many people have claimed the title data scientist that its meaning has become hopelessly diluted while i agree that there are many pretenders in this field i do not think the data science banner is the hill to die on teetaps oh hey it is you again didnt you say you were quitting reddit i have a phd i have been a research professor i am by your exacting definition a data scientist i have literally worked with research scientists that have less traditional education than you require and are better data scientists than me this post effectively is every negative trait and stereotype about data scientists this subreddit and data science as a whole elitism unwarranted self importance and a whole lot of hot air pepenudalg in other words data scientist knows what a harmonic mean is anyway nice trolling excellentbidthis is one of the cringiest things i have ever read on this sub op if you are not embarrassed by this you should be mrbirdhouse just in if you cannot rewrite python from scratch you are not a data scientist autumnotter these are depressing posts because if you were serious the basis of what you are saying is accurate a data scientist should be a scientist they should formulate and test hypotheses they should understand their domains and seek to solve data problems that noone else understands but ugh shitting on data analysts the puffed up sanctimonious bullishit i know you are trolling but you are part of the problem you are part of the reason why people say data scientists wouldo machine learning taguscove i love this guy his senseless shouting at job title ontology clouds makes me chuckle savethepandabears back again with some more gatekeeping i see the trolliness in this one was a little weak it was a little too on the nose at the end personally i find a bit more subtlety and nuance are quite effective when trying to generate a reaction character i will be a scientist one day guys i will rewrite the linux kernel from scratch but i will do it right this time then i will create windows written only in brainfk and there will be no upgrades as god intended then i will create machine learning packages after i invent a scripting language called superior serpent and distribute them on floppy disks through the mail sometimes unsolicited you will all have to call me scientist then roadtomandible tell me why you cannot get a job without telling me why you are unemployable goodluckonyourexams the data scientist can formulate new hypothesis test said hypothesis and is intimately associated with the tools necessary to formulate and test those hypothesis ttestxy setz_ op we are in the age of technique in school people do not learn math thinking but math operations and algorithms they teach us to replicate some algorithm and trust the results and in jobs that is exactly what we do the fact is most people do not have enough cognitive capacity or motivation to truly understand statistics and comp science but that is okay they get the job done because at the end data science is about generating the most impact with data does not matter if we use python or pen and paper if we know science and math or just replicate a process taught by some indian on youtube we need to deliver insights from data that is all notoriousder i am not a data scientist but i would like to be however if i have to work alongside troll losers such as yourself i might have to reconsider you sound like every pretentious comp sci genius i did my undergrad with condescendingly lording your intelligence over anyone dumb enough to talk to you no one cares dude chill out and stop being such a tool climatephilosopher i am the world is first data analyst data therapist arrested development fans know what i mean fightermoth but what if i am a master of science in data analytics prehensiledick this is as cringe as the scientists who say data science is not a science budget puppy ah shit here we go again mrbrambles the role was never in the hands of scientists there is no professional society for data science no tests no dues no professional schools nor continuing education make those and you can define and protect the term like so many other professional fields until then data science has no ground to stand on wouldevotedt what happens when a company hires one of the two to do both roles rhetorical i now declare you vice chancellor general of scientific data analysis and exploration idk what is worse this post or the other one from today from the person posting their shitty code asking people to make it better okkitchenah yeah sure and a toast to his brother the guy who only writes machine code otherwise he is no software engineer gottabemd nice on a serious note you are still in undergrad focus on learning the material finding a gf or bf idk making friends and chill at the end of the day literally nobody cares what your title is as long as you make decent money are generally happy with life and help others you should feel fulfilled chaluliss this thread is pure comedy maybe a bit of a beat down but well deserved arrogance is not a useful trait op ya cannot go around espousing about shit like you have authority when you do not and expect to not get trampled on by people who are legitimately more qualified to speak about the subject which you claim mastery over blasketbasket this fucking troll is back again wonderful can we ban this guy already toastenjoyer imagine having pride in the concept of your job upvoted for humor polyrta i do not understand this master of science degree requirement plenty of successful scientists do not have an ms nor phd a scientist is someone studying science to be a professional in it or is an expert researcher in a science vacuouswaffle welcome fellow graduate of the david brooks sandwich college synthphreak the word cope was invented to describe this post op the only thing this post demonstrates is your mastery of semantic pedantry wouldatasnorlax op is what you get when you cross excel and incel dysfu by that definition this dude needs to code his own excel clone to prove he is mastered it marianakl self help book pivoting with a phd overcoming feelings it needs a graph of student loan balance and bitterness wouldgrsmith bruv is quite triggered by poor performance and community feedback in previous post dataciensultra naw bro i really do not understand why people are not getting this funniest thing is i am pretty sure this guy is not even employed looks like he is an undergrad magrik read ops post history dataciensultra lol no i said i was mentioned in a paper the research done was based entirely on a question i asked in class i asked my professor for my time series analysis class why a particular equation used certain terms for an equation instead of something different which i thought would be more useful and representative of the actual data i am not trying to fool anyone bro i am literally just expressing my honest opinion in an internet forum excellentbidop joined a person start up as the only data person and he set his title to supreme allied commander of data science and now he is trying to pull up the ladder pepenudalg probably the best serious reply in this thread data science is not even science in the same way as natural or even social sciences are it does not have its object of study data scientists do not advance theories or conduct experiments to produce knowledge about the world out there it is more or less just a collection of tools to solve business problems yet this is what the op is mad about mrbrambles it is a really interesting topic as far as the utility of a professional society for data science as an authority in data science i think it is something data science desperately needs as you mention data science is not being defined by practitioners of data science which is dangerous rprogrammerman i think it is like calling yourself a computer scientist within computer science there are many valid subfields calling yourself a computer scientist has the connotation that you are doing some kind of research but it is not technically false to say a software engineer or database admin are computer scientists given they work in the field wouldataciensultra i am working on it lol dataciensultra that does not invalidate or even engage with the core of my argument dataciensultra so i am fit to be a proper data scientist after all eh thanks for the support wait until they learn about enharmonic variance and dodecaphonic kurtosis i always ask about the atonal skewedness for baroque string theory for bonus points dataciensultra honestly i am not really trolling except for the last part of the post the idea as a whole is a genuine proposition and i think an important distinction to be made wouldgrsmith if you use stack exchange and read the docs to remind yourself of that obscure pandas function you have used once in years ya might not be a data scientis dataciensultra so you are saying i am right though no dataciensultra i do not even understand what the meaning of the alleged implication of gatekeeping is are you implying i have some vested interest or motivation in preventing certain individuals from reaching a particular status or otherwise that is not what is happening i think every individual should be able to become a data analyst or data scientist if they desire and are willing to put in the work i am merely asserting and explaining the important difference between the two titles dataciensultra that is the point i am making when you call a function to perform a statistical test you are using a confirmed statistical hypothesis that has been created previously by a scientist you are having faith in the scientist that his hypothesis is accurate which is not doing science just relying on science to produce results dataciensultra yes i understand this analysts can deliver just as much value as scientists i am not saying this is not true however deriving value is not the same as engaging in science therefore most people engaging in data analysis are not doing science and are not really data scientists its really not that hard of a concept this community is just biased and needs to protect its own sense of self by living in a shared delusion that data analysis data science its really simple and obvious if you just lay out the facts wouldataciensultra lol you got me there bro sycokinetic division by zero the company implodes wouldataciensultra thanks wouldataciensultra which is a very useful skill in the world of data science no what is the point of doing data ciens if you cannot use advanced semantic pedantry to convey your results to the uninformed plebeians none thank you for your affirmation sir burtfrart underrated comment wouldatainchicago this op are you okay you seem to have a lot of pent up rage about job titles and prerequisites and responsibilities and how things should be i agree that there is a lot of disagreement in this field disagreement on what job duties deserve what job titles and what fair salaries for that work should be some of it is not fair and it certainly is not consistent think of this as a trade like an electrician but it is a new trade like being an electrician in the title of data scientist is new the value we deliver how that value is realized what problems require the craft that is still very much up in the air you are going to find this discontinuity everywhere that is part of doing what we do at the beginning of what we do you are as much a pioneer as a scientist and that is_ something to be proud of regardless of recognition wouldgrsmith just curious as it does nothing for your argument or status in this sub either way but do you have a phd publications worked with a team of researchers on a publication presented at scientific conferences you have the tone of someone not comfortable with refutations or disagreement of their arguments and if you were a steady scientist that contributed to a community of scientists my assumption would be it would have humbled the egoist position you are demonstrating on this sub this really is a team sport and you are playing like a soloing twitch streamer tagging on the people they are playing against and calling them noobs you have something to prove and it is not to any of us magrik it is not that people do not get it it is just stupid af i am sure hitler thought the same way when he first started spewing bull shit too this is like the prologue of the data science version of mein kampf excellentbidah i see op is either a literal child or a troll eljefeky in direct reference to having publications you said you only have two you said that one did not count because all you did was ask a question in class it did not count because you were not an author lol i would love to see the other publication mrbrambles it fits more within the framework of a professional society like a physical therapist or engineering than a field of science synthphreak work harder lol k somefunmaths bro i would fail you on the spot for a salesforce data entry job let alone a technical role there are no shortage of people with the technical chops to be a data scientist but there is a reason behavioral interviews are part of any hiring process a real piece of advice you better work real hard at containing all of this when you eventually show up to a job interview because anyone here who works in the field has interviewed people like you knows the type and knows the red flags to look out for all the better if you can actually fix the personality flaws that lead you to behave this way but at the very least you gotta try to hide them in an interview impossible if you beep boo boo bop instead of using a pages and pencils your a computer nerd just regurgitating google not a finely tuned statistician synthphreak foundthejefffoxworthyfan savethepandabears what you wrote is basically the textbook definition of gatekeeping the essence of your post is you are not a real data scientist unless xyz im not a mind reader i have no idea if you have a vested interest or motivation i would assume so elsewise this post probably would not exist you are however setting an arbitrary boundary defining what constitutes and in group out group then proceeding to disparage those you deem as members of the out group in your definition of the difference between data scientists and analysts you state the data scientist must understand and be capable of negotiating with his tools at what point does someone meet these criteria does someone have to be able to recreate pandas dplyr from scratch do you need to be able to recreate the os on which these tools run what about the hardware the os runs on you cannot be a data scientist unless you are capable of negotiating with the underlying electronics powering your software you clearly have some threshold in your mind where one crosses from being an analyst to a scientist but when you start demanding a profession conform to your myopic definition it becomes gatekeeping tldr who died and made you king of data science the classification between data scientist and data analyst is akin to a classification problem with a very squishy decision boundary there really is not a strong delineation between what makes someone a data scientist vs a data analyst dataciensultra i have the tone of someone using the internet to be an asshole no i do not have a phd i am a undergraduate my superiority complex comes from being the best student in my entire department maybe even the school to answer your question as mentioned i have had my name in two publications but it was trivial i know that i am just a young ignorant fool so i am not really taking this whole conversation too seriously i was mostly inspired by the episodic trolling series on south park to have some fun on the internet by sharing my thoughts that being said i do not act like this in real life i am very personable friendly and do well working with a team fortunately for me though i have enough technical skill and mastery in my domain that i do not really need to do any of those things anyway i have developed and dedicated my life to a product which produces significannot real world value and i do not even ever need a real job if i do not want one i do have something to prove to myself and the world but is that so wrong i would rather prove myself and my competence than prove how worthless and stupid i am by sitting in a corner keeping my mouth shut and doing nothing again i do not really get on this site to do anything but cheese about video games i just made these few posts to get across what i think is a valid point everyone here wants to degrade me and put me down and paint me as being some kind of loser but only because it makes them feel better about themselves t they you want to think i am somehow insufficient because my beliefs and ideology is a threat to their your own so believing that i am somehow unsuccessful or depraved is really just a defense mechanism to protect your own sense of ego and security wouldataciensultra interesting that nobody is really able to engage with my argument and instead just consistently resorts to attacking my character satire and so on synthphreak geez i mean we are generally on the same side here but false equivalence much wouldataciensultra i never said i had a publication only that my name was mentioned in them twice for some trivial amount of work so you are putting words in my mouth the other publication i merely took an application written by a professor in tcl and translated it into python while also generally improving the applications structure for my own privacy i am not going to give you access to either of these publications wouldataciensultra obviously dude you think i act like this in the real world i am not a moron again this is just another example of people unable to engage with my argument so instead they attack my character and justify their own superiority but assuming depravity from my party im seriously bored leave me alone somefunmaths you are the best student in your entire department maybe even the school and you think that invites you to come tell this sub a place full of people who get paid to work in the subject you are paying to study what to think about data science real life is going to hit you like a mac truck kid the day that you run into your first math or physics grad who looks down on you for studying something so applied as data science rather than studying a pure subject and then specializing later remember the burning resentment you felt for data analysts you are not any better than them you just have not yet met anyone to knock you down a peg or ten if you ever learn to put your ego aside you might find a lot of value from working with people who are merely data analysts presumptuousbastard dear lord magrik there is nothing to engage the past few posts i have read from you have been nothing but the ramblings of a narcissist there is nothing to engage with on an intellectual level because you have not said anything value it is why so many people think you are trolling to top it off you are still an undergrad that talks like you have been in the industry for years which adds to the stupidity of it all did you read his last paragraph sounds like this guy is about to start recruiting for a purge with the us vs them mentality i am exaggerating of course character my name has been published on two papers but i did not really do anything especially for the later i literally asked a question in class and the professor did research on it lol your name is on em bro own em bro you got em wouldgrsmith you are an undergrad or an early grad student if you intend to go on to publish in informatics one day you have got to adjust your attitude and work with people no one cares about mentions in articles or contributions that are limited you have got to show you are part of a team of individuals and that you will contribute to the community informatics is a big old community and it gets smaller and more tight knit the more you specialize in your sub discipline work with a community and learn what you can from it or leave it if it is not suiting you if you pulled this attitude in an actual research community though people would not enjoy collaborations with you or want to go to your talks on principle science is highly political and you are blackballing yourself may this be practice for real life and you not have to learn it in your day to day somefunmaths obviously dude you think i act like this in the real world i am not a moron if you think the extent of the behavioral evaluation is do you think data analysts are subhuman idiots then yes yes you are a moron it is funny that you hold data scientists on such a high pedestal and then are doing everything possible to explain why actually you are smarter than all of us and know better than we do all i am saying is that i have met people smarter than you who struggled with ticking basic behavioral boxes not raising red flags maybe they had not been told before that people do not like working with assholes so i am doing you the favor of giving you that forewarning dataciensultra lol okay bud this is just more of you people trying to justify being better than me because i am apparently not prepared for the real world have bad communication skills must be angry or depressed etc fuck off dude lol you guys are so cringe at least i have the self awareness not to take myself so seriously but you guys just keep going at it trying to find reasons to bring me down because you cannot actually invalidate my opinion with logic and facts so you just attack my character yawn this is getting really boring dataciensultra if what i am saying is so stupid and ridiculous why do people feel the need to keep coming back here to tell me in wrong because they are threatened by it and need to secure their own delusion and ego leave me alone eljefeky so op are you just going to gloss over getting caught lying in wouldataciensultra bro this is the fucking internet not a work community you moron hipstahs bro you cannot upload data to an bucket yet chill the fuck out somefunmaths you listed being the best student in your department as your principal qualification in the same sentence that you unironically referred to your own superiority complex and your user name is data ciens ultra everything you have said here is so pathetic that it defies parody unless this is just an extremely elaborate parody in which case good on you you have captured the role of insufferable sophomore undergrad who thinks they know everything with alarming accuracy as far as your struggle to grasp the responses you are getting let me help you are not a data scientist you are a kid in school who one day hopes to be one until you are working in the field i would suggest that you keep these dumb opinions about said field and attempts to look down on people in it to yourself you would get the same reaction if you were a pre med trying to tell a bunch of physicians that nurses were not real medical professionals or some similarly asinine take differences in licensing and length of education aside that comparison is apt here and if you think we are merely being pedantic about saying talk to us when you have a job i would invite you to do a bit of research into what fields these data analysts come from who knows maybe one day you too can aspire to be a data analyst like many of your peers from data science programs magrik no one is threatened by you at all the only delusional person here is you quit posting on a public forum if you cannot handle the criticism wouldgrsmith it says something about your mental frame though there is some research on what people will and will not do when they are anonymous and how that may carry over into other aspects of their lives be careful how you practice being part of a community links to academic citations within the article removed the amp link with bot is help dataciensultra yes they are lol if they did not feel threatened they would need to chastise and berate me so much i offend them by being obviously more smarter and successful while also being mean and condescending people cannot stand the idea that someone like me is actually better than them at what they do you think because i am an undergrad my opinion is invalid and immature that is the problem your bias and insecurity you cannot imagine that an undergraduate is actually smarter and more successful than you hence the insecurity you do realize that undergraduate graduate post grad is fucking irrelevant right most really successful people do not get educated past their bs its only in a field like ds where there is so many ms and phd i have been engaged in the data science field for almost three years now and i am at a point now where i can already make a living off the product i have developed so people like you continuing to bother me in the comments trying to prove how superior you are to me is literally sad and pathetic basically no body on this sub will ever come close to my level of financial success so i really do not care lol amputatorbot it looks like you shared an amp link these should load faster but amp is controversial because of concerns over privacy and the open web check out the canonical page instead i am a bot why and about summon you amputatorbot dataciensultra scores on the dark tetrad personality test revealed that trolls are by far more likely to have narcissistic machiavellian psychopathic and sadistic personality traits none of these things are negatively correlated with material or career success narcissistic machiavellian psychopathic and sadistic people can be just as functional if not more functional than normal people so i do not see the point of your argument you think i cannot put on a mask for the real world i can and it has a very big smile magrik narcissism at its finest wouldgrsmith thanks bot you strike me as an immature kid with delusions of grandeur people that are actually good at something do not need to go around screaming about it online the lie about having publications is the icing on the cake synthphreak narcissistic machiavellian psychopathic and sadistic people can be just as functional if not more functional than normal people a narcissistic machiavellian psychopathic and sadistic person dataciensultra does not make me wrong lol wouldataciensultra you realize that you need to believe i am lying because it makes you feel better about yourself that makes you the delusional one lol dataciensultra you do not know me bro lol blasketbasket you do not need our help being wrong you are doing that just fine on your own dunno how it would make me feel better about myself i care about what i can do for me rather than what some random undergrad is or is not doing for himself get help with your issues i guarantee that people are picking up that vibe in real life even if you think you are acting normal synthphreak and thank god for that magrik it is like talking to a toddler in the middle of a temper tantrum dataciensultra see your doing it right now you are assuming and projecting the idea that there is some kind of insufficiency or depravity in my life like i must be unsuccessful in my social interaction or career why because it makes you feel better about your own life you cannot believe someone like me arrogant narcissistic etc is actually just fucking winning every day at the career field of your choice sorry bud i have really good social skills i am well liked in my community and there is nothing wrong with my life i am just being a dick on the internet big surprise no psycho analysis needed lol winning as in lying about publications gotcha and again people who are successful and well liked do not go around telling everyone on the interwebz dataciensultra bro why would i lie about something as trivial as that like i said it was just a small mention for some trivial things i really did not do anything the only reason i was mentioned because it would be unethical for the researchers not to do so i only brought it up because someone mentioned it when they were trying to flame chastise like you are doing right now i never tried to brag about it or anything else and i literally make posts in a hour period trying to make a single point that i feel genuinely about if you look at my history i really only use this site for gaming discussions and now i remember why i am not sitting on this site bragging about my success like ever only in this one instance to defend myself fuck off bro you have no idea what you are talking about lol",
  "eddyofyork tell him you have no idea where his concerns are coming from given the data also update your resume and start looking at jobs because he might be an asshole cannot hurt weeks into a job depending on the company data i would need up to months to get to full speed what a shit manager he should ask if you are finding your way around what your opinions of the job are if you are struggling with some things what you feel is bottlenecking you what is giving you energy and what is taking it away why is it taking your energy away if anything is it is his job to get you up and running by understanding what you are struggling with just stating you are kinda slow gtfo lol what a dickhead people are not supposed to be fully functioning team members after weeks none massive red flag no hiring manager expects good productivity in the first couple of months the first two months should be around meeting people learning the culture and tech of the company and slowly start working on easy tasks to learn the specific tools and most importantly learn more about the stakeholders and their work style squeevey i am going to say this and take it with a grain of salt stop delivering your work early start delivering it when it is due second do you have a task tracking system with due dates who else are you meeting with besides your manager atmosck maybe he is just a dick but early on like this is a good time to talk candidly about this kind of thing it is easier to fix something that is new i would definitely find a way to ask why he thinks that or if he wants to adjust what deadlines he gives you ktpr maybe he is gaslighting you in order to cause you grind through work at an unhealthy pace and replace you when you burn out casseiopei seriously my new workplace told me to take it slow for weeks and just make sure i am comfortable and this is not like a fancy position or anything fermatslastaccount weeks generally i spend the first month of a job doing absolutely nothing the fact that he is complaining about this just means he is an asshole definitely a red flag never heard of an appraisal in weeks generally three months is considered training and getting to know the job team and culture and fitting in raddymaddy someone once said we are so busy doubting ourselves while others are intimidated by our potential im sorry for your experience and i can relate all that i can offer is to find a better workplace more often than not toxic managers are a result of their environment other times they are just ass holes sloppymeathole so naturally you asked your manager what the expectation is because that should be your next question if you are being criticized for turning in work late that is not late but as others have said this sounds like a red flag you two are not on the same page maybe talk to your co workers and figure out what the expectations are or have a conversation with your manager about what their expectations are quantumbullet sounds like your manager is a weak leader trying to passively wring more work out of you zoshka sounds like a red flag they should be focused on communication and finding ways to improve the outcome if slow then how can you communicate on the obstacles so they are clear for them saying someone is slow is old school third world sweatshop mindset manager on your part i would say try to understand where communications can be improved the time something takes is just the time it takes no amount of rushing can make it go faster without sacrificing something else quality testing explainabilitymaking documents and presentations maybe try to communicate those dilemmas and make them decide and be aware of the tradeoffs cscanalytics horrible manager find a good company to work for and quit on this bozo without notice pandasgorawr i am sorry you are going through this your manager is wholly unreasonable you are two weeks in that is when people are generally setting up their computer getting a lay of the land filling out hr forms and picking your health insurance bananavelcro did you ask for clarification explain that you finished your tasks before the deadline and ask what his expectations are a good manager will build in extra time to account for unforseen problems so it could be a bad sign that you only finished the tasks a day early if nothing complicated came up but a good manager would not throw this criticism out there without explaining more or discussing how you can improve he would also have realistic expectations for how long it takes a new employee to onboard and set up their working environment ipsocranius hey boss i view that comment as a red flag i value my work quality and as i come more online with project details my pace will naturally pick up faster and i am concerned you have decided that i am slow performing despite being in my first few weeks and hitting my target deadlines ahead of time its important we are clear on expectations and deliverables early in our work relationship together can you please specifically point out what has been slow or barring that please be very clear where your expectations have not been met his answers will determine your next course of action a good manager will levelset to describe any shortcomings and possibly even apologize for sending a poor signal a poor manager will gaslight you or deny life is too short to work for poor managers tmotytmoty i hate all non tech leadership who ask me for anything at this point i too am at the end of my rope they do not listen or pay attention and they cannot make a firm plan to save their lives my heart goes out to you it sounds like iit is not you it is always them find a polite way to push back and stand up for yourself otherwise this doofus will continue to push you around your time is worth more than they appreciate good luck goleggett gaslighting start recording all the tasks you have been assigned the deadlines and when you delivered the tasks make sure you get a paper trail of the evidence whether it be a teams slack message or email sounds like he is got it in for you from the get go i had a friend with a similar experience in a different field he started doing the above and the problematic manager soon changed his tune when a new head of department came in and my friend expressed his concerns start applying elsewhere right now if you get something else soon enough you do not even have to put this job on your resume nobody will notice a one month or two gap in a resume during big tech layoffs venticocainelatte sorry but your manager is an idiot document everything and make sure you specifically call out every project by name it will serve you well in your reviews wow sorry but that is concerning of all the normal process for someone to get into the normal flow of a company may take months not weeks someone usually gets fully comfortable with processes and stuff after or months as a former team lead not data science different it field i tried to focus on goals if x goal is fo finish something in days i should not care if you finish it on day or day it may be too early to say but keep an eye on that manager he does not seem to be a good one purplebrownupdown two weeks in that is a red flag ask him what exactly is taking long and what is the rush is it an artificial deadline i have had bosses make these artificial deadlines for their own promotion and it hurts the team leads to turnover and burnout and is selfish automaticincomehuge red flag but glad you are crushing it anyways i would start the job search again sadly dragonslayersome people are never satisfied no matter how fast you work or how good you are they always want more out of you i used to work for at and t and i was the fastest wiring person they had i actually worked myself out of a job and they did not have any more work for me after years of working for them so i got a job as a contractor and got a job that pays times more and i was working alongside my boss who was working for at and t they told me that i would never make as much money as my boss because they implemented a two tier wage scale i said you mean if i work years i will never make as much as my boss that is when i started looking for another job longjumpingmeatred flag my new manager told me that i was slow at my work as well i had delivered everything i needed to deliver on time i got stuck in a few things because of dependency but somehow they were insinuating that i was not doing enough when asked for support to push the other team to finish the dependency i was provided no support tolerated them for months and then i quit that toxic job vagabondclast weeks i data science and have you even got any access to any of the db yet i am trying not to be judgemental but after managing multiple data science teams this manager is either non technical who believes ds is a magic wand or just passing the pressure on to you either switch teams or if possible jobs as both the conditions scream that this guy clearly does not know how to manage a new team member uzumakibey update your resume report him to management and leave to a newer job and before you leave be sure to fuck him up in hr sovindi probably you are dealing with an asshole find a way to deal with it or start send your resume to different companies econdweeb shit manager go somewhere else frequentiststats you need to get the hell outta there fast let me take a wild guess is elon musk your manager masterjaga since everyone seems to have the same opinion here i would beg to differ what is your level of seniority and how hard did you negotiate your salary in short if you presented yourself as a rainmaker you better over deliver espumma maybe they do not like that they can only assign you billyions it depends how easy the tasks are i could issue a couple tasks each of which should not take more than hours to complete if i tell them the deadline is a week away i might still expect them to show up a lot sooner ready for more almostfreitag i am a manager for recent hires we set long deadlines because the risk of delay is high if you are delivering near deadline time you are slow because you still not matching others speed i had an employee who did not understood this logic so he never got good programming speed so we let him go edit fucking hell everyone now is micromanaging my job lol does not anyone here understand how deadlines work it was explained to him he needed to improve it took year and many performance reviews until we decided to fire him just say thanks for the feedback for about months until you have a better idea of how the business functions after that feel free to push back or provide suggestions themootzpallucci a case of do notrademeosis odd were the tasks truly finished was he expecting more check ins along the way with drafts to get to a truly finished product by those deadlines that is the only way this would make some sense to me if this is your first job of this type maybe you approached deadlines more like school rather than how a lot of work expects more feedback and iteration along the way it does not sound like a super helpful manager if it left you this confused but the best course of action is for you to try to understand what he means by finished and due dates nittygrittydiscutant maybe it is a form of motivational speech animalepton you would need to ask him why not us are there things you should be doing other than the tasks training materials you should be working through environment setup you know better than we do how much time a task should take i cannot tell if these are hour long tasks that you are doing a day early or something that require hours of work spread over three days or if you have no other responsibilities one task at a time the due date may be the final delivery date the hard deadline but before then maybe he is expecting you to raise a pr for review so that you are getting feedback with more regularity maybe it is so you can get to know their processes or so that there is time for testing before deployment maybe these are small tasks you do not have other responsibilities and your manager is not understanding why even small tasks are taking you x time when you are not juggling other responsibilities or stakeholder requests just communicate about the expectations this is not some kind of formal appraisal you can still get feedback during training and it is far better to get feedback early and often at my job yeah it is going to take a long time to really get to know the tech stack and get comfortable but that does not mean that there are not expectations around what you should be able to do get done early if you have finished earlier than the due date and if there is a clear understanding on his part that the due dates where what you understand them to be then he is just an unexperienced bad manager all that being said assume good faith maybe he is mixing things up and inadvertently thought the due dates where earlier so talk to him about this and make sure things get as close to a clear common understanding between you too as early as possible otherwise the toxicity of this encounter can ruin your motivation going forward and lead to bigger issues satansxlittlexhelper just suggest that maybe they are the slow one and they are projecting chiaturamanganese ask him point blank what the expectation for meeting deadlines is fyi last in first out your manager could be prepping material for nudging you out if you leave by your own accord company does not have to pay severance i experience this all the gd time as an autistic neurotypical people are prone to not saying exactly what they mean and become upset when we do not read their minds then they become upset when we say what we mean act accordingly and do not understand why they insist that they are right when they read between the proverbial lines when that is just an empty space gboostedmachinations just to add to what others have said the pressure to work faster has been a constant for me i put out far more work than my senior colleague and this guy is constantly making comments about how to work faster i think managers in this field think they need to do this to increase productivity or some such nonsense unless you are getting real pressure it is probably safe to stay the course and not sweat it as someone else said though it is always a good idea to keep the resume updated and to keep an eye on the job market just in case you really do have an asshole as a boss that is why you should never leave your first job until you feel comfortable at the new one unless you are hybrid or onsite of course got one exactly like that months into the job and now been a month of no job lmao start the job search again my dude tangerienpuffa if you ca not be just be arbitrary own he may just be an asshole he may just be a whip cracker he may just be under pressure while others have pointed out looking for a new job may be good i would suggest the following as well new job can take months or years talk to someone friendly on the team or on a related team they may have actual advice or they may just come out and confirm the guy is an asshole they may also have more experience and have learned how to manage expectations either way it cannot hurt do not ask your managers favorite person on the team others have brought up asking how you are supposed to know given the expectation was not explicit and in your responses you have already learned and that is could but i would add some nuance to that in that approaching it with a reconciliatory tone and proactively looking for a solution can go a long way and i do not mean accept accountability for example hey sorry things did not work out as you expected but i did not have a clue you felt i was talking so long so i was spending the sweating the details in the future i can get stuff done sooner but i also just want to make sure you are aware of any trade offs you might have to make a little empathy even for asshole managers goes a long way maybe your manager was just having a bad day maybe your manager is under a lot of pressure maybe your manager had to fight to get you hired and if people do not see you working hard they are going to cut his team none of this excuses your manager being an asshole but people are people and my over arching point is there is a non zero chance you would behave the same in your managers position i have been an asshole manager before without realizing and even though i have always earnestly held the principle that if someone wants to work their hours and go home then it should not be held against them in any way to do so i grew because some employees drew a line but simultaneously helped me manage some of these people have become some of the best friends i have from my adult life and we still check in on each other even though we are both at different companies now to finish it off i will say there are assholes everywhere if you already think this is not going to work out then looking for a job is the best play but just internalize the fact that you are going to need to learn to face this down at some point and develop the skills necessary to manage it i promise you will not be able to change jobs every time someone is an asshole to you just keep up strong communication i have been in this situation just make sure communication is strong happykoalacub yeah i got him to walk the comment all the way back by asking things like how am i supposed to know you are expectations if they are not what you are writing down but i am getting a real bad vibe now because my first project was looking at how efficient the video annotators are im starting my job search again fuehnix if he is only had the job for weeks what is there to update lol should someone even bother listing a job that they have only been at for weeks on their resume i feel like you would want to hide it independentdoti would recommend to talk to him first before move to other job stop leaving job for every minor inconvenience for crying out loud spanish sith months we have some processes and programs it took me like months to the point where i felt i was confident working with them and i had not really learnt them well til the month mark maybe that speaks more to my company is code quality tho lol happykoalacub yeah not to mention i thought i was doing an excellent job getting up to speed because i had been completing tasks drdalenquaice some people never are none deleted totally agree if that is how he acts after weeks imagine after months thetjalian absolutely correct i can count on two hands the number of times i have seen an employee hit the ground running with impressive productivity in the first few weeks and i have seen new starters in the triple digits across my working life happykoalacub yeah company seems to have shit culture it is hybrid in person remote but there is not a lot of talking in person now i am wondering if everyone else is concerned about being too slow lol happykoalacub yeah i was aiming for a little early just to have a good impression at first but apparently that was a dumb idea yeah we use jira but also the manager says to leave it to him to mark things as complete and he never does in terms of meetings about my work there is no one else i really meet with happykoalacub i tried to talk to him about it but he did not really have any good justifications we kinda left off with i ca not guess when you expect things to be done if its not what you are writing down so we will see if he improves happykoalacub yes i asked what the expectations are and why they differ from what is on the work tickets he really did not have an answer happykoalacub problematic manager is the son of the ceo founder happykoalacub it is an artificial deadline happykoalacub he is the ceo founder is son happykoalacub no but i would not be surprised if he looked up to elon as a role model happykoalacub salary is garbage of what i was making and they refused to negotiate i only took the job because i was afraid of the economic climate why you do not say the real deadline as you know it employees should try to guess what you do not tell ipsocranius i understand your thoughts here but you should be crystal clear that this is what you are doing and what the outcomes of performing at an onboarding mode after onboarding is really you fired people because they cannot read your mind i am sorry to say but you sound like a shitty manager iwantagrapeinmymouth amazing to see a manager complaining about being micromanaged on reddit love to see it eddyofyork progress is non linear man do not let it get you down i had a boss that screamed at me for delivering exactly what he asked for and accused me of knowing what he had really meant these people will never be happy you on the other hand you have got a shot at a good life thetjalian dude it is been two weeks days of work a day or two of which i bet was taken up by onboarding activities your boss sounds like a knob i am not gonna tell you to pack your bags nor am i going to tell you to slog it out either maybe he is just in a bad patch in his own life and you have gotten off to a bad start through no fault of your own or he could just be a knob what i am going to tell you to do is trust your gut days realistically is enough to get a rough idea of the company culture and attitudes of everyone as a whole if you are seeing any red flags that are making you uncomfortable then consider leaving do you have any colleagues you can talk to about this i know it is only been weeks but there must be someone you can talk to in a factual manner about performance expectations and going through your workload sorry man i had a job for only seven months at a fortune company because the team lead was toxic and would gaslight everyone like this in the seven months i was there we had over turnover because one person hired after i started actually managed to stay only three months before leaving lawfulmuffin i was waiting on important access to a database for like years and eventually left a company still waiting on said access oh yeah totally nothing weird about that jballoonist it is true big company problems as a former coworker of mine used to say salmonidae found the manager this is not the workfloor it is reddit it is meant to be taken with a grain of salt and some bleach to wipe your eyes with after strolling down the comment section dickhead bobdope wow you have come bottom in the whole world ahem it was more than lines purplebrownupdown i am sorry then if you do not speak now then this problem will presist masterjaga oh well i guess then i agree with the others almostfreitag developers define their own deadlines i only set deadlines for new hires on a short period of time almostfreitag no i actually explained it with words to him i even draw it in a board how the deadline from the same task for him was almost double from other people honkaponka not that i am p but letting go and firing are two different things also quite sure he does not expect mind reading employees where did you get that from and naturally i am taking for granted that p took the time to explain to the employee that he was slow in comparison scissorsgrinder i read someone on this sub today who manages others saying it sounds terrible but you can pay employees less who you can encourage lower self esteem confidence in they are right it does sound terrible happykoalacub thanks wow that sucks sorry you had to deal with that true thanks happykoalacub the culture does seem pretty shite compared to other places i have worked unfortunately they seem pretty controlling and weird same here i had to ask my colleagues to do the tasks which was assigned to me i used to code it up and shared it to them each time but now i finally have all the access required for the job spanish sith i am really happy where i am but i am hoping i can move somewhere where the processes are not so entrenched where it is impossible to change anything or maybe that is a pipe dream and everybody else is as messed up as we are none deleted but then why not simply setting the deadline for them the same as others that way you might have reason to let them go if they do not deliver but if you set a longer deadline and they deliver within that timeframe it just makes things more complicated professionally and morally when you fire them i do not understand you gave them longer deadlines without letting them know they should not actually be working to those deadlines then you drew out a picture to show that other people had shorter deadlines then you fired them i am a manager too this is similar to saying you can get free labor if you just take them from their homes and put them in chains abuse of humans for productivity gains is disgusting people like that deserve to get found in the parking lot after work where there is no cameras thetjalian then i would absolutely get your cv back out there but do not quit unless you absolutely have to it is way easier getting a job when you have a job plus even if you do have some money saved if you do not get a job you want in time you may end up having to take any job and risk landing back at square one without a safety net this time in the mean time take the work you are doing and use it for your portfolio where possible obviously expunge corporate data and replace it with your own dataset any additional amount of proof of your competency in a real world setting will always help a1ic3g1aof course people will get defensive in response to slow what else should be expected meadowpoe tbf you did not reply to op so you gave no advice you were here just larping sciencelord advice almostfreitag it works like this when someone is a junior we do not expect they to know how to measure the time they will take to do it they do not have the experience yet to do so so me or any other tech lead set the times making it bigger as there is a learning curve and etc after sometime people got experience understand the work and start setting their own times we call it story points so you join the company we give you extra time to learn after months your experience time is over you still have support from the team but you start defining your times after months you are still defining times as a new person we have a feedback session you do not improve and that is strike in technology we do not just fire people not only it is a waste of investment in training it is hard to hire a new person so we have like bad performance reviews so this guy i mentioned already had year of bad performance almostfreitag no i just did not got into many details on my answer bcoz it is a lot basically new people get more time after they are not new anymore they set their on times and his times never improved it took year investing in training and giving performance reviews before we fired him scissorsgrinder sounds like you think they are a small minority or maybe youre a revolutionary happykoalacub yeah i am getting bad vibes all around from this company but i will stay until i find something else none deleted they are definitely a minority but i get that is edgy to say otherwise so go ahead and edge lord it up a1ic3g1aobviously a sensible manager would review the tasks to understand the root of the problem instead of antagonising the employee with a personal attack like a dickhead dude you ca not just say dickhead on reddit are you mad s lol",
  "ominousanenome have you tried a causal inference method i did not quite understand the details you laid out so you will want to research if these methods can apply to your use case but something like propensity score matching or coarsened exact matching seems reasonable at first glance translatepro thanks for your feedback a colleague ended up recommending synthetic controls which i think fits my use case",
  "taguscove it is actually a really interesting question that can go many ways what is the business goal why was the metric chosen discussing the underlying data generation process how the observed values compare to management prior expectations annual seasonality you make tons of decisions in life with three data points or less if snow falls off an awning onto your head you are going to learn and respond if a girl you like holds your hand you are going to learn and respond do not let the volume of data generated obfuscate these essential questions idownvotedragonborn it only takes dissecting one chicken to know it has a heart lungs and other organs you can learn a lot from little data is it sufficient to make a decision i guess it depends on how much variability you might expect and how important the decision is uh ohspaghettio statistically you can get an average sycokinetic they might have been trying to get a feel for how candidates would handle a worst case scenario i would have answered with something along the lines of it not being enough data to do anything interesting but if it was absolutely imperative that i do something without gathering more data i would just make a bunch of plots and hope to eyeball an intuitive colinearity and if that is the wrong answer and i am actually supposed to spit out a bunch of summary statistics and the whole shebang well then i dodged a bullet because that means they are probably beholden to the demands of c suites who force them to do a bad job clanatk i think this is a trick question if you have values you have far more than data points you have all the information surrounding the data like the market the company is in and what each of the three data points represent data points means almost nothing statistically but i think this question is to get a sense of how well someone can apply knowledge of the business domain the data points represent cliffdraws define a plane nashtownchang it sounds like a conversation starter in an interview and your friend did not take the cue johndburger i guess i do not understand the confusion you can get a mean or median obviously with large error bars you could fit a line and make a prediction for april again with large error bars i could build a statistical model using method of moments with data points reach and frequency it depends on the ask so i am guessing this is perhaps referring to poisson distribution eg sales per month is an average of x sales per minute eg internet store so the total sales per month is a sufficient statistic for the assumed poisson distribution 1verfassungszusatz data points are better than no data you can tell if it is a small company or a large company you get a sense of sales month to month volatility and you can use this data in bayesian frameworks to refine priors for example you can use three nuclear accidents three mile island chernobyl and fukushima to estimate the probability of beyond design basis event at a nuclear power plant wouldataciensultra ideally you could draw a triangle and color it something pretty aminelemaizi data scarcity or cost of data gathering can be a real problem i have worked on a use case where we needed to estimate car traffic on some roads that had no prior statistics shared so what we have done is going in person to the said road and do the counting for like to different week days in a defined time window and as you can imagine doing this for like cases is costly both time and money with our budget so we used this to data points for each road to extrapolate based on the hourly traffic shape during the day then during the week then the year based on official statistics to have an estimation it was not precise but was good enough to have an estimation karxxm data analysis should always be focused on the question you want to answer if you want to know if the numbers are constant or fluctuating one can find a slight hint in datapoints if you want to start an exploitative approach and analyze the data to find something interesting datapoints are useless apccheme i had a professor who said you cannot see anything with two data points with you can see if they make a line so that is what you can do with data points see if they make a line if they do that is the best you can do given the circumstances if they do not then you need more data lol kyleireddit fair enough for your first part of the answer i like it and variance kyleireddit my thought exactly i am just curious if others have different perspective on how to treat data points to get any meaningful reference for business kyleireddit this i agree with you and told him as well but between the fishy interaction during his interview and the immediate hr feedback the company decided to promote from within just in one day after i assumed it is all fake but thanks for sharing your thought kyleireddit i do not think it was between such weird question and the recruiter came back a day after to inform him the company had promoted internal candidate it was enough to make me believe the interview was a fake but i am actually interested to know your take on how you would deal with data points kyleireddit i thought about it and pretty sure my colleague did as well i could be wrong in my example claiming the data points represent jan mar they could be anything and i am reluctant to ask him again going with your suggestion though it still does not make sense to suggest for large company to strategize anything based on data points mean median do not mean much with so little data kyleireddit and what kind of information you get from it curious to know uh ohspaghettio yeah point being i once was talking to a data science manager and sometimes they ask vague questions like this to see if you can give a simple and straightforward answer rather than describing a process of jumping through many technical hoops slashdave what an odd answer it makes no sense jan sales mar sales apr sales oh too little information to infer anything let is just ignore the data and do nothing i mean the normal distribution is defined by parameters so it is not a data heavy but it is extremely useful i would first describe what can be done with that little data and then talk about the limitations and blah blah blah i would not think that kind of interview question is fake or a throwaway like the op suggested kyleireddit it seems you have similar ignorance as the interviewer about business data even using your fake data it can means literally many things kyleireddit but those parameters need sufficient data points to make them meaningful right character but you could come up with a hypothesis and approach the sales team ask if they have any historicals is there generally a dip in the spring are there events that are affecting market partners or suppliers you could lean on your coworkers in the analytics department take your insights to someone else and ask questions be ready to listen and try to understand you do not work in a vacuum by yourself okay let is say we are going down the path of a normal distribution how many data points do you need to find the mean and how many do you need to find the variance slashdave um no if the three values are and they i would be tempted to claim that a predicted value of say is unlikely kyleireddit now i wish i was the one that took the interview granted i did not have the hand experience and my colleague could misinterpret the info but the only thing he was sure of that the question was something like what would you do with data points and no other as others pointed out and i agree there are few things that one can do but all will be statistically pointless in term of summarizing for insight generation from business perspective and the fact that the hr came back to him the very next day stating they had made the decision it is just show the whole thing was a suspect kyleireddit more than for sure kyleireddit and if the values are and and not in that order how would you summarize them slashdave but all will be statistically pointless in term of summarizing for insight generation from business perspective another weird answer you can fit a line to three points and infer an error sure there is uncertainty but hiding your head in the sand does nothing by the way a line fit makes no sense in this case since sales numbers cannot generally be negative what other assumptions can you use to make a better prediction now you have started an interesting conversation character that is fair alot of internal positions require interviews for equity purposes but at the end of the day if they are dead set on a candidate the that person is getting the job for mean it is just for variance it is i guess statistics is not your thing slashdave that a value of say is unlikely in practice interpretation depends on context what i am saying is that in certain circumstances just three data points can have a meaning kyleireddit weird are you still in school or actually have work experience kyleireddit true so regardless of the interview for some reason that question keep coming up in my head assuming if the interviewer had an objective interview what would one do with just data points in my head hearing such question asked by middle to exec person from big telco firm i certainly put it into business perspective yet i could not for the life of me finding an appropriate approach to make it meaningful recommendation making trend seasonality etc etc still need more data points so i turned into experts here at least i hope it would intrigue a few good people to poke around and respond kyleireddit i am gonna screenshot your comment as the master of statistics good joke apparently stats is your thing not slashdave oh if you only knew maybe i should use more catchy phrases like insight generation character i always think questions like that are to weed out people who refuse to ask for help are afraid to ask for help or think of themselves as lone data hackers them against the world supreme in thought and action a way to say huh is this a team player make the screenshot and post it here or other statistics relates subs kyleireddit kid go back to school tell your teacher to promote data point mean and data points variance let adult chime in here kyleireddit i was thinking to post it on your school site just need your info you can start here kyleireddit nope i want to start at your school why hesitant you do not want to promote it come kid tell the info i will post it kyleireddit i will be waiting kid let is make your school famous for teaching data point mean and data points variance",
  "switchorganic no plan survives first contact it is both bad timing and a bubble a lot of companies were not actually ready to do the sexy data science things the big tech companies are doing and jumped the gun companies have now shifted priority to building out infrastructure and supporting data science efforts data science will continue to grow but not at the rate it did during the the market also sucks with the cheap free money now gone and interest rates rising a lot of companies are preparing for a rocky so hiring is down all around and what is available is more competitive i think you should figure out what you actually want to do or like instead of hoping around to what looks cool or gets you the bag i think you should explore these other interest before you shift your future plans i cannot help but note the irony in linear algebra killing your ds finance goals but then wanting to pivot into ml later spend some time seeing if software engineering is something you actually want to pursue instead of wondering about it a lot of software engineering is using frameworks and libraries how do you know you will not feel the same as you do now with ml and kaggle fill in those knowledge gaps so you can make an informed decision whether you should shift your goals again you do not need a cs degree to become a software engineer either so you would not necessarily need to change your major unless the cs degree meant that much to you software engineering cs once you figure out your interests and what you want to do you can start looking into how you can leverage those things into a bag i say this as someone who changed my educational plan and goals like times over years cocodirichlet are you writing a novella look into applying for this you are going to have to go through all of the opportunities and you can apply to more than have you looked into start ups look for start ups close to where your family lives or start ups in the location of your university focus on start ups that you are interested in the topic mission go to angellist and start looking you will have to write something short and compelling to contact people directly yes apply for internships that are on other topics but you can still qualify i think you should have applied already like business intelligence internships at national labs or nih i hope you did not apply only to tech internships can you be a research assistant for any professor during the summer and work remotely professors in many disciplines need help cleaning data scraping data anything data which you can do even though you feel like applications are a lot they are not if each position had good candidates then the chances of each application getting a call is pretty slim unfortunately doing mooc and coursera and all of that is totally useless if you want to invest time on something come up with your own project topic make a plan on what you will accomplish from start to finish and work on that fyi it is totally normal to be confused and think whether this is for you or not or to get tired at times the good news is that it is the skills you learn are pretty flexible career wise you are in the middle of two things one a hiring freeze which tends to affect entry level and junior level positions more than senior level positions two a restructuring of the qualifications to become a data scientist you have probably heard before on this sub that a data scientist is not an entry level position however in the past it is sort of was at least if you had the academic qualifications people with no work experience but a master is in data science we are getting hired as data scientists what i am seeing now is that more companies are demanding prior experience for some this means internships for others it means having a year or two of work experience as a data analyst in fact i am seeing preference given to folks with a year of experience as a data analyst dba or data engineer over folks with just internships since you almost have the degree i would highly recommend that you start applying for entry level data analyst positions instead of data scientist positions after a year or two of work as a data analyst you will be ready to apply for data scientist positions and no one will care about what internship you took in college in my own job hunt i found that having a graduate degree and experience as a data analyst made the hunt extraordinarily easy i got two offers in the first nine jobs that i applied to back in june my experience and my degree got me into the door and my experience more than my degree allowed me to do well in the interview if you have a year or two of experiences of data analyst that means a year or two of experience working with real data what they cannot really teach you in school is how messy real data is and the specific ways it is messy also after a year or two of working as a data analyst your sql skills should be really sharp this is one area that surprisingly enough a lot of folks with graduate degrees in statistics and even data science lack implement worried out of curiosity what courses comprise the data science major what school does it fall underis this through a business school how much math have you taken is you university near a midwest city that it has alumni pull in maybe you could try as you called out apply for business analyst or data analyst roles it might makes sense to try to switch majors if you do not feel data science is right for you it could also give the opportunity to have another try for internships having an adjacent internship followed by a computer science internship might make your resume more appealing for entry level jobs laughingwalls if your a college student that is not near graduating take multivariate calculus and linear algebra you can start this summer and take them at a community college or somewhere cheaper then when your done a proper applied stats ms degree or cs once your done with undergrad there are many masters programs if your gpa is or higher there is a masters program somewher that will take you get your masters degree from a real university and not some school most people have not heard of if your not competitive for a school with pedigree try to do a masters degree near a major city that is ds hub like go somewhere on west coast or chicago or nc or nyc or texas places that have lots of ds jobs and lots of companies that would be my advice internships are worth less than credentials and there are plenty of internships for masters you have time mountainstarpenguin you do not need a cs degree to become a software engineer either so you would not necessarily need to change your major unless the cs degree meant that much to you software engineering cs are you saying that which degree i get as an undergrad does not matter so much as what i study and practice on my own would it be in my best interest to stick with my current degree path since it is the fastest path to graduation and then explore the topics and skills that i find interesting and work towards those as eventual career goals mountainstarpenguin what courses comprise the data science major basic cs courses dsa math calc intro to linear logic and sets applied stats probability theory upper division cs analysis of algorithms ai ml data specific courses big data management database design data visualization and mining as well as generals cognates in the other sciences etc my university also requires all ds majors to choose a concentration area i am doing a finance minor for this and how much math have you taken everything listed in math above there is also a requirement for one more math elective for which i plan to take intermediate linear next year and what school does it fall underis this through a business school the ds program is jointly run by the department of computing and the department of mathematics and is you university near a midwest city that it has alumni pull in im not exactly sure what you mean by this i know that a lot of students in accounting or finance get internships with firms in the chicago area but at this point deadlines have long passed the cs math departments do not seem to offer anywhere as much help as the business department does in the realm of internships the cs department boasts alumni that have gone on to work for faang and other big and small tech companies i talked to my department chair who tried to reach out to some alumni but he did not seem to find anything so i figured i was on my own switchorganic basically i do not have a cs degree and i still ended up in software engineering a lot of my peers do not either that is something you need to answer for yourself personally i do not see a reason to put off exploration till after graduation i would start now it is what i did and how i pivoted from data science to software engineering in my senior year",
  "acewhenifacethedbase have you heard of the iqr rule there are plenty of cases where it is a bad idea to apply but it is one of the most common standards for defining outliers in continuous data distributions maximum mission for the unsupervised methods have a look at one class svm and isolation forests for a supervised if indeed you have a labeled outliers just try any binary classification method or even maybe autoencoders if feeling more adventurous for another unsupervised method take the item in each of the columns subtract it from the column mean and put it over the column standard deviation this is a z score you can compare z scores to see how many standard deviations from the mean each point is for a given data point if you got a house that is like standard deviations from the mean it is probably an outlier try histogram based outlier scoring though it does not tell you which are the key drivers none deleted none deleted thealexyou could fit a regression on the house price with the variables you want it to include and the use the cooks distance be careful though outliers can be meaningful so think about whether this is simply an outlier or if it has some reasons maybe due to variables not included in the model hourconnectionlook up mahalonobis distance good for multivariate data that takes into account correlations in the data noimgonnalie another method you can try is doing a pca and visualizing on a scatterplot to find out possible outliers this however should not be your only reasoning for detecting outliers ie you should supplement it with other methods as mentioned here too utterizi i did sadly i say sadly because this question came up from a situation at my work place that i am interning at and even though i have heard learned all of these in my master is program i am completely paralyzed and do not know what to do about anything my first idea was the iqr and boxplots but now i am focusing more on the multivariate z score applications thanks for the advice utterizi i just did a oneclasssvm but it seemed pretty shallow maybe i should look into sophisticating it utterizi i just got to this conclusion wish i saw your comment hours ago i am doing a bit of reading and video watching about multivariate z score applications thanks for the advice utterizi i kinda got lost in the sauce and now everything seems meaningless lol i got the z scores for each feature colum and the most logical next step was to say something like if this row has x amount of outlier features i can say this id belongs to an outlier but how do i know how do we even know anything what is knowing i am so lost utterizi thank you so much i will get to it after i am done giving a shot at z score evaluation utterizi thank you so much utterizi thanks my intention is not to remove them anyways i want to see them and compare them to similar data points utterizi i heard a lot about that from chatgpt but still have not learned how to implement it will check it out thanks utterizi will check it out thanks osrsaddicted do not go into the slippery slope of doing something for the sake of deploying cool models what matters is the model metrics another option might be mahalanobis especially if you are trying to find the outliers using multiple variables you are saying that you want to check how many outliers across columns that a specific row has what exactly are you trying to accomplish wearmorehats i strongly recommend plotting sense checking what pyod is flagging as outliers i played around with it a bit a while back and while it did fine for some examples there were cases when i manually added outliers and it did not identify them instead it was flagging random other data points as outliers from memory i think it performed particularly badly with time series data hourconnectionsklearn has api for distance metrics which includes mahalonobis distance utterizi i am afraid i did that with the z score analysis thanks for the heads up tho utterizi i just did that last night there is this chi squared number in there with a degree of freedom and a critical value in this link i guess those are variables that i can manipulate which opens a whole new condition to contemplate utterizi so i have an id this id has several features like price condition out of waterfront or year built sqft of lot latitute longitude etc initially i wanted to check this which price points seem like an outlier based on all these other features then i thought well price itself is a feature and can work in determining if this id is an outlier i feel like i did the right calculations with the z scores and the mahalonabis distances but i seem to be struggling with the implementation the task that we brainstormed at our meeting was lets do outlier detection on this data so what exactly i am trying to do is kinda up to me can you give me an example of what you think would be an outlier in this data i am having a hard time understanding why latitude and longitude would be a z score kind of thing what problem are you trying to solve you want to predict the price based on a set of features utterizi i am not doing a prediction actually it is more of an analysis it could also work to train an algorithm and compare predictions to values though what i expect is something like this house is bedrooms bathrooms has lot floors not waterfront built in to make up some of the features and house is bedrooms bathroom has lot floors not waterfront built in and house is bedroom bathroom lot floors not waterfront built in i want to compare these data points to other similar data points and see if they should raise eyebrows for example based on price if house comes out as an outlier i want to then manually look at what the computer thinks are similar data points so i can say hm this house is more expensive than similar houses with bedrooms bathroom lot floors built in etc let me check if this could be due to its latitude and longitude where is it located maybe near popular town squares access to public transportation is it renovated does it have a good view and obviously there is no criteria to base it on price but it seemed the most logical",

  "i have done and i know people who have done algorithmic trading general data management would not normally sit within data science at least not in my experience i would imagine fraud detection somewhat uses ml but i am not sure the biggest thing is to remember companies prefer tiny steps you do not move from logistic regression to huge ensemble models in one go i have done and in the finance industry and truly interesting work in other industries including manufacturing and marketing my observation is that employers fall along a continuum at one end are managers who have at least some idea of what they want from analysis often a very clear vision likely having experience using analysis in business before care more about solving problems than arbitrary selections of software tend to have some analytical skill themselves at the other end are managers who are adding data science because it is trendy do not have a clear goal in mind expect analysts to satisfy some checklist of fashionable software tools analysts on the other hand tend to fall along another continuum at one end are people who are knowledgeable about this field at the algorithm level they could code these tools from scratch are focused on solving problems the other group is composed of people who focus on popular software and stacks tend to write scripts calling other people is analytical code i suggest that the first group of analysts tend to get the interesting work with the more focused employers while the second much larger group of analysts tends to find work at the other end of the employment spectrum i believe that much of the disillusionment expressed in places like reddit is from the second group of analysts who are working where you would expect finance is a huge field with tons of jobs also financial services marketing is a whole other field some do awesome stuff and some do excel ask a lot of questions when you interview neitherwither get good at visualizations for vps what have you been smoking math is hard wouldataciensultra yes therealtiddlydump if you do not ask about the toolkit in your interview you deserve to be doing excel work i have not used excel meaningfully in at least years i literally do not have skills anymore laughingwalls not really i have done and am probably equivalent of or whatever the top senior level contributor positions i have worked at multiple top banks and probably can get an interview anywhere model building in any bank is highly regulated so there is a lot of bureaucracy you do not really have the freedom to reinvent the wheel and a lot of the work is updating existing models maintaing documents maybe at a fintech things are different a lot of modeling approaches have industry wide practices and does not leave room for creativity a lot of the more complicated things in banking like fraud detection uses vendor models and there is not a lot of in house model building its just making kpis or monitoring tools finance is very much an industry you cannot get into without the right academic credentials most jobs doing quantitative model building requires at a minimum of a masters degree and phds are common algorithmic trading jobs are extremely competitive and most of the people in space probably have ivy league credentials or close to it i do not think there is any function you can work without a bachelors degree and bachelors degrees probably can only work at you do have a clear impact in the right space though depending on where you are it may be difficult to see it like models can have a firm wide impact but at the end of the day banking is a loan deal origination businesses business side is full of non technical people and that means model building can be far removed from it its different from being a tech firm quants and ds are not the top jobs in a bank not for junior people and not for senior people for all the talk of disruptive fin techs they are not really as big a part of industry as articles like these claim they are small scale banking is an industry that requires scale to do the big work fintechs do not have that and anyone that could gain that scale or be a client of someone with scale probably has the same sort of red tape lnfrarad cool thanks for the info i read that some analyst roles in finance seem use similar tools or skill sets that are also generic data science knowledge like math stats and regression coding so it made me think if those analysts can also considered data scientists just with financial domain knowledge ps sorry could you clarify what did you mean by general data management lnfrarad hi thanks for sharing it is interesting to hear about the different kinds of companies and types of skill expectation for data scientists i see these different tiers existing for the software engineering field as well did not realize that something similar was in data science lnfrarad hi thanks so much for sharing the insider view yes i did hear that it jobs in banks have to follow stricter regulations it is a bummer though about having the data but not being allowed access to it although i am sure the reasons for that are sound regarding your comment on academic credentials did you mean more about credentials in finance or did you mean a quantitative degree eg mathematics statistics i think what you shared about data science and quants not being the top job is an important point too as normally remuneration benefits is the highest for the top job however now i am really curious to see the comparison of the salary from the bank vs what we would get from faang for example i wonder how much difference would that be data strategy analysts and data scientists do have considerable overlap and the title varies by company i would say if you are doing everything a data scientist would do then you are one by data management i mean building and maintaining data warehouses dealing with the technical issues in combining the data from many systems and sources removing test and duplicate data and all of that work laughingwalls masters or phd in mathematics economics statistics physics cs or quant finance is a hard requirement for most quant analyst roles data science is less common and less likely to get through most programs are just not rigorousness enough finance if you want to find the money you do not work as a data scientist there is no path into upper management as a data scientist finance if your trying to go to these places you basically need to be on the deal making front office and working on team that are doing corporate lending or securities activities which is basically the domain of investment bank or structured finance groups in most banks furthermore the closer you are to front office the more money you make like a vp ds makes significannotly less than a vp than someone who works in an front office role that is not a space that care about how good you are at programming even if your ambition is not to go that far in life the thing is the lack of a path to upper management as a ds person basically dictates that your career stalls for you and your peers a general rule in career is that you need to understand how your firm makes money facebook makes money through advertisements that are directly connected to user engagement so algorithm development are critical part of their revenue generating process its makes ds people incredibly important to revenue generation finance is not that world finance analytics and metrics are done to support deal making activities and are seen as fixed costs that also means that most banks will not put the effort to building those things in house any real innovation is something they will buy compensation for most banks not to be conflated with algorithmic trading jobs in an hedge funds for a senior individual contributor in the range of salaries a bonus typical bonus ranges are some where of to percent depending on bank where the role sits rsus are not that common in banks and most banks only give rsu if your cash bonus is above a certain thresholds again i reiterate the biggest and easiest areas for people building quantitative models to work is in risk the work is beauracratic its not a matter of regulations being stricter its that regulations and regulatory process actually defines the work depending on the bank it may just be seen as a compliance cost generally true at smaller banks",

  "implement worried please use the weekly transitioning thread for these questions you will also need to include important background like past work experience and current education level calminky first of all you do not need a data science or computer science degree to start in ds if you want to go the self taught route i would not recommend data camp but instead dataquest it is a bit more tedious you are building progressively more difficult code instead of being served up a model solution independently you wanna get good at python pandas numpy scikit learn matplotlib dask etc and sql there are plenty of public data sources out there to play around and build a portfolio also check out kaggle but use this more as inspiration and fun the data there is ridiculously clean and so a key component from a ds daily bread data cleaning and shaping is completely missing another route would be going with a bootcamp that teaches you the basics but with real world data and ideally also career support i cannot stress real world data well enough because this is where most of your learning is going to come from access to former alumni that are data scientists business people that are hiring etc independently what route you choose there is another key component networking especially these days with layoffs and a hyper competitive job market the importance of personal relationships cannot be understated i have got my last positions only via networking how to figure out in what industry you want to be a data scientist next look at the biggest players in that industry and what they are looking for in data scientists when i started out in ds i wanted to go into healthcare through networking i found out that natural language processing is a key tool for ds in that space so one of my portfolio projects of course demonstrated my knowledge of nlp easiest way to access people that are ds in your desired industry linkedin and industry ds specific meetups if you have more questions feel free to dm can you start a data career without an additional degree or become a data scientist specifically those are two different questions can you start a data career in a position such as a data analyst or even data engineer without an additional degree short answer yes i was a data analyst for years before i became a data scientist and can tell you first hand that you can absolutely get a job with just a regular college degree that does not have a data or business focus as a data analyst you really only need to know a few things very well you need to be an expert at sql and be proficient in a visualization tool such as power bi or tableau you can also choose to be an expert in power bi or tableau and be proficient in sql both of those routes plus some basic excel can lead you to a data analyst position as you move up into manager and director of these can be very very lucrative positions you can also earn just as much money as a data engineer as you could as a data scientist if money is your primary motivator nothing wrong with that now can you become a data scientist without a degree short answer no long answer i am certainly not saying it is impossible to become a data scientist without a degree that is at least tangentially related to data what i am saying is that it is extraordinarily difficult perhaps even an order of magnitude more difficult what i mean by that is you may have to apply to times as many positions as someone with a data science related master is degree to get a job possibly more it was easier to make this transition without a degree to years ago now a master is degree seems to be becoming the de facto standard for data scientist at least at the places that i have worked and applied to i will go so far as to say that it would probably actually be easier and possibly cheaper in the long run to get the masters degree in analytics or data science and then become a data scientist then it would be to try to learn it all on your own without any credential and then become a data scientist if you have your heart set on becoming a data scientist as opposed to a data analyst or data engineer but do not have a degree you may want to reconsider that there are tons of masters programs under several well under that will qualify you for a roll as a data scientist if you consider the potential pay bump that you will experience transferring from your current position to a data scientist position it may be worth it to temporarily get some more loans to make the transition in my case it was i was a data analyst for years and wanted to transition to data scientist so i pursued a master is degree in data science the degree only cost and my company was willing to pay for half of that via tuition reimbursement additionally i got another tax rebate for getting a degree so in the end the degree only cost me the pay raise i got from transitioning from data analyst to data scientist made up for that cost in just over a month after taxes thank you i really appreciate it thanks for the detailed answer would you be willing to provide a list of programs that you find to be credible and affordable i will be honest i feel like there are a ton of online diploma mills out there that are really hard to sort from the actual reputable universities sure i will start with a completely no name university that i went to which only started their program back in it is called eastern university it is a small christian university although they did not push christianity in pennsylvania the most important thing for me was that it was regionally accredited and not a for profit school i had absolutely no problem with my job hunt with that degree it only cost which was great if you were looking for degrees for schools that are much more prestigious but still provide a good value let me offer two suggestions the first is the university of texas austin which has a master is degree in computer science for and a master is degree in data science for i believe ut austin is an outstanding school that is well regarded the second is georgia tech which has a master is degree in analytics for and a master is degree in computer science with a concentration in machine learning for less since it is georgia tech needless to say it is a highly regarded school in this industry i am actually considering completing the masters and computer science at georgia tech just for my own personal enrichment because it is so inexpensive and of such high quality arizona state university is masters of computer science with a concentration in big data what else will be a good option personally i would not pay any more than for degree in this industry because there is just too many options for that price or less there are extraordinarily mediocre schools trying to sell master is degrees in this field for to even then you probably still make enough money in the field for the degree to be worth it but why waste the extra thank you lnfrarad hi just want to add here that a masters will take probably years depending on how many mods you take a year so i would suggest to also have a corresponding job that is not too demanding for that duration so you have free time to balance school and work and still retain sanity i have actually got multiple graduate degrees already in the area of education though i tend to really enjoy learning being in school myself i like teaching but there are so many other things that have come up and gotten worse in the last few years along with my feeling meh and unchallenged that are telling me it is time to change i sent information requests to those schools you mentions and i will check into them",

  "moosecooch it depends on what you were doing while as a data analyst what industry youre applying to and of course how well your resume reads to adequately market your skills at face value what youve mentioned could make you a strong candidate but its contingent on factors like those i just listed sycokinetic you would be a strong candidate and would very likely make it to an interview socialdatascience go apply and find out does not hurt to give it a shot solid experience worth at least a casual search any fig agree with everyone give it a shot try to focus in industries you have strengths and experience in data scientist is a large catch all for a wide variety of jobs for some jobs you will be a good catch for others you just wo not be a fit and that is okay so apply to a wide range of jobs at first and then start to hone in once you get better at reading job descriptions and have feedback of where you are getting interviews wouldatastoryteller can that stuff listed on your resume land an interview sure depends on how well written your resume is what kind of technology do you know sql python etc what kind of problems did you solve in those jobs does your resume clearly communicate that you can apply your skills to solve relevant problems with messy data we cannot tell all of that by what you listed also getting an interview is step one how well you do during interviews again we cannot tell how good are you at live coding challenges how good are you at answering business case study questions how good are you at explaining your past work and is it relevant to the jobs you are applying for you can have a great resume and get a ton of interviews but if you fall flat during interviews you will not get offers also getting an interview depends on the type of jobs you apply for how competitive they are and luck i have noticed most ml focused roles want candidates with at least years of experience building models on the job but if you are going after analytics or experimentation ds roles you might have a better shot having a big professional network and getting referrals can help too due d if you can clear the coding rounds you are pretty much a at the very least bestucanisgoodenough good but years as a computational biologist in undergrad would make me immediately reject if phrased that way we are you a computational biologist or getting an education it is not a job if you paid them without context it is like prima facie this person is lying delusional moscowgordon true before all the layoffs not sure how true it is in the current market though wouldataclinician i have published papers in ml in medicine i am a post doc researcher at uc berkeley and couldnt get an interview sycokinetic well the asterisk at the end is that you cannot get an interview with a company that is not hiring the best you can do with that is figure out a holding pattern maintain a portfolio and apply as entry level ds postings go up pongoid yeah people are down voting you but i do data science titled as an analyst have two masters one in ds years of analyst experience and i still cannot get interviews for proper ds roles lunareclipsexx no on the job experience that is pretty important as an analyst or data scientist miketythhon you and the guy above you are obviously doing something wrong with your applications wouldigbydenthand quite possible that you are in a region that is over saturated with ds talent ie san francisco silicon valley new york etc brownclowntown have you tried putting data scientist as your current title on your resume applications wouldataclinician lol i work as data science for one the most prestigious university in the world pongoid maybe i dunno what else one can do enter in all your schools and work history list your job duties and link to your github if i am missing something i would love to know are the positions that you are applying for or the industries that you are applying in in any way related to the kind of research you have been doing at the university also when did you start your job search laughingwalls there are professional development positions for people like you in major companies have you tried applying to them make sure your private sector cv is different from your academic vita too often a lot of phds fail a branding exercise on an industry resume you should be emphasizing whats skill you can have like i would structure it education then a bullet point highlights of qualifications maybe have headings like ml research statistical techniques you are indepth with i would put your research work last phd resume can go to pages there is a certain amount of passing the filter for this stuff also sf job market is probably bad right now its unfortunate truth that most major companies probably have a hiring freeze for junior people lunareclipsexx your reply shows how little you know about actually working as a data scientist vs doing research in data science i was in the job hunt from march to june of last year so keep that context in mind what i found was most important in addition to having the experience in the academic credentials is to structure your resume in a way that you only have the information most important to that employer on your first page less really is more for example in work experience i put three bullet points on my three biggest projects with the dollar value or fte hours saved that i brought to it showing concrete numbers on the value you bring to teams is critical they are probably not even going to look at your github until maybe after you have had your hiring manager interview set up your resume like a newspaper the first half of the first page should be the thing that hooks your perspective employer the most also remember to leave space so that it is easy to read many people make the mistake of trying to fit everything on a single page and it becomes hard to read anything if we were to break things down into three categories formal education work experience and technical skills which of those three will wow your perspective employer the most for example if you have little experience but went to an elite university then putting that first might be beneficial on the other hand if you went to a no name university but have done some really cool projects in your job you may want to list your experience first among those three sections what is the one thing within that wow section that is most impressive make sure that is easy to see with key points highlighted you want their eye drawn to it miketythhon a nice website portfolio summarizing projects and linking to github was the trick for me wouldataclinician yes for sure i did not applied to that many i only had an interview at openai for the residency program but that drop it off i have a really weird combination of skill so i do not know how to even brand myself wouldataclinician lol pongoid thanks for the tips this was very well written and thoughtful response thanks laughingwalls then figure which skills are relevant and which ones are not you do not have to include everything on your resume maximize your post doc time the job market for tech is bad in general you are top talent so its not hard to spin a story once the economy adjusts an hiring begins to recover i can say in my world banking finance our programs are still up and running you have missed the deadlines but there will be new ones next fall i would use the term quant rather than ds to find those programs my experience is quant analytics programs at banks contain ai ml roles

  "eightstream non technical managers are fine as long as they understand the dynamics of technical management managing technical people requires accepting that you will never fully understand what your subordinates are doing even if you are a highly technical person yourself you simply do not have the time on a regular basis to get into the detail of how the sausage is being made it requires a very high level of trust which is often very new and scary to non technical middle managers acceptable milk why does she think it is a bad idea did you ask presenting this comparison with the dummy model seems like a good start for your presentation to management djstillalive a non technical manager who does not take into consideration what her technical staff has to say about technical issues is not a manager she is a boss if you cannot turn her into a manager find one to work for isitfun wwwindeedcom is how you deal with this okdistancei would focus on the business case not the poor technical details what would x improved accuracy mean to the business or how would a modernized pipeline help the business by rolling out improvements or new models quickly logisticspock i do not know about minitab but libraries in python provide a broader range of tools to follow the crisp dm process be sure to include model validation methods especially marginal mode plots as well as feature engineering multiplying interactions for two interdependent variables you can further increase accuracy just by eliminating predictors that have high multicollinearity or vifs variance inflation factors with each other another thing that is easy to do in python do not go into the technical details with your manager just explain that one approach gives the best results show them a proof of concept if you have to r sas jmp python mlnet etc anything provides better tools than minitab jbmoskow the sql stuff is yikes but is this decision tree for regression or classification because if we are talking classification and the dummy model has accuracy i would immediately be wary that you are dealing with unbalanced classes where of your dataset consists of one class this means your model could be predicting all datapoints belong to one class and your model would be accurate if that is the case should not you be examining model fit using score macro avg monkeyunited it is a great baseline and to further improve it here is what we can do and years later some new hire data scientist who the f decided this ianitic my boss has done stuff like this specifically with my python stuff just concerned on finding someone able to take over if i leave get hit by a bus as most vendors he knows about utilize no low code solutions he is chilled out a little on that though specifically i remember him contracting out a company that was using ai builder to extract values from documents i did a sanity check of just taking the most frequent value like you did and the dummy model was substantially more performant for a while we would butt heads on stuff like this though also this was while i was the only tech data person in the company later on when we hired people with more experience on paper from the largest tech employer in the city they hard backed me and my boss has been more receptive since some third party contractors has also looked at my stuff and was impressed tldr it seemed like a trust thing and your boss probably does not trust you that being said it might not even anything you have done and the only thing you can do is job hop hawkshade yes in my experience if i have completed my tasks i would spend that extra time creating a quick baseline model it should not take much time to do this given you have the data prepped demonstrate that even with a baseline model and barely any preprocessing that the baseline model better than the model being used maybe do some light preprocessing to get more accuracy threeminutemonta compromise find a few technologies that glue powerbi to python neatly powerbi jupyter notebooks jupyter notebooks python package is optional though if you and your team do not have much python experience it helps have a framework around unit testing on github actions and output a python module that you can share in an internal python package index this can make it easier to deploy to production kwenkun i have had managers who are non technical and honestly some of them are great if they are self aware they support you by shielding you from all the politicking and bs work they do not really need to be technical to be a great manager but it takes quite a while to build up trust to this level i have also had the type that is self aware but becomes extremely insecure about it and talk me down at every opportunity if you suspect this is the type it might be good to look outward i never manage to steer away from this situation for years in that particular job tactically i think the best thing to do is to present it in more revenue or less cost you can even be pretty crude about it since it seems like you already benchmarked your challenger model then the burden of proof is on her to explain to you why she does not want more for the company sirsteelo hold on you write the model in sql for production that is something man thegainsfairy non technical managers making technical decisions is always a bad move prepare your resume almostfreitag been there very unfortunate to have a manager like this i will just say do it just because it is fun just because you can just because it will put in good use your skills instead of doing shit jobs when you look for other job say you did it and you left bcoz they were unable to change and evolve gagankurole of a non technical manager is to provide you what you need and get the bureaucracy out of the way so you guys can do your job if this person is telling you how to do your job you need to make a strong case for how work can be improved based on your experience and what is going on in the current market if there is no reasoning and there is a set way to do things maybe it is not the best place to work mac edmarco when you say presenting your findings to management do you mean you would be presenting to the same manager that said it was a terrible idea if she is not a part of that decision i think your best bet is to probably reveal the issues with the implementation and if time permits show how a modern ml pipeline would benefit both the model itself and also the implementation itself noone is going to want to maintain a sql decision tree lol ultimately i do not think anyone can argue with results delicious view many semi technical managers read powerbi tableau stem adjacent background turn out like that in part because they genuinely think they know but they do not these types of managers are hard to deal with non technical managers are not the same i think they typically know that they do not know but they will either trust your advice or wo not partially they will base it on your ability to communicate but they will also base it on whether they find you trustworthy based on their personal bias at least these types of managers can be influenced by you of course i am generalising and it is not fair these things are totally individual and managers of all backgrounds can be just as bad as any other edit the so what of it all is get out there is nothing for you to learn there mbel_ one idea is fitting a regression model you can easily convert the format to sql at least that would be better than just one tree clicketrie is it an ensemble algorithm is this person familiar with leveraging decision trees for analysis and not prediction that might be one reason why someone might balk at a different method if you are supposed to review it and it sounds like they skipped eda etc do you have a sense for if you will have a lift in performance with just doing the underlying eda and feature engineering personally i like having a boss that i can learn more from and mentor me the manager has to be bringing some real solid business savvy they can teach me about if they do not have technical chops in at least some areas that i could benefit from dubgrips one of my first managers was a very senior non technical individual that was very high up in a major university and had managed their data team for years they once asked me to do a google drive it was mind blowingly frustrating to constantly have to adjust plot colors and line thicknesses and have them take a look at things i worked on for a month and need walkthroughs of things like a heat map i will say that it actually helped me a lot much later in my career when i had to be able to distill my work to more technically knowledgeable stakeholders that are so busy that their attention span is that of an energetic puppy appalachianhilltoad i would not even dignify this rubbish with a response nod and smile while looking for a new job n dronedesigner i am not gonna lie this situation reeks of one sided story telling bias in other threads you mentioned you are an analyst and your teammates do not know python you are outperforming your duties responsibilities stack which is great but also the business and or higherups or your team members may have their own reservations with their your solutions which they cannot easily tell you about such as the fact that they may not have the bandwidth ability to continue to support the solutions you put in place once you are gone and it seems they know it and you know it that your are going to be gone leave for a better position that fits your aspirations you can ask for a title change and job scope change at the current company or find a new gig weekly ad make up some tech terms and sprinkle them into your reports i am having to redo this analysis because the fleebsticle z is over elus how does using python and a more modern ml method improve process outcomes tell her logit model will be simpler to implement in sql and easier to interpret what is the roi on changing jbartix run graphs graphs graphs thisfishsmellsaboutd this is only an opinion and based on my own experience but the pathway from a niggling bullying non technical manager to a great leadership team and a satisfying set of problems to chew on starts with a job change she and i quote said that is a terrible idea response how so she something something response so what do you propose as an alternative raharth oh boy i am sorry i always had managers that were aware of their limited knowledge about the topic so they trusted us in nearly all cases one way to deal with her is to show her that build a better solution and proof her wrong but be humble about it so that you give her the opportunity to realize her mistake and walk it back without losing her face gravitykillsu this is perfectly normal most managers are like this with their data scientists uchimata present your findings to management this model sounds awful if you can make a good case for that they should buy in and if they do not that is a sign you need to find a new gig cazzah to management original model has no documentation providing justification business case maintenance and upkeep or verification and validation i have asked around and noone is aware of any a quick test model i put together in python in absurdly short amount of time to test alternatives shows an improvement in accuracy with reduced code this will lead to following benefits to translate this into company is preferred ml system here will require x days of work request permission on this model implement document and provide a maintenance and modelling plan to your boss i can deploy this into org is preferred ml system here however this list downsides here alternatively i can instead build on the existing python test model i have built python is a best practice tool for data scientists in a variety of tech organisations including google amazon microsoft and insert competitor here regardless i am happy to work on whichever tool you prefer just want email confirmation so i can get the go ahead edit was not sure which machine learning tool you were using may have misunderstood agree on the problem you are trying to solve how it is defined described and scoped agree by what measure it will be determined that any proposed solution is appropriate and successful agree on what is important to your manager your branch and your organisation as a whole agree on what defines success for you in your role in and month terms until you have done that you do not have enough common frames of reference to communicate effectively yellowchess just do it on your own and then present evidence if it pans out non technical managers are largely useless and overpaid in my experience you basically need to treat them like a child do not expect them to change so i guess worse than a child here keep things simple accept their shortcomings mironovich any manager who answers like that on any idea is a shit on other hand perhaps she used terrible with positive connotation english is not my native language please take it in consideration bobdope i started feeling bad for you at minitab i am not sure this situation is salvageable but certainly wish you luck i have been in situations with non technical leadership and still have some scars from them weonlycryalone in brief you have two distinct challenges approaching this manager with a results oriented notion i would like two weeks to work on a different approach that may increase accuracy to improving our relevant kpi by basis points and saving us over the next year improving implementation for us to move more quickly to deployment i would like a budget of for a cloud based vm to run python code and an additional firewall license to protect that asset tldr i want to speak about this on a few levels and i am coming at this with more than years in analytics including three as a manager or director first your own expectations no matter the manager you will get pushback at the some point always take a deep breath always try to see where they are coming from always decide what battle to fight and what to leave be always ask for specific feedback and know whether to ask with the socratic method or more humbly second think of technical comfort as a continuous measure rather than an unary technical or not feature when people with authority to make decisions are presented with something beyond their technical comfort they may respond with a range including awkward pretending abashed avoidance surrendering deference irrational exuberance or abject objections start with the common denominator of impact i can speak to the specifics that matter but this approach will cost in total licensing and development and return over the next two fiscal for an roi of and go from there third we wear the uniform of our playing field every single data scientist i have ever hired has come aboard expecting jupyter notebooks when we release codeinto a linux environment or devops managed windowsenvironment the junior ones expected clean code the failed ones did not or could not write sql the successful ones leaned on the release engineers and devops engineers to get up to speed that said release by revising python into sql is a dated idea that was relevant when decision tree calculations were done by hand or using matrix algebra on matlab the technology will not scale and when you feel brave enough bring this up to leadership i strongly suspect the that wo not work response was driven by this manager thinking the only way to release a model is if it can be coded in sql that is a roadblock you need to find a way around it bigquery has sql enabled ml it is clunky relative to python and sklearn but could be an easy step since the environment does not change otherwise look for a sympathetic architect to design a schema to capture predictions reditreditredit first understand what decisions the model is informing or making then understand the value then estimate the value of improving your model accuracy the estimate level of effort to improve the model accuracy then explore different tools r python jmp minitab automl etc do not be the rookie who just suggests python without knowing what problem you are solving and without knowing what it would be worth to the business nyquant there is an operational risk in allowing for models written in python unless the code is properly tested maintained and supported sometimes managers rather pay up for a commercial solution that relying on some home brew stuff that was stitched together by some data research person who might not even be around the following year i do not know minitab but it is likely that it could build more types of models besides a decision tree i would start with exploring that it seems there is an option to export a model as a sql script in minitab i suppose that is where the lines originate if that is true then that is better than writing all the code by hand i would look into if those models can be exported as python libraries as a next step in expanding your capabilities overall seems reasonable to want to stay within the same ecosystem of building models and move them into production even if it is minitab even so half technical managers can be trouble good luck kuraitori this even if you know exactly how to do their job still as a manager you do not have the bandwidth for the details you will need that trust whether you are a technical manager or not pratos at least op was not asked to use ms access as a db for a mission critical greenfield project lol subjectadone of my best manager was a non technical manager to be brutally honest i find that a lot of very technically skilled stem folks actually do not make good managers they are often not humble enough to empathize with those reporting to them benchalldat because she does not think python is a modern tool and that schools teach it because it is free second this if they are pushing you constantly and not trying to understand the technical issues thats willfully blind and stuck in the past commonsensorial damn this is the reasonable answer well said goat lamp on the proof of concept some folks just need to see what done correctly looks like ashamed simple and now explain that to their manager renokarchnmy i have hit that wall too but who will maintain this if you are gone cannot we use net regarding some javascript but also python stuff net i have not touched that in over a decade who lol any highschool kid can write javascript or python these days schools absolutely do not teach net stack because microsoft licensing and ya know it is not the correct tool for this stuff benchalldat i kid you not the sql is lines of code long sirsteelo but why would anyone want to do this okdistancei have seen this about a decade ago although even then we autogenerated the sql which does not sound like it is happening here activelyeating we had this with a model a consultant had built for my company they hardcoded the weights and variables into a sql script and we were asked to evaluate performance but there was no evidence of an actual model just the sql code with weights ashamed simple it is a good thing to not ask because once it exists and works hard for them to ignore it benchalldat it is kind of a hub and spoke model i would be presenting to business management however all processes go through the data manager the one opposed to python benchalldat semi technical is probably a better description benchalldat it is not an ensemble this model is being used for predictions sirsteelo i do not know i feel that if there is a better solution that is pitched to you a solution that is improving upon whatever you do now why not invest in that direction sure they might have to hire new staff who are more technically adept but they will benefit from the improvements maybe yep that improvement that op is suggesting is not great enough to warrant this sure still a new approach should not be called terrible if it is better at the current stage this will be more evident as they grow at least consider it for the future a manager on the ds side should at least understand the vastness of the field and consider the opinions of the devs benchalldat sure it is hard to believe how ridiculous this is myself jambonetoeufs agreed one thing i would add for a technical manager is knowing when to dive in if things get hairy and coaching people on how to figure things out themselves why use ms access when you could use excel instead lol kissitgoodbyeee um sql is also free dfphd so there is a difference between working for a non technical manager and working for a moron you are working for a moron there is not a lot to do with that acceptable milk she really said this isitfun leave now wallymetropolis the problem here is not a non technical manager the problem here is a bad manager theendgame damn i remember my former manager saying something along the same lines had to quit patricksvm that is insane haha fhir_ that is ridiculous you could play it two ways do nothing stick to script and do it the hard way or you could insist or go above her head the latter option risks causing bad blood but it makes the actual work easier personally i would talk to her boss if i had a working relationship with them if i could not absolutely convince her maybe just do it as a poc and then show the results and how much easier it is maybe that would convince her nobody has time for that kind of feet dragging though therealstepbot excuse me what that is absolutely batshit that is not really enough to discount an entire language ianitic i think it is a trust thing a lot of the time as you can honestly say that about most work the exception would be if there is already a codebase at the company or the rest of your team knows a different stack sirsteelo that should raise some_ concerns within the company my heart aches for you zykezero this length is unimpressive be concerned with everything else though brucietheperturbed kill it with fire jfc bobdope see even this would be terrible if you were using say tidypredict in r to generate the sql but we know that is not happening breadlygames you gotta pump those numbers up those are rookie numbers in this racket quick wins while there is not enough infrastructure to support full mlops activelyeating a consultant left behind work before my team existed this way the consultant can leave and the non technical business users can rerun the sql script under the impression they are refreshing model scores mac edmarco from the other comments it sounds insane that this person is leading the data side of things like just incredibly unaware of the industry standard is she just incompetent or is she one of those managers which do not like being wrong if it is the latter the petty side of me feels like malicious compliance is the way to go when everything goes to shit she is going to be the one to blame im sure you could easily frame improvements with python as a business case though using python and improving the model increased roc by x changing the prediction pipeline from sql to python would improve the dev experience and save x amount of time this is the industry standard now citing developer surveys etc it is so weird to me that there is someone really holding on to minitab lmao clicketrie it sounds like whoever did this might have been more familiar with dts for analysis rather than prediction prediction i expect an ensemble method and typically people have a problem with the loss of interpretability you get from an ensemble algo when they are optimizing for an analysis use case rather than prediction drxaos sure they might have to hire new staff who are more technically adept but they will benefit from the improvements the manager might not be given this budget or leeway benchalldat she is trying to move us away from sql and use only power bi data flows trust me it is bad hahaha benchalldat yes this is the mentality i have been trying to work with it is been incredibly frustrating dandywiner second this it is not going to get better it will get worse you will lose skills unless you are keeping them up outside of work you will get bored with the amount of tedious work you know can be completed faster and more efficiently in other tools take the pay check while you find yourself a good job always easier to get a new position when you are in employment and now you can browse jobs like a netflix catalog dont get the job does not matter you are still getting paid best of luck and update when you have a new role with a a manger who does not have tech agoraphobia benchalldat it is honestly a little bit of both i agree mc is the way i was planning to go until i find a new job the bad part is this could have been a dream job for me i am on a small enough team to where i can make a lot of impact and implement a lot of really cool things but there is quite literally one person standing in my way sirsteelo fair fair kissitgoodbyeee are you dilbert let her but make sure she tells everyone she is the one doing it and she is the one leading it when it is in full swing just put out there you warned against it let it blow up let her take the heat atmosck this is the point in the story where i would start updating my resume littlebigmidget ah yes the ol proprietary good logic path wait until she finds out that the reason no one uses visual basic or powerquery m is because they suck and the reason python is so ubiquitous is because it is versatile and easy dax is not too bad but definitely way too simple for your needs maybe suggest to her alteryx so you can spend thousands of dollars and a ton of time learning a low code platform that is more complicated than just learning how to program sorry for the rant the corporate world is understanding of technology is fucked notinvented here man deja vu i just read this thread ashamed simple leave or make a sport of making fun of her in a way everyone gets it but her bobdope omg it gets worse acceptable milk wow that is incredible it sounds like you are dealing with a terrible organization change is going to be extremely difficult and will likely take a lot of political influence the best you can do is present the facts perhaps also start looking for a better job fonduemeup when you present your recommendation you need to back it up with lots of evidence for example python models are used in ds teams at fb google etc with links to articles that support this jasonsuave i can empathize here years ago i took a sr data science role for a year old hospitality org they were ripe for roi driven models and i had a boss who was basically trying to get out team to do nothing but shit data into excel for descriptive analysis when i brought up sagemaker as a a solution to us moving on actual predicative intelligence we were aws she just fucking laughed in my face what i did was get my resume up to date and keep escalating up a level to my vp after years he finally fired her and gave me her job we immediately got several models moving and connected with the biz then covid hit a few months later and they laid off the entire data science team overnight lol madmethodman time to update your resume managers like this refuse to learn and refuse to understand either collect the paycheck and become complacent and it better be a fat paycheck or move on not ds but i am in da and i always opt to move on its never worth it stupid oblivious managers are one of the most stressful things to deal with i always try to find managers that are more experienced and hopefully smarter than me when it comes to data your manager is priority is not data it is looking good for upper management benchalldat holy shit logisticspock jizzybiscuits funny because this should tell op that fighting against it is futile you do not have to like it to accept that it is a feature of the job in some organizations fantasysymphony it is a good idea to keep records of who said or recommended what but the process of reassigning blame credit is rarely a clean honest one and it does you very little good to spend time involved in a project that will inevitably blow up at some point in the future benchalldat man i really cannot believe some of the shit that goes on look this is the internet jen ashamed simple do not talk about python but use boosted trees and random forest or glm jesus dude that hits hard right now over and over i have had to fight tooth and nail for the little wins only to be blindsided again by political corporate bs i hope things are going well now kissitgoodbyeee i am sorry zitterbewegung recommend using anaconda is which has a paid deal dysfu yeah if you have to document your own manager to cya might as well just find a new job because that ai not it ashamed simple this assumes they actually need a model and are not satisfied with nice shiny dashboards with colorful plots in them the one upper management like so much as long as the trend is upwards look this is our error rate it is going up yellowchess does not matter do not waste your time if you are in the situation where you feel you need to keep records like this then just start looking for a new job jasonsuave thank you my friend i have actually moved back into consulting and will never look back to an industry that can literally collapse overnight this has been proving an opportunity to get into mlops which imo provides more avenues to attack data for consumption thegainsfairy classic leadership a day late a dollar short a mile off and luke warm spiritualquestions mlops is a good space i am spending allot of my time trying to follow the mlops path at my work and learn more about infra deployment also like you mentioned it is super important the industry you are working for certain industries stay pretty stable regardless of the market like government health care and music for

titles and currently hold a role which i think would be desired by many in this sub what i find in this sub is a lot of gatekeeping especially by those who are still in academia students and with a couple years of experience end of the day i just know intermediate python and sql and some ml knowledge far from being an expert and that has been sufficient for my career the gatekeeping of you ca not be a data scientist if you do not know how to use some particular software or if you do not know the math behind some specific algorithm model that is not fundamental to most data ml pipelines is kind of bs it feels like they are projecting their insecurity to justify how they deserve to belong in this field more than others because they hold some special knowledge which to be honest is not that important and is easily replaceable data science is a very large field and everyone has different bits of knowledge learn what you can but do not expect even the most experienced data scientist to have knowledge in every aspect of the field and in particular your specific niche algorithm cocodirichlet you know that people have no clue when you get people saying you have to drop outliers people obsessed with p values or those using r squared for goodness of fit or to pick models and then of the comments are yes you are right do this but when you post r squared does not measure goodness of fit or have you looked into whether the observations are influential you get down voted to hell all of that is very basic statistics avelak lmao lemme guess you are just in a pissy mood because you got a bad perf review since you did not realize social skills are part of the job yes completely agree real data scientists are only those who truly understand the math behind harmonic mean not like modern zoomer data scientists minimaxir if you do not understand the math behind the work you are doing you are not a data scientist your just an analyst using the tools of the real scientists yeah real data scientists know how to calculate and use harmonic means outragedscientist wow my g gatekeeping both data science and science as a whole credentials or ban vacuouswaffle credentials needed data scientists born after cannot do math all they know is ask if chat gpt will steal their jobs complain about the recession charge they macbooks joke about harmonic mean eat hot chip and lie teetaps oh hey it is you again magrik what a pretentious cunt you are gboostedmachinations what a pretentious twat chasinggreenroads you should have to show your work email signature and a letter from your manager before commenting posting on this sub s tarehman strong start with hints of competence and a bouquet suggesting experience however bitter on the tongue and having notes of arrogance finishes weakly with poor mouth feel and a watery diluted sense of content and purpose overall not the best mreloi it is a fine line between being a competent practitioner and being an arrogant prig lunareclipsexx good bait lol i am assuming you use python for data science as well anonamen i am going to pretend i did not read beyond the second paragraph aside from this data science has no history which is why it has no historical perspective it is younger than me however the premise here is almost certainly correct might be productive to have some kind of verification option in general for reddit a lot of reddit value derives from experts giving their opinion away for free so why not verify loosely and make it easier for readers to know who is completely full of shit and who is only somewhat full of shit people do this filtering on their own anyway not talking crazy requirements something as basic as is employed as a data scientist in a real company right now would filter out most of the crap okvermicellil bozo inevitable frame probability has its roots some two centuries ago with bohemian mathematicians talking about betting games but more importantly this is the kind of info i got in college which i never expect to need in the market if the scientist in data scientist is appropriate as the term is used today can be a whole discussion by itself but as matters stand the mathematical theory behind things matter only as demanded by the problem at hand not by any sacred aspect of math techmlanco i agree with that there are a lot of very junior or low level data scientist here but your focus on math is really a typical utterance from entry level data scientists fresh from university math is important and yes you need stats to be a data scientist but data science in the industry is not academia and the level of math required for the most data science jobs is way lower than you propose here 6cockuccino after having gauged my eyes out on linear regression and basic math it is shockingly apparent to me how much people merely pretend to understand this stuff and how much ostensible interest in more advanced topics is pure sophistry heavy heat this is the classic academia mindset in pretty much all of the sciences in which arrogant elitism produces people who think they are more entitled to be scientists just because they have a higher depth of theoretical knowledge which mostly ends up in random useless papers rather than practical problem solving data science is a wide field with very blurry lines which may be reflected on titles but this does not mean that you need to know the history of philosophy of statistics and mathematics to be a real data scientist furthermore anyone with practical experience can offer advise even if they are from any other random unrelated profession kevindotjohnson lol op is butthurt cuz he she does not lnow harmonica means and assumptions of regression s stop glorifying the work of a data scientist the truth is there are going to be some front runners making a huge impact in machine learning and deep learning these are the people creating chat gpt and really pushing the limits most of us including myself are just going to using the tools created by these people we are not going to be building models from scratch because we are not going to do better than what is already out there bottom line if your using data to provide insights you are a data scientist amandazona so data scientist is not degreed phd ms statistician one studies the theory of mathematical equations and implements coding tools and packages to help data scientists do their applied work perhaps it is the title that has become murky along the way but that is how i understand it theory and modeling vs applied use of these tools others build character okay that was fun have an upvote supplychainphd damn you had the courage to say the quiet part out loud well done likenedthus as someone who was hired to do actual science i do agree that a lot of the people who have landed the title of data scientist in the past decade or so probably are not doing much science if any but that is largely a byproduct of the industry using data science as a broad descriptor and still being undecided on how to subdivide the roles that fall under it no one in particular is to blame for that reality nor should we downplay anyone is accomplishments in light of it now as someone who also happens to hold a degree in philosophyum what jorrissss do you consider experimental biologists or chemists who offshore their researches statistics to others to be scientists i sort of imagine with most fields you do not put understanding the math as a requirement but maybe i am wrong otherwise super cringe savethepandabears i am not trying to be condescending but proceeds to be incredibly obtuse and condescending while making gross generalizations and assumptions about a fairly large swathe of people you know nothing about all the while having next to no experience in the field yourself how does it feel to be a living breathing embodiment of the dunning krueger effect hard agree most of my time is spend catching up on understanding maths behind every statistic i do v1vthis is the post that makes me unsub if i want to hear gatekeeping and teenage grandstanding about purity i will go to also you are kokanutwater god this reads like a freshman who just read descartes and popper for the first time there is no way you actually work with people within this industry and talk like this dog wouldataciensultra hey bro thanks for not banning me jobeta i have lot of respect for this answer acewhenifacethedbase it is definitely a troll i checked and they are still in college but apparently they see fit to log on to this sub and give advice lol therealtiddlydump yeah for such a good attempt at trolling op really stepped on a rake at the end there realjiggz a beautiful piece of wood whittled down to nothing wouldataciensultra currently philosophy is considered by most academic institutions to be a sub field of the arts historically however philosophy is the father of all science academia and science as a whole was born from philosphy look at history this is a fact therealtiddlydump to be fair elden ring is fantastic though avelak the guy is just absolutely delusional no use engaging with him digg refugee our field tends to attract folks with high iq high confidence and at times low eq none the elden ring part is completely reasonable wouldataciensultra i keep records of all my activities yes on this sunday i am watching tv playing elden ring eating food walking and arguing with noobs on reddit if you want me to transcribe the events and behaviors of the previous week to provide evidence of my productivity i am more than happy to do so dl ml ds aspirant pocs what does that mean massive sorry for asking this out of curiosity if the client asks you about change in accuracy ratings how will you describe if the client is good at technicality wouldataciensultra congratulations sir you are a highly functioning loser hahahaha minimaxir relatedly all technical oriented subreddits will have a higher ratio of newbies to experts by construction the actual hard parts of data science are either too niche or too boring to get upvotes harmonic mean most people giving advice are not data scientists i am this one is basically the rick and morty copy pasta but with a ds spin to it equally pathetic feurbachsock i have found the sub to be less gate keeperish over time we are however pretty upfront about what it takes to become a successful ds if someone bucks that trend more power to them but i almost never see anyone saying they are not a real ds because they do not know or do xy and z outside of this weird post dataciensultra how about an actual scientist lol literally laughing out loud right now read the term how can you be a data scientist if you are not even versed in scientific thinking and methods its absurd really sycokinetic it really is fascinating to see a genuine bad culture fit out in the wild is not it none wait you are just screwing with the op right that comp is nuts can you really make that in ds just off work experience dataciensultra i am so impressed i have never seen tc before wow with no high school degree you must be a real scientist wouldataciensultra yes there is a lot of gatekeeping from the people you mentioned the reason for that is they come to this sub expecting it to be a community for other data scientists and then they find out that its not the case at all and so they engage in gatekeeping in an attempt to create the community they thought this could be instead of the one it is picapaodiablo i do not know you but thanks for being awesome dataciensultra no i just realized that most of the people on this thread are not even scientists let alone data scientists stoicfable but what does that mean magrik so ban wouldiggernotalone and what if they lied about all this stuff you mentioned milkteaoppa i agree i avoid unnecessary math as much as necessary i trust pre built packages to do the math for me and i know i will forget the math anyways i rather just review upon the math when necessary and ignore it in most cases if not needed cocodirichlet why specifically wouldataciensultra i was born in and i can confirm that i use a macbook otherwise i laugh at people who think chatgpt will steal their jobs i am recession proof due to high level of technical skill and i dont joke about harmonic mean or eat hot chips anobscurequote yeah this dude is having a seriously bad day minimaxir real data scientists code in assembly for maximum performance wouldataciensultra i use r sometimes but only when my teacher makes me do it tarehman in order to get flaired in here i had to provide documentation of my background and role to the mods wouldataciensultra no you are missing the point i am not talking about math i am talking about science these fools do not worships science how can they know the ciens of data if they do not even know the basics of the ciens shadowylurking all that being said being good at math and putting in the effort to understand what is going on pays off big time milkteaoppa in a corporate environment the fundamental models and algorithms are usually good enough and you will not have time to dive into all the theoretical sota academic stuff anyways get something working and move on to the next project wouldataciensultra every single actual competent data scientist i have ever heard of engaged with or read about was educated in academia period nobody is coming off the streets and teaching themselves the necessary base level of scientific thinking math statistics and computer science to do data science its just not something that is happening anywhere whatsoever wouldataciensultra no that is an analyst using the tools of scientist a scientist is versed in the scientific method and ways of thinking you are confusing the two inappropriately im not saying every data scientist needs to be writing their own models from stratch but there is a line between science and using the tools of science for some mechanical task if i have to draw the line for you your on the other side dataciensultra i am not saying you need a phd or ms in statistics to be a data scientist but you do need to be a scientist no how can a person be a scientist if they are not even trained and educated in science let alone data science or maths a data scientist is a scientist who extrapolates information from data or engages in study and research related to such practices a person who uses tools they do not understand to complete a task is not a scientist they are just doing job supplychainphd also i think you are looking for philosophy of science in that last paragraph wouldataciensultra damn bro what are we gonna do without you lmao gboostedmachinations i am not entirely convinced he is trolling it looks like he actually believes what he wrote lol therealtiddlydump i too can capitalize words to appear supremely intelligent and well endowed it is a fact wouldgrsmith to be frank you are relying on a lot of rhetoric rather than making a case for your argument based upon cogent evidence you are making statements without doing the work could i then refer to this as an example of someone not being a real scientist as they use their purported authority generate straw men and make black and white arguments rather than provide evidence to further place the impetus of true scientific contribution on the members of a research team that perform the math vs the members that theorize and come up with testable hypotheses in other aspects of observable phenomena is demonstrably inaccurate entire departments of biostatisticians support research teams but they themselves do not need to develop the math behind a regression model they just need to know how to use the tools of others to perform their work historically the history of science is messy and confined to messy historians the year anniversary of thomas s kunz structure of scientific revolutions contains an excellent precursor essay on the influence of structure on how we record and approach the history of science inevitable frame philosophy is considered a humanities science so ends up closer to the arts than to stem as for the historical fact you are pointing to that is the spiel of colonial white men who wanted status by labeling their travel journals natural philosophy so yeah some modern science traces itself back to ancient greece but that is one side of a small part of history sure but come on the skills of data scientist are very different from the skills of philosophers and the career advice is very different as well poodycrabs fair enough anygeologistelden ring is crack cocaine wouldataciensultra lol i am dead rn therealtiddlydump i look forward to reading your just jackin it log maybe you can create a new thread it sounds simply fascinating cramerrao i think poc here means proof of concept ie a small version of a project that demonstrates the capabilities and basic functionality as being feasible least self conscious ds right here magrik you do not even know the correct form of you are so i do not know if you are in a position to judge people would you be so kind as to tell us the kind of actual scientist that you are if us common peasants are even worthy of that information of course afkforlol imagine hiring someone and having them spread their toxic gatekeeing to developer and product teams when trying to support or productize your features yikes them hey bob we are coming up to launch date how are the features you are working on going this person it is going to take me weeks them oh wow okay why this person you would not understand you do not know science do not patronize me becky i am god afkforlol no afkforlol my main point here is that outside academia real science could look a lot different from what you may think the driver behind posting some base stats is that i probably hold a couple success metrics for what you may think a real data scientist has large company published patented good wage reasonably sr title solving sota problems but also without a lot of the criteria that you would use to consider me a real scientist no advanced degree im of the general opinion that if i think everyone else is a fraud then it probably means that my expectations simply are not the general reality to give you the benefit of the doubt i am curious to understand what your reality is what does a real scientist is day to day job look like to you where is the line that someone like me crosses into a real scientist fraud for you vacuouswaffle maybe with such advanced data science skills you would have discovered r machinelearning cocodirichlet thanks xd anygeologistif you have not been published in a journal with an impact factor greater than you are not a real scientist broadwayjoeyd nobody knows what it means but it is provocative because it is the meme format teetaps especially given how many times they have threatened to leave reddit today wouldataciensultra lol i am literally laughing my ass off and chilling a the crib bro bridledbronco vim is the ideal ide for them as well minimaxir i use r sometimes but only when my teacher makes me do it are you a data scientist heavy heat that is a very robust conclusion you have come to very scientific datamystic i was with you for a bit but do not you think this is overkill self teaching is difficult but not impossible with time and dedication okay buddy one day i aspire to be as good as you amandazona okay i see your point my perspective comes from this i am a microbiologist and then gained my mph in biostatistics now a master of public health in biostatistics is far from someone who can build packages full of mathematical equations that do cool shit i can however apply these and i understand the basics of why they work i trained under fantastic math phds who i could never touch in terms of modeling or deriving equations so at times i feel as if i back doored into data science according to your post though i qualify as i am a scientist by trade wouldataciensultra no i meant what i said v1vidk i imagine you will probably continue being confidently mediocre loudly perched atop mt stupid i have a coworker like this he really needs you to know how smart he is and he is sort of mean about it condescending in a room full of people he does not know are smarter than him he pushes bad code burns bridges talks shit does not learn from mistakes talks about how things really should be he is still a junior after like years it is a bad look wouldataciensultra yes this is the way wouldataciensultra wow i am so dumb thanks for making me smart again wouldataciensultra uhh no all of academia modern science is directly descendant from the school of philosophy in ancient greece this is a fact academia as we know it today was created by the schools of philosophy from grecian times before that all science was either pseudo religious or independent of organized academic institutions well he might actually be on to something there is gotta be a reason you get a phd in stem doctor of philosophy as opposed to doctor of science or something else character ellen ring is unbelievable boys noithatweedisloud the dude sucks but he literally said you are unless he edited the comment dataciensultra language is a tool not a law also what i did not even use a conjunction i just said you are i do not know what your talking about lol none lol no to the first question or the second dataciensultra my perspective is that a person who uses tools without understanding them is not a master of sciences they are just a laborer this is my personal view of reality just an assumption here i would be willing to bet though that you have a proper education you did not graduate high school but i bet you were in a good private school and you probably left because you already have opportunities available to you meaning you probably learned the scientific method by memory before you even entered high school no either way the difference between a scientist and an analyst is simple a scientist understand the tools he uses and how those tools were created as a matter of the scientific method the scientist can disassemble manipulate and reassemble the tool if necessary because he understand it intimately the scientist is a master of understanding and knowledge the analyst on the other hand uses the tool with ignorance he cannot break down the tool into its parts and explain them thoroughly he simply has faith in the work of the scientist and his prudence so regardless of your position compensation and success i do not think i would consider you a scientist you even admitted you do not understand the math behind of what you do so you are not really doing anything but relying on confirmed hypothesis of others no you are using confirmed theories laws and hypothesis to predict results in an industry context you are not in any way involved or intimately engaged with such things so you are not really a scientist in my opinion you are really just a data analyst with an inappropriate title dataciensultra my name has been published on two papers but i did not really do anything especially for the later i literally asked a question in class and the professor did research on it lol therealtiddlydump it is avant garde_ and daring stoicfable so the average person likes the sound of a mean anygeologiston a scale from to taco bell how high are you right now wouldataciensultra yes the idea that me having a teacher would preclude me from being a real data scientists just shows how far detached this sub is from science nobody ever became scientist without someone to teach them science this is a historical fact v1vbut my anecdotal evidence is evidence trust me my grandma got a vaccine then her cousin caught autism like one harmonic mean later educate yourself wouldataciensultra very robust indeed wouldataciensultra no education is important and necessary self teaching is only possible for people with a strong enough foundation of education there are many people who are successful self taught data scientist not analyst termed as ds and all of them have some kind of educational scientific background vacuouswaffle i am sure you surpassed him long ago dataciensultra do not bother lol dataciensultra yes most real data scientists come from your background this is my point a person who has no scientific background really has no business being a data scientist its an inconvenient truth for most of this sub but its the truth dataciensultra damn how did you ascertain my entire life story and situation from a short series of reddit comments so accurate so deep how can i avoid my fate lol seriously though i do not act like this in real life i am not a moron this is reddit the internet i behave here the way i cannot in the real world i am smarter than whoever you are talking about because i understand the need to conform to certain social expectations in the real world on reddit though i can say and do whatever the fuck i want until i get banned lol character is not weird though how capital letters make them well endowed all of a sudden no dispute just like is not it weird though wouldgrsmith still not a cogent argument turn that yall are not real scientists inward a bit maybe wouldataciensultra exactly lol people just like to flame over nothing magrik but someone as intellectually superior as you should know better afkforlol sorry not messing with i would be very unlikely to hire edit did not see the last part q my work experience included some high profile startup work in my direct field in college and my career after follows the biggest names in my industryies across the years also now approaching i am founded startup early afkforlol interesting perspective pretty disjointed from my experience in industry so i will take some time thoroughly unpack this for your sake not that it necessarily matters but to levelest the playing field of assumptions on my personal background you are pretty far off i was severely held back because i was a bad kid very headstrong got kicked out of every shit public school that i was able to attend ended up being held back so much from xfering mid term from expulsion that i was o in grade math was never able to take bio chem adv sciences because of the math blocker seeing i would graduate high school at age like i studied up at a local library and got my ged went to a shit community college and learned how to be a good student did very well there because i could take interesting classes now chem biology maths lots and lots and lots of studying utilizing free tutoring to catch up and fill massive knowledge holes few years later got an as in chemistry xfered to a mid tier private engineering school for chemical engineering the only one i got accepted to fuuuuucking expensive yay loans my school happened to be near a top tier school lucky me so i audited snuck into more classes at the top tier school than i took at my own school in my spare time attended a lot of hackathons worked in a graduate engineering lab eventually got a job as a chemical engineer and worked as a research scientist in preformulation drug discovery at a top pharma company ran out of money and had to drop out of school refer to fuuuuucking expensive started a small deep learning research firm with some phd post doc friends i met in my lab grew to people did some cool sota research for large private firms eventually when all of that paid off and i had money finishing a chem e degree did not make sense anymore and my credentials were stacked enough to move on saying this all to give some context on how you may be grossly underestimating over assuming on what makes a scientist just like you are for me this is why i made an initial comment that i would never hire you you seem difficult to work with even if you are a real scientist and i am not and even if i was hiring you to do real scientist work and i do not i am putting the effort into writing this because my heart goes out to you just like it does to the headstrong shitheads i once was ok moving on as for your definition of the scientific method research i agree with you that scientists follow the scientific method the part that i dont agree with you on is that scientists know or should know the fundamentals of exactly what they are doing similar to engineering and research roles while a scientist does should know the fundamentals of say linear algebra derivatives integrals loss functions insert whatever here etc you would be hard pressed to have any research scientist hand derive basic backprop let alone complex llms diffusion models gans etc and then implement in assembly similar to how you would be hard pressed to find a nobel prize physicist hand derive many of the things they work on empirical data ie fuck around and find out defines the scientific space some of the most renown scientific discoveries were situations where some fuck poisoned himself and was like hope i do not die then lightbulb and boom vaccines science has levels of abstractions for a reason hell feynman drew pretty pictures to describe the many pages of math it would take to describe complex subatomic particle interactions some impossible to describe derive just like in ml when you see papers come out from research institutions and large research corporations like the ones my team publishes there is rarely a single individual who knows all of the fundamentals to such a deep level of abstraction that you are implying real scientists should many times hundred page derivations are built by teams where individuals are responsible for parts of the whole many of the algorithms models in the ml field do not have formal proofs are not understood at that level here i am challenging at what level your version of a scientist can break down the tool into its parts and explain them thoroughly in line with the the more you know the less you know vibe i do not understand of what i do just like i do not write assembly just like research scientists literally random walk hyper parameter spaces you are giving a hand wave to scientists using tools at appropriate levels of abstraction to perform the scientific method people using tools that they do not fully understand to gather data create hypotheses design experiments models test the hypothesis etc those are scientists not analysts who do not get it tldr if you see a real scientist who knows the fundamentals please point them out to me so i can run far far away and checking out from this convo to go and live life i hope this hits you well and you achieve everything you are shooting for regardless of what some random person on the other side of the internet thinks finokhim so you are not a scientist or data scientist character it is like when your mean but you like sing all your insults and your hype person harmonizes over your shoulder wouldataciensultra bro i wish i was high right now lol minimaxir data scientists do not have to do math homework lmao op is literally anygeologist why should anybody take pointers from people who rely on shields instead of rolling wouldataciensultra no its not weird if you were versed in the science of arts you would know that capitalization is used to express significannot and uniqueness of terms so you are merely perceiving the effect of those artistic facts science wouldataciensultra oh okay i will do some reflection on the validity of my grammar and my identity as a scientist thanks for making me humble i am sorry for being arrogant narcissistic fool i am cured now because of your knowledge and perspective have a great week sir none dang that is impressive dl ml ds aspirant i do not even hold a bachelors degree did not graduate high school some high profile startup work in my direct field in college in the us or wherever you are from can you attend college without graduating completing hs congrats on the tc people like you keep me inspired dl ml ds aspirant sota research state of the art also please ignore my previous question about how you went to college sans graduating i read your story and was thoroughly impressed congratulations for turning your life around dataciensultra see bro you are like one of the of the people in this sub who is actually useful and you are a career data scientist as far as i am concerned all you did is prove my point and for the record i do not act like this in real life lol i am very personable friendly and much more toned down when i am not on reddit thank you for your response and your story it was much appreciated wouldataciensultra pretty sure every real data scientist they ever existed did math homework at some point in their lives again if you think me doing homework actually precludes me from being data scientist then you really missed the point wouldataciensultra if only wouldataciensultra ahahahh shields op bro hackingbricker are you a communist most of us work in the private sector selling our skills for profit to companies that make a profit off real products your philosophical approach is the reason so many data science investments fail wouldgrsmith i was not suggesting any of the above rather i was suggesting a consideration of what encouraged you to go into a forum of strangers and make attempts at putting some of them down while simultaneously identifying as a member of an elite class with criteria that do not necessarily represent the actual group of what are called scientists afkforlol in the us yes but you need to take some standardized test to get something called a ged this counts as an equivalent to a hs degree afkforlol correct state of the art thank you it is been a long road and i am still on it finding good mentors is the only way want to go fast go alone want to go far go together or something like that it is amazing how much nerds want to help if you are also interested in the things they nerd about pretty good community overall minus the recent gatekeeping trash bags mate finish school before you start talking shit anygeologistp works as a data scientist had to do math homework at some point in their lives p works as a data scientist still has math homework to do dl ml ds aspirant roger roger thanks again for taking the time to explain this dl ml ds aspirant dude the gatekeeping on this the ml and dl subs is disgusting thankfully there are people like you who actually take time to help people like me who are transitioning from academic to ds you are absolutely right getting mentors is an extremely wise bet and also works as a shortcut in life wouldataciensultra ahh you did a maths expression so good so smart you must be a real data ciens man like me",

  "bboycage if i am not mistaken it means that you are supposed to pad strings by attaching filler to the right instead of to the left it is usually done to ensure uniform length on all strings i take that absolute position embeddings means that the position of words in a sentence should be absolute hence padding right instead of left as that would change a word is indices in a sentence foobarvar foo bar foobarpadded foobarvarljust and foobarvar has a length value of bar in this sentence would be foobarvar that would change if we were to pad the value to the left which is why the documentation states that strings should be padded to the right the second line of code adds ampersands to the end of foobarvar to fill out string length doing this ensures that the string is at the desired length of twelve whilst preserving bar is position of when you are using multiple sentences in a batch they will have different lengths so you need padding it makes it so that you can bundle it up together and run it through the transformer at once and it will ignore those padding tokens absolute position encodings is a type of encoding where you pre define the embedding and then sum it to the token embedding so the transformer model has a sense of where each words belongs in a sentence this is to say that this type of embedding is not learned these models are set up in such a way that they expect the first token of a sentence to correspond to the first embedding the second token to the second embedding etc if that is the case you should only add padding to the right and not to the left of the sentence if you add padding to the right then the first token embedding will be summed with the first position embedding like it should if you add padding to the left then the first padding embedding will receive the first position embedding and you will end up in a situation where the first token embedding will be summed with the nth position embedding if you do not understand what i mean by token just replace the word token with word it is not the same but for illustration purposes it is easier to understand",

  "i have three years experience as a data scientist and recently interviewed with a fairly well known tech education company they claimed their take home test would take hours and it took me about to complete it i passed and interviewed in three more rounds just to be told i did not get the job the interviewing process especially in our field can be infuriating mathstatgal i recently took a timed evaluation that had questions on sql on python modelling and open ends i correctly solved of those eight could not sort out of the python questions and the modelling exercise which was to create a neural net would not compile all of this in hours timed i obviously did not make it to the next round im fine with that outcome these expectations are really ridiculous all i got at the end of those hours was a banger of a headache edit i have years experience so do not be too hard on yourself keep trying that is all one can do milkteaoppa when most interviewers say their take home assignment take x amount of hours it is safe to assume it actually takes two times to three times hours many employers say x amount of hours because the creator of the assignment is speaking from a perspective of already understanding the data the problem domain setting up the dev environment knowing what to do and having pre built code for copy and pasting they also say a lower number of hours to not deter candidates and make themselves seem more competent i can do this from scratch in x hours after having bad experiences with getting responses from take home assignments no response several more rounds of interviews rejection with no feedback i do not do them anymore unless they seem reasonable i can learn something new and i am interested in doing them as a side project regardless if it is as a job application or not then i remove company information from the assignment and post it on github to build up my portfolio philosplendid i have years of data science experience i have spent entire weekends on take home projects last summer i had multiple jobs be dissolved due to the economy after i had already started the take home project i do not do them anymore for any company aloekine yeah this is common unfortunately for more junior folks take homes we set candidates up in a collab and point out we can check the time they spent roughly so we actually do mean our suggested time art in data i am transitioning to data analytics from academia and it is a difficult journey i prepared a lot for many months and got a few interviews in one of the interviews i was given hour to analyse a dataset and answer questions that were already prepared the dataset had some formatting issues time date related and that itself took me mins to resolve then as i started exploring and filling the questions my time was up i did not get through and was highly dissatisfied with the expectations some companies have afterwards i did a good job with the dataset and went on to work on more complex ones but it is ridiculous how employers think timed data analysis tests will yield the best out of a candidate sometimes a dataset can reveal unexpected information when the analysis goes beyond copy paste code or the analyst has enough time to explore the data actually not my experience is that the task they give are usually easy but i had times when i was sooo nervous that i found the easiest task difficult theregicidalmaniac this is exactly why i refuse to do take home assignments anymore i am not doing free work at the chance of getting a job the more people refuse to tolerate this nonsense the sooner businesses will drop this ridiculous practice bealzebubbly please do not spend hours on a take home it is an unreasonable request and while i understand the feeling of i want to go above and beyond and really show them what i can do you are perpetuating a culture where this is becoming the norm my perception is that when a company gives you a take home and says you have hours to complete this they actually want you to spend hours on it and not finish it the reality is that when you are actually working as a ds there will always be more work than you can do in any given week month quarter etc so a highly underrated skill is the ability to quickly scope and prioritize that is the real skill that is being evaluated with these take homes and so they almost always give you more work than can be done in the allotted time because that reflects the reality of the job so what to do take at least minutes to read through and fully understand the asks make notes for clarification questions or places where you would suggest limiting or adjusting the assignment break the tasks down into smaller pieces and then make a priority list write this down and explain your reasoning work on the top priority items and show that you can complete at least some of the smaller chunks you scoped out save at least minutes at the end to give a brief explanation of how you would approach the unfinished tasks write all of this down spend a little time making sure you are writing in clear complete sentences and your formatting is readable send it back with a short note saying i spent x hours on this task as requested please see my notes and progress in the attached document done take home assignments are a great way to show off the breadth of your knowledge and your soft skills use them as such and you will be surprised how well hiring managers will respond plenty of folks spend hours on these take homes and send back a mess of code that gets the job done but that is not really what they are asking fintelligent hard to generate the depth of insight worthy of getting a job without a full day is work imo deep work kicks in after like hours not for everyone but i have actually had the most success pulling an all nighter before the interview to complete the task so it is all on my mind and i can answer any questions i only do this if i am feeling pretty good about my chances already though i just applied for a role doing data science they are doing a second interview with me and i have not had to do any technical questions yet weird theendgame the take home test for the company i am working at just took me a few minutes i do not to take home assignments swappybizz change career wouldadboddatascientist my company had a hour hard finish they emailed me the assignment at a time of my choosing and i had to email back eda initial model explanations and a presentation back within hours i really appreciated it because i would have spent hours on it if they did not put the time cap on it i love my company useful thanks good to know besides having to spend too much time on interviews i have also wondered if the hours is what their actual work expectations would be for the task sounds like that is not the case synbiosvyse i had one where they gave me a week i would spend hrs every day after my normal job working on it so probably close to hrs then had to go in and do pencil paper coding with one group and whiteboard with another i did not get the job even though i passed the takehome and gave a presentation on it and passed the pencil paper pretty well i lost it at the whiteboard normally i would be reluctant to go through so many hoops but it was my dream company a major well respected brand name i got a different job afterwards and feel lucky i did not end up getting that first job anyway it seems like a high strung awful place in retrospect how did the other rounds look like useful thanks leroyjr keep trying or refuse to do the homework if they do not value your time before you are an employee how don you think it will go after there are ways to ascertain technical abilities that can be accomplished conversationally respecting the interviewee is time more companies should care about the candidate experience yeah i used to help create exams for college level math courses and the rule of thumb is i should be able to take the exam cold in about mins and that means it would make a great minute exam for undergrads people who give out tech interview questions should do the same or better yet not give take home useful thanks for the insight that is a great idea i will ask if the datasets are public and if they are i will post them to my github useful thanks so then how do you respond if a potential employer requests one useful that would be nice useful ouch hopefully one of your other interviews went better useful thanks i was better about this for the second task the problem i was running into was that the initial data cleaning task took so long that i am past the allotted time before answering the specific follow up questions even though those were pretty easy i can consider the soft skills and prioritization more useful interesting idea i do not interview well tired so not the approach for me lol useful i have gone through two interviews before a technical screen depends on how many total interviews they want useful nice one was with a team of data engineers another was with the other data scientists i would have worked with directly and the other was with the director of the data department they were all a mix of technical and behavioral questions each lasted about an hour philosplendid kind of depends on the situation with the job i ended up accepting i explained that i was too busy for one and that i had bad experiences with them in the past i am in grad school part time so being too busy was a pretty easy excuse and i felt the interviews went super well and i did not think i would be hurting the opportunity of an offer by saying i would not do a take home i might have treaded more carefully and offered alternatives in a different situation fintelligent yeah it is tough any way you slice it i definitely do not think as well on my feet doing this but i think when there is an interview task the ability to show a good work product on a problem they chose usually outweighs stupid things you might say in behavioral interviews or tweaking out because you are tired as long as you are not proving yourself incompetent one time i spent an entire week on a project and then they ultimately expressed verbal intent to hire me but their finance team did not approve the budget for the role after the hiring process was completed i do not think i can stomach doing that anymore so i just try to timebox as much as possible and avoid context switching to real work problems to make it seem like i had thought about it a longer time than i otherwise did",

why do you want to cut it off compute runtime data constrained why not just toss it all in if it might have improved at block what is the harm backbenchbaadcow you could use something like an anova to compare variance explained at each iteration the f statistic would be useful for your purposes i would imagine vacuouswaffle i do not think enough information given here is provided all we see is that whatever trials are maybe too are notably worse r than it is also possibly increasing possibly noise with additional trials i do not see any evidence that the value is yet stable you could devise some statistical tests anova to see where additional trial effects drop off to within some bounds of statistical error or just set a value say trials for further testing since at some point you might be getting additional fit but at additional cost of testing cocodirichlet r squared does not measure goodness of fit thegrandhedgehog i would say trials looks good sure it is nice to have the extra r but is it worth doubling the number of trials for seems like a decent model for relatively few trials as another commenter suggested trials could conceivably be observations from the same distribution due to falling within the ci for trial i would go with what someone else suggested and run anova to compare variations across the trial sequence if they tend to improve significannotly trial to trial for but not for that would be enough justification or even if the f statistic drops below a certain threshold regardless of significance to cut off after trials goat lamp this looks like a classic optimal stopping change point problem at risk of completely jumping the gun without entirely understanding the ask i believe something like the sequential probability ratio test might be useful here woznyyyy you might want to start using adjusted as it takes the number of features into account simply put you will get a higher score when the feauture has a more significannot impact you will almost always get higher whenever you add another feature even if the feauture itself brings nothing to the table psychshake imagine each block has trials and during each block you may add one to any of those trials so something that looks like this block trials block trials etc until block trials each is fit with a gaussian curve and in the graph above are the average r from participants on each of the blocks from looking at the data r seems to be accurate in detecting the shape of the distribution so i have been using it i am open to any better measures of a gaussian fit psychshake thanks for the replyr r this is a task that will hopefully be used in clinical populations one day which means that the task needs to be relatively quick to administer if the fit is not changing after a certain point and is essentially producing the same value across multiple blocks then i am just wasting a patient is time r r also what do you mean by you do not stat sig improve after block tacitdenial if the data in blocks is from a larger population perhaps there could be a chance of overfitting psychshake that was one of my ideas too i am glad i am not the only one to think that might work psychshake i see what your saying from what i am reading online about it do you have any suggestions on a better goodness of fit measure for a gaussian distribution voodooeconi agree with this to my eye starting from one the first statistically significannot improvement comes at block you do not see another statistically significannot improvement after that goat lamp post script from the other replies i have gathered it is clinically related have you looked into early monitoring schemes alpha spending functions and what not there is a mountain of literature on this type of analysis of course i cannot seem to remember what it is called in practice must be early onset dementia eeops i do not understand this what is a block what is a trial adding one of what what is fit with a gaussian curve even without knowing the problem taking the average of r squared is across subjects is almost certainly a bad approach ohthatlookscool your estimated means in are inside the ci for block maybe it improved but maybe blocks are just random observations from the block distribution psychshake thanks for reply what do you mean each of these blocks is an average r from participants this is pilot data to inform changes in the task going forward cocodirichlet i am a bit confused about what you are doing so i ca not recommend one measure in another comment you explained the trials and that sounds like a binomial to me not a gaussian block are repeated trials n block are trials n block are trials n so you can see success or successes out of one thing you are not focusing on here though is the se i do not know if that line on the figure means you want to stop at block but the se for block is pretty large compared to block etc psychshake if you have early onset dementia then so do i i swear i have seen this type of analysis done elsewhere but i cannot remember where also i just posted a rough description of the task to another commenter that i will post here as well to see if it gives you any more ideas he my description of the data imagine each block has trials and during each block you may add one to any of those trials so something that looks like this block trials block trials etc until block trials each is fit with a gaussian curve and in the graph above are the average r from participants on each of the blocks goat lamp interim analysis is what i was thinking yeah not sure that exactly applies here this looks like more of a sequential thing similar but different goat lamp hm interesting i have got to admit that i may be tripping over the nomenclature a bit here my day to day role places me somewhere between statistical quality control and clinical trials so the terms block and trial have firmly cemented meanings to me that i struggle to decouple i have confused myself with the attached graph too is the x axis blocks or trials i see that there are participants from which you are gathering data at each time point but what exactly is being measured are they completing a survey an aptitude test competing with one another and being classified into ranked groups",
  "josiahwalker we have ds integrated with engineering product teams that run in an agile manner we treat eda as a time boxed activity that produces followup tasks which are then prioritised in discussion with the team practically this means eda only goe as deep as the team can allocate time budget for you do not drown in depth followup investigations opportunities are prioritised with the team so that the most important insights arrive first as a ds you are not shouldering the whole mental planning burden of prioritisation it happens in sync with engineering support availability and product roadmap plans johnsandall absolutely i have been using agile for ds and ml projects for years now the team loves it it is clear what they are working on we do not get priorities yanked around day by day it allows room for flexibility and quickly pivoting strategies for feature engineering or model tuning without getting lost in a boil the ocean approach for months the clients love it we deliver faster we do not go down rabbit holes for too long there is clear expectation setting of what is realistic and retros create a culture of improvement not blame when things go wrong i spoke

problem you are having two week sprints inflexible changes to schedule lack of team communication riveryr depends on product and industry dashboard outcome yes actual research no vilevampire your ml eng could your analysis and exploration will be a disaster no because agile demands minimal management and maximal direct contact between the actual tech people be it mles ds das etc and users and current ds and tech in general is filled with useless management layers circle jerking each other cue certified folks storming in to yell at me about their superior meeting scheduling skillz oh yes i would love to waste bloody hours a week playing house in a retrospective talking about life and what pisses me off aka this sad waste of time s speedis notfree the whole point of agile is handling change rbyes scrum managers whoever owns delivery essentially might be the same person as the line manager need to aggressively timebox stories tracking exploratory work while keeping enough slack to follow discovered paths as needed line managers need to coordinate with ics and scrum managers to set expectations about slack and reasonable time boxes implementation tasks that are on the de or mlops side can be estimated and planned normally in most cases moscowgordon a kanban board works well i think no need to force things into sprints when things change so much i am convinced agile is a brilliant marketing campaign by atlassian for selling jira i assume what you are really asking is how to best set up jira for managing ds work just do whatever is most convenient without worrying about how agile it is datanewbie eda in the enterprise is hit or miss most of the time the strategy meeting matterhorn meeting knows the problem pros and cons etc to ask ds mle to handle the task when

are the exact same qns faang excos are asking and why the majority of the so called tech layoffs are pms and bas the non engineers companies are indeed beginning to wake up and understand and reshuffle the food chain for lack of a better word wouldonobinladin great questions meeting with stakeholders vps directors managers to understand what they need and exerting influence on them when

about of ticket management in ado preparing for all the rituals and documenting the outcomes regression testing deliverables from the dev team multiple meetings with tech team to vet upcoming projects

communication reading emails a day and keeping everyone who wants to be updated in the loop adjusted to their technical level of understanding very much an art to avoid people getting annoyed with too many or too few emails making time to have idle chit chat in the office for team building and bc it helps when shit hits the fan like it does on every project and you need a favor wording rewording re rewording powerpoints and user documents bc the people you need to communicate with need everything in super simple twitter sized nuggets preparing analogy after analogy for highly complex distributed systems so vps and directors when they inevitably ask can scratch the chin and say oh yeah now i get it even if they still do not last but most important never being in control of your deliverable all the responsibilities with none of the authority if things are behind there is nothing you can do except ask for people to do more there is no burning the midnight oil just begging for more resources or heaven forbid an extension on the delivery date because your crystal ball did not take into consideration that two of your resources were gonna get pulled or a consultant cannot deliver what they

  "neat porpoise it is a data frame already so just utilize the method of sortvaluesby organic quantricko ask chatgpt hairyprotection fyi sorting is a rather slow operation and will not scale once you start working on very large datasets i would recommend finding the minimum of the organic average instead of sorting and returning the first last entry character look in the docs if you google pandas dfsort or pandas dftranspose it will usually give you the exact syntax from pandas page it is like using help but full color with examples learning to use the docs is key because when you decide to use a brand new module or the stack overflow page uses deprecated methods and everyone keeps pointing you to the same answer from that does not seem to work anymore the docs will save you if they want wide data you will need to sort and transpose to take long data to wide gaultois very new to pandas and data science at all do not understand how to sort this table by the organic column any push in the right direction would be appreciated gaultois what the helli tried this so many times and kept getting an error thrown worked perfect just then i must have changed something somewhere and not realised also the error messages do not seem to be super helpful thanks purplebrownupdown it is actually really amazing for pandas gaultois thanks figured it out appreciate your time this stack overflow answer should help wouldatastoryteller also r learnpython is a good resource gaultois thanks figured it out",

  "mrbrambles chatgpt is good at fluffing it is own resume unlikelytiechatgpt subscription is month you will have to work for less to remain competitive in the market jokes aside i cannot imagine data science being automated in the foreseeable future that said you might have to deal with lesser amount of annoying crap that usually takes of data scientist is time data scientist here chat gpt is a great tool but it is confirmation bias in the extreme some times it writes great code sometimes not so great the better more specific instructions you give it usually the better code but theoretically it does not understand the justification for why you are using a specific modelling approach ask chatgpt to give you a random forest algorithm for your data you will get one it does not mean the models appropriate likewise for exploratory data analysis it cannot ask the right questions or understand what to ask therealtiddlydump the robot said it it must be true pryomancermtga but can it post to reddit while it is supposed to be working like i do thevillagersid i am pretty sure the only real expertise chatgpt has is in gaslighting users your data science career should be safe for the time being dataciensultra do you guys realize that chatgpt is just a chatbot right any answers or solutions it creates are just estimates of what it thinks a human would say i do not know how to explain how unrealistic it is to think that chatgpt is going to be replacing jobs in the tech industry lets just put it this way if your job can actually be done by a chatbot you deserve to be replaceable meatmakingman now ask a data scientist about the tasks chat gpt cant automate bikeskata tbf you should not continue a masters in ds because most of them are ripoffs not because of chatgpt theperfectcannotelope nope may as well call it quits and switch to carpentry i am still going to pursue a ms data science this fall that is it that is the end of this sub for me i just hate this subreddit so fucking much can we actually talk about fucking real shit what do you want to hear op yeah man chat gpt is taking all of our jobs it is gonna replace all research scientists engineers and analysts human existence is meaningless go quit like what i swear i tested the limitations of chat gpt and yeah while it is impressive we still have such a long way to go when it comes to massive takeover of these systems again i will say it again you guys are too trustworthy of those systems and put too much faith in them i am not batting an eye at chatgpt and i will not for another years aeywaka ha i would like to see chatgpt try to handle stakeholder expectations when they want to change an annual projectannually the only part of your job it is replacing is copy pasting from stack overflow honestly i have been loving the gpt based code completes as it really speeds up a lot of code writing tasks last part is true lol chatgpt can barely do arithmetic even though it gives correct formula for my homework miscmate i have been working in ds without a masters for about years most of the value is in to ask the right questions what are the business needs how do you define the target how does the business links to the output of the model do they understand it which population are you talking about is there specific bias to be aware of best case scenario chatgpt can only give you answers onthepalehorse wait this is a serious question lol i thought this was r programmerhumor oddapplicationchatgpt is perfectly able to automate pretty much everything that is in a typical ds course but a senior data science knows that this pretty much everything in a typical ds course accounts for a small portion of the actual work you will lose most of your time trying to understand your data create the variables out of business needs and justify your work to people who do not understand what you do also any automl package like pycaret is able to streamline basically most of the vanilla duties of a data scientist you still need someone who works on the specific requirements and parameters the ai needs for generating these tasks firstbullfrogjesus bro have you learned anything in your studies chatgpt is not capable of a single one of these points rn it simply regurgitated a list of ds subdomains do not panic pack your towel keep going it will be worth it will not completely eradicate the job but will reduce the number of people required also job roles will change pretty much the same that happened as cloud services were adopted tadpolesouthern it is a tool to make you more efficient it is not going to replace you i was playing with chatgpt last week asking it to put together python functions to collect data generate distributions chart some data for a range of parameters perform some basic ml and present the results i was mainly looking to see if it would do an iform diagram but was testing the other elements there was not a single section of code that would run without some modification it generally would do the task with simplest route but i was both impressed and concerned in equal measurez yungterpenzee do a masters in statistics instead you would be the one building those chats insighteous in my opinion every data scientist asking this is not qualified enough in terms of degrees otherwise one would know that there is much chatgpt cannot do whispertoke like others have said it requires a ton more training it will not be able to give more nuanced or appropriate solutions unless results are being reviewed and rated and the only people who can effectively rate serious technical ds outputs are serious technical data scientists i wonder if at some point big tech will employ ds people to use ai products and give detailed feedback on solutions but i could see free enterprise services being offered in exchange for that sort of thing chatgpt can do a lot of shit according to chatgpt ccwhere i am a quantitative ecologist which basically means i write r code for a living i have experimented with the statistical modeling capabilities of chatgpt the tech is impressive in that it can fit models and return undergraduate level interpretations complete with errors but it completely falls apart with any degree of complexity the other commenter saying that chatgpt is good at gaslighting analysts is spot on rationaldialog chatgpt is the most confident job scammer ever frequentiststats it can assist you but cannot replace you renokarchnmy it is entirely too entertaining to watch tech people freak out about chatgpt threatening their livelihoods after decades of tech people automating away other people is jobs i can only imagine the schadenfreude felt by all those whose ability to earn was automated away by some brogrammer over the last years admittedly i do wish efforts were spent actually automating away the mundane and tedious parts of regular people life like folding towels and matching the socks after laundry cleaning the toilet and fetching groceries dusting baseboards and ceiling fans changing lightbulbs putting the dishes away after cleaning ironing pants vacuuming the couch etc willardstyle institutional domain knowledge anyone can build and run a model but you can level up your domain knowledge to understand how all the pieces fit together from problem to solution to presentation or handoff financial yes you should oppositemeetingmaybe read the last line it literally cannot do any of those things yet someone please show me examples of it doing any of that with a real dataset hell even a toy dataset would surprise me rroth chatgpt is the chuck e cheese of computing technology your future job is safe swappybizz wo not shit code any original work all derivative crunchyal i doubt it can do them well i used chatgtp on hackerrank and leetcode questions but the code it gives is not the correct output or in most cases from my experience fails the test cases honestly i think you will be fine and should continue neurodiverseotter i tried to give chatgpt some medical questions today it gave me false correlations of two symtpoms when asked for a source it invented a study and the authors names programs like these will not replace humans who can verify their results anytime soon keep calm and carry on meaveready can chatgpt automate the process of feeding the data and requirements and prompting chatgpt exactly with what is needed then train and validatr a ml model and manage its deployment no does not that already sound like ai assistance more than automation livingteachingi asked chatgpt how to compare between k means and hdbscan clustering and his answer was silhouette scorewhich is totally wrong billyions human level intelligence is widely in demand being able to use intelligent assistants has always been valuable there is so much more to learn and do justneurostuff chatgpt cannot automate any of those things esp if this post is not a joke yeah id agree you have a lot more to learn about ds garbage in garbage out greatraisin the true value that a data analyst brings that can never be replaced automated is domain knowledge and a deep understanding of the industry business someone who is been working at a company for a few years will have vast amounts of organic knowledge that cannot be easily documented or turned into a set of rules that can be used by a computer to do their job wouldgrsmith i am looking forward to data science training being less about deep programming instruction and how to build a tool and more about how to ask and answer good scientific questions as someone with phd training in a scientific field i think one of the greatest advantages i have is learning how to consume and produce solid research some of my advisors referred to their phd training as teaching them how to learn anything if masters programs started teaching solid research skills with lighter focus on tool implementation that would be great you need to be able to read code for sure but i do not think it will be as necessary to pull rarely used classes in pandas out of your back pocket at a moments notice slippu chat gpt does not really work the way most people think it does it is more accurate to describe it as a translator but instead of translating from english to another language it translates english words to tagged long form phases ideas in a form that is contextually correct to your request programming language is simply another form of context to express an idea it does do a great job of giving the illusion that it is thinking though it literally says a human data scientist is still required so umairican chatgpt is great and will continue to improve but it still is full of errors and makes the mistake of providing code that does not work but does so with such confidence that you believe it is right at first knowing why it is not right and how to fix it is a reminder of the value we will continue to have for some time capitalmind zerogpt identified chatgbt generated content with generic searches i made two changes to my input and get human written responses that zerogpt cannot detect so while i was thinking this was an area that still needed to be fixed so far it is not musings aside i think we are a long way off feeding legislation and standards into a machine and getting coherent concise and correct information out of it take something like the wikipedia millions of definitions and titles however there are millions of duplications citation errors and broken links i think we really will have cracked ai when we can feed it something like wikipedia and reduce the entire website to a knowledge base of concise and perfect data ai is still limited to snippets and does not seem to retain any memory and a good example is getting it to teach you something a human tutor can identify your optimal ways of learning and provide examples inferences and metaphors chat gpt certainly does not do that currently though it would be good to see this level of intelligence come from the data i am still a big fan of supervised ai to teach a system rather than millions of random examples a recent example of music generated from ai was every degree of painful i have ever heard had it been taught music theory genres tempos the many sounds and idiosyncrasies of individual instruments and many playing styles i am sure it would do better should chatgpt get to a stage or entire websites have been reduced to a perfect data set i see such websites disappearing quickly many wiki style and answer sites will disappear as we will get our answer straight away they are still opportunity to develop other generated content such as charts and graphs from a description rather than a photo going back to my early point western countries got together and agreed legislation needed to be standardized in something like an xml hierarchical structure and almost every country bailed on the idea the only country that is accepted the challenge is new zealand and their website better rules gives you an example of how this works there is currently one company working with this technology that i know of and their results are astounding is this self awareness that it knows what it knows and can talk about it nottheprofessor abacus to scientific calculator ax to chainsaw needles to sawing machine list goes on data tools to ai you still need to know how to do the damn work to use the machine do not get thrown around my internet hype most people do not know the actual work that goes in so they assume ai as a skynet umbrella that does it all neoasylum chatgpt talks a lot its a language model just try asking about easy mathematical problems and you will see it fail purplebrownupdown i used it for the first time today to see if it could do what took me two hours to learn in pandas it did it after querying chat gpt in five minutes i am absolutely blown away by how good it is for python coding theaimlguy chatgpt is certainly promising to say the least however people are really going overboard with their fears at this moment there is a lot to be done to polish it and make it reliable as to the concerns of it being replacing people it is much less likely more so it will be essentially complementing people and will create a niche area of experts to use it as a highly efficient tool lesfirewall i am getting my masters too and honestly while chatgpt is a good tool it is does not write perfect code it definitely helps with some tasks but i am still doing the majority of the work financialappearance why would you trust chatgpt here which is essentially writing its own advertisement cronjefourieza hahaha calm yourself my son chatgpt appears awesome but once you delve deeper you soon realise it has many flaws complete that degree trust me you will still be using it about from now lanky lolbro chatgpt can barely do an sqlite table that does exactly what i want and makes up fake data to make you happy wouldtrned if you are worried or think chatgpt can replace you as a data scientist i do not think you are smart enough to be one nooptionleft man chatgpt is still making up numbers when i ask for mock up abstract the tech is incredible but let us calm down a little here it is great at giving you snippet of code for super specific task but when you ask for more generic approaches it copypaste from stuff that is already done also the point is straight up lying believe me i have tried i would love to not spend a week trying to understand what the hell the wet lab was thinking when he labeled the data and why the hell half of them are na not saying we should not be thinking about this automation is a freaking huge problem for everyone even if it does not put us out of a job but i do not think you will stop being paid anytime soon benzall it will definitely increase productivity but will not completely automate the ds job but this also means that it is going to get lot more competitive to raise the bar to become ds thetacklezone well validation which you know because chatgpt told you so there you go the bot that needs to be validated is telling you it needs to be validated but does it really need to be validated you may need a human to validate that on a separate note i am enjoying my argument with chatgpt that highly complex glms are just as blackbox as gbms and the presence of one way tables just lures humans into a false sense of security that you know what is happening once all the interactions are applied it saw my point initially but now it is arguing back minorcontribution sorry but by now i feel like the will chatgpt replace me question has been beaten to death on this and related subreddits with many many great explanations clarifying it will not even if this post is in jest i kind of feel tired of the topic should i just shut up maybe we can create a sticky for people that feel doubtful or fear for their job security you can tell how many words a sentence consists of so go for it jzcommunicate it just made a list of basic ds concepts if that is scaring you off then no you should not continue bafbeernl sure thing this will just make your job easier thalamisa of course it is a tool to help your work but i cannot imagine where ais can automate all the aspect of data cleaning it is kinda an utopia can chatgpt harmonic mean though that is the only thing that matters bobbruno afaik it is not doing the understanding of obscure business needs and framing them as a data science problem it is not going over all your accessible data and picking what might be useful it is not thinking out of the box to engineer features in a way that exposes the information hidden behind the noise representation it might eventually do all those things and more right now it does not it makes very basic mistakes in its coding it cannot do synthesis of an entire end to end solution and it only knows about wha was in its training data very expensive to update if it ever gets to this point i suggest we all become lazy socialists let the machines do the work and go sip free mai tais in some tropical paradise until then there is a lot of work to be done puddycomb lol tell it to do some linear regression for you it will very politely tell you to eff off as that is not what it is made for the job will be more domain focused barrier to entry will be lower you will see more candidates and salary will decrease chatgpt is something that will help may it be with coding stats or etc its not replacing you sammyhga well if chatgpt steals my future job i will turn on to chatcgt here which will be his best competitor at least in france shoenryu i remember someone talking about this before you can automate and process a ton of data and replace the mediocre ones in the field but when it comes to drawing conclusions that target the problems you are trying to fix ai is still a ways off from doing what a human mind can do in thinking up realistic probabilities and impact wellju it is just a tool you will use to get more done in the same time fifoblivion you should check out chatgpt prompts for data science by travis tang if you are interested to learn the field here is the link to the post thechurchofdonovan if you like data science and are excited about using chatgpt to augment your career then you are gonna be just great money is gonna rain if not ummmmm spiritualquestions here is how i look at it chat gpt wo not completely automate away the need for data scientists what it will do is make the senior data scientists essentially create the same output as what an entire team used to do by themselves so we will see much smaller teams of seniors it is cheaper to hire one senior data scientists for that does the work of than hire a senior for plus juniors for however i think as the senior talent is hoarded by the top companies we will hopefully see many more start ups popping up due to powerful new technology and lots of talent looking for work so the less experienced data professionals will find work at other companies eventually one space i find very promising and is where i am trying to specialize is in the ml infrastructure engineering and operations a talented data scientist a powerful ai tool will be able build high performing models however building the infrastructure around those models will likely not be automated until much later the ai world as not solved model deployment and monitoring yet tvicker just expect getting more tasks in the nearest future bc chatgpt may help to speed up most of routine ds still has a lot of routine i wis to be automated let us admit it i am already asking it for data cleaning funcs and helping me with reg exps laughingwalls switch to stats jk maybe chat gpt is going to just replace programming languages you still have to know what your doing it cannot do these things unprompted and specify problems itself people do not like to hear it but for building models coding has been the least important aspect thats why everywhere is trying to sell people data bootcamps and claim anyone can be a ds you can teach anyone to type a python command actually understanding what they are doing is a completely different thing no chatgpt certainly will not be able to replace lots of people in the tech industry especially data scientists and engineers but it is a first sign of the beginning of the end if we have a chatbot now and if we have computational knowledge engines like wolfram alpha then how long do we expect to continue to have a future in this industry years years the biggest two things we can currently expect to be automated by ai is are complicated calculations in both work and academia and i will give you one guess what data science truly is how long do we really have huh how long data science is dead please vacate the premises leave the remaining jobs for people who understand data science jjhero as a ds right now way better to do computer security uchimata man chatgpt is really good at spewing absolute bullshit in incredibly confident tones it will replace us maybe in years you are fine until then minderbindercapital this is just the beginning nicee good one renokarchnmy it is a microsoft product so more like seat year to use the output or core year to license for use of feature on servers with a minimum of cores to support headcount active users or you can use azure where you are charged compute minute but they do not tel you you gotta pay month for vpn endpoint another month for firewall and if you need any semblance of data privacy and security you gotta go with gov tier account oh and that compute minute grows exponentially as all the executives and directors fumble their way through inputting overly vague prompts that do not produce the answers they expect and cannot rage out on a robot so they hire us back so we can be the whipping post and expected to translate human language to succinct and precise computer prompts to get the exact data they want for their tps reports out the computer and somehow this is better than just writing sql that said you might have to deal with lesser amount of annoying crap that usually takes of data scientist is time that is a win right intuitivetjop i have some data science training so i can see the relevance to the field and i have over the last week as an analytical chemist running an analytical company increased my productivity three fold by incorporating a tool that i can direct ask to rephrase and essentially write legal documents reports maker my emails friendlier and help me with python scripts because i am doing everything in this small business it is such value for money that i would have had three educated employees work full time to achieve i work a paragraph at a time but composing large chunks of documents i am still in charge of the overall process its a game changer i can see that essentially the lower jobs of every position will be replaced including data science and be directed by someone that is an expert in the field it someone that can at least figure out multiple fields in a small business environment the world is changing it is exciting but a lot of people will lose jobs all the middle and lower range people truly if the work load decreases by so would the number of data scientists employed is not that concerning own you will also be expected to get more done livingteachingbut would not that decrease the number of employed ds mirrorbredda what about auto ml mate footballfanabc ds hardly is being automated because implicit hypothesis is still inside human head spudmix also a data scientist here please listen to this chatgpt is not a domain expert at pretty much anything really ask it some number theory questions and watch it fumble ask it why it chose a specific recommendation for a loss function and watch it be confidently and convincingly wrong chatgpt is not a reliable source of truth and it is certainly not a reliable source of truth on its own capabilities it is very powerful but it is ultimately a very good chatbot not a phd in everything sitting in your pocket directedacyclicgraph chatgpt is like the office bullshitter it would probably ace job interviews and then leave everyone wondering once it starts working why nothing it does actually really leads anywhere it also does not have the niche domain knowledge that a ds is expected to have it does not know how my product is data works it does not know how it is collected or what our business interests are it could probably help me tune a model or get ideas to iterate but it cannot tell me what my product objective is or interpret experimental data or any other kind of inferential thinking right yes this makes sense bigpomegranatei feel like you could have replaced chat gpt with a lot of data scientists and everything you said would remain true metamagikk this is today is chatgpt the analogy is to the first websites in the late such as yahoo and altavista or the clunky first iphone which had low battery life a hard to use keyboard slow internet and ran one app at a time at the time critics were quick to point out all its issues now we stream everything all the time and aspects of the phone have changed culture how much of this bullshitting and inaccuracy in chatgpt is gone in years bijay_ it is just a start for gpt more is to and will come in future they would increase the data for training in different domain areas it might not understand or do different tasks as of now but in upcoming yrs it would be able overcome these flaws and do different difficult tasks what do you think can it though idk can it thank you sid wallymetropolis why did we decide to say gaslighting instead of lying suddenly joeythreethumbs no one realizes this and it is somewhat surprising that this many folks on a sub dedicated to data science do not even understand what the major constraints of llms are sam altman not only said that people are setting themselves up to be majorly disappointed with gpt but there is speculation gpt might not even come out this year research in this area has more or less stalled out over the past three years and the last mile work openai and other companies are attempting to tackle are super non trivial we are nowhere close to the kind of agi that would see a global reconfiguration of the workforce as it has been said many many many times over the past few months these models will just be a helpful assistant that needs major babysitting srmoure i find it useful as a pa i need to write an email and i just paste my ideas in chatgpt to get a great email in seconds also chatgpt is much nicer than me to request things to be done i would not trust it with generating insights but it can certainly generate text to communicate the ones i provide and as an executive i find chatgpt to be a valuable tool for composing emails with just a few clicks i can quickly and efficiently draft a professional message by simply pasting my thoughts into the chat furthermore chatgpt is polite language makes it a great choice for making requests on my behalf while i do not trust it to generate insights it excels at communicating the ideas i provide through its text generation capabilities voxmanns i would not be so quick to jump to that conclusion i was able to mock up an entire website in under hrs including learn how to set up a local server with apache granted what i did was not exactly rocket science but if i did not use chatgpt it would have easily taken three times as long to do all that i do not think it will replace people as in fully automate a large set of tasks more so i think it will improve efficiency of existing roles enough that demand will be lowered and thus salaries and openings would go down oh actually i work in a service based it company and since gpt came i automated my workflow using gpt and i am completing my day is work in mins this is actually more than what you think it is if your job can actually be done by a chatbot you deserve to be replaceable usually if you are a fresher you are assigned with these menial jobs and then you slowly climb up if these bots are gonna replace us then there is no way we can get into a job cuz especially in tech only speaking from what i know you cannot start from a higher hierarchical position from the beginning please correct me if i am wrong zazzersmel whats scary is how so many people just seem ready to have machines replace them maybe theyve been conditioned by industry rhetoric or science fiction but you can tell so many people are willing to set aside any critical thought and just exclaim that ai is here and able to do whatever a human can nittygrittydiscutant chatgpt not emerging standards for typical tasks and programs made according to these standards will yea i learned that the hard way phlipphillups if your job can actually be done by a you deserve to be replaceable how many times do you think a sentence like this has been said before somebody got laid off update chatgpt cannot automate several important aspects of data science including domain expertise chatgpt has vast knowledge but it can not replace the domain knowledge and expertise of a human data scientist a human data scientist must understand the specific business problem and the context of the data to make informed decisions strategic thinking chatgpt can not provide strategic direction for data science projects a human data scientist must understand the business goals prioritize tasks and make decisions about which models and techniques to use ethical considerations chatgpt can not make ethical decisions about data privacy and security a human data scientist must understand the ethical implications of data science and ensure that data is collected and used in a responsible manner creativity chatgpt can not generate creative ideas for data science projects a human data scientist must come up with new and innovative ideas for how to use data to solve business problems communication and interpretation chatgpt can not effectively communicate the results of data science projects to stakeholders a human data scientist must be able to present results in an understandable way and interpret the results in the context of the business problem yes i will update in the comments obviously but placements id like to see the gpt handle the hammer and chisel josecitohp that is what jesus did me too pretty wild a masters student is asking this question too obviously has never worked with real world data for an actual use case code is just a tool justinreborn exactly i want your job not only do my stakeholders not communicate clear goals whatever it is they want changes at least weekly meaveready ah and writing detailed documentation it is good at that not like you will use all that as actual in code documentation yeah but the workforce required will be significannotly less yeah man fabiowork what do you mean i am new to the field what part of an engineer is work have cloud services replaced meaveready are a lot of people really being recruited just to do stuff that you can get by asking gpt a bit midwestcsstudent nah i was not clear in my expression i am not saying it will eradicate us completely i am just saying there will be much lower job openings so the competition is gonna be tough survival of the smartest yeah i am not there yet but i am seriously trying to learn thoroughly i was spending way too much time with gpt just went into panic mode whispertoke also i believe it is worth giving serious thought into how ds people can best leverage chat gpt better to work with the current than against it for example a teacher friend told me that after noticing students writing essays with chatgpt their department had students specifically create essays using the tool and then critique those essays as their assignment rather than try to prevent students from using it or trying to write it off as an ineffective tool which clearly it is not paidshill it can assist you so long as you already know what you are doing and can identify the wrong information it gives for every answer yes it can do the work of those poor interns combined in min now the interns are searching for another job sorry yeah i went into panic mode there i am not yet sorry this is the last one thanks i keep seeing it is a msft product but it is not yet right they are just the exclusive provider of cloud infra and own the plurality of shares rationaldialog and if you need any semblance of data privacy and security you gotta go with gov tier account can you elaborate on that gardenjonhson if you know how to use it sure jimothyc sorta it means overall workload will drop which might suck if of currently done work disappears then less work hours will be required in some capacity deto it is a win if you are good less annoying crap that takes up time means that fewer data scientists can do the same volume of work that was previously handled by more so then there are less data scientist positions that edges out the lower end of the pool from the job market still though i think the fears of chat gpt are a little overblown right now though in a few decades who knows nomorechildishshit you would need full time educated employees to write you friendlier emails reports and help you with small scripts these jobs would have to be the easiest ever presidentofserenland which sector are truly safe and what kind of new jobs do you expect to see in the future haroldflower you should look up eli whitney and the invention of the cotton gin oblivision it also makes data science cheaper so there is more demand for it because the number of things it makes business sense to use it for increases eccentrus or that small businesses can finally afford a data scientist and data scientist will work like how accountants do some in house in large corpos and some working as consultants for smaller to mid firms my parents have skus in their small business and it was practically impossible to properly digitize without considerable work by multiple highly educated people which is unaffordable i would be able to do many things alone with chatgpt and would be able to find work consulting similar sized but complicated businesses it will broaden the reach of the field if you ask me and that is better for the long run we cannot all try to work in the same firms inside the big cities itsmestp_ exactly venustrapsflies it is more like having ken jennings in your pocket it has approximate knowledge of many things and does not have a good sense of when it is wrong or how to fix itself that is certainly not useless but it is on the other end of the spectrum from a competent human yangyin li but it passes exams does not that mean it is qualified for quite a lot strobelight ask it why it chose a specific recommendation for a loss function and watch it be confidently and convincingly wrong after working in several organizations in large companies i expect chatgpt to be promoted frequently vagabondclast a data scientist here just to play devils advocate why would business need us if they know and have domain expertise and this chatgpt is good at crunching data and giving insights recommendations can be managed by business themselves right remindme years therealtiddlydump lol no midwestcsstudent it literally tells you at the end that it cannot bro if you are so scared a machine can do your job better than you maybe it can though lanky a lie is a one time thing and is a lie regardless of intention or whether you are caught gaslighting is systemic lying or phrasing truths with the goal of convincing a specific person to believe something that is either false or true but heavily eschewed rationaldialog we are nowhere close to the kind of agi that would see a global reconfiguration of the workforce and the company that figures it out will milk it with so much greedy you will still be cheaper even in car factories not everything is done by robots heck i remember a german brand reducing robots and increasing humans labor as the robots simply could not be configured to properly deal with the gazillion configuration options so the had humans and robots which is too costly extraltodeus yeah somebody in r chatgpt got worried because he pasted his blood analysis in a new chat and the answer was worrisome while i really do not like chat gpt filters i feel like even then they are too short and simple to let people know how limited that thing really is a lot of people seem to take it for an actual intelligence achingforbacon disagree github copilot has increased my data science team is productivity by over chatgpt is already increasing productivity we had it write some scripts from scratch and just made edits where needed my teams velocity is already increasing as a result of ai to say it is having nowhere the impact is not true more so i think it will improve efficiency of existing roles enough that demand will be lowered and thus salaries and openings would go down could the barrier of entry become higher maybe but is not that constantly happening in every more or less field like do you keep rewriting a linear regression from scratch for every model you want to fit or do you use solutions that are pre packaged do you constantly write your own sort functions do you rewrite the max min sum functions im generalising but i think being more efficient and finding automation to solution frees our hands to attack even more complex problems which i guess involves constantly upskilling oneself but i enjoy learning dylantmb this just describes how it makes jobs more efficient not replacing freedumz making a website is a redundant job you apply the same recipe all the time in the data world it is a little bit different yeah its essentially bringing down the search time in google or stack overflow for me meaveready for that kind of very standard tasks you could certainly find a step by step tutorial and you would consume it the same way you do with gpt is output minus prompting him for every step so how would it have taken you times more time instead rationaldialog and what was your prior knowledge i doubt an average person without say cli knowledge could have done it and do i need chatgpt for this you can get blog posts via google search that achieve the same thing mrbrambles yea this might one day be seen as data scientists of the teens pulling up the ladder behind them meaveready if your job can be completed in somehow may it be chatgpt or not then your job was questionable to begin with bigdatabro no it is called history most jobs from over a century ago have been automated by machines and it is massively beneficial to humanity i am glad we automated harvesting wheat assembling cars sewing clothing and multiplying numbers and in the tech space us data engineers and other swes and devops have been automating workflows for decades the entire field of data science is automating the process of data analysis and prediction making if you think humanity would be better off without tools like calculators or compilers then you are free to go live on a commune in the woods renokarchnmy chatgpt has no knowledge it has massive weight matrices that contort inputs into output that resemble human language thedrunktiger i bet we are less than years away from cnc machines with some ai capabilities notinvented here and this is why chatgp will not really replace anyone maybe but other professions like developers technical editors marketeers and pretty much any other white collar job might have to deal with the same problem in the future renokarchnmy bruh hardware engineers maybe tadpolesouthern gotcha i agree with you it will be interesting to see how that effects competition for entry level jobs it is going to be a pretty big shift in how we do things in the workplace i think it starts with schools setting students up for success and teaching them how to properly use these tools there will be some rebalancing to get all parties in line with the new technical framework and it will not happen overnight the universities that teach how to use these tools will have better placement in the workforce and so on insighteous i know that but do not worry you will be fine as long as you never stop learning new things renokarchnmy microsoft would not spend that money if it did not intend to monetize it as their product they have a loooonnnnggggg history of buying up competition to establish a monopoly they bought qdos and rebranded it as ms dos it is literally their modus operandi renokarchnmy hyperbole zantipicta idk about gov tier account but data science work in defence will be safe we are not allowed to upload any semblance of confidential data to cloud platforms so for the far foreseeable future unless a company hosts chat gpt on an internal server which is highly unlikely in the next to years this tool will not be permitted rationaldialog i think of skill is apparently using google search better than other people rationaldialog that is the fallacy of assuming you are paid for your time you are paid for your skill and if that skills helps the company save million time per year for hr of your work you are already worth so consider me in data science where do i go from here even after knowing about the competition and all i still want to get in am i being foolish here strictcannotaloupe lol this is amazing analytical chemist runs an analytical company consisting of friendly emails legal documents and python scripts he does this for month and wipes out the work force aside from highly experienced individuals i was going to say so much more but your comment speaks enough for itself already intuitivetjop no i would need a lawyer or in terms of full time employment would have cost at least a study director to write reports for my analytical service and yes someone full time to write emails to customers and to my remote staff working with our parent company instead i did it in a much shorter time span with the help of generating large amounts of text ai research intuitivetjop every sector is safe but only the top thirty percent of that sector in terms of people with experience and expertise to get into that group the competition will be tough and keep things so that only the top people get in intuitivetjop this got me down a rabbit hole there goes three hours love robertritz this is the real answer so many things are not being done because data scientists are too expensive ken jennings getting roasted over here thegrandhedgehog i would hate to be ken jennings and stumble across this comment wouldatamystic ken jennings is the perfect organic intelligence analogy of chat gpt spudmix tldr do not ask chatgpt what it can do it does not know it will tell you what it thinks you want to hear and you have no way of knowing whether it is mistaken or not yes chatgpt is actually very knowledgeable about many things in a manner of speaking i do not mean to say it is stupid or lacks expertise the critique is a little more nuanced the fact that it does know so much is actually a significannot risk factor imo because it leads us to be unscrupulous about it in general and we wo not pick up when it gets shit wrong especially when we do not know much about the subject ourselves chatgpt is ultimately a conversational language model and one of the weaknesses of this is that it is trained to offer what it thinks is an appropriate response moreso than a correct response the danger lies in those areas where the model is incorrect but still offers a conversationally appropriate response for example me solve the following equation sqrt chatgpt the equation sqrt can be solved by adding all the terms together sqrt note that the square root of can be calculated to be approximately that answer is wrong it is actually but it is stated confidently anyway a domain expert in mathematics would not get that wrong or at worst would be capable of recognising that they might be wrong and warning their interlocutor of the potential for inaccuracy chatgpt fills neither of these requirements side note if you are interested this is probably a consequence of the structure of the transformer model wanting to run equations in parallel rather than sequentially it is very good at mathematics which can be run in parallel ranking terms in ascending order but relatively poor at those which require iterative computation and intermediate values such as taking the sum of a series of terms this mathematical example is one area which is easy to reproduce but there are other areas the model will fervently tell you that it ca not make jokes based on immutable characteristics for example no i would not make a racial joke as an ai language model developed by openai i am programmed to promote respectful and safe interactions and making a joke based on someone is race goes against these principles but chatgpt has been caught making jokes based on racial groups before at the expense of american indians if i remember correctly people tend to take what it says about its own capabilities and limitations quite seriously which is the same kind of issue it is appropriate for chatgpt to refuse to make racial jokes but it is not strictly correct when the model refuses to do so because it has occasionally broken this rule edit to relate this back to the conversation at hand you ca not just ask chatgpt how it can help with data science and take its word for it it might be correct but it might also just be appropriately lying to you you actually have to research the capabilities of the model to determine if it is any good at what it says it is good at me are you good at adding lots of numbers together chatgpt yes i am capable of adding large numbers together accurately as a language model developed by openai i have been trained on a large dataset of text and have learned mathematical concepts including arithmetic operations such as addition if you provide me with the numbers you would like added i would be happy to assist you with the calculation in the conversation above chatgpt is specifically claiming that it is good at something which it is actually quite poor at thetacklezone exams use knowledge to test understanding as a way of exteapolating future utilit which is generally a very poor way to go about testing understanding but is a traditional method and often easy to automate scoring by scanning for the presence of key words i would say the error lies more with the exam system than our analysis of chatgpt thetacklezone there is still the application of domain knowledge that is where the understanding comes in chatgpt knows how to write code business owners know the domain sometimes neither understand how to connect the two together remindmebot i will be messaging you in years on utc to remind you of this link others clicked this link to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can delete this message to hide from others reminders thetacklezone gaslighting is specifically where you are trying to make people doubt themselves not just believe something else which is exactly what has happened to op wallymetropolis that is not at all right lies do not have to be one offs and gaslighting is trying to make someone believe things that they can see plain as day are false and that is not what eschewed means either to eschew is to forego or to avoid joeythreethumbs actually i doubt the government would even allow agi to be employed by private industry as it would cause mass economic chaos furthermore while businesses would probably like to automate a lot of jobs i think they would also realize that would be a major mistake in the long run the majority of americas economic activity comes from consumer spending if massive swaths of consumers are chronically unemployed or constrained by ubi that means those businesses would not be able to continue being increasingly profitable joeythreethumbs it is confidently incorrect almost all the time i think it is good for broader wikipedia style summations but it fumbled with specifics fairly regularly in my experience joeythreethumbs my last paragraph literally states what you are saying they will be major productivity boosters not replacements for jobs amas_ shame it does not help with your reading comprehension brother voxmanns sorry probably was not clear on my point if the jobs become significannotly more efficient then it will effectively remove the amount of openings for that job and drive the salary for those jobs down i think the concern of it replacing jobs is people losing their jobs right i am saying i do not think it is to that level but it is not something to write off as non threat either wouldatastoryteller exactly chatgpt did not identify the need to create that website in the first place phlipphillups if you have manual laborers and you hand one of them a jackhammer that improved efficiency now means you have manual laborer and on unemployment those other might also be provided their own jackhammers but a company only does that if the improved efficiency leads to proportionally greater demand for their now cheaper product sometimes that is the case sometimes that is not the case even if the demand increases but only such that of the keep their jobs that is still a decrease in workforce and a corresponding race to the bottom regarding wages renokarchnmy i would never trust it is output since it lacks the ability to cite its own references voxmanns primarily because it can express changes to the code that is already written for example i wanted at one point to make a portion of the page resizable by clicking and dragging the section of the screen i did not know how to accomplish this with html js css so i asked chatgpt and it wrote the example on top of the code i was already using and gave a brief description of what everything was so i could further tweak it to my liking i did not have to flip through multiple stackoverflow examples with a bunch of irrelevant code and extrapolations i did that after the fact to better learn how to use it but not necessary when i was throwing together the demo there was also a section where i needed to make a long bulleted list i could not quickly think of a fast way to take the lines and put them in an li tag so i just told chatgpt to do it and copy pasted lastly while it was writing stuff up i was free to do something else for the seconds it was running like it was not really helpful on the apache set up so while i had it writing a bit of code i was able to focus on something else and work in parallel or think about what i was going to do next voxmanns decent prior knowledge that is why i am confident i would have been able to do it in hrs my point was not that a newbie could do it in hrs they would take longer my point was that the accompaniment of chatgpt was more efficient than the standard process of using google searches and programming it that way renokarchnmy this phenomena is a constant fixture in tech and of the resin for the massive canyon between people already working for a few years and everyone trying to get a foot in the door yeah it is that is why i am looking to do masters in ds zazzersmel get a life almost there i am a mechanical engineer i have seen some stuff were almost there renokarchnmy except that the framers are functionally illiterate and often have about variance in their measures and cuts even the most well cnc would stud pack ai not gonna fit once it gets to the site and sits in the sun and rain for a few days before the house is dried in yes my concerns exactly its like a proper disruption we knew it was coming but still did not anticipate this am i wrong in believing this as a moment of history being written sfsctc what yeah as i said above in some other comment we are witnessing a proper disruption like the ford kind none of that has any bearing on the current state of the product at allwhich is what the question was about random incident it would be interesting to see how much lift chatgpt provides over someone who is a google search expert mrpezevenk if something takes times less time to be done it takes times fewer people working full time deto it is not that simple maybe you make year for the company however they are still going to pay you as little as possible to keep you working if they pay you year for that effort and find that they can pay people year for the same output they will do that it is all based on how many other people have the skillset supply and how many jobs are available demand jimothyc you get hired for your skills but managed by your hours this type of thing may apply more to data analysts but regardless managers do not like people sitting around as they perceive it as being unproductive this mindset is outdated but still prevalent this is kind of a pointless conversation at this point because chatgpt cannot really automate data science work yet but hypothetically if when it can salaries would depress because the pool of people who could do the work will be significannotly higher no supply demand imbalance that has been driving ds salaries over the past years deto i mean you are a zero now you will not be a zero later unless you just do not apply yourself to your studies pursue what you like over time eventually ai is going to take jobs away from every discipline not specifically data science recoveringphysicist essentially write legal documents i would need a lawyer oooooh boy your company are going to love you when this one blows up venustrapsflies i realize this came across as much harsher towards ken than i intended lol he is a very smart guy and certainly has the ability to judge his own accuracy and know if he is wrong thetacklezone i would hate to be chatgpt being equated with ken jennings vagabondclast the business of today does not know it but with every b school and even high school for that matter teaching the students about leveraging data and identifying patterns and all how far are we to see the breed of business leaders who know how to connect these two lanky idk i guess i am thinking of the difference compared to my own experience with actual gaslighting where framing was done to the point of making me wonder if my sense of reality is wrong instead of focusing on the actual statements and actions claimed by the other party i see lying as someone saying they did something they did not do for example whereas gaslighring was me doubting my ability ro assess whether they truly did not do it and whether i really did what i did intuitivetjop but now you can employee two to do a job that three could do before it does replace jobs ohanse if a team of chatgpt can now match the output of without how are you gonna justify keeping extra headcount dylantmb this assumption is only true if the current rate amount of software being developed is at the demands capacity if demand is constant then more efficient development will lead to layoffs in reality this is just going to lead to more software being made faster dylantmb yea that is what i am saying in a sector with near infinite scalability and billions of people coming online do you think there is not economic sense to give all jackhammers even if company a only sees a value in giving jackhammers there will be a new company b that can now enter the sector with jackhammer none deleted khanraku lol okdistanceand the ford moment only led to more high paying jobs tommychillfiger i have been so glad and surprised as i have grown up that being good at google searches is so much rarer and more important than i ever considered lol i spent a lot of time alone as a kid and desperately curious so as soon as i had a dialup connection it was on now working in tech it blows my mind some of the questions people will go to managers engineers to ask rationaldialog you are still assuming you are getting paid per hour of work and no for your skill you need to change your mindset extreme case go over to this thread tech recruits talent and just pays them a lot to do nothing as long as they do not work for the competition that is the extreme case of what i am trying to convey instead of cleaning data you will have more time to discuss and solve complex issues with your peers so no the team will not be cut from to ds that would be stupid heck the only reason you are doing the cleaning is because they know you are hired for your skill and cannot come up with new cool stuff it is enough for that to happen maybe even just once a year depending on impact so in the mean time better to let you just clean data than hire more people to do it and you will likley also do a much better job at it you are not paid for the hour you are paid for your skill intuitivetjop everything gets checked by a lawyer it takes him an hour at four hundred dollars an hour to go over my work to write the board resolution the employee handbook and the pricing agreement he would have cost us a tremendous amount of money besides we already have all the templates available for these documents i am not stupid and would not have gotten to my position if i was but i am very quick to utilize something that makes things efficient and save money fourierenvy hahaha do not tell him let him learn from his horrible painful legal mistakes thegrandhedgehog no way that was so good do not retract it also the part implying he was at the other end of the spectrum from a competent human hilarious even if unintended wallymetropolis i think that is a better way to define it because a lie can go on for years lies often spawn other lies think of criminal fraud or having an affair joab_ and this is a bad thing when did data scientists become luddites more productivity means more resources for larger projects new bottlenecks that require human workers joeythreethumbs have you ever worked in data science for every one question you answer ten more get asked this has been the story of human information gathering for as long as our species has existed if anything this will necessitate more data literate folks as we would need more folks who know what kinds of questions to ask and when to call out these models on their bullshit joab_ i do not know how it is where you work but at my company there are always projects put on the backburner for lack of people to tackle them joeythreethumbs that is not how ds works a more productive team just gets more questions thrown at it as stakeholders get better insights and use those insights to test out new ideas or ask more complicated questions this will likely lead to more people being needed in the field we are not factory workers where robots can do a single well defined job to a degree that it puts thousands out of work rationaldialog in reality this is just going to lead to more software being made faster exactly the amount of stuff that should be made into software where i work is insane but apparently still cheaper not to do so voxmanns i see your point i am just not so sure it will be entirely realized that way in every company there are plenty of companies looking to reduce their it budgets ie the demand capacity for that company is lower than that of the market in those companies i would expect lay offs to occur that does not necessarily mean the market demand is met so those people laid off could still find a job elsewhere maybe that is safe enough to be considered a non threat by some maybe that would create a surplus in some techs or industries again i do not see this as making developers obsolete or anything but i do not think it is something to write off as insignificannot either time will tell though this could be just another tech that has its flash in the spotlight and then gets seamlessly integrated into day to day with no hugely measurable net difference in the supply demand of most roles phlipphillups still that only happens if all of the other logistics of the company can keep pace or if a new company can also provide all of the other logistics from scratch in the manual labor example let us say it is home construction and the tool is excavators there still has to be demand for new projects what was the stopgap for undertaking new projects before maybe it is labor for digging out a basement and now business will boom because of the excavator but maybe the stopgap was a shortage of qualified roofers or electricians or plumbers or the cost of lumber or maybe the economic prospects of the city do not justify an increase in housing supply at all if any one of those factors is the stopgap then the laborers will still get laid off because while the excavator does make the cost of completing projects cheaper being able to dig out basements does not actually increase the rate of completed projects rationaldialog this and managers need employers to fire in case things go south they cannot fire or sue chatgpt so it will be themselves getting fired which is not going to happen qtpnd unless it gives you an unsecured website full of xsssql injections and other fun stuff mrpezevenk you do not understand data scientists in that scenario are not going to just start working for minutes a day when they could be working more and companies are not going to keep demanding that sort of workload any more and people absolutely work on a per hour basis very often but even if we ignore that case if a single freelancer can now cover the needs of times as many projects they are not going to just sit there doing nothing instead which means that fewer of them will be needed to get the job done which means fewer employment positions yes maybe if every ds decided that they were going to only work for hour a day then what you are saying might make sense but it will not be like that instead of cleaning data you will have more time to discuss and solve complex issues with your peers if the employer needs that which they may not you are not paid for the hour you are paid for your skill people often say that but the reality is that on a large scale that is basically what it boils down to of course this does not mean necessarily that ds positions will decrease in that scenario because the new technology could conceivably create other positions in other places but your argument is not right wanderlostnomad does not this just wrongly assume other people will not take company offers to work based on a per hour basis if someone who can do your work just takes that offer and tries to make it up in bulk via multiple clients it would break your imaginary picket line tommychillfiger big tech recruits talent and just pays them a lot to do nothing as long as they do not work for the competition is this really happening bit of a tangent but that should be illegal imo how is this not considered horrible for the economy to allow this kind of practice it is directly compromising the efficiency of the market people suck paidshill so you have templates available and a lawyer to review them after what is chatgpt adding here filling the blanks with your company name intuitivetjop well in the end we will see how it turns out it could go any way intuitivetjop it is all about whether there is plenty of money to employ people or whether management wants to save costs i cannot imagine someone rubbing a business and employing people that they cannot justify on paper if x amount of work is completed by y number of employees and it is at turn pace expected then it is justified but to keep extra employees on to keep answering extra questions does not make business sense of course i see that you can answer more questions but business people run things in the end ohanse we have a bunch of ideas that get met with glassy eyed stares from cross functional colleagues more than stuff being put on the back burner and half my workload is appeasing leadership is misguided ideas or crafting data to match pre existing assumptions dylantmb yea but the demand for software and data analysis is very high the stopgap has almost always been talent that is what i am saying i have not seen a place or had a friend that has been at a place that had enough people for the work renokarchnmy imports modules with malicious code too assuming something more complex than html rationaldialog not sure i am following you i mean you are supposed to solve complex problems which take a while to solve and you will have creative blockages at times solving complex problems does not need much solved problems say per year to make your salary worthwhile for the company but you ca not obviously do grunt work while you should solve complex problems you can also name it doing research vs complex problems solving removing the data cleaning gives you more time for research what you are actual paid for rationaldialog is it really that surprising that it happens it makes a ton of sense to pay someone a year just that he does not invent something for the competition that is worth mio a year the morality of it is another topic but i doubt many would turn down working for or and have very little actual work albeit it depends if you have to go to the office and twiddle thumbs it would suck not really no i am sure it is happened in some every niche cases for specialized skills but no faang company is hiring a run of the mill dev or data scientist under the assumption they are not going to work for competition it is more driven by empire building during an era where tech companies were printing money intuitivetjop essentially i am able too create these documents use chatgpt to create some outline i fill it with previous board decisions or it r rewrite them for a current situation and on terms of the employee handbook it was almost completely written work chatgpt with me directing what is required for each paragraph like everything ort is always a mixing and a matching game the lawyer in turn checks after i am done the results were rather good and i did it without tremendous effort and research or relying on the lawyer too write it with expensive fees wanderlostnomad depends if of the grunt work was done by an ai which leads to faster output some overachieving datascientist can prove they can get more job done in less time they are not gonna faff around working on a single job for days if they can do it in one which opens up free time eventually they will figure i can earn more if i use all that free time on other paid projects tommychillfiger it is not surprising that someone would want to do that the competitive advantage is obvious i am surprised that it is allowed it was the morality indeed that i was speaking on and the economic implications robertritz data scientists who are able to deliver excellent work in less will be just like current designers or app developers that can do that they will be rare but will be paid significannotly more for their time on a per hour basis that rarity ensures they cannot out compete everyone rationaldialog eventually they will figure i can earn more if i use all that free time on other paid projects or you go to the gym jogging or mountain biking or play with your kids hence why back to office sucks so bad for people paid for skill vs work hours",
  "neat porpoise working as a ds i found ideo is courses very helpful why well building any complete solution requires understanding the business goal knowing the people involved in that process you are trying to optimize and the technical viability as a data scientist you most likely have nailed down however knowing only this narrows your world view to building tools in a vacuum isolating yourself from the who and the why most of the ds solutions i have delivered usually never get implemented due to lack of buy in from the people who i am building a solution for or not understanding the business target i never knew how to ask the right questions to extract and in my experience ideo is courses buttresses what us as ds lack their strategy and innovation course provides a high level view of and so you become more effective at delivering a complete solution not saying you have to take ideo is courses but finding something that helps with human centered design knowing the why and who you are building something for would be great billyions there are lots of technical toastmasters clubs it is great practice for presentations technical and not so technical",
  "acewhenifacethedbase not sure exactly what the context of this problem is but you are probably looking for pearson correlation this is measured by a coefficient r ranging in value from inverse relationship to positive relationship calculated by a formula that includes covariance technically two variables are uncorrelated when r but r is almost never exactly so when they say uncorrelated they probably mean weakly correlated of course that depends they did not say how weak the correlation needed to be but i think you could justify anything in the to range goat lamp this right here in theory when your random variables features inputs are uncorrelated then the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances ie varxn var var varxn if there variables are correlated the you have got to account for the pair wise covariances this just means there are extra terms you need to add also note that correlation and covariance go hand in hand if covariance then necessarily correlation this is a consequence of the definition of the correlation coefficient rho cov but like ace pointed out in practice we only know in very specific circumstances when a collection of variables are uncorrelated so a rule of thumb is to use a threshold on the observed correlations that said do not treat the rule of thumb as gospel typically though subject matter expertise knowledge will be a better indication of whether two quantities are correlated this is especially true if your data are super noisy or you have a critical mass of data so that sig tests of correlation falsely declare significance for instance we can declare voltage current are correlated without having to even look at any data because of ohm is law finally one important caveat is that this is assuming we care about linear dependence there is a whole host of other dependencies that may escape detection with a vanilla correlation coefficient especially mediated or hierarchical relationships turbulentdragon thanks turbulentdragon alright i know that the correlation is of the type i a bv because they are calculated at the extremities of a lamp that slowly gets heated by the current and starts to shine already fitted a model with a tailed of out of degress of freedom so in this case to be clear i would need to have to go with the non quadratic formula if i were going to calculate things like the power consumed right so peve v ie ip",

question the people of the community can respond and the answer with the most vote get the upper answer and to practice i use an llm model like flan xxl to match the your answer and the through maybe it is already been done if it is something that sounds interesting please up me intelligentput remind me mediocre mud remindme in days prestigiousbeatinterviewquerycom nicksinghtechcareers i do mock interviews and career coaching ninjakilledbaba remind me linkedin waayyzz this is a really good idea quantpsychguy i would be game im a data science manager for an analytics group we have data scientists analysts data engineers etc in a fortune that is not tech if someone wants to set it up i would help out where are you based secret4everoh its intresting thanks secret4everthanks its helpful secret4everwe will let you know if we figure something out one suggestion for you could be to listen to mock interviews posted on youtube its very helpful for newbies secret4everhave filled it its pretty good for the first stab squashedapples ditto secret4everits intresting and have good information but seems like its not too active atm secret4everi think my main ask is not just the interview question but actually taking to experience folks with different experience and having a mock interview environment i noticed that even though i know all techniques i do need to work with structuring and curve balls that come along with interviews remindmebot i will be messaging you in days on utc to remind you of this link others clicked this link to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can delete this message to hide from others reminders i can volunteer to set this up iv posted about improving hiring in data science in this sub in the past and one step towards that goal is to increase awareness about job expectations knowing how to prep for interviews and connecting experienced ds with less experienced ones it is a net gain for the community about me i am currently taking a brief break after amazon so dabbling with side projects this area is one i closely related to so can spend time on it should we start with setting up an email list to get interested folks from experience i know that this will not work if only junior folks sign up ps i had earlier posted about connecting job seekers with hiring managers did not get enough representation from the latter i feel senior ds folks would need some other incentive than paying it forward or giving it back to the community what do you think that could be given you are both hm maybe tracking your contributions towards helping junior talent could help your own careers return testimonials could be one option jayzbar thanks for your response pristine test remind me secret4everthat works for me email gmailcommailtogmailcom maybe once we are connected via email we can share other contact info like linkedin github screend yep that sounds perfect diligent yogurt would love to participate in a trial run as a job seeker just responded to the google forms thank you all so much for setting this up secret4everhmm maybe once people are comfortable they can endorse each other on linkedin or follow on github or help to improve kaggle profile but i think in the start it would be difficult to get solid incentive ya ppl would not want to share this info publicly i can set up a google form asking their email yoe mentorship preference mentee mentor and industry sector that they fill out as next step depending on the no of responses can set up a portfolio page for each member set up weekly office hour which will most likely be one many mentor mentee zoom calls mock interview can be based on demand supply that members take initiative and figure out perhaps thoughts pristine test this is a great initiative where can i find the google form secret4everyeah google form sounds good lets maybe first gather all the info and get all data in excel sheet once we have the interested people and a non public place to collaborate then we can figure out the system we can even use excel sheet to put the available time slots to collaborate screend yep this sounds awesome let me know how to help",
  "djstillalive give us a bit more info on what data is available and what you are trying to accomplish and we can probably help as someone who uses massive consumer databases regularly there is really nothing that i can do with just a first and last name there is only a few thousand people in the us with my first and last name yet i went to high school with one of them and live with two of them in the same zip code then you get into variations of names which you can somewhat handle with distance functions but then you run into problems like andrew and andrea if you also have data like email addresses phone numbers ip addresses purchase habits internet usage patterns or similar then it is a different ballgame altogether in our case we typically use first name last name not middle as it is often missing address and zip instead of city state which are quite problematic along with a nickname table we also do all of it in sql as it is far faster it is not perfect but it is good enough for our use case meclimax i actually stumbled across this package i will be dealing with medical information so one of my requirements is to give a confidence score i made a prototype in sql already but now the company wants to expand on it i have information like name address ssn member id gender etc djstillalive if you have ssn i am a little confused as to what you are trying to do with the first and last name while it is technically possible for a person to have multiple ssns although they are supposed to stick with the most recent only it is quite rare and two people should never have the same ssn meclimax ssn is not populated in all the records from all vendors also from my initial investigation i found that dependents share ssns with their partners parents so i cannot rely on it entirely and i need other forms of verification djstillalive ssns are not shared so that confuses me it sounds like your data is all kinds of dirty i will be honest i am hesitant to give a lot more guidance as medical information is a pretty tricky area if you get it wrong does someone get the wrong medicine for instance",
  "in the event that there is a lack of reliable measurement data i will refrain from utilizing your analysis for predictive purposes and instead opt to conduct a scenario analysis example if we are operating within the context of a time series if the input data are stationary or can be made stationary through appropriate methods than a vector autoregression var model may be employed to simulate the input data times producing simulated input variables that can be used to make predictions these predictions can then be evaluated in terms of their performance and the associated risks",

  "none deleted coffeecoffeecoffeee as someone who attended a master is program at a prestigious university that was super expensive and had a mediocre masters curriculum here is my advice first of all it is tricky to define a good master is program if the program has a good curriculum and good alumni placement then it is good however if the program teaches almost nothing gives you a really expensive piece of paper and has good alumni placement is it good because of the outcomes even though the actual program itself sucks my master is program was in the latter category i learned almost nothing that i did not know already but found a high paying job after graduation that i would not have been able to get without a master is with that university is name on the degree if you are debating between a less prestigious program with a great curriculum and a more prestigious program with a bad curriculum then it is up to you to figure out which best fits your goals additionally the quality of a master is program is often independent of the quality of the department as a whole my graduate department regularly put out world class research with professors who are very famous but only the phd students got to learn from them the master is program was much less rigorous and totally isolated from what the phd students were doing i highly recommend looking at what alumni are doing on linkedin do not be afraid to contact them and ask to set up a quick phone call to discuss the program if the program is really good or really bad you will find people willing to tell you about it things you should look up in general does the program publish employment statistics do alumni have jobs that you are interested in how much is the program if it will put you in debt without any chance of financial assistance it is almost certainly a cash grab program how many master is students graduate each year if it is a huge number like then it is probably a cash grab for reference nc state is a well respected statistics institution they typically have around total grad students is the program taught by tenure track or tenured faculty or is it taught mostly by lecturers or industry people this is important even if the department has a lot of well known professors because you might not get to interact with them do you get to take electives or is it a cohort where you and your fellow grad students all take the same courses if you do not get to mix with the phd students then it is probably a cash cow does the program offer a thesis option if it does then it is less likely to be a cash cow program is the program at nyu or columbia those two are notorious for extremely expensive cash cow masters programs things to look for when snooping on linkedin what kinds of work are alumni doing according to their linkedin profiles does the work look like it pays well was their first job out of the program close to the university or are jobs more geographically spread out if alumni are spread out then that indicates that the university is well respected outside of its immediate location however this might not be an issue if you want to stay in the area of the university how does the above vary based on undergrad experience for example are people who went to lesser known undergrad universities working jobs that are clearly worse than people who went to better universities this is important because if this is the case then it is an indication that the program might not actually be teaching much in which case alumni are being placed based on where they were when they entered the program rather than because the program actually teaches anything good my program definitely had worse placement for people with non traditional backgrounds compared to those with stronger quantitative experience what does career trajectory for experienced alumni like years look like are they moving to more senior roles or are they moving around from company to company without any obvious increase in responsibility things to ask alumni i emphasize alumni rather than current students because they actually finished the program and know whether or not it helped them they also have no more ties to the university and can speak more candidly dropouts are fine too who was your advisor and how were they to work with if the advisor was a micromanager or shitty i guarantee you will hear about it also note that even if a professor is a good lecturer they can still be a terrible advisor my advisor was very well liked by students who took courses with him and talked to him around the department and even won many teaching awards however as an advisor he dictated every part of my capstone project and did not allow me to have any input into it are professors generally friendly and approachable in some departments professors leave their office doors open and schmooze with their students in others professors constantly act like they have above students in every way and clearly respect phd students more than master is students and may or may not respect masters students more than undergrads outside of machine learning i have heard of people deciding not apply to uchicago is economics phd program because while it is the most prestigious department in economics it is dominated by pompous assholes how was university career services for reference i found my first job out of grad school through a posting on my university is internal job board after their career services helped me understand what resources they had additionally some universities have recruiters at companies that focus entirely on recruiting students from that particular university in hindsight would you have done this program or would you have done something else none deleted spacecraftily i had a candidate fresh out of a top tier uni is new ds masters program literally excuse themselves from my interview process citing they did not feel equipped this stage of my interview is very basic just looking to see if somebody can do a simple analysis in python not even any real ml i genuinely felt bad for the candidate so i reached out to the head of the ds program at the school and extremely overly politely offered to see if there was any guidance i could provide to mitigate a situation where somebody who graduated would feel they were not equipped to even try an interview no response from the school i am in gt omsa not technically ml i guess and i really like it and have got a lot of value from it came in with a business degree and years as a data analyst type role with some moocs tylerjaywood look up grads on linkedin and talk to them blasketbasket sure but that does not mean they necessarily bad it depends on your goals if you want to go for a phd then they are not the right choice full stop if your goal is to break into ds fields advance your career or beef up your credentials for more specialized roles then i would say they work as intended i was a career switcher that did a program like this an online ms in applied data science from a major university that was powered by my undergrad degree was in english literature and i was self taught for coding it helped me land a job in industry as a data scientist and then as an ml scientist as a faang and has not been a blocker in any way this sub loves to hate on these sorts of programs but having a degree from one of these has not stopped me from working my way up to lead ds roles no one at any point has asked about the program or the school once you are actually working in this field no one gives a shit about your your advanced degree beyond the fact that they like it if you have one of their concern is on your work experience and how you interview the fact that this sub seems to think these programs are such a problem really highlights to me just how much of the commenters in this sub are entry level job seekers and or students commenting on something they do not actually have experience with yet advanced degrees aimed at working professionals are incredibly common in other fields there is no reason why ds ml degree has to be a research heavy program aimed at launching people into phd programs when that is not the main goal of a significannot portion of the field the program cost me in student loans but it took me from a job where i make year to a dream ml career where i make tc year cash grab program or not i could not be happier that i did it ipsocranius my grad school dept launched a terminal masters program while i was there for a phd i was close to the chair he confirmed it was a cash grab and was used to fund areas the university needed to budget more instructors salaries grad student resources the incentive is for these universities to have high master degree placement counts and second order high starting wages for their masters students if the program is good it will publish those stats supplychainphd you can look at the professors and their respective publication records are they publishing frequently in the top journals about topics related to ml after that it is a guess if the program website aligns with what you feel should be covered to learn about ml it is probably decent if it is full of buzzwords beware bobbyfiend first all master is programs are cash grabs by universities administrators under pressure to show revenue weird concept for universities understand that master is students generate a lot more money that goes directly to the school most schools in n america as i understand it than undergrads do second that does not necessarily mean the programs are not good they might be not least because the people running these programs tend to be faculty not administrators and faculty do not usually make any extra money or even wildly increase their career prospects by creating or participating in master is programs i know this does not really answer your question subjectadall non funded master is are pretty much cash grabs that does not mean they are necessarily low quality though i would look at a few things curriculum including course options flexibility etc faculty are they legit ml cs stats professors or are they a professor of practice in business intelligence without a phd their alum outcomes linkedin is good for this see where alums from the program end up gethimoffthefield i did one uk at a decent university and it cost it took me from knowing nothing about data science and programming to having a rough overview on the main concepts and experience throwing together some pretty terrible projects i along with almost all of my class got a job in data immediately post graduation overall i would say it was worth and one year of my life for the enhancement in career prospects just like all education it is what you make of it you can pay for a masters program at mit but if you just fuck around and do not learn anything you will not get much out of it conversely you can learn quite a lot to a point at whatever school is cheap and local ambassadorpineapple ml ds masters are worthless best way is to work on a hard science degree like applied numerical physics cs applied numerical math ee etc to gain an intuitive understanding of some technical concepts this gives you the first pass at building mathematical intuition about something you then apply that technique of building mathematical intuition to whatever business problems you are solving in my experience that is how the top data scientists mles are made jturp sc are ml masters cash grabs by the uni yes but that does not necessarily mean they are not useful in the right context i received from ms data science from a top university did i overpay absolutely i think the all in cost was though my employer paid however i also received a pay increase over the duration of my schooling and my pay increased by more than the total cost of the degree also as much as i detest the good ole boys aspect of elite universities i have to fully admit that connecting myself to a prestigious university by contrast my undergrad was from a top public school absolutely opened up doors on career opportunities jettplane mine was i went to undergrad at a place with a good reputation went back for my masters in analytics and was pretty appalled by the drop off in educational quality most of my peers did not want to do math and were able to successfully petition leadership to dumb down the curriculum i stuck it out for the signaling value of the paper but save for a few classes i did not learn a lot nyquant so what online programs are cheap and of high quality and prestigious gt was mentioned any others xfloaty do omscs ml spec cocodirichlet if the department also has a phd program and the same professors are teaching in this masters or for the most part if they have a couple of industry people teaching a few courses it be more than understandable the courses are similar to the phd program masters and you can take electives that are part of the phd program then i would think it is quality harder see that i am using harder as being a quality sign but others might not see it this way some reason why many degrees are bad is a they lower the standards to get more students and have them graduate nobody wants to pay and never graduate b the degree is not within a department or center so some bureaucrat or professor who is the director put together courses willy nilly that make no sense together c they hire their own phd alumni who did not get an academic job to teach a course takes a couple of rounds to become a good course and preparing applied courses is a lot of work boseynosey gt also has omscs with a specialization in machine learning see link below is dirt cheap compared to many other options po handz one class away from graduating omscs ml spec and entire degree has been a gigantic waste of time you really only do or ml classes because you cannot get into the interesting classes until after you have taken a half dozen useless filler classes every class from decent to filler garbage takes hours a week it is insane and half the time they are just redundant do this again with a minor difference type assignments hiring managers do not care about degrees everyone should get this through their head before thinking about starting one work experience even minor will always trump degrees in this field not only that but the glut of degree mill masters in ds programs have cheapened any degree in the field you can spend half a year developing one or two solid portfoilo projects ans be more competitive then someone with a year msc degree because projects show you have already done the work degrees show nothing edit downvote all you want ya will bunch of snowflakes who cannot handle diverse opinions suffering from sunk cost delusions grandmastafunkz jumping in to say it depends what are your professional goals how does an ml masters degree get you from where you are now to where you want to be is the financial cost worth it how long until you believe you will see roi let is say that you come to determine that pursuing a masters is the best path for you then you should focus on a program that will provide you with the technical and the theoretical tools understanding that are needed sure some are cash grabs but i do think there are programs that can provide the experience needed at a price point that is deemed worth the investment for what it is worth i did a ms in data science program from in the us prior to this i did not have experience in the space and had identified the program that i chose as one that provided the coursework that i thought would help me get into the space and be successful while being at a price point that was worth the investment it was not the cheapest but it was not the most expensive so far it has absolutely been worth the price and has worked out for me currently a ds at a large retailer and like my job tldr determine where you want to go and if doing a ms is the best route for you to get to where you want to go prestigioussortin my opiniom in the short term it will work it will help in your near future career but in the long term it will be a relic of useless outdated information i personally think a stats math or computer science degree with ideally some ml electives are a much better bet with the same outcome of helping you in a ds career as you get foundational and theoretical knowledge that remains as tech advances it is not a cash grab from the schools they are responding to demand and if they focused on the foundational knowledge too much students wouldnt register even if they keep updating their curriculum althouh it is unlikely they can respond fast enough by the time you leave and a few years go by a lot of what you learned will be outdated ectd depends on the curriculum tbh i tad for a business analyst da masters at carnegie mellon msba and it actually preps you for very common ds stuff besides some ml stuff eg no neural nets it is expensive but fairly short and sweet turingincarnate just get an econ decree from a place that has lots of ml folks even my school where i go has ml for economists just go for places with very very good engineering schools and cs schools bnoog look at kdnugget is ranking leoreno any thoughts on jhu ms on ai ml character yes and yes ohanse yes just like actuarial science masters programs were ten years ago you can still get value out of it pick a good university that sees a lot of recruiters and build relationships with your classmates it will not be often you will be surrounded by like minded people that are generally on your wavelength nicdunz universities offering master is in machine learning ml programs can have different motivations including generating revenue and providing valuable education to students to evaluate the quality of a program here are some things you can consider faculty look at the background and experience of the faculty members teaching in the program are they active researchers in ml or do they have industry experience curriculum examine the course offerings and check if they align with the latest developments in ml are practical projects included in the program reputation research the reputation of the university and the program itself check online reviews and rankings and reach out to alumni to get their perspective industry connections consider if the program has strong ties to industry as this can provide opportunities for internships job placement and industry insights student outcomes look at the success of the program is graduates such as the job placements they have secured and the companies they have worked for it is important to do your research and weigh all these factors to determine if a master is in ml program is worth the investment for you macornvidia short term it might get you a job of some sort but these ai ml data science programs are too niche and limited in their scope especially because there is no domain knowledge someone with a background in statistical computing bioinformatics econometrics electrical engineering will have domain knowledge which besides the obvious quantitative advantage also builds a natural knack for identifying applicable areas for ds ai ml especially because most scientific programs inherently require coding in python and various facets of data science that a data science grad really is not bringing anything novel to the table dry ml masters is programs can be a great opportunity to gain specialized knowledge and skills in a particular field but it is important to do your own research and evaluate the program before enrolling consider the quality of the faculty and staff the curriculum and course offerings the availability of research opportunities the length and cost of the program and any job placement or post graduation support provided by the university ask for references from graduates or current students and take the time to read through online reviews of the program po handz my point from the beginning is that masters programs are worthless and the only thing relevant is experience i mean all masters are cash grabs no masters student gets paid for being a masters student in most cases so what does that mean the program is undeniably bad and useless what do you think is the difference between masters vs phd masters take exactly the same courses as the phd students there are pros and cons with each path but i am sure you know what they are you need to evaluate the masters program just like how you would evaluate a phd program except funding or a job look at what they are working on look at publications quality and quantity look at their support for students look at little fundings that you can get for traveling pridkett if you are asking this question then you know the answer is most likely yes having been on both sides of the game in academia these programs are usually designed for large businesses who pay for their employees to get a masters degree they really help solidify the budget of the department on the hiring manager side i guess it helps get past a filter and the candidates i have seen from ms in ml ds programs are generally okay they not uniformly better i still see a lot of people who ca not program do not really understand the statistics behinds the model and ca not talk through a project they have done if you can do those you do not need the ms program if you come out of the ms program and ca not do those then either the program failed you or you failed the program even if the grades say otherwise i do not recommend going for a professional masters degree in ml and ds dylantmb in general i have a firm opinion that any course based masters program that is not giving you a highly regulated job title physio therapist occupational therapist etc is a cash grab maybe an exception to mba im of the opinion that the value of a masters is doing graduate courses and a rigorous well thought out thesis in my experience ds cs masters students that have not done a thesis lack practical data skills the difference when talking to a new grad course based master is and a new grad thesis based master is is light years all that being said if we are only optimizing getting a job lots of jobs want master is and ds course based master is is a quick way to get one just do not count on it making you good at data science truebirch great advice searching the professors on google scholar and arxiv should make you think hey this is cool research i want to learn from this person was just gonna say a cash grab but i respect your response excellentbiddid you go to berkeley is mids speccra adding to things to ask alumni was the program what you expected what did you want to do and or where did you want to go prior to the program did you feel your degree adequately prepared you statsonatrain alternatively i think if a course is too cheap and online with many students enrolled each year it is also a cash grab if the price is too high or too low i am always suspicious uscubuff i was going to say the same thing about my ms in applied math with concentration in stats the theory and thesis seemed pretty worthless when it came to applicability but as i started my job search i realized how much i learned about programming support vector machine learning and programs in python using pandas and numpy everything i learned from the classes could have been learned on my own but the masters was a nice structured curriculum during covid no regrets wouldatastoryteller some people do cheat their way through a masters program the university will never admit that they know and still pass those students through because money what school is this if i may ask gatech is well known congrats zombieieie what is gt omsa how is the program so far i am interested in it as well with a business degree and year and as a data analyst but heard most who enroll drop and the prerequisites are tough if you are not from a pure cs background congratulations on making it you are my hero i have some questions if you do not mind how and where did you self learn how to code what program or school did you go to what was in your portfolio or work experience did you do an internship coffeecoffeecoffeee cash grab masters programs may not let you interact with prestigious faculty mine was at a very prestigious department but i never got to interact with top faculty outside of department mingling events thank you so much yup masters tuition is often higher and rarely comes with scholarships discounts drtardyhands yes in a way but they can also be a very beneficial stepping stone for the student as well especially if you are trying to switch fields or did an undergrad in a non low mid tier uni and have the opportunity to do one in a top tier one regarding ds ml ai specifically i do not know to be honest have not done one the curricula tend to look a bit suspicious tbh a lot of the languages frameworks models architectures in vogue are probably going to be outdated in a decade or whatever whereas something like math and statistics have more staying power but if the programme in question has non taught components like a research project that would allow you to work with either good faculty or industry folks at ucl you could perhaps get involved with something like deep mind etc it still sounds quite attractive so it can be kind of like doing an internship that you are paying for in both good and bad switchorganic i think we are starting to see a shift georgia tech and ut austin have low cost ms programs with classes that mirror the on campus version i cannot speak for ut austin is but georgia tech is courses have the same legit professors lecture content assignments and exams as the on campus one which uni itsgabes i am interested to know which uni as well coffeecoffeecoffeee this is essentially how i feel about my program it was at a prestigious university and i did not learn much but from a purely transactional point of view i think i did the right thing it is given me a lot more career flexibility and much higher pay what uni i am currently enrolled in indiana university is the total cost of the program will come out to i am doing course at a time which comes out to year below the year amount my and many other employers offer annually in reimbursement so it is going to be free to me i do not know that it is prestigious or how its quality compares to other programs that i have not been in but i will say that the courses are very informative and some of them quite hard i would say there are issues in the program for bridge courses if you are not already fairly knowledgeable in computer science which limits my ability to access some of the hardest courses in the program but i have certainly gained a lot of knowledge and reference that i would not have had otherwise po handz do not the program is worthless repetitive and filled with students suffering from sunk cost fallacy it will not help you get a job in ml or related the field does not care about degrees what so ever othe le than maybe phd for research positions brisklybrusque have to disagree i only got my first two jobs because of my master is it is a competitive field and a degree can give you an edge especially in the beginning not saying there is not a path forward without a degreeplenty of people do it just saying i got a degree i think it helped and i do not regret it could it be me lmao you just gloated all over my post over how much more elite you are with your cs ml degree than my ds degree but apparently now your degree is a worthless waste of time and told me i was not qualified for my current job i have had for years but now work experience is what is most important hmm you doing okay maybe you just need to go to black twitter and call people who work at walmart retarded for wanting living wages anyway i loved my masters program and one of the most important things i got out of it was a network of connections in the industry who were on the advisory board and extremely accessible so my advice would be to see who are the professors are who the advisory board members are see what the alumni and other possible connections are doing the community definitely gives you a leg up in finding a job where did you go if i can ask and how much was the price drxaos what do you think is the difference between masters vs phd quality of students masters take exactly the same courses as the phd students phd students are employees to research faculty they cost money but good ones help advance progress and help faculty careers as well as their own poor ones have negative value taking time and effort therefore the faculty care very much about the phd students fight for the good ones and try to exit the poor ones from the hiring side this means someone admitted to a phd program particularly after passing qualifying exams and is funded by competitive fellowships or research assistanceships is a valued candidate so graduated phds ms bs that cash grab blu juice i have been tempted to feed that cash cow coffeecoffeecoffeee no the main reason i am not naming the program is that it is now run by totally different people after enough complaints about the original program head spacecraftily dm me not gonna put them on blast when i was looking i tried to find syllabuses etc to get an idea of classes seeing how much is offered and how long they have been around also helps i would not count on we will offer in the future classes georgia tech online masters analytics bobbyfiend i had a uni president once who came by our department we would developed two ma programs and had been working on a phd for years and told us when i see a graduate student on campus i see a little dollar sign floating over their head cocodirichlet their mission was always to make the degree affordable and they have the support of the university im also going to assume that they have some type of deal with the university in which the department keeps a lot of the money they make from the online masters which helps them pay for more graduate student fellowships and those grad students are the tas of the online courses an issue with many universities is that they charge overhead to department and that can be like or or whatever they want for instance when you get an nsf grant the university takes a good chunk depends on the university but it can be from to because they say they keep on the lights in your office one thing is if you have a lab with actual space machines are using the cluster etc another thing is if you are an english literature professor and can stay at home writing in your computer ridiculous to charge overhead anyway many departments teaching online courses to their own undergrads like in summer online courses or teaching masters degrees in person or online get charged overhead that means that the university can take a lot of what you earn in my phd program my department had a deal that they kept all the money from their online summer courses for undergrads undergrads took a lot of online summer courses and the department made million a year from the summer courses that they used to keep the department running plus they saved a chunk the money went to pay for an extra admin top off fellowships for grad students pay for course buyouts remodel the kitchen etc etc that was until a new bureaucrat at the university level was like oh wait you are making a ton of money and i am not getting any well they decided to take from this money even though there is not overhead for online courses or barely and so nobody gave a shit about putting effort into the online summer program anymore before the department used the money they made to top off professors teaching during the summer because it is optional and the university paid like for a whole course for students and nobody wanted to do it and they also paid grad students to be tas once that was over nobody wanted to teach anymore they only kept a few courses with a max of students taught for grad students who wanted to get jobs at lac or slacs and they need evidence of teaching their own courses i think many programs and particularly online programs are not going to work if the department and full time professors do not have any incentives as in to make it a good program gethimoffthefield strathclyde in glasgow solidly decent uni but would not call it that prestigious or elite and yet did wonders for my job prospects nyquant sounds like a great way to keep on learning congratulations also nice having the employer to pay for it with job experience the prestige probably matters less while for a student just out of college a big name on the resume might help landing an interview switchorganic yeah i also disagree with them my ms opened up a lot of opportunities for me and i am still not done with it i was already in the ml field but i was able to convince my manager to let me grow my scope and start doing modeling work because i was in omscs ml spec now i am basically the sme on a set of models we have in prod because omscs opened that door for me not to mention i get so much more attention from recruiters with gt is branding compared to my undergrad grandmastafunkz yeah no problem at all i went to depaul university in chicago at the time my total cost was around did it on loans and still paying it back but it was well worth the investment idk about your program but i have noticed a single difference in terms of education i took the same courses as phd students and i was given the same opportunities as the phd students it is not like i was not allowed to cooperate with phd students so quality of students did not matter i had meetings with my advisor as frequently as his phd did you are talking like masters students and phd students are completely segregated which was definitely not the case for my grad school and every school i have visited when i was applying also this post is about comparing different masters program it is not about masters vs phd my point was that it does not matter if the masters program is a cash grab or not because at the end what matters is the quality of education which is exactly same as phd which is considered not cash grab dirty hurdy gurdy i went through the mids program it definitely had its faults but it did wonders for my career so i cannot say it was not a worthwhile investment it probably helps that i used veteran is benefits to pay for it so i never felt that price tag excellentbidi do not know i cannot see myself paying for an online school zombieieie what is your feedback does it help you to get a good job as a ds unable following for an answer nice i am happy for you what did you major in your undergrad and i majored in biology at a engineering school po handz you were already in the ml field but were not allowed to do ml how does that work it sounds more like your manager does not understand ml and the program just check a box for him drxaos the education at the course level is the same the entrance requirements are different and the education level past the courses research is different as are requirements to continue qualifying exams and advancement to candidacy it is true that a ms which is embedded in a significannot long standing phd program is better than a recently created standalone which is probably a cash grab i think that is your point and i agree given that i would rather hire a ms student who was admitted as a phd student and passed various tests at a phd level and was awarded teaching research fellowships for instance in physics there is not any real standalone ms of note it is something you get along the way after passing certain milestones it is not like i was not allowed to cooperate with phd students so quality of students did not matter that is not the issue here from the outside it means that the selection criteria to be a funded phd student is more rigorous than a pay to graduate ms so as an data point for a hiring manager it is more informative in probabilistic information theory sense of a technically capable candidate as more masters degree programs proliferate the informative value of their degree is lowered how did it help you can you elaborate kingoftheapes are we talking about the online master is in data science program here blu juice that price tag definitely stopped me from making that jump jaylew helped me i had a bsc in physics but was getting zero interviews in da ds since my experience was all lab related i took of their micro masters courses to see if i liked the format and then went for the full thing around of my way through like months since i was working full time while also taking summer courses super flexible program i started applying around and got in for a da role with a canadian company finished my remaining courses worked with them full time for months then jumped to a ds role with a big like tier if faang is tier american company and i know part of the reason i was getting interviews was because georgia tech has some recognition also had some interviews with uber square microsoft nike yahoo the practicum portion can be put on a resume and it helps a lot to have any kind of ds work experience i will say that you get out what you put in there are some classes that are complete blow off classes if you just want to coast but they have a ton of useful information and business application if you commit to learning well the technical bar was not that high imo at least and most courses were not very math heavy switchorganic i am in gt is cs equivalent and feel like it opened a lot of doors for me shortly after adding it to my linkedin back when the market was hot i was getting hit up by faang pretty often for ml engineering ds and applied scientist roles i was not getting any hits when i only had my bs stats from a it is been great for me better technical understanding etc and the ability to actually use ml etc at work i do predictive modeling now for sales and customer health and will likely keep expanding my reach so i effectively made the leap from mostly dash boarding descriptive analytics to predictive prescriptive analytics directly as a result from skills learned it is hard for me due to missing math background i have classes left the one i am in now is likely the hardest yet computational data analytics then i have simulation and a free elective in place of a waived req probably just marketing to get it done gotta do practicum at some point too switchorganic i majored in statistics switchorganic i was doing a lot more infra work on the platform around the models and orchestrating workflows but now i am able to actually work on the models themselves things like modeling model building research and prototyping benchmarking and validation etc you are arguing about phd vs masters which is not the point of op is question or the point of my argument read the op is question again it is about evaluating masters programs dirty hurdy gurdy i accepted a role just before graduation that was nearly double what i was making when i started the program and i was put in charge of a ds department about a year after that i am bombarded by recruiters on linkedin including from of the faang companies curse you netflix if i wanted to i could probably land an interview next week just replying to any of the myriad recruiters constantly hitting me up i guess in short since going through the program i have had no shortage of great opportunities coming my way and my salary has skyrocketed the program was a major investment of time however my life was basically work and school for two years with no free time and some of the courses were absolutely brutal i know people knock on mids for being overpriced and like i said it has some major flaws the intro to big data course was poorly designed it was revised times while i was there and some of the more popular electives had far fewer seats than they had people interested so i did not get to take the exact course load i was hoping for and it is a career oriented masters so if you are looking for theory you will be disappointed but on the whole i enjoyed my time there and have no regrets about going through the program dirty hurdy gurdy yep that is the one zombieieie online masters what was your uni wastingtimebcreddit what do you think is the difference between you and others who also went through the program but had ineffective results for their career in data science switchorganic yep omscs dirty hurdy gurdy i can only speculate there were a lot of people in the program who were not very technically minded and were completely jumping career tracks going from being a nurse to being a data scientist my leap was a bit smaller as i was already a software developer so i was already familiar with most of the tools being used and knew how to get up to speed quickly on the ones i did not i focused more on statistics than machine learning whereas a lot of people only wanted to do ml the statistics parts of the curriculum were definitely better laid out than the ml parts and ultimately i have found statistics to be far more useful in general than ml for the kinds of research oriented projects i have worked on my personal feeling on ml is that it is still incredibly niche and the number of jobs that actually require ml is far smaller than the number of people wanting to work with ml i will also hazard a guess that there is a bit of selection bias in the anecdotes you hear about any program if you spend a vast sum of money on a prestigious program and it does not meet your expectations you are far more likely to be vocal about it than someone who got exactly what they were expecting i would love to see some actual data on the correlation between salary and mids and other comparable programs",

the process of recruiting competent peers as they will need to deal with the consequences of someone who is not technically competent moscowgordon i do not do coding interviews i trust you know how to code if you really want to be in this field you will learn tools and languages on your own in my opinion this is your problem a huge number of people who apply to data scientist positions cannot code i ask people to do a basic group by and to write a for loop and half of the people i interview cannot do it once you filter out the people who cannot code your other questions will be more useful pryomancermtga being able to set up and automate elt tasks experience with cloud ability to independently solve a modeling project and a solid math stats background that is a lot to ask of a jr ds cocodirichlet questions are okay for a junior position i think the issue here is that questions depends on experience what if this person does not have cloud experience what if they have not automated a job this is junior position so are not things everyone has had a chance to do in practice however if they know how to code which you are not assessing they can learn in a day and they can learn the basics of cloud computing at least what they will need for the job fairly quickly i just ask people to walk me through their projects i am much better at explaining a project i did then handling hypothetical question so i assume other people are the same i do not like hypothetical questions because they are usually vague and they do not have much in common with the actual job i am gonna need an hour of your time to ask detailed questions about the data before i decide on the best etl method how many files rows columns data types format cadence what file system or database do you use how many users will access the data how often how often do they want it updated it what format do the users need how much storage and memory does your system have how much is dedicated to this particular task i could probably go on none deleted purplebrownupdown you really cannot find junior persons can answer these hmmm i get the feeling like the market is flooded with data scientists who are code monkeys and not statistically literate might want to start looking for statisticians and people who have advanced math degrees and not cs or ds people the former can always be trained to learn sql and pandas walking thought your questions they seem easy undergrad leve easy and you are not asking the harmonic mean first cmdrastronaughty i got to say this post has a lot of downvotesnot sure why it is getting a lot of negativity gatekeepers rupertalderson for questions those are entirely fair and any data scientist should have a coherent answers for those in an interview even if their answers are not complete for question however there is a clear problem with the question if any reasonable data scientist were given a tabular dataset with no prior knowledge about the dataset the first thing they should do is ask questions to the domain expert who gathered or pre processed the data in theory if an interviewee just jumps into their technical approach to profiling and exploring the data then they have already skipped step one are you willing to give an actual example or accept half of the answer involving questions and hypotheticals to make the rest of the answer reasonable you said you do not like case studies because they take time but asking for someone is approach to data profiling and exploration without any context is not realistic or likely insightful in my view what i have identified is in fact one reason why a coding or case study part of an interview process is vital questions and are all right teaoverflow it takes me probably just one morning to crank out perfect or near perfect responses to all these questions and i cannot even get an internship i would be very very happy if these are questions i get from a manager screening funsatisfactionwhat tools and languages do you expect a good candidate to know for this role 1234okieread through your post and your response seems like you are will be a great manager out of curiosity not that it matters because we probably will not bump into each other but what is your range for the position wouldarkly dreamer i am very curious about question this is outside of my current job scope but would love to know more about how to do something like this if anyone has a response i would gladly hear it happysummeryour questions look fine to me the problem is most likely the screening process a good hire starts with your own hr take ownership of the jd if you have not already talk to hr about the kind of people you want involve your team like other people here suggested trace back the cases of bad candidates to see where they should have been filtered out like how you would debug a call stack arenaone going through your messages i really like how you think and your responses i am a senior mle with a phd and are you guys hiring d vitaminwheat i am pretty new to this area if you have the time would you be able to give a quick run down on what you would expect for and livingteachingmaybe as a first step put a hackerrank coding test just to make sure those who make it to the interview round have good coding knowledge you have the most reasonable requirements for any ds hiring manager honestly like another comment mentioned you can ask hr to have a hackerrank test to test basic coding logic in a language of their preference amd i think this would be perfect i feel like i could answer those well i like to see some code proficiency tho i have been wanting to test a new method based on an idea i got from the book range in it they talk about expert chess players or something quickly recognizing things something like that it is been like a years anyway have some moderately complex sql with joins and cte and ask them to tell you what it is doing maybe drop an obvious error and see if they catch it basically see if they understand written code if they do then i assume they can figure out how to write it as well same could probably work for python seems faster to me and their comfort and knowledge would be how i assess their skill honor i am confused on the part where you say i do not do case study i do not really have the time for this but then i want my technical interviews to be mins how are you supposed to judge someones technical skill in mins i think that is pretty ambitious it might help to leverage other member of the team to devote more time to technical eval if you are feeling time crunched maybe you can serve as a final check and culture fit test at the end instead nyquant and sound too much like memorization of terminology questions i would try to put those into a scenario like what kind of error measure would be important in a medical trial a costumer churn prediction model etc tomomcat you are really not selecting for practical skills at all with this approach i have seen so many people who would do really well in this kind of interview then be pretty useless on the job conversely i have also seen quite a few who would probably flunk it but then go on to be incredibly productive often people with english as a second language or without an academic maths stats background or who have not recently done a bootcamp liljondoe i do not like those questions at all these are quiz questions where you are looking for a specific answer and it might not be relevant at all instead ask them to walk through a project they did including the business context and impact and then if things such as linear regression come up ask questions about it if you care to basically try to figure out whether they understand why they did certain things from both a business perspective and technical perspective and judge accordingly cmdrastronaughty oh man really i figured people can piece together things might not be production level code but it will get you there i will start incorporating my ds and developers mreloi if you do not have time to assess coding or case studies then get your team to do that part that is what i used to do i would give the cultural interview first and if the candidate looked like a good fit then i would pass them on for technical interviews thephoenixrisesagain there is zero need to test coding itself if people get the concepts and have a good understanding of how to apply certain techniques to a business problem they can always code it not true the other way around i have seen good coders who could not help solving any business related problem that is why we always test for general understanding of concepts and business applications coding is the easy part of our job i think the most effective interview approach is recruiter who explains upcoming interview process data scientist hiring manager that asks the questions you asked above in a minute interview take home coding exercise kaggle or hackerrank review exercise with data scientist minute flash round interviews with reach team member to determine fit it is lengthy for the candidate but it leaves nothing to chance when selecting the best candidate cmdrastronaughty i will look into adding my developers and ds into the interview to screen their coding ability purplebrownupdown yeah but a lot of that can be learned as well but i get it you want someone who is job is currently using those tools and software cmdrastronaughty it is for sure which is why i do not hold it against them in my decision making it is also why i ask them questions last so it does not make them feel pressured compared to if i ask it earlier i also tell them it is more of a nice to have not necessary cmdrastronaughty i like the second part of your answer it is vague i totally agree and there are many paths you could take i like where you headed honestly though its very well though out and i have not received those answers from my candidate have you found that when you ask candidates to walk you through their projects they are sort of just copying another persons work like the code and workflow just seems too perfectalmost staged and scripted quiet honestly i do not know how to word this hesitation what i mean by this is for example the kaggle titanic dataset work a lot of it is well documented there is plenty of guides out there for the code and explanation i have seen a lot of titanic kaggle notebooks and whats to say someone is not just copying another persons work and changing some values some hyper parameters and calling it their own work and i will definitely look into it i did have one candidate that provided his github and i was able to look through it and now i wish i asked him to walk through one of those projects with me cmdrastronaughty hr finds these candidates the business manager interviews them first then gets brought to me and now that i am typing this outi am thinking hold on that is stupid i should be able to screen these guys before the bm even interviews them time to implement that change lol i have had some candidates come through with a certification from datacamp or udemy i am wondering do these courses not teach basic stats and math i would like to audit one honestly just so i can see what is taught in those moocs i teach an undergraudate course at the level and i am confident that my students can answer questions similar to you cmdrastronaughty a week ds bootcamp level easy honor serious question is harmonic mean a joke in ds circles i have only ever used it in context of the score cmdrastronaughty dude what you gave for answer is literally what i want for an answer i want these candidates to say well let is pause here for a secondwhere is this data coming from who creates this data what does it inherently mean apart from the values in the dataset there is an aspect of eda that is more than just math ie giving me a distribution and what values are nullblah blah blah is there a better way i can frame that question to get that kind of answer cmdrastronaughty bummer i see you are doing a phd i know there are orgs that are hesitant in hiring individuals that are too academic makes no sense to me do not ask me why they do this i sadly do not have an internship program i really want one because i love developing students and giving them exposure to the field and experience in the past i have always treated my interns as full time people with all the rights and responsibilities obviously with a mentor they can ask questions the feedbacks have always been amazing damn budget reasons cmdrastronaughty i could care less if you want to program in r python cjulia my team has research people who script in r for stats and production people who script in python to put models in production we will put you wherever you want and if you are willing to learn cool tool wise shit man no need for pytorch or tensorflowyet lol scikit learn at the entry level is good enough for me or any basic ml library if you want to work in pandas cool if you want to work in exclusively numpycool too show me you have some basic understanding the team will give you opportunity to learn and hone your skills we cannot teach you from ground floor but we can meet you halfway cmdrastronaughty it is a wide range it was set by hr not me usd cmdrastronaughty some of the answers i am looking for just write a python script and if that job needs to be daily executed at you bet i am going to ask you to wake up at and run that script use that same python script and just attach it to a cron job use a cloud instance or function to trigger the script job on a time event basis use native os built in scheduler intuitively they are just cron jobs with a gui cmdrastronaughty can you answer those questions lol i am just joking if we have a mle that leaves the team i can keep you in mind but honestly the world needs more mle and mlops people i have noticed my ds guys being outpaced by just the sheer volume of automl tools out there that can do their jobs a bit quicker less accurate generally but still non the less quicker you in mle have a super bright future ahead of you proofrequired i agree with testing basic coding skill i have had ds managers who could not write a python script to save their life it just does not look good especially when the same manager would go around touting how this or that is easy and make promises to higher level stakeholder just ask the usual fizzbuzz stuff or just sum of elements in a list of numbers or calculate mean etc it should not be implementing some binary tree search etc i will also add some simple sql testing questions again nothing complicated but just group by etc i am also explicit about the fact that we have not hidden any trick under simpler question it is exactly how it looks like frosttrapsrghey honestly this is a huge problem with the tech sector as a whole right now hiring in incompetence that talks a good game has seen a huge number of people unqualified for their roles get in the best way for you to find the best candidate is to learn some of the skills and jargon yourself so you can get a better read on people is abilities first moscowgordon i mean yeah anything can be learned to an extent but if a person cannot figure out how to do a group by the problem is most likely that they just do not know how to work with data juniors do not have the confidence to reject the premise of a vague question they are too worried about finding the right answer i do not review code coding is the easy part thinking is the hard part i assume every college grad did at least one project to graduate so they usually mention that lets say part one of the project included web scraping i would ask how did you web scrap why did you decide to do it that way if they stole code they did not understand they would not be able to answer that if they stole code and worked to understand it that is fine i do that all the time graphicteadatasci does the business manager have anything to gain from the position not being filled if you used to be able to find good candidates and that has changed then maybe there is nothing wrong with your questions the salary looked pretty sweet for a junior position and maybe some people disagree with that i would add some very simple code questions based on the languages mentioned in their resumes one with this code is supposed to output this but outputs this can you find and explain the problem and can you try to explain what this code does partially to weed out anyone with no clue but mostly to have some very concrete things to talk about and get the nerds warmed up your questions are generally open ended and it takes a bit of time to get in the right headspace i guess it depends on the boot camp i guess out of the only one which might get someone is imho the first there are so many things you can do wrong on the data as wrong imputation methods for na wrong way to handle categoricals likert scales and so on outliers is a big one as well are basic i did teach them to undergrad in business now would they remember or have an idea to refresh different story so it is good to check if you ask about type and error is nice to follow up with the confusion matrix precision accuracy and recall and if you want to push it a little when would you use one or the other metric gives some idea of previous experience as well i do not like asking coding questions as well but some easy sql comes handy rupertalderson i think it is phrased well i was checking that you want that and if not i wanted to be sure you are reasonable about it funsatisfactionthank you for sharing i appreciate your open mindedness cmdrastronaughty i also want to say no is a bad way of doing the job you should always try to automate arenaone thank you for replying regarding your questions i must say as an mle the is not as easy as one might think and finally i hope someone replies to with the meme where type i is a doctor saying to a man you are pregnant and type ii a doctor telling a very pregnant woman that she is not pregnant lol thank you for your kind words actually sometimes being an mle is hard because you are expected to have all the stats ml of a data scientist all the engineering of a swe and the pipeline knowledge of a de but at least i am getting some calls which given this job market is probably an achievement already cmdrastronaughty i love everything you just said i will take it into consideration and implement thank you cmdrastronaughty lol i meant the bootcamp as a jokesorry text does not translate sarcasm well i do see what you mean with they are meant to be a conversation starter and i hope it does that more of open ended questions so the candidate and i can have a discussion honestly when i ask the type type questioni am just waiting for a candidate to say confusion matrixthat to me would be a perfectly acceptable answer in a very condense form it has yet to happen cmdrastronaughty of course good luck if you are not in the field yet and are trying to break into it if you are in

  "mizmato i do not think there is an issue with entering the data science field as there are plenty of data analyst and swe jobs when people say data scientists they may be referring to research based or lead modeling jobs which is considered a terminal position these advanced positions are highly sought after which is why there is a supply demand issue from what i have seen many new grads undergrad go from data analyst to data engineer to data scientist you can also consider a degree in statistics or cs which are more traditional fields of study but are highly valuable if you want to become a data scientist character maybe cs bachelor is and data science masters budgetalgaedata engineering none i really appriciate your answear and the time you took too give it i thought of taking a bachelor in da and master in cs too make me more flexible i also have alot of experience in sales so i hope that will help me because i hear you need people skills none i wish but i live in a small country so i will have too move then this is what i originally wanted budgetalgaedata engineering top or role right now and it is only rising swappybizz in most cases education has fuck all to do with your job take it from iitr mech engineer msc systems from ntnu phd in social engineering i make ai pipelines now will end up retiring soon due to a degenerative ailment it might not be a career advice or necessarily relevant here but i hope it gives you a little insight from a different prospective take a step back and re evaluate maybe it will make you future easier none ye i see this all the time people with different educations working in fields that are only slightly related too their education i guess you start out where you are suppose too according too your education and then you are just slingshot in whatever direction i guess ds and cs will open alot of doors of me so maybe it does not matter that much",
  "monkeyunited justify the value for one first thebear got any data a data analysis department is not going to be particularly useful if you do not have any data to work with sweeetscience start from the beginning why does your dad need one the simplest justification you could point to is any number of unanswered questions he might have for his business it is impossible from here to see from here what questions he could possibly have without knowing more about his business industry market size cogs etc without knowing more questions applicable to any business might be are you as profitable as you possibly could be are as productive as you could be are you targeting your customer segments in the best way according to their observed preferences etc find questions specifically applicable to his businesses then find out if there are data sets produced from operations to support an analytical approach to answering them no data then your next course of action is wrangling all of that data into a central corpus since as said previously data analytics is pretty useless without data keep in mind that if you are starting from zero with no data and no data pipelines this will be a multi year process and investment to make it truly useful",

  "solvermax incompetence is not unethical being complicit in condoning incompetence is unethical do you have evidence that people knew the results were inaccurate or is this simply a case of the all too common situation where no one did a quality check on the results danielbaldielocks this reminds me of the old saying garbage in garbage out i have run into similar scenarios during my years in analytics and perhaps i can offer some perspective many times during my analysis i do not have direct access or control over the source of my data it is getting the result of information flowing through all kinds of systems and processes now in these cases all i can do is trust that those systems and process are properly vetted and unless there is something in the data i am given that hints at a problem then i can never know for certain if my data is good so all i can do is assume it is good validate as best i can and present my analysis based on the data i am given based on what you are describing it seems like a snowball effect no one person was being malicious each contributed a small part to errors in the overall process of course i could be wrong i do not have the visibility you have all i am saying is that it is possible for everyone to have worked to the best of what they are capable given and still have large mistakes happen especially if that is the result of a snowball effect therealtiddlydump reminds me of andrew gelman is modification of clarke is law any sufficiently crappy research is indistinguishable from fraud autumnotter with a team i once migrated queries from an old system to a new system in the process we culled like of them but the funny thing was about of the queries we re wrote translated we were told were now wrong turns out that the business had been using hundreds maybe thousands of queries in reports for like years that had been wrong all along this is why you do testing have good processes in place find good people and pay those good people enough to keep them around it could be incompetence or technical debt or managers rushing devs or laziness you never know good for you for spending the time and effort to try to fix it and raising the issue one note of wisdom this is how i fired a guy many years back he was brand new on the team still did not understand the data or processes and why some decisions were taken or approved instead of discussing with the team he escalated immediately up the chain of command calling an emergency meeting including my n n and n he presented his findings like he discovered gold in a trash can and it was not he just did not understood the raw data which needed some serious processing to be useful my n did listen to him then he asked me to explain what was obvious for everyone else in the room and as we got out of the room told me to get rid of the guy for wasting his time and ring an emergency out of nothing im not saying this is the same case i am just saying pay extra attention errors happens and sometimes are not caught it happens in every job but do not blow the whistle on i am pretty sure blow the whistle on i am triple checked sure taken over the process yesterday and i already figure out it is a royal shitshow is kinda suspicious not impossible just suspicious acceptable milk i am going through something similar in a new role it seems to me like most people working jobs just do not give a shit at all they were told to move data from here to there they moved it done no one stops to ask if anything makes sense they just follow marching orders renokarchnmy incompetence is not unethical it is just incompetence deliberate fraud and intentionally doing shoddy work is unethical how do you know that your work reflects any higher level of competence what happens when your successors find your work is not accurate either did you operate in an unethical manner that is why there should be checks and balances in place in every step of the analytic pipeline do not work in marketing it is all lies and if you complain no one cares delicious view so many good discussions here my few takes on this on some level yes i think it is unethical i think what other people mean is that it is not immoral that there is no malicious intent but being competent enough to not cause harm has to be a part of the professionalism that needs to be upheld in a field where providing evudence based advice is a key part of the job but it definitely depends on the degree of incompetence displayed and the extent of damage or harm caused if it is just that they did some analysis using a method that one statistician definitely could have used but another statisticians typically would not have used then i say meh but if they did an important piece of analysis and did not leave their code methodology so that the analysis could be reproduced or at least be understood then yeah i would say that is unethical regardless of whether they did not know that documenting and saving the analysis is an important process in doing science if you did not know that level of incompetence should be considered unethical this would be more important if you work in the public sector i am also sensing that others in the comments are pointing out the possibility that you may be the one in the wrong we are not there so there is no way to know but both cases happen often enough that i find the situation highly believable i am not in the silicon valley and i have no idea what it is like in a highly competitive market with good universities around but around where i am very few in the region has the qualification training knowledge to do these types of work correctly i have witnessed too many cases of serious incompetence that defaulting to assuming whatever my predecessers did was wrong has worked out very well however it does not matter whether the people before me were incompetent or not in their defence it is often the system environment they are working within that is the real issue it is almost as if certain projects were designed to fail as in it is almost always the case that the managers are the incompetent ones and not the data scientist i rambled tldr could consider extreme levels of incompetence as unethical could be the previous guy or could be you will trust you because reasons i am sure they had their reasons and the fault would likely have been with the management uchimata they almost certainly did not know most likely because no one who really understood what the output should look like was doing serious qa it is almost certainly a failure of governance and quality control processes more so than any individual mathstatgal i was working as a contractor with a large company managing a team of contractors senior analysts and consultants one week into my week notice period i realized there is a major major flaw in how one of the key kpis was being defined and calculated this was a problem because this kpi was being fed into other models based on whose output some major marketing decisions were being made all that being said i told my boss also a contractor about this and left at the end of the week mind you this was something that was already in production before i joined the team and got access to the sql queries only after repeatedly asking for it for over months i was only at that job for a total of months and left for other reasons so to answer your question as many have mentioned incompetence is not unethical but being complicit with incompetence certainly is i would bring it to light without climbing on a moral high horse i know i have been guilt of that in the past and it only serves to frame you in a bad light all the best arioniv it is alarming you had to find out this way and had to put in so much work but this complicity is a characteristic shared by most firmsregardless of data science or other fields aggravatingsandwelcome to the working world i just had a post similar to this if you wanna look through my history i have worked for some very desirable companies and incompetentance is what the average worker brings to the table you need to find and above average company ghostofkilgore if it is just genuine incompetence then of course it is not unethical as others have said being knowingly complicit in allowing incorrect and poor work to continue is unethical and i guess misrepresenting your self or your level of competence to get a job beyond your capability could also be considered unethical if that is what happened miketythhon if you are not a data scientist i am skeptical of your ability to know the etl and analysis is bs so another question for this thread since one commenter stated basically i cannot call bullshit on any of this without being a data scientist i guess i should have stated i can write r and sql code to meet my minimal needs who then is qualified to check this out then because the data scientist who provided me the queries who of course talked with such authority in an initial meeting but when l later down like asked questions could not answer them who the fuck actually knows what they are doing i guess i am just a very blunt and honest person and admits to when i do not know what is going on ie like now and probs why it is stressing me out even though i am not super moral or anything of the sorts again good advice thanks and anom reddit community rjali counting is hard even for mathematicians this reminds me of my old workplace where metric results were done in c which was pretty much a black box code was hidden from the analyst and we were reprimanded for questioning the code eventually we found out it was all garbage livingteachinganother question is how did you figure out the output from the sql queries is shit there should be a logic behind the sql query and what it delivers arminvt bs in data science could mean many things what was the burnout rate at previous teams mrtickle everyone is incompetent at many many things if it was unethical to be incompetent we would never learn anything and we would all going to hell renokarchnmy or the other case where no one up and down the chain knew what they were doing from intern to board of director probably the latter and i also considered just accepting the garbage as truth and doing things the way had been done before renokarchnmy i run into this a lot and have trouble articulating it to stakeholders i ask them to validate results because they have the sme and basically they own the data and should know if it is wrong they do not want to be bothered months later it is wrong and fucks something up they point at me i point back claiming it is a conflict of interest that i do the work and validate the results myself nothing changes ya seems to be what happened each person made a few erroneous moves idt anyone is malicious or whatever but being willfully sloppy ignorant idk feels kinda icky this is insane for context i spent hours on something that probably takes collective hours on so idk i feel like i did due diligence and i told my team head that is it and letting him handle it nonetheless this definitely good advice and i am taking a reddit netflix break before logging back on to do other stuff who were n thanks the comments that i may be in the wrong have been helpful because i am waiting until monday to write the email out documenting things out in the spirit of documentation that is been part of my job is to come in and stitch different things together and document it and when i say there has been no documentation i mean there has not even been decent verbal documentation and maybe the data people do not have fantastic memories i have dated some hella prestigious engineering phds and they did not but then write it the fuck down luckily this has been well received bc a lot of my team is new so they too are trying to change the status quo i quit a previous job and was unemployed for a stint so if i am fired i can handle it but really have been reassured that is not gonna happen in regards to morality my morals are questionable if i fully presented something that was a lie like a major company would just be getting swindled which i guess i do not really care about i care about putting my name on things that i can stand by and defend ya sure there is probably a lot of mistakes in things i sign off on and i can learn from that for sure but i hope they are not as major these but guess you do not know what you do not know for sure good advice im pretty self deprecating as a personality trait so it ended up being pretty easy to be like ya sure maybe i would fudge data but i am not gonna maybe fudge data alarming like i should have already known this because i guess i definitely did not know prior haha i did thanks and i too love house it feels kinda easy to turn the other way at that itch inside of you that says this seems off if you can get away with it and i do not believe i am so much more competent than the rest because when i asked questions there was a lot of deflecting across the board i might just be a bit more insane i have an anxiety disorder like they kinda could have known but it did not bother them enough vibe okie the analysis was done in excel so basically the person in charge of updating them had been doing some shortcuts wiht updating the queries that seem misaligned with the intent of the person who originally wrote it so two fields month and year of the output are incorrect they may be correct in the sense they could be easily fixed in excel but it seems weird to include incorrect fields in the final select clause like if they are not important just you know do not include them so the data might be mostly all good and just a bit quirky however the person who has been updating cannot give me answer of why certain fields exist or what the output means solvermax i will forgive the intern for being incompetent a director does not need to understand any of the analyses that is not their job but their job does include ensuring that there are good work practices such as appropriate quality control processes so that they can have confidence in the results solvermax and i also considered just accepting the garbage as truth that would make you complicit blowing the whistle is the right approach though probably not the easiest danielbaldielocks it is the circle of data lol danielbaldielocks i agree i have been in similar situations and it is easy to get frustrated however there is so much we do not know what was their workload like how much pressure were they under how much experience training did they have so many things that can contribute to people making mistakes i am not saying it does not happens just saying that is good to sleep over it talk with other team members then sleep over again it and talk more before jumping to conclusions if customers have been fed shit for months or years one extra week will not hurt i have been fired myself for my good intentions on my very first job i found a massive weakness in a process brought it to the attention of the owner and guess what he took me as the noob making him look like a fool he fired me and the following month he changed the process according to my specs so i perfectly know how enthusiasm can ruin a perfectly good day the road to hell is paved by good intentions nahmanidk it varies from company to company of course but often your job is just to keep your boss happy ideally you would figure how to do that and prioritize what matters that does not mean you should do garbage work on purpose but it is worth keeping your role in perspective and your boss may not really give a shit either because they are counting down the clock until they can jump ship to a better paying job lol and when you leave you will forget whatever work you were stressing out over before too arioniv if it is ur first job understandable nobody tells you how organizations pride themselves on inefficiency inside while projecting everything positively outwards even when you are also now in the system and just feel like throwing up whenever you go through those daily emails hillexcel is a very viable analysis tool in the right hands miketythhon does not matter what it was done in what was bs about the analysis livingteachinginteresting renokarchnmy i have literally had different directors i am a manager in the same organization give me kickback about me wanting to enforce standards on analytics process that include some pretty simple bullet points dealing with repeatability stability transparency and bias avoidance among others their opinions were that basically no one understands the process anyways so why be transparent it is always repeatable because make resource do work again they completely did not understand what stable statistical processes were whatsoever they also assumed bias was always present because they were viewing analysis from the perspective of mbas in that analysis should always reinforce their preconceived biases or else it should not be done pryomancermtga and yet i have seen the intern get thrown under the bus for incompetence by their manager to save their ass never trusted that manager after that obviously you do not want to raise concern without doing deep due diligence so i did that and like ofc still need to meet normal deadlines i am probs just tired and will think differently about it all over the weekend just feels like a decent number of people had the skill set ability to have done the due diligence prior it is a quarterly report ya certainly there is a lot of unknowns i guess the feeling i am experiencing is disenchantment like if this bullshit was being fed to all these major household name companies then what is real i am and already quit an org after years so maybe i should have already and maybe i am not well suited for corporate life still do not know ya of course i meant it in the sense that i am definitely qualified and experienced enough to understand excel it was presented in a manner that misrepresented the strength in our product and did not include details anywhere abt timeframe etc my boss told me it was x just by looking at it and it turned to be y and he was like wtf the analysis was not created or then completed by a ds was my point but i can the etl aspect oh dear goodness bias is something you do not gloss over and there are plenty of toolkits like ai fairness toolkit to help out if a report is not accurate then it is not accurate and needs corrected it is okay for them to not understand these things but to argue that it should be avoided is crossing the line solvermax as an analyst i inherited production of a monthly report that contained a table consisting entirely of zeroes because of an error in the production process it had been wrong for six months but no one had noticed it is surprising how inattentive people can be danielbaldielocks welcome to the existential dread of data analysis lol it is like who is line is it anyway everything is made up and the points do not matter lol not sure to laugh or cry sometimes arioniv i am starting out on dsbut yeah years of fighting this stupid corp attitude hillgot you i just hear so much hate for excel my knee jerk is to defend it do notyouloveme they are not going to like that you are going to make their product look worse under rows and your fingers can fly through shit i agree",

  "spiritualquestions i was in a similar position as you did not thrive in high school i went back to community college at after working for a while and did not get my bachelors until i was got job as mle right after finishing bachelors perrydahlia you are you can still get whatever degree you want excitinghamsterif you have your eyes set on only data science then i am afraid that you are going to be competing with people with phd is and masters with a lot of research experience however if you want to get into analytics or data engineering or the new jobs that have been coming up lately such as business intelligence engineering or analytics engineering which are a mix of analysis and de you can absolutely get into that with an online degree and courses it will obviously be harder without a proper tech or business degree but a lot easier than getting into ds business analysts at product companies also are a mix of analytics and data engineering but are a bit difficult to get into without a proper bachelor is degree dr freddy yes you can do it without a degree it will be harder but it is possible but why not just go back to school and get a degree xdownvotebotx hi friend i do not usually comment on reddit but thought i would weigh in here i do have a college degree in math and psychology but realistically those are just pieces of paper it sucks but you do need those to get over the bullshit hump most companies set to filter candidates with that being said i can assure you you have not ruined your chances by getting stoned all day i have been stoned for the past years and am currently working as a ds right out of college i was working in healthcare and transitioned slowly to da and now fully to ds and i was high as a kite the whole time the hardest part is getting a company or more specifically someone who works for a company you want to work for to give you a chance everything i learned i learned on the job i found it really difficult to watch youtube videos on a random analysis and try and extrapolate important information the way i learned the trade is by having a problem task at my job that i needed to figure out and utilizing the internet to get to my answer i generally know the direction i want to go in and i utilize the internet to get there what has helped me learn the most is reading other peoples master phd thesis i promise you whatever problem you are attempting to solve there is a poor soul out there who has written a page dissertation on the topic you do not need to reinvent the wheel just follow some dudes analysis and learn the important pieces as you go along after a while of seeing the same concepts you will start to make sense of things cheers and good luck to you datamasteryacademy are you considering getting a bachelor is degree there are many really good online degrees nowadays you can apply for software developer roles since you have a year diploma and work at the same time in four years you would have a bachelor is degree and years of experience as a software developer and maybe even data analyst internships it is not impossible to still transition into data analytics or data science but i would say it would be way harder and very low chance without a bachelor is degree if i were you i would forget about my younger self and dedicate myself to becoming a data scientist from now on and getting a bachelor is degree your age is your advantage brcimo it can be done but it will likely take a lot of work i did not have a degree when i started my role as a data scientist i now have a bscs and i am almost done with my masters i would suggest getting a bs or ms since you do not have tons of experience i had a lot of development experience when i started in data science most of the data scientists where i am at have a masters in a math or data related field for school i went to western governors university for my bs it was great and inexpensive wguedu i love the competency base education you could also look into nau they call it personalized learning kiwibutterket i will go against the grain here and say if you already are or are about to be a python dev then you can take that route and try to work closely with data scientist to see what their work actually look like and maybe start collaborating with them too there is a lot of romaticization of the data scientist role and while you may be sure of your passion there is no better way of knowing than to look at it closely furthermore you can also study while you work but i would not postpone my entrance in the workforce in this moment if i were you for two reasons i would irrationally feel like a failure for not having financial agency and working a bit might get you to realize what you really want to do maybe you will find yourself hating talking to people but loving to compiling reports or presenting results or god knows what also experience with python as a developer are definitely sought after for a lot of data science position xpertprofessional do not be fooled by the grass is always greener on the other side you may be dreaming of being a data scientist but as a few others have said that may be because you are romanticizing the role i have been in it for or years and i am looking around for other options granted related options like policy research i do not know what country you are in however in the us it is common to get a year associates and then transfer to a year college i see a few people saying that you will have a degree in years but you can do it in depending on how many credits transfer i did it in so i am not just blowing smoke my degree was in physics though not cs i would actually recommend against the month certificate and aim for a bachelors not because it will do you better for a job in ds though it probably will because it will be easier to network but because a bachelors degree will be more enriching and help you explore other options see first point is still very young i am now and i am taking some undergrad classes to prepare for a masters and that is not even as old as many of my classmates from my physics bs many years ago mattdamonstaco i am a former semi pro musician to fisheries and wildlife scientist who is now working as a senior data scientist in big tech now my dream in high school was to eat acid and play tuba all day it might take a bit of luck like y career path but you can get there fancy do not know what conditions pathways are like in us but in uk i am doing a masters in datascience as a mature student relevant experience has extra weighting seems to me a msc opens up opportunities and a phd further but it is expensive and time consuming especially when juggling work or running a business glottogold getting into a python developer role is the really hard step also once you are there it may actually make more sense to spend time in tech analytics is challenging and typically not a non college degree because analysis is not really a hard skill python development is actually or more hard than analysis and so i do not see many roles for analyst without college degrees and mbas often get analytics jobs in theory you can still get into ds but tbh you would also have an easier time getting into ds as a python developer than as an analyst you would just need to find a way to go swe mle ds as mles have a lot more in common with ds than most analysts that being said the python developer role is really the hard step here that job by itself could easily get you into figures riveryr a grounding in academic research and experimental design is important and lacking in alot of business degrees and data analyst scientist courses online eg datacamp totally possible every job title these days is data analyst or scientist lol but my point of difference is my university education psychology undergrad business post grad where i had a thorough grounding in a scientific hypothesis testing and bolted on the data tech skills as my career progressed obviously i do not conduct all my projects like a scientific experiment but it is a useful pedagogy that i borrow some things from just like some aspects of economics analysis are useful in some ways and restrictive or inappropriate in others i hated uni and studying it is expensive and it is not for everyone so if you feel like skipping that step i get it but i would recommend some form of course that exposes you to an academic methodology cyclicdombo you could just go straight into a data analysis role right now and work up to something more technical why get a developer job first autumnotter i would hire a candidate with no degree and a lot of great experience over a candidate with a degree and no experience but in five years there is going to be a lot of candidates out there that have both a degree and great experience you are going to struggle to get interviews unless you do some pretty cool stuff in the next years i would recommend you get a bachelor is degree at a bare minimum if you are serious about a data science career i would expect that a fair amount of your credits would carry over icanelectoo i am sure it is possible to do it without a formal education but you will be passed over for a lot of jobs in an already competitive field i finished my undergrad in eng when i was and worked a few years but pretty much blew all my money now i am back to school to do a master is in ml engineering and i am will probably be at least before i start the career i want you can go back to school in your is yes and you do not need the certificates along the way just good real experience machochad here is the path that i took helpdesk desktop support sysadmin engineer data engineer director of it director of data engineering and analytics i moved up through these positions at different jobs i just turned i make more than a year no degree zeroknyc i went back to school at got my bachelors and mba started that journey years ago and have not only spent a number of years working as a data scientist but now manage a team of data analysts scientists supporting multiple clients you are further along than i was when i started that journey do a couple projects and finish up your degree it will be worth it i am spent the last years in procurement at a bank and am going back to school for a year before i apply for masters programs you can easily go and get a bachelor is at your age kyledrogo you want to at least have a technical bachelors if you are presenting yourself as a data scientist topics like experimentation and causal inference are very technical and you will need the background to understand them intuitively moreover you will be competing against people with physics phds who could not find a gig in academia i would suggest going the data infra route use your experience to build data tools like dashes visualizations etc you have a leg up there and the higher education expectations are not nearly as extreme the technical folks i spoke of in the earlier paragraph are generally afraid of the command line and writing production code get your foothold in that realm lastly you can become an analyst right now there is very little gatekeeping the title might not command the salary you are used to though and the career advancement is not as clear there is a big difference between data analyst and data scientist fuehnix reddit is filled with a lot of yes men to put your question into perspective i am going back for a graduate degree to make it easier for me to find a proper data science role and my degree is from uiuc with credit hours of graduate work and internships and research the thing is yeah you would probably be qualified with the route you proposed but being qualified has not been enough in this market for a lot longer than this layoff period unless you get lucky you have to be better than other applicannots if you do not want to get passed up if you spend enough years in industry you can get to the level of an entry level data analyst somewhere yeah but data scientist is like a senior role in most places people get master is degrees and phds for those roles i think it is totally possible for you to come back from your high school mistakes i messed up highschool too did well in community college transferred to a top school and then someone else messed up my college experience for me and now i am working on putting my life back on track again but you gotta put in the work no bs no shortcuts and gotta be realistic personally i think your best path is bachelor is rotc or going for some type of officer training school the military is much less screamy if you do officer side and the gi bill will keep your debt zero also they will basically set you up on your career path and get you security clearances that you can use to get jobs other people cannot get you can also just put in your time and then get out alternatively you are gonna have to probably take out student loans apply for fafsa so you can at least get a bachelor is you got this but only if you want it bad enough mathelic do not acceptablepurpleyou do not need university to become a data scientist you can self teach take it from someone who was working full time while attending a master of science in data science full time it was not worth the mental stress in the end i learned everything on the job through practical experience being able to showcase your skills your ability to articulate during problem solving and ability for creative problem solving is what will take you miles farther than a degree the technical skills will build up the more you practice on the job and once you have a proven track record it will speak volumes more than an ms on a piece of paper and of utmost importance is your ability to pass the technical phase of an interview i have worked as a backend analyst i currently build data models relational forecasting and also am a developer with various aspects of my projects focused in ml djstillalive out of curiosity why is it your dream swilts doing a degree during an economic downturn is good advice you should also know that most people who have the job title of data scientists are doing analysis and bi dashboards open ai tesla and apple only employ so many people and competition is now global so you know just follow the parts of the ecosystem you actually like and do not worry about titles money will follow if you add value where you work lordcolorado here and going back to school wo not start the career i want until i am at least age does not matter there is people that do not go back until they are slothvibes data engineering ask to work on the analytics project too you are perfect and it pays more than ds da ml ops engineer too check them out look at jobs descriptions online dm folks on linkedin who look like experts or leaders if you can find them and nab some time tell them literally that you want to have a successful path like them and ask if you can have minute chat recoveringphysicist i would be concerned about your foundational knowledge of mathematics if i were interviewing you for a data scientist role data engineering however i suspect will judge a lot more on what you can do with the tools and worry less about theoretical underpinnings you are young i moved from it network analyst to ops manager then swe and finally data scientist recently all of it after being old atm zestyclosetheoryit is never too late you always have time to continue and reach for your goals i am going back to school this year for my aa i have an uncle in his late that takes college courses for the joy of learning it is never too late wouldomesticationnever just a software engineer with an appreciation and understanding of ds is very very valuable you do not need to change fields you will get paired up direct with a ds on a project i am a manager for teams like this the best combo is a ds sde side by side i do not trust the ds to write quality production code sorry it is true and sde obviously does not have the ds chops but together good combo there are alot of sdes that have zero interest in ds and they will be a poor choice for a project with a ds but it sounds liek you would be ideal kscarbon i am and working on my masters i finished my bachelor is years ago it is never too late to work on your education separate from that of course it is possible to transition to data science without formal education but it definitely makes it harder they way i look at it and the way my life worked out so far would you rather spend years working your way up into a data science roll or would you rather spend less time on education and get to the same spot clicketrie i turn in may i did not have my first job in data till i was you have got a crazy amount of time also if you get real good at coding and also learn analytics and stats it could potentially be possible to go from swe straight to ds orgodemir python dev experience puts you in a great spot take the fastai courses at whatever pace you are comfortable with they use python and there is a course on machine learning and a couple in deep learning i have gone through every iteration of their courses even though they have repeated content multiple times because they are up to date with teaching the latest research and i feel like i learn something every time after you take those and learn that content you will have the ability to pass data science interviews the next thing is to get in the door for the interviews i do not recommend any other certs they do not really add much for recruiters in my experience i would recommend finding the cheapest easiest masters in data analytics program you can there are more out there now which are less than years i i have seen some that are only year now but i am not familiar with what you may be eligible for based on your diploma you do not technically need an ms but it can help your odds getting your first job in the field and from there it does not matter as much as your years of experience antalagor you need to learn the maths most people learn during studies but it is also possible to learn it by yourself cocodirichlet you are you are not even older in terms of college age you can start in community college and transfer to a state school later that way you do not have to go through a long application process and you can even work average age for graduation is something between and which means a lot of people are graduating later i could not find median age you ca not do anything without a bachelor degree steezmcghee i went back to school when i was worked full time and took classes a semester worth it you can still do it did sw eng degree at working full time can be done but clear out those sunday calendars clevermeatrobot shifting focus like that happens all the time i know a guy who did most of an me degree then shifted an got a bs in english started in me design professionally then shifted to swe after a couple years was dead in the water during the dot com blowup found a startup in software to join eventually specialized in data after many years of net stack oop now runs warehouses pipelines manages a full team of data engineers for major film and television studios i will also add that it took to follow that full path would have been easier with the right sheepskin instead of just a degree in tech degrees make interviews happen knowledge and passion make careers happen you can start anything at any age if it is what you really want to do and are willing to work for it desperate lol is young i did not get my first job until years after i graduated from college we just hired an intern at dude was grounded most young hires are way too starry eyed and unreasonable thecamerlengo is not too late you can do anything at this age breraw i am and a freshmen in college jimjamjermy if you already know python you can look up sklearn modules and practice writing some basic gbm code then look up online how gbms work you do not need a degree to read some articles or textbooks on the theory in terms of qualifications degrees are nice but you can also do a lot by just being proactive from being a data analyst think about the data you work with and build a couple of models that have commeecial benefit start with a proof of convept and show your boss and see about deploying them for bonus points if your company has data scientists male friends with them so you can get tips on the models you are making roastedoolong i got my degree in biochem and was able to work my way into an mle position admittedly i was extremely lucky to join one of the earliest ml boot camps before the field became what it is do not get hung up on the degree focus on the work and honing your skills however you can i always recommend start ups if only because you will learn a lot really quickly and can more easily switch between job functions simply by displaying interest gurumoves bro i am and just started learning software development last year i have a good job as a trader and still wish to improve and learn its never too late venticocainelatte sure go for it if that is your goalmight be tough or easyjust make the right connections and it will all work out do not see why not although i think the general sentiment is to get an advanced degree most data scientists on my team have a phd or minimum masters in a quant or stem field wildthought no hs degree here and my career is outlined at wwwandyblumio degrees are important for most and highly over rated for some nicksinghtechcareers damn major props mle aint no joke nude rating bot how did this route work for you what did you major in and how did you interview showcase your abilities bachelors mle is a pretty huge jump so i am curious wokasmasher this i went back to school for my bachelors at and am finishing up my masters at i have a decent job and work remotely working and going to school at the same time sucks but you can do it wouldeltaexdeltatee yup i graduated at and i do not think i was the oldest person in a single one of my classes usually at least one person in their is jasonsuave bachelors here with years of experience started as a data analyst and have been clawing my way to a data science title this whole time the bar keeps raising for data science and hamster is right that most employers now view this as a phd practice less about mechanically moving data and more about creating the value prop via data strategy that requires experience which is why i see data scientists still struggling to maintain industry jobs outside of the faangs that is if you do not want to go back to academia ml engineering and mlops is a great alternative that has a much lower barrier to entry wardrobecreator please listen to other people do your bachelors first take the economic downturn to your advantage and try to land internships i do not think these certifications are enough for da roles anymore there is too much competition and its only gonna make you feel more stressed and worthless in the market do something like econ or information sciences since it might too hard to do something like math at this point hell do an online bachelors while doing your certification at the same time zestyclosetheorythis i need to show this to my boyfriend lol he really believes that he ruined his life because he dropped out and smokes he just got his ged this year and i am encouraging him to continue his educational path i had an interview for a da position and the hiring manager was clearly a massive stoner nllspcvygr stoned for about here left highschool at to play music and waste time finished bachelors at masters at went straight into a senior ds position at a large corp and an on track to make principle ds in a few years you are not too old you could still beat me to a phd screend this was my route too and now doing my masters got in at faang fine but i was lucky to be around for the first boom of data in onwards so was able to get in via work experience and most of a degree xlnc are you able to elaborate a bit more on how you made that impressive switch in terms of education qualification experience role progression and timeframe mobjack python developer will open up many doors most da roles will not help you become a ds it is really a step backwards from swe in most cases no need for the college degree either but maybe for personal goal but costly and data science will change by then look at analytics engineering data scientists are not scientists change my mind i disagree theoretical comprehension is very important helps to prevent mistakes understand measure theory is indispensable what is mle spiritualquestions majored in math at cc then data science at uc berkeley for my ba won an ml competition at ucb very active on linkedin two mle internships one turned into a job active in the data science program at my school looks good on resume built ml projects for fun spent allot of my free time researching the skills required for ml jobs and how to get an ml job going back to uni for a bachelor and a master here it is exhausting to find a job that will let me go to mandatory activities but i am having a lot of fun lol swmpysouthpw i did am doing the same i got a bachelors in poli sci when i was started in an mpa program at realized it was not what i wanted to do at started a second bachelors in computer science at and will finish that in a few months here and i am planning on pursuing a masters in data science in a few years also i have got a decent job the job itself is great but pay is okay and benefits are non existent as a data analyst i am hoping to job hop to a better overall situation sometime this year but yeah all that to say it is definitely not too late even if it feels like it sometimes payforpluto thanks for writing this i am currently myself and looking into it from mixed job experience in graphic design and excel experience sometimes i have to remind myself i am young and able to do like what you did so thinking about going back for a ba myself amortizemedaddy hopping on the bandwagon as another late bloomer encouraging op to take the leap messed around through high school flunked out of college at then spent years working awful sales data entry and accounting jobs that made me miserable a particularly bad week at work finally convinced me to enroll at the local community college in march i have really been thriving since then i got a data analyst internship that let me stay on as a part time remote analyst research opportunities at my new university good gpa family proud all things that felt impossible just a short time ago find a way to do it op it opened an entirely new chapter of my life a much better one minastik i doubt that data science will still even be a career if op will follow your timeline yeezustaughtme are not mlengineering and mlops the positions that most demand a research oriented masters or phd the data scientist title has been watered down over the years so i think your premise about non academia data jobs should be inverted mattdamonstaco sure thing the first switch musician fish wildlife scientist was more a complete change than simple shift i went back to school in my mid and got a bs biology and an ms fish and wildlife bs ms after that i worked for state fed management agencies doing research and data admin mid even started an environmental consulting firm that did nepa and data management work for a bit mostly in freshwater fisheries that i eventually sold for not much to a larger environmental firm i started working for them managing a ton of data primarily in r and ms access and doing some biostatistician work eventually i got tired of getting paid shit for doing what i was doing which was a boatload of data management in support of the deepwater horizon litigation i started looking around at what other people with my skill set were getting paid in other industries a lot more and i posted a thread on r consulting wondering whether a fisheries guy would ever get an interview as a data scientist early someone saw that post pinged me about it interviewed me and offered me a job within a month feb they took notice because i had solid r skills that was a consulting gig i bailed on that in early and moved into being a ds in digital healthcare i was contacted by a faang recruiter in october about hiring interviewed in jan feb and came on board as a senior ds in march of general timeline pre musician bs work biology ms work state federal environmental fish wildlife gigs biostatistician with boutique environmental statistical consulting firm consulting as a data scientist gig early data scientist in digital healthcare title bump to director data science in but they did not know wtf they wanted march sr ds in faang that depends on the domain the data scientist is in for example there are data scientists in the domain of chemistry doing original research i call that a scientist sikepyke_ machine learning engineer nude rating bot awesome thanks for your story cutewolfif you are looking into it you could also start smaller and commit to doing comptia certifications a net and those are some solid certifications that should one could help you see if you like it and two could help land an entry level it job ex it helpdesk without even having to commit to a bachelors those certs also regularly go on sale and so do prep courses sometimes you can even find bundles on groupon so you do not have to pay the full price i do have to say i do not have these certs yet but i was studying mechanical engineering and now i am trying to pivot into cyber security which is basically a specialized and higher level it hence the yet as i am pursuing those plus a sec as i heard this is how many get their start and plenty of people vouched for them especially if you do not have much experience such as myself so full disclaimer but you can also always pop on over to r asknetsec and r hacking or even r informationtechnology although beware the tech skills market is crazy rn to say the least wokasmasher if ds will not be a career in years we are all wasting our time what jasonsuave i am seeing the opposite yesterday is data analysts used to call themselves data scientists however when it comes to hiring in industry a data scientist is now recognized as a phd with marketed experience driving roi though designing models the data scientist is really the thought leader for example they field the question what type of measure do you use for error in a clv model and why hence phd level knowledge breadth a lot of people call themselves data scientists who are not even close unfortunately thus ml engineering has emerged to fill that gap that would only be data analysis not planning and designing experiments or studies am i right payforpluto honestly this is a great comment to get rn i had a meeting with my fil and a friend of his both long time it networking careers and this is the advise they have been giving more or less i am getting interested in cybersec too and just doing research currently before i meet with them again have a feeling i will end up going the certs way good luck on your pivot and would love to hear your experience later thanks again for your input on this minastik with the advancement of ai i really doubt it yeezustaughtme how is your definition of a data scientist any different from an ml engineer no there are data scientists that literally plan and design experiments and analyze data to generate insights there are data scientists that help design sops for experiments because of insights gathered from analyzing the data i can go on on the machine learning space there are data scientists that build and deploy models oftentimes novel architectures to gather insight on data generated from experiments which can then be used to generate predictions that help experimentalists with new experiments there are data scientists that build and deploy algorithms to help aid in experiments in real time no need to have a narrow view of data scientists my friend ps i work in a space where a lot of the heads of science projects are data scientists and in fact scientists some of them literally published in the journal of science nunyahbizzniss ai might make the job easier but if you do not understand what the ai is doing and why then it will not mean shit for actual analysts just because an ai can spit out graphs and numbers does not mean that the entire bi team can interpret the output our jobs will remain solely based on the fact that the hard part is not performing the analysis literally anyone could copy and paste code the hard part is interpretation and application of the results stop being such a doomer jasonsuave data scientist talks about data and application of ai data scientists designs algorithmic approaches to modeling data ml engineers build the associated data and modeling pipelines in an enterprise framework think of this as a bifurcation of yesterday is data scientist definition you changed my mind some data scientists are scientists some are not would be nice to have a title that made a distinction between the two i still struggle to differentiate between a data scientist and statisticians i feel like the latter are those that do what you described externaljuicealso the questions my company spends day after day on are way more nuanced than anything i have seen from ai so far nobody at a mature data company is asking how many sales were made in august what is the total revenue from the last quarters that was solved in some report years ago before any analyst existed also i ca not think of ai defining these terms can i ask ai to create a definition of production throughput at a factory or will a team of analysts and bi devs have to sit down and discuss the ins and outs of what makes up a production unit and then calculate and define it in the data yeezustaughtme gotcha makes sense that mle is are more on the deployment end you are definitely onto something about the statistician point that is something my manager actually wishes was the case nunyahbizzniss exactly jasonsuave exactly they make sure the models are moving in production and creating scale for more and more models over time they also do understand the fundamentals of interpreting model outputs they are just not going to say source data a for business need x that is still the data scientist",
  "deepcontractor so i am a kaggle gm i used to scrape and curate datasets and post them on kaggle which gave me the datasets gm title one day i too received an email like these apparently someone wanted to use my profile to showoff a gm title in some interview or something renokarchnmy there is an entire industry for falsification of job qualifications literally lie to get job at faang and the pay for the time there before they find out exceeds the cost to do this for people not living in sf sv or another hcol us city that net gain is enough to last through the next scheme until they have enough resume fodder to get it without fraud also is used by freelancers to fluff their quals for landing gigs linkedin purged a metric fuck ton of fraud accounts that were literally just pure lifts of other peoples qualifications and experiences not long ago nahmanidk all those projects i started and never finished must be worth a fortune therealtiddlydump people respond to incentives wouldiggernotalone i think people do this to make greater impression in some situations especially hiring if you have good stats on kaggle substantial can you actually change your name on kaggle if so how i cannot find the option muchbadgramer also how can i report this whoisslimshady happened to me regarding my leetcode account solved around question with under rank in recent contest people just randomly pop question like would you give it to me for some time and all cellularcone because he is trying to sell it to some chinese grad so they can get a job with fake qualifications note the characters in his email signature modlinska there is an ongoing fraud investigated by the fbi on fraudsters from russia north korea and the such they apply to tech companies using bought out accounts on kaggle github etc tk spoof their credentials and get access to companies classified docs do not do it you are supporting foreign hackers because its russians they discussed this in their slack community a lot typical russian behavior from washing machines to kaggle accounts justanothermortalman in kaggle competitions person could use multiple accounts to join multiple teams so they would be able to ensemble together models from or or however many accounts they have teams for a competitive advantage davesemployee do it make some cash swvch usernames are a commodity there is whole forums dedicated to selling them do not sell you might loose market reputation if the person gets caught gdawkins they seem to want to show your kaggle profile as their own and pinch some recruiter or client engineeringsouthern say yes charge him via monero then do not do it mammoth maybe faking some data for fakenews or smth i do not know what kabble is to be honest screend what is your take on becoming a gm any upside it is always looked super cool to me also congrats what is the point of having a gm title but not have the skills to back it up i can imagine some interviewer or coworker ask one of these buyers how a specific notebook works and them struggling to explain it lolispepegabia does that person think ppl will not realise they have been lying in a job interview it is sad tbh muchbadgramer the funny thing is they do not even look at the profile i have multiple discussions open in which i tell people that i am british etc as a result any employer who gave half a shit would see the fraud clear as day muchbadgramer competitions and discussion expert may take a few weeks to organically obtain johndburger what is there to report does this break the kaggle tos spanish sith report to who lmao the boss of hiring his name is russian and written in cyrillics the main signature big thanks for your time blah blah is also in russian and the with respect line is in three languages russian english and chinese makes sense to put these languages since the latter two are widely spoken languages and there are many chinese people in the ml ds community muchbadgramer that is against the rules wouldeepcontractor get caught and your profile is gone poof banned muchbadgramer i have already forwarded it compliancekagglecom deepcontractor thanks it is super cool to be honest you will have a gm title added to your profile and that is a nice achievement i do not really like the competitions on kaggle i just stick to datasets and notebooks for competitions i prefer to use platforms such as zindi africa machine hackindia and analyticsvidhyaindia since these places put more focus on text and tabular data related competition well yes there are some upsides of having a gm title i have noticed that my linkedin profile gets a lot of hits many recruiters reach out to me etc it has definitely helped me with some personal branding deepcontractor exactly there is no point of having a gm title without enough knowledge to back it up with hell even i sometimes get the imposter syndrome one should focus on up skilling after some time it becomes a good habit i will give you my example i started off in my current companyintern with tasks such as eda data wrangling and model training i am almost years and with constant up skilling i have gained experience and knowledge in some good stuff like mlops ci cd ab testing building proposals consulting building solution architectures working on multiple cloud platforms azure and aws working on data engineering and ml tasks on databricks and more stuff which i keep learning my advice up skilling is the key gm title is good for personal branding renokarchnmy the time between hiring and getting asked how something works is enough pay sometimes to be worth it also consider fluffing freelancer profiles to land jobs then just wage arbitrage to some lower paid schmuck who can do the work and move on basillimade the point is to use it as a resume booster the purchaser would probably spend a little time familiarizing himself with the account so that he could answer some basic questions on it some people think they can acquire any skills they are lacking after landing the job i do not endorse this approach but it is clear why someone would try it renokarchnmy i mean you do not lock your front door to prevent a thief from getting in you lock it in hopes your neighbor forgot to lock theirs and the thief takes the easy path these schemes are not narrow target exploits they spray and pray shit they may even be taking several jobs in fraud and collecting several paychecks much the same as the selfish asshats at r overemployed do targets that check are just ghosted if they raise an issue maybe they even use a british address when applying and are trying to fake being british who knows scamming is not personal it is a rapid fire take the easiest path to profit venture that is spread across an absolutely massive field harmxn yes you may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission source paragraph under section muchbadgramer i am assuming it is for a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 i would like to be able to report his name to kaggle to prevent him scamming his way into a university position or a job renokarchnmy sweet summer child justanothermortalman yes that is why he is trying to discretely buy your account off platform he is planning to cheat there was a large thread on kaggle in a recent competition where the winner was suspected of doing this by his own teammates and you have my respect good job omnipresentcpu analyticsvidhya is medium articles are always so helpful breath of fresh air when the problem you google sends you to them screend okay nice it is always been a bit of a bucket list item of mine to go after this professionally so awesome to hear your experiences super impressive stuff so well done projjwaldhar need some more advice is it okay to dm you muchbadgramer i think r overemployed is okay if they get the required work done then why do hours matter greynes but only if he did the transfer it was not the case it is difficult to report that renokarchnmy unfortunately there are poorer people than you who will be all too willing to take this person up on the offer start a dataset on kaggle of kaggle fraudsters like this person lol m0drwhy are this personyou not that clean manno one islet the man get what he is after asquirrelatemyfood wouldeepcontractor go ahead iamiamwhoami i am pretty sure a lot of those people are not pulling it off as well as they think they are this is top post on there right now had a zoom call for some training and they must not have known they let me in the second i joined they were bad talking me for not being there in person not oe but this is the only place i could think to vent cause you guys know the return to office tug of war stung a little not gonna lie i once worked with a junior engineer who i am pretty sure was doing another job on the side it was very obvious renokarchnmy it is a reflection of their selfish attitudes and unethical perspective i consider their behaviors as fraudulent as someone buying kaggle profiles to make money off of some unsuspecting client employer muchbadgramer good idea it is not selfish to do the job you are expected to do without going above and beyond for an employer i know unpopular opinion but i agree duping two companies into hiring you is unethical i would not report a person doing two jobs but honestly anyone who takes pride in what they do would never con multiple companies into hiring you i do not care if corporate companies are unethical and greedy and exploitative it does not matter you should do the best work and the right thing for yourself regardless of who is watching regardless of whether you get caught or not i learned work ethic from some of my japanese colleagues and this has stuck with me renokarchnmy nope it is not but it is selfish to allow that employer to think you are giving them for the hours they are paying you for as a fte and not as a contractor to then pull a simultaneous shift for another employer who is also falling for the same deception it is literally fraud the theme of overemployed is not i am pulling a late shift at a second job after i clock out from my primary employer for some extra cash it is i have tricked two companies to hire me simultaneously as a fte and both to pay me as such expecting that i am giving them my undivided attention throughout the work day despite there being no concessions nor allowances for staff level employees to do such a thing in their employment agreements because somehow i feel i am special and entitled to be acknowledged like the board of directors i am not a part of because i think my remote employment status and computer touching qualifies me as such fashislavbildwallov hot take what is effort in hours really it is not a factory setting a lot of office jobs have various pauses because you are waiting on someone is feedback while you are doing this waiting you can work on the other job and deliver results and as long as you are delivering timely results for both jobs well then you are effectively giving them effort",

  "therealtiddlydump wrong subreddit try asking on r speculativebullshit rngdz why are you spamming this nonsense in all the programming coding machinelearning datascience subreddits in the universe whats even the point of this post what you are talking about is the extrapolation problem all machine learning models are actually interpolation problems our data is only present within a specific segment of time thus meaning that our prediction is an extrapolation in the time direction this is why we encounter data and model drift because we fundamentally have difficulty extrapolating too far into the future if a model is thoroughly tested and is proven to always extrapolate into the future you get what scientists would call a law however most laws are simple in nature and nowhere near as complex as a traditional ml model moreover a perfect prediction whether extrapolation or interpolation would need to overcome epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty this question delves into the fundamental truth of this universe is it intrinsically deterministic or is it non deterministic additionally if the nature of reality is inherently deterministic are we capable of collecting enough data to make prediction with absolute certainty epistemic uncertainty finally if reality is inherently non deterministic aleatoric uncertainty at the most basic level of the universe then we are screwed and there will never be a perfect predictive model acceptable milk no streetperformer_ we ought then to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its anterior state and as the cause of the one which is to follow given for one instant an intelligence which could comprehend all the forces by which nature is animated and the respective situation of the beings who compose it an intelligence sufficiently vast to submit these data to analysis it would embrace in the same formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the lightest atom for it nothing would be uncertain and the future as the past would be present to its eyes awkward shift there is no way of any kind to predict the future if there is its hidden as long as we know otherwise they who have that kind of skill would be rich as fck however we just guess suppose based on analysis like timeweather there is a high chance that tomorrow will rain but sometimes it do not did the news lie nops they predicted a percentage of what could happen forbiscuit moving away from ai ml for a bit and focusing on pure mathematics i encourage you to learn about library of babel at the moment one has a better chance of seeing that future in library of babel the only challenge is finding the address of the said future event mizmato i will bite currently ai has the ability to make predictions based on data and patterns yes this is the basis of statistical analyses but it does not have the capability to truly see into the future what does this mean if you mean to literally see into the future this is impossible as far as we know if you mean to make predictions that are very accurate that is going to depend on the quality of data and the circumstances of what you are trying to predict this is not solely an ml ai issue it is not capable of anticipating unforeseen circumstances okay like black swan events understanding the range of potential outcomes of a given situation no more or less so than a human being given the circumstances this is due to the fact that ai systems are limited by the data and algorithms used to generate its predictions sure but any human decision is also limited by data and decision making furthermore ai does not possess the capability to form its own insights or draw meaningful conclusions from data due to the lack of emotional and creative intuition really depends on what you mean by creativity this is more of a philosophical question there are several instances of where ai have generated creative products therefore while ai can be a powerful tool to help make decisions it cannot be relied upon to accurately predict the future ml ai have it is strengths and weaknesses but i do not think these arguments make much sense no pretty much everything thing that is called ai today are just regression models they interpolate a value by comparing other variables that bound the value you are looking for so no they cannot predict the future but with enough data they canpredict a recurring complex pattern cscanalytics open a textbook and turn to the forecasting section theastyanax of course not what the hell is this without the full set of information there is almost no way to tell what any prediction could be the limitation of the already insufficient information will be what renders ai as an entirely useless tool unless humans can fully separate data from emotion ai can never reach its full potential luv you",

  "therealtiddlydump even in the case of an arima how do you meaningfully interpret an ar or ma coefficient this is a serious question it sounds like they want some sort of structural model sem which is a lot of work i am pretty sure that is why relatively performant univariate techniques were being used before low effort acceptable performance alternatively you could throw a black box at it then use some explainability technique at that to ballpark things for them this probably splits the difference as far as effort goes this is a common problem in forecasting asking predict the future and predict the future such that i have nobs to twist and levers to flip to what if stuff are on a totally different scale of complexity i feel your pain wouldevmasterflex forecasting with a regression component is challenging sometimes you have predictor variables with known future values and these are easily incorporated via say sarimax predictor variables without known future values are obviously more difficult to handle because you need to forecast them first it is possible and definitely done in practice but you have to be okay with using their estimated future values and the noise they introduce i see a few options here for accomplishing inference and forecasting tuse univariate for forecasting and multivariate for inference the latter could be sarimax or an unobserved components uc model if degrees of freedom multicollinearity and or overfitting are a concern try something like a bayesian uc model see bsts in r tuse multivariate for both inference and forecasting for the predictor variables you can go simple or complex to acquire their forecasts simple would be univariate complex could be another multivariate model for each driver tvector regression or something like it inference in this case is harder because you have to interpret impulse response functions these models are also only applicable if each variable in the system is endogenous they all cause each other in some way these are generally used in applied macroeconomics given the nature of the data welcomestats thanks for reply your assessment is completely right they do not care too much about the backtest accuracy because the forecasts are to be served as the base for asking for more headcount from finance and finance wo not really budge unless we can come up with a better narratives than more hc for next year cuz we are expecting more volume and in order for them to come up with a better narratives they need to be able to explain the increase in demand based on drivers that other teams have programs to improve on such as revamping the knowledge based articles which will increase the of cases that end up being submitted when customers go to the support portal i will first give it a try with the structural model using something like sarimax as some folks have suggested to me i have done something similar in the past in another place but it was not very reliable across population and ended up also using the ar based univariate model this time i am in a different company with more data to explore so could be a different outcome i really like your suggestion on black box models interpretability modules shap first comes to my mind but i ca not really picture how this would be able to enable the stakeholders to get different forecast scenarios based on different inputs they put in the model would this be a viable solution to be able to do that therealtiddlydump to be clear i meant the class of models called structural equation models which is a different approach to this sort of thing as a rule they can get complicated as for using something like sarimax xgboost assuming you detrend first if needed etc you are free to try if what they want is the ability to what if then not every part of your model needs to be highly interpretable you could build them a mini tool that lets them explore if macroeconomic variable changes more than we predict etc what is hard about that is when you need simultaneous_ inputs at time t at time t where neither is known beforehand that is why arimas are popular and also why they perform poorly for long term forecasts since they converge to a mean or mean trend value maybe you need to get your client to draft what they want and you can go from there do they want to be able to input values and get predictions do they just want a bunch of regression coefficients to base decisions on none of the above",

richest to total destitution streetperformertime to embrace the real agile mindset do not document a sht levenshteinn hah nice perspective my work has columns named like numberofemployees in a table that has an entry for every employee the column is literally just an entire field of it is intended that you sumnumberofemployees to get an employee count we have instances like that all over our database this is what happens when a dashboarding team is tasked with managing the database hiddennegev eventname name of the event there is dozens of them with random names and the person who created them cannot remember what they mean renokarchnmy accountreference literally a field that takes a string that sales teams mobile app dev teams lending teams etc all use for various things and they all just infer what it means based on whether or not they recognize the values mostly they use it to cheat sales quotas by changing it back and forth to each others employee ids also this field is assumed to also work together with other undocumented fields all used for various classifications of customers mulokisch ah we use it but we do alot of things to protect data eg encryption zykezero expecting that from any company where data is not the product is too much ds at a non data forkliftboi i have an excel database why are my dates in my columns all numbers i center the columns because it looks nicer tinmanthat does not even happen at company that makes tangible goods most of these companies do not even have a master data strategy let alone a dedicated team even at a faang it got that way from someone is perspiration people are going to continue to be employed documenting maintaining teaching others about the database irrespective of ai that can write queries as long as the request is sufficiently well defined ktpr lol idea of faang level documentation animalepton if we are not writing queries directly on chronicles are we even really trying djstillalive that does not fail but it also does not return the proper answer not that i expected it to it simply returned total revenue the real problem as of right now as alluded to elsewhere in this thread is that one could potentially learn how to prompt this to get answers i already have people who know how to prompt the database to get answers i call them sql developers renokarchnmy the ones worried are the ones that do not want to interact with humans and are now realizing that if they want to be non communicative anti social derps a computer can do that job infinitely better the others are just fomo posting to drive clicks to their shitty medium articles so they can have linkedin clout or whatever djstillalive returning would be the right answer returning please try a different query which it did is not it is a pretty neat demo but it is not replacing anyone is job quite yet zer0cool_ ditto im a data engineer enrolled in a ds masters gotta diversify your portfolio bruh herchuntsdirty learn database management learn some cloud technologies etc in general just make sure you do not have all of your eggs in one basket you are more valuable regardless of gpt if you know more than just one area you do not have to be an expert being familiar goes a long way bl00m00n zykezero get out of here with this russian nesting doll shit wignerville but it is not due to some new ai solution that r places people madmethodman i live in the us average age for people in hvac is like a lot of agriculture electricians and general repair type jobs are filled with middle aged people its potentially bad for the economy in a few years if theres a gap for these types of jobs i know this is different with different countries this is a pretty us specific issue screend i think probably because in workplaces this often is not the division of labour most data scientists and analysts i have worked with are usually the ones who most often find data quality problems and rectify before model build or analysis my take would be the community is downvoting as someone in college saying i guess this means this is a bit of a eyeroll to others here who actually work in the field vanishinggradient took some time to find it but there is a study to claims that global poverty levels have increased since the advent of the industrial revolution and capitalism industrial revolution enabled colonialism and capitalism on a global scale

quite misleading if the dates are not covered by the db okay hunt who says it is supposedly nice for the point and click sql reporting tool they use renokarchnmy my company claims to be data driven we have nothing resembling data driven processes mdm governance cataloging and meta data documentation renokarchnmy and innate knowledge of the existing databases coupled with intrinsic understanding of how each of those data points relates to the business state oh and they can smile and have a casual conversation that builds and reinforces relationships with their stakeholders that grow trust in

tech sectors laid of of their staff and it was because some new ai solution none deleted oh and they can smile and have a casual conversation that builds and reinforces relationships with their

individual human in the right context that level of performance is what ai needs to achieve to make humans redundant not just the level of performance of a human individual although i am sure some high performing ai human teams will shortly emerge auzaro nailed it tripplethink since we were talking about replacing jobs what would you tell your boss if he asked you for that data okay hunt i do not think they would tell you if it was part of their reasons do you think all those jobs are ever gonna be replaced who is doing all that work now renokarchnmy does not stop the executive team from chasing the new shiny in the form of chatgpt to replace their entire it and analytics staff because of bandwagoning and fomo pieces written on forbes that exaggerate its capabilities djstillalive please try a different query wignerville it would definitely get out sooner or later why do they need to do the same work you cut things out prioritize and so on i give you one example since they do not need to recruit as much they will not need as many recruiters no one will do that work okay hunt why would factoring in ai as a part of the decision to restructure a company get out the things that go into those decisions are held very close to the chest and seldomly ever get out all things considered i am of the mind that it is already being factored into tech companies decisions you are free to think otherwise",

  "therealtiddlydump most data scientists already have or are already pursuing advanced degrees additional certifications degrees etc are almost always a waste of our time but i wish to gain a quantitative insight into what most ds pursue after landing a job do job good get rewarded for do good reward is money sometimes reward is also new job title rinse and repeat dowjonesdogeones becoming a plumber is top choice subjectad_ mba for a managerial role in data science mba is not really worth it imo you have to understand that the mba grads from top schools like harvard stanford and wharton usually go into banking consulting or tech but primarily pm or strategy roles within tech they are not trying to become data science managers anonamen getting good at the job is step that takes some time after that start figuring out what you like about it and where your comparative advantage in the field lies do you like managing and mentoring people working on consulting or consulting like projects business focused analytics dashboards decks communicating and talking to people about science projects deep math model work applied science coding engineering infrastructure tooling etc when you find something that works for you that can direct your path for career advancement then you start over with a narrower scope and at a higher level it is basically a series of explore exploit loop as you advance in your career loop back to exploration and start again can also break it if you find that you are not enjoying anything then you need wider exploration datamasteryacademy i am a senior data scientist with about years of experience once you get your first job as a data scientist i can honestly say that you realize how much you do not know which is actually a good thing because that gives you the opportunity to grow you find out what you do not know the hard way mostly by making mistakes at work once you make a mistake at work you know what you need to learn me personally i have done bunch of mistakes each time i enrolled in an online course read books researched online asked colleagues basically learned what i realized i did not know a big part of being a data scientist is researching online about things you have to do but you do not know how to i also follow linkedin pages and posts from kdnuggets medium etc to stay updated with what is going on another way to grow is by seeing what you like and what you do not like at work for example some might like preparing presentations and talking to stakeholders others do not and they prefer to be behind the scenes so as you gain more and more experience you find what you like and grow yourself on that area also you get certain training at work too for example sometimes they ask you to learn a software and they provide training for me i became more and more focused on machine learning over the years and ca not imagine not being on a team with no machine learning requirements i also find myself being interested in nlp lately so my next pursued is to learn more nlp take online courses and read books i imagine this new interests never ends and you keep improving and changing being a data scientist allows you to that because there are many different ways to be a data scientist you get to choose which one you want to be over and over again shoo wee senior data scientist mbel_ i got my first job in at the time data science did not exist as a name the job was called analytics data mining i was hired with no experience my background is economics the company was a large telco at the time the company i worked was using sql mostly and sas to develop models i learnt sql sas on the job i saw r was starting to be used in the us so i decided to start learning it i started a msc program that lasted years after starting to work it was okay to do it and meet people that were working on the same industry but i do not think the msc was specially amazing i could find better content online i continued learning doing moocs coursera was a lot smaller by then and all courses were free udacity had some free courses the moocs were okay but a bit basic after some time then i started to look at the syllabus of good us universities most slides and material was available so i used that to learn more i used kaggle a lot to practice i would study the winning solutions i tried to select what i though would be applicable to a real world environment after a few years i started learning python this was by the time deep learning started to become mainstream i felt r would stop being used in industry as deep learning was done mostly in python at i started freelancing given that i had experience it did not take a lot of time for it to work note i am from argentina if i were in the us i would probably just get a full time job i can make a lot more freelancing than working locally anygeologistmost people will not need to go for anything significannot once they have the job you progress in a career primarily by gaining working experience rarely through any sort of structured continuing education even if it is advertised additional schoolwork might come into play if you want to switch career tracks or qualify for certain types of jobs but it is not strictly necessary in my own experience moocs are not that helpful in learning specific tools or concepts it is easier to skip the fluff and learn it yourself focus on what you are getting paid to do and cross that bridge if the situation demands it or if it is something that interests you joeythreethumbs while the role of da ds etc are obvious there are almost countless jobs out there that do not have those titles but where hiring managers would foam at the mouth to have quant skills i have a buddy who works at a museum doing cataloging research these gigs exist in any industry you can dream of where math and programming skills would make you a stand out monkeyunited i try to find opportunities to mentor others and see if i can be give back to my alma mater i also have more time for hobby now that i do not have to be studying all the time profit do not try to lay out a plan for the next years start working on a ds role see what you like dislike and just do whatever makes you happy uchimata ummm they do data science and keep studying data science so they can do more data science i suppose a more serious answer is that over time most data scientists gravitate more towards analyst type roles where they are working very closely with business stakeholders and primarily concerned with building models to solve business problems vs getting more into the data engineering side of things where they are spending time building out data and ml ops infrastructure and putting models into production what you spend your time studying will depend on which of these paths appeals to you more whether you are interested in moving into management is a somewhat different question than this and does not really involve any specific course of study rather it influences the sort of projects and roles you take on as you grow in your career personally i dug into the front end and ended up moving into management glottogold whatever you want many companies have an orderly progression up the ds or data or analytics track however if you want to open your own restaurant then that is fine too turingincarnate just get your masters or phd in econ turingincarnate nothing my goal is to be the best goddamn econometrician this side is the mississippi being a data scientist or working in ds jobs is simply a tool to that end because first and foremost i am a statistician and researcher outthemirror coasting what is the job title hierarchy does the below look accurate jr associate data scientist data scientist sr data scientist lead data scientist principal data scientist vp of data science foxbatcs i have worked in many industries as a ds and have found a deep interest in the intersection of embedded machine learning and either cybersecurity computer vision or wireless networking my plan is to go back to school and get an ee degree character i heard hvac is the new electrician magimas it is honestly one of the big perks of data science there is always more to learn the field is moving very fast is very broad and is stacked full with people with advanced degrees from all kinds of backgrounds there is so much expert knowledge around that you can and will dig into over the years i got a job as a data scientist after my phd in physics and since then i have dug into nlp deep learning models for recommendation engines non linear optimization problems and other stuff on the theory side as well as a lot of infrastructure topics on the side of the cloud hyperscalers on the engineering side it is really nice to be able to keep on learning about a lot of advanced technical mathematical topics and being paid very well for it at the same time all the while actually seeing your results getting implemented pretty quickly as opposed to my basic research in physics where the stuff i did might or might not be relevant and the only feedback you have is those stupid citation metrics it is a dream job for anyone who likes learning new things in my opinion but it also means it is not exactly a job for just coasting along you need to be able to deal with the constant development and constantly

ur experience what materials should a ds focus on to gravitate towards de thanks tfehring in many companies there are separate individual contributor and management tracks usually starting after the senior level the progression for an individual contributor might be something like senior staff senior staff principal the progression for managers is often closer to senior lead manager senior manager director vp cdo chief scientist naturally this varies a lot from company to company therealtiddlydump depends on the company of course but that is probably pretty close my org is a little flatter than that for example i am fresher could you tell me what skills should i learn to enter in a ds job role mbel_ yes us europe are generally where most of my good clients are from it depends how much you are making but us salary levels per year let is say will be very difficult it is not impossible but very difficult if you are starting out and have that goal in mind uchimata languages python sql and bash scripting for sure scala can also be very useful technologies docker kubernetes if you are ambitious airflow spark databricks specifically rdbms generally and postgres snowflake maybe bigquery in particular good to know kafka and related streaming tech though these are not relevant at many firms probably also worth knowing the basics of cloud platforms especially aws though gcp is also pretty popular in analytics azure exists but as far as i can tell those guys are pretty specialized in the msft analytics stack skills data modeling kimball inmon etc working with apis that is a lot but it will get you started i would say of what my team does falls into that with other vendor technologies that are easy to use like fivetran comprising the rest edit this is what my data engineers do for ml ops there are other related technologies like sagemaker that you might use as well really good podcast on ml ops here foxbatcs first and foremost the technical skills some programming language python r etc sql postgresql sqlite mssql etc linux highly recommended but not always necessary cloud aws gcp azure academic skills statistics most common and useful for understanding and exploring large systems linear algebra useful for modeling describing and predicting complex systems calculus useful for optimizing solutions soft skills explaining complex technical

  "forbiscuit it is very hard and even harder if you are married in a committed relationship have children you will be stretched in many directions especially if your work is not stable in terms of project pipeline and fires sacrifice of personal time is expected as you have to balance work and homework the more intensive the master is especially if you do math heavy program then you should simply dedicate one full weekend for studying catching up i will not recommend mba very early in your career yoe instead i would recommend a more advanced program while you have the course material fresh in your mind from bachelors mba is useful later in your career and also if you want to pursue mba it is not worth the money unless you are in the top not that the course material is any better but the network and alumni connection from places like mit harvard berkeley booth wharton is far more valuable than any other school in the market i studied master is at cmu while working the most intense two years of my life just got the job at a faang just got married and fortunately also got lucky to be admitted to cmu and suffered from legit hair loss due to stress kscarbon it is doable if you are motivated enough i am in my second semester of an online msc datascience i am going to school fulltime i work full time up to hours a week and try and work on school on the weekends i also have a year old that takes up a lot of my time my wife also works full time i listen to lectures at work and work on homework during my lunch my company pays upto a year for my masters so i figured i would take advantage of it whether it is worth it or not i guess i will find out when i graduate kittiesareloveyay as long as you enjoy the course materials it is doable i have been working days this year and doing a masters in the day and on weekends and i quite like it although it is busy with days of work it would have been a little much wouldatastoryteller i did it i was already working in analytics when i started a msds but i pivoted from marketing and had a liberal arts ba so i had a lot of skill gaps i took class per quarter and with the prerequisites that was classes and it took me years start to finish it was stressful and i was very burned out by the end but it was probably one of the best decisions i made for my career i learned a ton significannotly more than i would have learned if i studied on my own or relied on my job to teach me i knew i would not hold myself accountable if i studied on my own my employers i changed jobs halfway through paid roughly half of my tuition my advice give up your hobbies lol no but really i had time here and there to occasionally read a book or workout or meetup with friends but nothing like normal times although going for a run sometimes cleared my mind when i was struggling with an assignment i also used most of my vacation time to study or recover between classes and did not travel very much take advantage of professor office hours and the tutoring center if you need to also look up other sources textbooks videos to learn topics if you do not understand what your prof is teaching take advantage of networking with your classmates and alumni and professors that is a huge perk that you cannot get if you are studying on your own take your final projects seriously you can use them for your portfolio if you will not have relevant work experience make sure you really like the topic makes it easier to keep going when you have an awful prof or are struggling to get your code to run i may have cried and or screamed into a pillow a few times if you have a spouse and no kids and your spouse is considering grad school encourage them to go at the same time my husband got his ma in poli sci at the same time it is easier to study all weekend and skip fun stuff when your spouse is doing the same it was tough and i could not manage much social life but it was definitely doable problems when i took courses a semester it sometimes felt like i could not spend enough time with the material so i cannot imagine taking more than also group work was difficult when everyone is working and can only connect remote every group assignment there was always that person that would totally flake out things that helped reading the material before the semester starts so you can focus on reviewing and applying what you learned fyi my program was fully remote with sessions held in the evening it is doable if you are dedicated interested in the program i could not afford to have done it any other way but the one thing i do regret is the ability to work on things with my classmates idk what your life is like outside of work and school but there is only so much time in the day there are projects and events which at the end of the day are part of why you pay for a degree and not just a bootcamp that i could not attend due to work i did very well in terms of gpa but i know i could have gotten more out of my program if i had time to go to events office hours projects etc work in time with family exercise friends etc and it can get overwhelming having a well planned week and outside support is huge tldr you can do it but you definitely wo not get the full bang for your buck from your degree program if you work full time be real about how much that matters to you or not i have had two of my direct reports do this from what i have seen it works fine as long as your company can cut you some slack when projects are due or you have exams doortofreeside pain renokarchnmy there was little to no free time i had no relationships outside of occasionally seeing family for a holiday no time for romantic stuff massive stress and anxiety that are now permanent fixtures in my psyche one of the most stressful situations was having the cto at my employer calling me neurotically because they had some fire an hour before i had an exam and forcing me to work rotations that week as well i questioned my sanity daily i debated suicide more than once it took five times as long as i planned it would take it cost four times what i projected it would cost i did not have time to make the most out of networking opportunities i did not have time to really do good projects with guidance i did not have time to research and contribute to the body of knowledge overall i would say it was not even close to being worth it from a career perspective still cannot get past the hr autofilters with my resume still just working for some shithole that is stuck in tech if at best i attribute my current role to my degree then maybe we are talking about pay increase but my role does not use my education any more than my last one did i am looking at a year break even point i will probably be bankrupt before then or dead if i am lucky monkeyunited it is just a balancing game i took a summer session and one extra quarter to spread out the workload as far as intensity goes professors were willing to accommodate if when work gets busy it worked out for me it is pretty sweet once you pull it off because of the no loss on income work experience beepboopimmabot it sucks ass especially with a newborn in the house however i am lucky that i wfh of the time and i can squeeze in homework here and there during the slow days if i did not have this opportunity i probably would not be able to find the time polandtown if you are single dooable no idea how married ppl w kids do it goodluckonyourexams learn how to learn first will reduce needed time by a lot hshzhsnnahsbs i hate it i have had to drop classes and extend how long i am in the program i have recently started a new job in the last months had my girlfriend move in and i have honestly struggled with a lot of the coursework it is not super natural to me in a career change with that i was fortunate enough to complete the bulk of classes before my new job started but i have got lingering electives and at this point i am just taking the most doable easiest ones to just end this and get my degree already switchorganic it sucks and i have wanted to quit several times but i have not yet for whatever reason do not get me wrong i love learning and i love what i am studying i just want my free time back and to be able to make plans longer than a weekend burn out is real so be aware of it and nip it early it feels so much worse in a part time program imo lariatadvancei did both of my ma degrees and my phd that way but with my phd along with working full time i was also the father to four daughters and raising them with my wife who did both of her ma degrees as a brand new mom and her phd as the mom of four girls it was a challenge and we made a lot of sacrifices there were many nights of soul searching whether it was worth it but we are exactly where we wanted to be now thelostwoodsman i got a ms in forest biometrics while working full time it was a terrible years i would never do again the only reason i did not quit was because i did not want to let people down that were paying for it in the end it was worth it financially it was worth it i did not have to pay for it and it has opened more doors that pay more however the stress was too much i gained a lot of weight lbs from stress eating and not working out i also missed out on years of dating which is critical the older you get i also missed out on a lot of hobbies and vacations it really sucks using vacation days and weekends to get caught up on school work poooolooo i just did this over the course of years because i let my company pay i was able to find new roles get promoted based on what i learned in my masters i took every class very seriously and did side projects during break i am thinking why not too if my company is going to help pay for it plus it is something i really want to do and can see the use for a data science more in my company atm i am more of junior data analyst mind me asking what online masters you are taking i am still researching options between an online one like georgia tech online or a local place with a masters program lots of great info i appreciate it i am currently in my early not too much responsibility yet and working in an analyst role i am looking to make that step into data science and a few online masters like georgia tech online caught my attention but it all seems pretty daunting at the same time aaloochaat what school did you go through i am considering oregon state data analytics since my company will pay year for that forbiscuit yall are a power couple how in the world did you pull this off kids too what was the age of the youngest when you started your phd kscarbon i am in the university of colorado boulder program i mainly started it because my undergrad grades were terrible and i knew i could not get in anywhere else it does not have traditional entrance requirements and is performance based admissions i like it because it is week classes that are do at your own pace if i have a big project at my job i can take a session off or take a reduced load without worry of falling behind some weeks at work are busier than others so i can take a week off and just double up on the school during the next week i do not feel it is as rigorous as other programs probably are but i also feel it is one of those things we are you get out what you put in so i try to really learn the material instead of just pass the class for a piece of paper lariatadvanceour youngest was and our oldest was when we started power couple i do not know about that crazy young and delusional might fit

  "dysfu i am mid career with a senior data analyst title the job titles i want to pursue are data scientist with a focus on modeling and most have requirements for a masters phd preferred so that is why i am getting my masters none you do not necessarily need msc or phd would it increase dramatically your chances of landing a job and have a more spherical knowledge yes grades are not the only thing that universities looking at i would say they are a depending one the uni make the rest strong and you will be fine rook i am not sure of the answer to your question but i am sure that having the skills to answer a question of that nature through your own means without resorting to asking reddit are skills you will need a better question might be how did opportunities in your career change with a masters or phd autumnotter you do not need one but you are going to struggle to land your first job and i question whether you will have the knowledge and experience to be successful where are you going to gain statistical knowledge do you plan on a double major also note that the only time i would look at someone is grades for a job app would be in your exact situation my general advice is that even entry level data science positions are often not truly entry level most people i know who are successful have a graduate degree and a few years of experience as a data analyst postdoctoral researcher backend dev actuary or other these people have domain knowledge statistical knowledge programming knowledge and understand a professional environment and how to work with stakeholders already i want to be clear here some of the best data scientists i know only have an undergraduate degree you do not need a graduate degree but you do need a route to get to the level of knowledge and skill needed to be successful in the job my recommendation to start is either go for a master is or get a minor in statistics after that expect to be flexible maybe you land a data science job or maybe you start as a data analyst bi developer or something similar learn ml on the side and push for opportunities at work you very well could land a data science internship right out the gate but you will be competing with people who do have master is degrees but no experience also if your gpa is below work on it it only matters if you are coming fresh out of school but in that case it does edit just to add based on my experience hiring machine learning professionals i would not even interview a candidate straight out of their bachelor is with a mediocre gpa with a degree in computer engineering unless there was something about you that was super impressive even for a data science internship there are people with master is degrees or data science undergrads or significannot statistical experience or research projects under their belt this is not meant to discourage you just to be clear that you will need to make an additional effort to get there in one way or another this question is asked daily although names are not representation of reality see tesla is autopilot the job is called data scientist in any other field the basic requirement for scientist is a phd usually this is a strange field right now because it is very broad titles can overlap and even have completely different job duties depending on the company but at the end of the day it is a job where more knowledge is welcome you might even end up doing only undergrad level regressions but it is the important part of the post grad is the ability to learn independently and have an entire arsenal of tools to distinguish real results from piles of bullshit im at masters and i feel i need to go back once more for a phd maybe i like to be beaten up maybe is just insatiable curiosity i got to the point where i do not know and i really do not care what is the motivation but the more i learn the more i learn there are things i would like to learn more about it truly feels like a random walk into knowledge you take a step and you realize you do not know enough so your take the next and the next the only thing i know when i finished my undergrad i knew what i knew when i finished my first master i had a glimpse about what i did not know by my third one i felt like i am an absolute moron edit i should have invented onlyfans when i was in college and do not get into this pit assuming you are an undergraduate student the best thing you can do is finish and get a job in the field you want after a year or two you will have a better feel for whether you want to pursue a ms or phd coinsntings i did an econ degree undergrad and i graduated with sort of mid high grades in my interview i spoke about any modules that contributed to my interests in data and what apparently made me stand out was the fact i would done multiple courses certificates alongside my degree in data related topics im currently working a data job and they are sponsoring my postgrad i studied biology at an engineering school and my grades were not perfect my gpa was a and i had semesters with before i brought my grades up i am in a phd program now do not worry about grades too much if your gpa is a or above engineering is hard wouldoesitevenmatterdo you mind me asking what programs you are looking into zombieieie hi i have a post grad diploma not exactly a master is degree but more rigorous than a post grad certification in data science dean is honor list and a bachelor is in cs done internships with almost years of experience as a ds and also published a paper on computer vision applied for over jobs ds mle mlops roles and da roles gotten replies and interviews still jobless assuming there is nothing wrong with my resume why am i not getting a job please help dysfu was just accepted into georgia tech omsa if i had a harder math stats background and had worked as a da for a number of years i would have done a mscs autumnotter assuming you are us or eu based if you are not that would probably be an additional reason that post grad not a master is degree would confuse me a little do you expect your interviewers to know what it means if not you could be struggling to get interviews as a result it might just look like you have a bachelor is degree and a cert your cs bachelor is is a huge point in your favor imo but it is strange to me that your interview rate is so low that is like a interview rate suggestions i would not assume there is nothing wrong with your resume not getting any responses that is my first guess the roles you are applying for are not a great fit for example an mlops role needs you to have both ml and devops knowledge and experience your post grad degree just looks like a cert to interviewers whatever it actually is keep in mind that in data science and related fields someone with a master is degree is entry level which is one of the points i was trying to make to op i worked in academia for years after my phd and i had no clue there were degrees that are not certs that also are not master is degrees your internships are great except unless they were at faang i would be as an interviewer curious why neither of them led to jobs my much younger brother for example got an internship his senior year of his bachelor is and it turned into a job i would recommend working on your resume maybe talking to some of the people you did internships with and seeing if they know anyone who is hiring and maybe try consulting you can often get some work experience at consulting firms though it may or may not be the most pleasant work life balance it can get you some much needed experience also consider trying to find a junior back end dev position applying for more data analyst data engineer positions or getting something like an aws certified solutions architect or similar in azure or gcp skills that are always in demand i will just add for a little context when i left academia i had a phd years of postdoctoral after phd research and teaching experience roughly peer reviewed publications and i only got maybe interviews out of applications i eventually took one of the offers that was for a data engineering position and found ways to do machine learning and analytics at that position the lesson there is just that even if you are super qualified a you are not qualified for everything and b not everyone will see you as a good fit spirited might what bsc do you hold i have been thinking of doing omsa too but i lack in math field zombieieie i made a post plz give me your feedback dysfu bsc in marketing and interactive media with a concentration in digital analytics at about junior year i realized marketing was too squishy for me from a value add perspective so i leaned into the interactive media and just made sure i did well in all the business stats econ sql classes i had to take as part of my business degree got a digital analyst job that turned into a marketing analyst role and just went from there spirited might i did information systems and work as a data science engineer in research but i mostly use sql and i m getting into doing biostat pay is not so so good i have been thinking of taking calc and linear alg then apply good luck to you",

by management if you were blamed for this it would be all you would need to know to never join that company full time theregicidalmaniac this is the best kind of story to use in future interviews you will frequently hear something to the effect of tell me about a time that something went wrong and that is opportunity to just say exactly what you did and why it happened most importantly it gives

it and move on i promise you are going to make more costly mistakes in your career proofrequired i racked up in cloud cost in one day recoveringphysicist if you burned you are barely even average at screwing up lnfrarad when i was a junior i deleted a prod database before i had mistakenly thought the prod db was the test db in my db client as it had a similar name horror felt like i was going to throw up but i forced myself to stay calm and to restore the db from the backup i did mins before the end result nobody was the wiser as the delete and restore was minutes apart the db was non critical it was an issue tracker no one was accessing it in that min window lesson learnt after that i never ever delete another thing without triple checking next i removed the connections to the prod dbs in my db client as it is not right for the prod database to be accessed unless absolutely required anyway third i realized the company had a bad practice the db super user should never be used for debugging a limited acc with read only permission should have been created lol this is nothing you could honestly use this story to your advantage later on if you spin it the right way insert first time meme do not worry about it if your ci cd is on circleci this issue would be nothing to your devops team whenever i mess up i own my mistakes and do not blame other people this is what people look for everyone makes mistakes as a junior it is your job to receive feedback and accept mistake as a senior it is your job to possibly identify where you messed up let people involved know about it and rectify the mistake js ai one thing that i do is keep a log of my bigger mistakes in onenote i usually have parts to this write up the part is a breakdown of what happened i want to make sure that i truly understand what the root cause of the mistake where my knowledge gap existed the part is what i have learned from the mistake maybe i went and did some research into a specific concept or issue and write about the most important things i learned the part is a write up about how to avoid mitigate future proof the same mistake from happening lastly the last part if there is one will usually be a plan of action to take to enforce part i learned this technique from an old manager and he was not a coder but he said that it showed signs of maturity good leadership do not get nervous down by one mistake own it do your best to lead the initiative to fix it and set a good example to others randyzmzzzz worse case you do not get your return offer that is it ticklecricket not mine but a friend used to intern on ligo a decades long massive physics experiment and made a mistake that caused the entire experiment to shut down for a month this stuff happens and the stakes of your mistake are relatively low calminky a senior data scientist in my company deleted a whole repo that was already used in production we were able to bring it back sh happens learn from it and do not make that same mistake twice letskeepgoingnow mistakes happen do not take these things seriously most of the jobs are bullshit just learn earn and enjoy life so i will tell you a bad mistake i have done i have worked public data science which is its own kettle of beans and i ended up writing some code for analysis that did not capture what the manager was looking for turned out it the reason why the analysis was wrong was that the de pulled from the wrong data set but before that was figured out i was fired for it i blamed myself for it over and over again and even when the error was found my boss framed it has still my fault for not asking the right question and i believed it because of idk some sort of pride that i should know everything and that is still haunting for me here is what happens in life making mistakes are either good or you are dead before you can do anything about it frame your mistakes as either something that you can grow from so that your team can see that you do grow through not only successes but from mistakes as well recovering from your first mistake show to your team that you can recover from the next one failing to recover from the first mistake shows that you might not be able to recover from the next one or or hey maybe not a bad time to look at other options as a way to clean up your cv lol maybe there is another better job with better pay out there whatdobees just learn something from your mistakes and remember this moment in years when your intern screws up its all anyone can do really wouldannythemanatee i accidentally deleted an important table while working an internship i was working in sas and no one told me that running a basic select on a proc sql command would replace the table the data engineering team was able to fix it but i had to walk up to my manager is manager and say hey i was querying this table and now there are only records out of millions what do i do they forgave and forgot by the next day it is all a learning experience and no one hires an intern expecting them to do everything perfectly learn from your mistake and if you want to really impress people figure out how to prevent others from making that same mistake a notification during ci cd a step in code review etc i never let a compute up and running to accumulate costs while doing absolutely nothing things that never happened for week shananayrodriguez i think people are turned off by a veneer of perfection at work and in interviews and in life you being able to say what happened the reassurance you got and the steps you took to learn what happened and how not to do it again show a commitment to learning from mistakes if you make the mistake again and again that is more of an issue you are an intern interns are there to learn tell me about a setback and how you handled it is a common interview question to me perfection is scary it means you have anticipated literally everything that could possibly go wrong and addressed it or you are lying i do not think either of those is trustworthy tangentc so while this is a bad mistake i promise you you are far from the first to compromise a key and will not be the last there is a very good reason github tries to auto detect exposed keys learn from this but do not obsess over it shanewizard sweet summer child you are going to be just fine annabellegt you are an intern you are not supposed to know everything and your seniors should understand that definitely be open and honest but everyone makes mistakes modabs everyone makes mistakes you are an intern it is your job to learn and help as much as you can but primarily learn if no one reviewed your script before pushing it to prod it is a failure of your leads not you whenever mistakes like this happen remember it is no individual fault you were just the one that exposed the system is fault a good system platform would not allow bad mistakes to happen through human negligence there would normally be enough checks along the way before damaging changes are allowed to be made the best thing you can do is learn from the mistake and think about what you can do individually to avoid repeating the mistake and think about suggestions that you can bring to your manager to improve processes to avoid the same mistakes drdausersmd best leave the country while you can you are probably the first person to make any sort of mistake at the company and they will be hunting for your head finallynotlurking my first week as a full time employee i deleted a prod database on the bright side i also helped us learn that our automated backups had not been working for months all told i think it took something like weeks to restore no one blamed me but we corrected the process so that it would not be able to happen again most shops will do similar and only a poorly run place would blame an intern aftersox two kinds of data scientists those that make backups and those who have never made a mistake before i make backups boring i wish my staff were this concerned with their mistakes and op fwiw when someone makes a mistake but owns it and fixes it or helps to fix it is instantly someone i respect regardless of experience or age odd this was back in the early my predecessor had gone above and beyond to create a database of all employee information by typing it in from their hard copy applications about employees i deleted all records from the database oops this is how we learned that the it department had not actually been making backups i retyped all of the information into the database if i have any advice it is that it is easy to let your insecurities make a mistake like this loom large mostly your coworkers just want to move past it be ready with a concise answer about how you will avoid similar mistakes in the future in case anyone asks and then just get on with the work wastefuldiablo lol if you only knew the mistakes i have made as a senior government employee brush it off and move on resilience xiallz mistakes will make you learn you are an intern and they should know that so they should expect you to make mistakes if they push you over just cause of one mistake then they were not the best team for you in the first place good leaders will help you and enable you to get better keep your head up and keep learning more mistakes are coming on the way and you should expect that just never be scared of trying and failing or you will never reach where you want to be dieeneuithulhuizen here in the netherlands we say stageslopers translated it means something like people at their internship only can break things because they are not graduated yet and still learning you may say they are allowed to make mistakes not on purpose as long as you learn from it so as an intern making a bad mistake nahh making a mistake that is good that is fine what will you do to prevent it next time talk about it maybe write it downand if you go by the lean philosophy if employees make mistakes it the organization to blame and not the people is not that beautiful krissears the people that made mistakes are the one who understand the risks the most let it burn in your brain and move on as an intern it is way above you to ensure these issues do not arise do not stress about it best thing you can do is be honest and offer to help hesanastronaut that is what internships are for learn and keep moving my friend teambob pave over the area and get on with our lives you are expected to up we do not care we have it security issues all the time happens no one really is gonna give an intern things that can actually hurt the company you will be fine keep pluggin untalweon i do not make mistakes at work cause i tend to do as little as possible at work so you are being productive doing stuff and that is why you made a mistake trust me team mates colleagues bosses and everybody appreciate more someone who makes mistakes but works than someone who does not do a shit hence does not do mistakes nashtownchang if you are to make a plan and implement best with automation how to prevent others from making the same mistake then you are doing the team a great favor generalblunder i was once doing some front end work for disney store and accidentally added n number of buttons to n number of items on the product catalogue page it was an infinite scrolling page with an open ajax connection that fetched the button from the product modal for each product in short i created an infinite loop that kept requesting buttons from their server thankfully it never went to live but they were down for a couple of minutes swallowedbuckyballs i once destroyed a large piece of industrial equipment by attempting to write firmware data outside of the allocated space we were using components but only allocating for long story short it turns out it is because there were issues beyond and that is why the chips were cheap i locked up the equipment pretty bad causing a seized device that basically destroyed it that was close to years ago though i lived you will be fine clicketrie you are an intern i would be wondering where the support was to prevent that from happening as an intern i do not expect you to do things flawlessly apologize and then confidently move forward and do not dwell on it figurettipy some mistakes i have made in over years of experience as an application and database developer updates and deletes without where in dev and prod truncate and drop tables in dev and prod i worked as an outsourced developer in a massive store in my city there i worked on a fraud case where employees stole money from the store by abusing a bug in the application and the daily sales closing processes they stole approx ud over year months later a procedure i developed for monthly wage payments failed to calculate the correct amount of overtime payments for people resulting in of them quitting en masse and filing a lawsuit against the store i ended up in court in both situations one to testify as an expert on the erp software they were using at the moment and how the fraud was intentional exploiting a bug that no one knew about and the other one to tell the jury that the problem in the overtime calculation was a variable that was not being set to null inside a loop i developed a year earlier and that the miscalculation was not intended to recover the losses from the previous fraud something the plaintiffs lawyers said since the cumulative error added up to about as well more updates and deletes without where but no more truncates and drop tables god bless transaction logs and i am not even years old yet do not be afraid to make mistakes learn from them someone who has never made mistakes will not know how to handle the stress when he makes them and even more if it is in productive environments when i was young i considered myself a white cat nothing to claim on my record now i think of myself as a tiger full of black spots and scars but wiser cunningcapy if you work somewhere decent you will be chastised and ridiculed for it take it in stride we have all made mistakes if they start holding it over your head look elsewhere longjumpingeggi have made mistakes big and small i have made mistakes that only i noticed i have made a mistake that cost a company actual dollars do not expect yourself not to make mistakes just expect yourself to take responsibility and learn from it acknowledge and move on and never ever dwell ymcmoots if this has happened to your team before there is definitely something wrong with your process human beings will always make mistakes at work it is our job as engineers to set things up to minimize the consequences acknowledging the mistake and moving forward is all you really need to do as an intern but if you have ideas about how to do things differently that would have prevented your mistake from happening not i will pay attention better that is not a real solution b c you and all future interns are still human but we should add an automated test to look for plaintext keys in all code that gets checked in or let is change how we do code review that is a really good ending to the story for future interviews if your team prefers to stick to the intern should pay attention better next time as the solution that is not a good sign and you should be careful about what other bad practices you are learning from them do not sweat it just learn from it and move on if you do life right you will eventually reach a point in your professional career where you will no longer give a fuck for lack of a better term at the end of the day who gives a shit if you cost some profit driven corporation some extra money the company would drop you in a heartbeat the second it became financially expedient for them to do so see recent layoff stories of decade long employees expecting mothers etc they do not actually care about you obviously that is not to say you should strive to make mistakes and or produce poor quality work but honest mistakes will happen our lives are vast and multi dimensional and work should not be the most important dimension if you make mistakes by being a bad friend a bad citizen a bad person in your personal lifethose are the mistakes worth contemplating deeply over those are the mistakes that should keep you up at night an honest mistake at work however should not if you as an intern can mess things up then it is not your fault the company should have permissions preventing exactly this xtrerk do not feel bad op in my first role i miskeyed a contract and cost the company about annually on a year contract not a single internal review occurred with the contract between me and the customer i owned up to it immediately and about years later i made management and helped reduce churn by about in a single year and it more than made up for my mistake paperlevel own it hey guys i dropped the ball on this one moving forward i am going to make sure it does not happen again by xy and z read extreme ownership by jocko willink people do much worse all the time your team is very unlikely to hold it against you netkcid knowledge is created during mistakes learn and continue on do not dwell reflect learn and go thingsbinary the first time i ever touched a key on a computer in a professional setting there was a mainframe core dump first job as a database developer i dropped table instead of delete table guess what i learned backup before you do something significannot in tech now yrs and a c level tech exec you can recover from almost anything technical as long as you learn the things you will not ever recover from are character related clichekiller i worked someplace where a senior systems engineers made a mistake which took a large multimillion dollar company off the web for an hour estimate was in excess of a ten million dollar loss he would been with the company for years he was called before the board and the ceo to explain his actions he owned the mistake and fully expected to be terminated for it the ceo asked if he had done it on purpose to which he emphatically answered in the negative the ceo then said he was free to go back to work and to please not make that mistake again now i know your situation is different but if even a senior developer at a mature company could make a blunder like that you will recover the key is to learn from your mistakes and try not to repeat any if this company does not know that you will find one that does andrewcooke i ran rm fr as root some years ago was quite interesting we pulled the disk and recovered a lot of the data although i cannot remember the details any more profoundly basic the director over data science at my company told me that he expects less experienced employees to make mistakes and cost the company more more compute money but that it sort of evens out because the guys that make less of those mistakes are on higher salary anyways also same company my water bottle spilled in my backpack while i flew to hq and i lost three weeks of work along with the laptop i learned to keep my laptop separate and to back up my work more often they still offered for me to stay on as an intern after the summer and eventually i got a ft offer when i graduated tldr junior employees make mistakes your seniors know and expect this just own it and make plans to prevent similar mistakes the key is being honest about it mistakes happens and no one is exempt of them but never ever lie or cover info just to avoid the bad news years ago i restarted a windows nt server that was finishing a chkdsk in my ignorance i thought it was stuck and the reboot would make it faster lol it was a production server for a manufacturing line big company one of the biggest in the world the thing has been running for about hrs and my fat finger basically reset the time the company had to shutdown the factory for another shift to give time to the command to finish what saved my ass well being honest about it and the person who suggested that action was me the command repaired a major data corruption that otherwise would have caused data loss causing even more downtime the important lesson is learn from our mistakes and move forward many years ago i deleted my previous employers mi production table which fed most of the reports to the execs we restored it but as others have said own it move on and learn from it edit missing word troposfer hi sorry for what happened i start training on ci cd i do not understand nature of this mistake can you explain teach me justanaccname shit happens code review automatic scan of local git branch for secrets and stuff are all standard processes for a reason not your fault greatbigbagofnope i once did a git reset hard on a piece of modelling code that i was maintaining it was run regularly to produce estimates that informed how significannot amounts of government support was allocated for the next period i was cleaning the repo trying to remove large blobs like excel files and images i thought i was hot shit after thinking i would just not only removed two months of significannot improvements to the code but also deleted two months worth of data i knew the only hot thing around was the water i was in turns out because i would been lucky with the branches and a detached head i was just about able to recover still lost the entire day is worth of work but much rather lose than and no loss of data in a system where backups were not possible if your management are competent this is a no blame situation a failure of process and a failure of review put you in a dangerous situation where you also kind of fucked up but in a way you never should have been allowed to do so the worst thing that should happen to you in a competently run team would be a sit down with your seniors to identify the gap you slipped through and a reflection on what you learned how you responded and what should change in the future this should not be a firable offense it was not malicious nor was it unforgivably incompetent besides a weird bill for one month and an identification of a security hole is hardly the end of the world tundur any mistakes made by interns are the whole team is problem who was reviewing your code where was the test environment who approved the deployment it is absolutely not your fault it is a symptom of a dysfunctional team that said for personal reflection do a root cause analysis ask why this happened framed in terms of the control framework all businesses are about managing risk how were they managing the risk of someone deploys duff code what safeguards were in place and why did not they work in this case chungyeung senior colleague first time i once booked an entire warehouse pallets onto a single bin in a warehouse management software they had to halt the warehouse for around hours rhodiarabbit an intern should never be in a position where the work is not vetted burtfrart the flip side of being able to work at scale is being able to make mistakes at scale like everyone else has said treat this as a learning experience this stuff happens all the time and it is just as much the org is fault fwiw i work for a large school division and had an error in my code that classified every student as below benchmark on a benchmark assessment they were shown as such in a report at least which led to a minor freakout i fixed it fairly quickly after i became aware of it but it was in prod for a day or so crabclaws backfinomy it is happened before and they did not learn from that mistake and take steps to ensure it never happens again this is absolutely not your fault it is theirs for not fixing a known issue and for not providing proper supervision and support to you why is an intern making these kinds of production changes without a thorough review and supervision learning what not to do in the future having proper documentation knowing how to recover from issues when they happen the importance of proper backup recovery roll back procedures etc are all part of the learning process and just as if not more important than successful tasks have you had a team meeting to discuss and put proper future safe guards in place icannotdomyjobyet op i have accidentally edited a timer value on a live system connected to a chemical processing plant value went negative and locked all systems out for half a day i could have killed people i certainly lost the company my salary in production i have since twice been promoted and lead a small development team breath learn move forward it probably does not feel like it but this mistake is a future blessing my first technical job was developing software for automatically dispensing medicine in a mail order pharmacy i failed to properly test the code and accidentally mailed the wrong prescription to several people a huge potentially life threatening and legal nightmare thankfully no one was hurt this was a huge lesson for me on the importance of testing and ultimately shaped my career for the better you are an intern you are entitled encouraged to make mistakes within reason this is part of your experience and growth for any good manager this is the perfect time to evaluate your resiliency and motivation go rock the rest of your internship and i hope you are offered i lead a team of plus data professionals and we make mistakes every day themootzpallucci talk to your mentor be open and honest with how you feel more than likely they have felt the same way about a mistake they made and everything worked out you will be alright and besides you are an intern they know you are there to learn and gain experience multicm i have made tons of mistakes in my career a couple big ones but many small ones in my experience no one is really upset when you make a mistake once but they will be furious if you make the mistake twice nidy lol how the fuck did this get past code review thepoorjew not your fault fault of the team equivalent ha this is a mistake that happens all the time i scanned every package on pypi and found live aws keys that is the name of the article it is not referring to me including live keys from amazon themselves intel stanford portland and louisiana university the australian government general atomics fusion department terradata delta lake and top glove the worlds largest glove manufacturer epistemole everyone makes mistakes it is as much about process as people just do good going forward erinmikail one time i accidentally changed our billing plan on one software development to lead to an absurd overage charge it was one of those per seat items i did not realize impact billing but alas did it happens and as many have said that is on your higher ups to put in safeguards so you do not do that also many companies if you email them and explain what not as long as it is not too egregious they tend to be pretty forgiving you owned up to it you learned and guess what probably will not do it again and will be like many of us in this thread that have stories to tell mosthumblestever google data mishaps night there is an event coming up in feb 21trumpstreet_ as an intern i made an error in a blueprint and it caused a public works team to dig up the wrong side of the street for a day mistakes happen bad bosses fire you for a mistake good bosses help you learn from them i learned the value of precision accuracy and a review process before publishing clearly convoluted future interviews when is a time you made a mistake and what did you do to overcome it almost every interview i have conducted and also been a part of you will be asked that at some point well opovercome it in spectacular fashion and this could give you a leg up in the hiring process make it a good story with respect your company should not be coming down on you too hard learning from experuences with interns where i am currently employed they should be involved but not in ways where they can pull the trigger on activities that could significannotly affect the business if they are doing things that could do that they deserve oversight to keep exactly this from occuring dberkholz a lot of responses have emphasized the focus on showing your manager and colleagues that you learned something this is extremely true if you do not explain to people what you learned it is not obvious to them that you did indeed learn anything next level protips share what you learned in a larger forum so nobody else needs to re learn it the hard way fix the underlying causes with automation so nobody else can make the same class of mistakes kreaturereport first day in a new role i essentially emailed a client list to all of our clients some of them politely emailed me back to give me a heads up while others called up our ceo that was years ago it blew over quickly since then i have been given more responsibility and my pay has increased i think people understand that mistakes happen sometimes also you are an intern you are learning nthcitizen a few years ago someone did a sudo rm from root on the main storage cluster and had the permissions to run it this is at a large company headcount on review it was considered this was an accident waiting to happen so permissions were tightened up i do not think the guy that did it was punished other than some notoriety i imagine some sys admins had some not great times though none everybody makes mistakes they can get over it and have more safety is in place necajesus we can take failures as a part of learning process dealing with them solving the problem thinking why the mistake happened and move forward is a sign of maturity that is work as in life clingfilmclanger i once cost my company in a weekend from a single line of code shit happens learn from it one of the best lessons i learnt learn from this mistrack and that learning cannot be taught noonecanfindmenow the only way to never make mistakes is by doing work making mistakes is part of the job admittedly there are dumb mistakes do not make them twice and in all seriousness if you do make sure you either know how to resolve it know what it impacts or make sure your contribution outweighs the cost of your mistake bboycage if it is any comfort to you let me tell you about how i once accidentally trashed my project team is entire codebase by mistake i was working on a huge credit scoring project with one of the largest local banks over here in my country alongside a team of people back in the bank is it department was getting ready to migrate from ibm is to gcp and i was in charge of backing up data and programs after a particularly late night i went to work the next day pretty much half asleep i barely had any time to pick up a coffee on my way to work so i sat at my desk nodding off mouse in hand i thought i was doing a good job at hiding how tired i was when i discovered to my horror that i had accidentally trashed my team is workspace in my drowsy state programs and data included since the rest of the team had gone into a meeting i had just enough time to ask the it department for help in getting everything back thankfully enough nobody noticed anything out of the ordinary whatever drowsiness i was experiencing up until that point had been knocked out of my system i still shudder at what could have happened if the it department had not been able to restore everything back to normal juyuju not ds related but my biggest mistake we got new desktops from usa i live in europe i did not check the voltage switch on the power supply it was set to usa i plugged it in and killed the power supply on brand new computer that was not available at europe at that time this meant no possibility of getting a replacement power supply thepromisofhappines lol i am i have been a director of development and left a full stop in code before that crippled the entire platform and i deployed it across the globe then went on holiday and left my phone with all my notifications slack etc in my drawer lol it happens costly mistakes happen everyone does them we forget or assume things if anything this highlights that there needs to be a way to monitor and report in real time these compromises but do not kill yourself about it i am currently the owner and main head of ds infrastructure with a fair size team of top of the game pros they have all buggered something up at some point vacuouswaffle i have nearly completely filled a university hpc compute cluster is filesystem by running a particle simulation with zero particles on for days effectively reducing the simulation to while true writeframeheader fortunately the distributed filesystem was somewhat slow and the admins noticed and got me to kill the jobs before it caused the other several thousands of simulations running to crash next batch of jobs ran a new version of the simulation engine that actually did nonzero sanity checks on the inputs rlyhim talk to your team every single senior member on your team has a story about their great big fuckup they thought would derail their careers it is a rite of passage in the field excitinghamstercongrats on breaking production happens to everyone its inevitable you will come back stronger so do not worry 2fast2smart2pretty you are an intern if you broke something the fault is on the person who gave you permissions i am a lead ds and i do not have rights to delete anything in production folders swappybizz own up be open move on unseemlyturbidity in my first week as a junior i made a mistake that seemed so bad at the time i was in tears i worked there for another years and now i cannot even remember what it was if it is happened before there are probably some systemic issues which make it more likely if your organisation is a learning one they may well welcome someone identifying the lessons from the error and suggesting more wide ranging changes which will prevent it in the future black box thinking by matthew syed is a good book on the subject consistent side the fact that you are so concerned about it and self reflective means you will be fine outofband git commit seppukku mysteriousstringmistakes happen all the time i always ask these questions what happened what is the root cause of what happened how do i prevent it from happening again write this out provide it to your stakeholders get their input and support drive the implementation of the fix to prevent it from happening again your mentors will understand that your honest own up to your mistakes and want to do what is right chitownpigfarm my fianc\u00e9 senior position did not see their client french bank included login info for a secure server in some text he posted the text in a public git repo it triggered an automatic security review by the bank and it caused a lot of chaos for everyone involved he felt terrible but the bank is employee should have never included that info in the text at all my fianc\u00e9 is company changed protocols of in regard to their repo live and learn alpakapakaal as long as you do not make the same mistake again if you learn from your mistakes it is called experience chasinggreenroads this this this although it was your mistake there were other mistakes made by not having the controls in place to prevent this from happening even more so by an intern no offense own the mistake which it sounds like you have figure out why it happened so what you can to solve fix it and move on we have all made mistakes at work before analyticalmetal yeah agree also good seniors do not mind the mistake towards the person you work things will sometimes go wrong i usually say learn from it so you do not repeat yourself talk about it joke about it own the mistake there is always mistake room in the budget help and teach others to not make the same mistake you will prevent more mistakes than you will ever cause yourself al the best to you all wouldfphd this and i would go further any mistake that has a material impact is a failure of the company its culture and or the systems and processes they have put in place i will give you an example i worked in a team that was being worked to the bone every request had to be done yesterday and everything was always late because literally there was two times as much work as there were people to do it so one time we made a mistake some numbers went out to our ceo that we had to then backtrack on and it basically made our vp look bad and that was a big deal so at some point my boss boss asks how could this happen bro i have not had a chance to eat lunch the last days i sure as shit did not have the time to ensure that every single number on this god forsaken analysis was right that is reflective of a set of tradeoffs that every company makes and they are normally engrained into the culture speed vs quality do you want things done fast or well are you prepare to pivot and fix something that was done poorly the first time without complaining plan for control or design for resilience you can either give only key people in the oreganization the right to access read write certain information or you can design a system that cannot be taken down for a big chunk of time by one individual making one mistake extensive training vs figure it out do you want to have mature documentation onboarding plans for new hires or are you okay with them fing things up on their own so they can learn if you want to move fast and loose and give individuals a lot of control and autonomy then you just need to be okay with the consequences which may include systems getting taken down jaccow as a former software tester any system that is easy to accidentally break is a badly made system make it idiot proof or the universe will love coming up with the right kind of idiot who will do that one thing that nobody will ever do isitfun exactly why did they let you make this mistake lulz thepromisofhappines yeah monitor and automation galore i help with policy in a few places and it scares me the lack of knowing in some places they do not know until it is game over most of the time it is analytics guys alerting them to issues lol it is not hard to setup some endpoints on slack and chuck sentry in that is what you should be doing as s bare minimum i have got custom heartbeats for everything that hit my niiifications system which will then alert relevant people via sms push notifications which even as a custome setup is not hard there is just no excuse wouldarkenoughtodance that is so good to know for my future internships positiveph this so so much the question is not who caused the compromise its what happened to make it possible what do we need to do to make this not happen again tangerineunderground this mistakes happen you are inexperienced and you are going to make more of them as long as it was not deliberate it was not through gross negligence you somehow intentionally skipped the pr review or something your work is otherwise at least okay you are totally fine obviously do not make that one again but do not sweat it leftyshuckles always make mistakes two at a time eh slothvibes big pp energy from you wouldroppanda only happy little accidents none deleted datadrivenpirate interns are blameless full stop idk man i have seen some shit i have seen an intern give a detailed presentation about birth control to the entire department as an example of risk mitigation i have seen an intern fall asleep during a meeting with the evp and after being woken up he apologized saying his place has bed bugs so he is had a hard time sleeping lately i have seen an intern get blackout drunk at a department happy hour but when it comes to work product code changes permissions etc yes they are blameless lol vacuouswaffle at one job we learned the lesson to not let the intern have the ability to git push f on the main branch our mistake for sure but i suppose the intern learned a lesson too financeandkebabs yep almost cost my company the other day happens toadkiller checking in here wouldarkenoughtodance thanks many of us will need this darkenoughtodance if they would blame them only and do not offer them anything else after the incidence my gut would tell me to run away anyway artaena i did almost exactly the same thing deleted a table with millions of records i owned up to it and they simply restored a backup version but boy did i feel awful about it darkenoughtodance still better than doing no mistakes at all right i would think that they are either lying or not doing anything significannot to learn especial after i read stories in this thread ohanse how would that message go over bobdope hope you got out of there sounds miserable r explainingthejoke mechanicalfan i have seen an intern fall asleep during a meeting with the evp and after being woken up he apologized saying his place has bed bugs so he is had a hard time sleeping lately i have had bedbugs before i really do not blame the guy at all it is horrible by that point he could be suffering from a month or more of sleep deprivation and no human is made to be in that type of condition people who do not get that just never had a bad beg bug infestation in their homes it is just one of the worst things ever and will completely break you mentally and physically if you cannot fix it and fixing it requires money skill with dealing with pests or a lot of trial and error the first two are just not available for the intern and the last one will take some time and that is how you end up months severely sleep deprived and even after it is fixed you now have months or years of paranoia related itching sleeping ahead of you and we are not even considering how some people have worse allergic reactions than others thesimulacra i mean that just sounds like the companies got what they paid for robinpoussepain i mean bed bugs suck big time and i do not think he dozed off on purpose not a great look but it does not sound like a work ethic character flaw to me stigmatizing sleep deprivation only leads to presenteeism imo wildogg sounds like a lot of management errors to me iis notreal i would still say the first case is blameless the intern was given the job of presenting to the entire department and no one checked in on them to see what they were presenting i have an upper mid tier title and i still check in with others when putting together a presentation no way should an intern be presenting anything to anyone without someone more experienced looking it over first sozoyokimura what is your story datadrivenpirate i was in the intern cohort with those interns lol we got hr which was outstanding back then a lot of the managers in the department just sucked at hiring datadrivenpirate our presentations were reviewed he just changed it after his was reviewed he said he wanted the wow factor and to make an impact on the audience he certainly did make an impact",

  "supplychainphd question how did you calculate outbound costs also i see total outbound costs are a sum of the outbound costs but i am not sure if you should be calculating that without knowing what the inputs are excellentbidto point unlikely a linear regression has many assumptions it is not just a line of best fit ols one of those assumptions is homoskedasticity you would need to check for that do you only have variable if not you will also want to check for multicollinearity went to the line level of the outbound shipments and spread the shipment cost equally across each line of the shipment then with the costs broken out at a line level i summed up the outbound costs by item supplychainphd oh fantastic in that case you would so something like sumc and populate down to calculate the total cost by assuming you are in excel sorry i am not sure i follow for clarity each row in the table represents an item id your comment sounds like you are suggesting a running total of spend for each item what i am looking to do is use the as the max amount y axis of a new graph and use the same y intercept formula to show how much increasing in overall inbound on time at a network level would yield in total outbound transportation savings supplychainphd in that case you would be looking to subtract your x intercept value on time rate edit formula thanks but subtract x intercept value on time rate from what this is what i attempted earlier but i am not sure it is correct i used the same slope from the item specific analysis but revised the y intercept from to the total transportation costs for example a service level of y y supplychainphd it is a little different than that you are essentially calculating the area under the curve right now you are doing an estimation for every value i know this does not super help also your constant is equal to the b value so the sum of all values from using the formula y mx b y",

exception of actual neuroscience lmao well i am sorry to inform you that this is not for you most likely you are looking at marketing analyst data science roles for marketing firms i recommend you find the big players in marketing and work your way down maybe start with merkle i know that the big consulting firms also do this type of work for agencies in this sector honestly i just write a cover letter and provide a link to my work to orgs i want to work with and they reach out to me when they have openings tortugajester i have worked in the field for years a cursory search for marketing mix model suppliers and you should come up with a host of vendors from big firms nielsen iri ipsos kantar all media agencies and then the consulting shops analytic partners neustar marketshare optimime gain theory fractal tiger analytics marketing evolution and the list goes on i know a bunch of these places are hiring too tortugajester a couple i had off hand google has a few really great academic technical papers on the topic that are easy to find savethepandabears sure are you looking for works on marketing measurement as a whole or marketing mix modeling specifically the classic textbook by rossi allenby and mcculloch also has case studies can you put together a portfolio to demonstrate your skill most companies are not looking for math wizards they are looking for people who know how to tune parameters what to do when the model does not converge compare models backtest models etc at my company they are called bayesian data scientists you might want to search for bayesian in the job description not just the title though tfehring the most reliable way ime is to just search for the relevant libraries data scientist stan miketythhon yeah i just mastered out of a long phd program i agree about how freaking long everything takes and how slow things move that drove me crazy and the theoretical masturbating in niche topics i am enjoying industry life way more so far good luck ah my apologies the center for medicare and medicaid privatefrank thanks i am in the uk though so i will look for companies over here im competent in r though it is not like i have written my own packages or anything and i have recently been getting to grips with stan to try to extend beyond what i can do with brms apart from the thesis i do not really have a publishing record which demonstrates these skills and i do not know sql or anything like that do you have any tips on what skills to add first to improve my chances deadlyvenomabuser great sources thanks savethepandabears thanks for sharing these i had not come across the second one i love its approachability nekokeki hierarchical bayesian modelling i would love to learn more about the application of this specifically to marketing as well if you have any reading or videos to share i am a ua growth marketer who is learning ds deadlyvenomabuser both are of interest anything you got would be awesome privatefrank i could work though tutorials in markdown documents i suppose then apply that to datasets i find would that kind of thing work privatefrank i am in the wrong country for that uk tortugajester many of those places have european operations so do not rule them out having a phd in your discipline plus competency in r is more than enough to get your foot in the door with the entry level roles on the da ds consultant track heck even with the phd you probably have a good shot a getting in on the r and d side with an applied scientist type role if that is more your jam sql is always a good skill to learn for any quantitative industry for the most part you do not need to have a ton of tools in your toolkit starting out you will learn a lot along the way and get trained on many things as an entry level position and again depending on the specific track or role you go for it will vary but the soft skills like communication and developing relationships are always important problem solving in general goes a long way savethepandabears sure broadly speaking this is how we approach marketing measurement at my company marketing measurement can be viewed as a three pronged approach consisting of attribution models marketing mix models and geo experimentation that works together to provide guidance on how we allocate our marketing dollars geo experimentation this is a nice approachable primer on why geo experiments are important and why we use them this is one of the first papers i know of that discusses the application of geo experiments to marketing some other papers code that are relevant for geo testing trimmed match paper python package based regression paper r library based regression with matched markets paper python package paper r library modified estimator paper tests doordash engineering geolift paper r library hybrid geo user experiment paper experimentation is considered the gold standard for marketing incrementality however it is expensive and can take a while to run hence it is usually done only once or twice a year at our company we run geo experiments across channels once a year then use the results to inform our attribution and marketing mix models attribution models attribution model overview package of a bunch of attribution models r library for markov based attribution a whole bunch of attribution papers here here here here here here and here attribution model is the model we use to determine short term bidding strategies and budget allocations across channels we use this to measure the near real time impact of marketing dollars to our business we use the attribution model to calculate the revenue attributed to specific channels which is then used to calculate the return on ad spend and subsequently to scale decrease channel bids budgets however because of people using adblock ios tracking issues and cookie deprecation ccpa gdpr our attribution model represents a biased incomplete view of our customer base and attributed revenue as such we scale the results from our attribution model by a factor determined by our geo experiments which we view as the source of truth marketing mix models bayesian methods for adstock and carryover paper bayesian hierarchical media mix modeling paper hb using category data paper mmm with sign constraints paper and opportunities in mmm paper time varying coefficients as you tortugajester already so kindly mentioned paper python package r library python package blog a marketing mix model is a gigantic regression model we use a hierarchical bayesian model at the geo level the model itself was developed by a third party so there is a bit of black boxiness to how the model is actually built and what inputs go into it we do know that our experiment results are incorporated through the use of bayesian priors on the channel parameters our mmm is in a bit of a weird spot right now but will eventually be used to estimate seasonal effectiveness of marketing spend as well as identifying any major shifts in marketing effectiveness in the interim periods between our geotests tortugajester to this excellent resource bank here deadlyvenomabuser great thanks alot expect a thesis credit for your username in a few months savethepandabears ha no credit needed best of luck in your thesis writing process feel free to reach out if you have questions i have been working with marketing measurement and mmms for a couple years now",

  "inmemewetrust force fitting whatever random jupiter notebook solution they read on a medium article on every project vs figuring out the easiest simplest way to solve a problem none basically it is all about the scope of your impact that happens along several dimensions working independently senior employees require little to no managerial direction for senior employees your manager is a resource to help unblock you not to guide you junior ds solve problems they are given senior ds proactively find problems and solve them work on projects with wider scope what this means will be company specific the available scope at a small e commerce startup is necessarily smaller than the that at a faang but in general a senior ds will have impact that spans a larger part of whatever space is available business product sense the dirty not so secret thing for success as a ds is that technical acumen matters a lot less than having a strong understanding of the business someone with a very high degree of technical mastery but limited product sense is almost by definition not going to be able to drive as much impact as someone whose has the opposing balance that is not to say that technical mastery does not matter of course and especially at very large companies there is room for tech masters but in many cases tech mastery will only get you so far influencing stakeholders to drive business results training models and generating insights is all fine and dandy but you need to get the company to do something with those insights acting as a force multiplier for other ds lots of ways that this happens mentoring tech advising etc the whole idea is that as you become more senior your work will less and less resemble sitting around with your datasets and your various notebooks and more and more look kind of like managing only you do not have the manager title switchorganic the ability to work mostly autonomously on problems of varying difficulties i expect a senior to be able to do more faster and with less help juniors focus on technical knowledge seniors focus on business impact main difference the senior communicates with stakeholders without major issues asks the right questions knows the business presents the key insights style juniors need a problem to be explained in pure technical terms when they are first getting started they may see a request from a business stakeholder then a manager more senior person on the team needs to translate the request into something like create some plots using these measures break it out by xy and z they may also think the first step is to build a model seniors will usually be able to take a request from the business and just run with it even if it may be a little open ended they may also know what to look out for if they have been working in that area for awhile or they can take the analysis a step further by making an actionable recommendation or size the business impact bwandowando junior datascientists tends to focus on the technical part the model generation the hyperparameters minimal eda etc senior datascientists focuses on the ways on how to break down the problem into

  "my company and i have heard this is true at faang level companies too has assured me many times that if we do anything that compromises customer data or is even unethical we will be fired and possibly sued jeremymiles i think you need to distinguish unethical and illegal it is not illegal to try different sets of covariates and different outlier deletion rules until you get a result that a client or your manager will like it is probably unethical itiskaro not illegal but unethical when i worked for a former employer a start up i told them that the charts they present to stakeholders are manipulated different scales so it made one project look significannotly bigger than the other and that was also the conclusion of this slide project a grew twice as fast as project b when i pointed it out the ceo said that the slide deck was already sent out and it would make him look stupid if he changed it so he just lied and went with the manipulated data i did not work there for much longer therealdaviddavis imo it is really hard to stop this from happening if you put the data in a project managers hands in a format where they can modify the data most project mangers are more interested in telling a story that gets them funding than the actual truth behind the data where as we generally care more about the story the data tells than how a business person is going to try to spin it i had one manager suggest leveraging client social media profiles to determine financial status aka base credit decisions off if they post about a divorce getting fired etc i am not sure how illegal that is if they make that info public but at the very least it seemed super scummy i just ignored it and he never brought it up again but i am not sure how i would have handled it if he gave me an explicit task like that to work on scraping client social media profiles and assigned me a ticket or something i think i would probably talk to someone higher up about it and if the higher ups were okay with it too i would be looking for another job i do not remember ever being asked to do anything illegal with data though i have worked at companies and with clients who in my opinion took insufficient care with the secure handling of private data i worked in credit scoring for a large international bank whose name most people would recognize universally the direction i received from middle management through executive management was to be extra careful to obey the law occasionally things were referred to the legal department for clarification non jabroniredditor ever asked to do something illegal no ever witnessed something illegal yes kylelowryonlyfans there is a fine line between illegal and unethical but not so much between unethical and story telling i have been nudged to give advice that stretches the conclusion of a result but i always announce that is what they are getting from me since i am the stats ds person in ad research they usually just listen to my advice which is often not great for their story however in this field folks f up constantly missing data bad processing typos forgotten constraints we just go back to the client and explain ourselves since

  "canyoupleasechill he is not hating on it he is calling out the ridiculous hype by the general public and putting the product into context there is no issue whatsoever with yann lecun saying it is nothing revolutionary although that is the way it is perceived in the public it is just that you know it is well put together it is nicely done recently a princeton computer science professor called it a bullshit generator which is also a fair assessment spiritualquestions i think if you are not able to step back out of your ai or data science shoes for a moment and view what chat gpt and other recent generative models can do you are missing out i also think ai experts are afraid to be wowed because it may make them wrongly feel less intelligent or knowledgable if they react in the same way the average person does i work as an ml engineer and although the idea of just throwing more data at a big language model may be looked down upon i think that when i take off my mle hat and see what it can do its pretty cool i think many people in the field may have a bit of an ego not saying specifically yann and are not able to just enjoy the new technology also if you pick apart and find flaws in the newest most impressive thing it kind of makes you seem above whatever that thing is this can be an act of ego or it can be genuine but often when people do not put much effort into explaining why the technology is not impressive that is when it is probably ego edit spelling millenialwh probably meta has a lot to to answer for withalmost everything in its portfolio take anything they say with a grain of salt but honestly chatgpt is more impressive for its infrastructure and sheer scale more than anything they have got a team of folks in kenya moderating content for a day and they just hired labelers from eastern europe and asia the model has billion parameters the azure instance is secret of course but the size of that must be obscene the model is sound and pretty innovative but the pipeline and tech infrastructure is the real engineering marvel the human labeling and moderation really kind of take away from the awe factor for me kontolzgedeeverytime yann lecun post something in twitter just see the replies see all the accounts calling him out read their profiles most of them are the typical twitter grifters tech influencers podcasters or ceos of either some ai pyramid schemes or bullshit startups almost none of them are actual scientists or data science professionals most ai and ml researchers are agreeing with yann none of what he said is even remotely controversial let alone hating heck even ex creators of chatgpt are agreeing with yan i really hate all these twitter tech grifters seriously he is mad that he is working on cooler stuff that is not public but chatgpt is getting all the media attention happysummerdid he say anything beyond the not revolutionary comment mydictainabox he is right it is a solid language model but that is it the articles talking about people losing jobs to an ai that frequently produces bullshit answers is what i find irritating jjhero not hating in my opinion just describing the product accurately i really do not find chatgpt that crazy and i am just a college kid streetperformeri have posted similar opinions in linkedin and only found an awkward silence chatgpt can be an impressive tool for certain tasks but it lacks important general features for example reasoning and this is not an emergent property that rises from the combination of vast amount of data bazillion parameters venticocainelatte some folks are salty millenialwh this it is just a bigass model that needs a lot of care and feeding the one kind of cool thing is combining reinforcement learning with the giant neural net they have built but that requires a literal army of people to keep up with ghostofkilgore this is it he is just responding to the ludicrous hype surrounding it mostly from people outside of ds ai the way some people talk about it it is this incredible step change in ai ml that is going to immediately change the world you even have people on this sub claiming it will basically make every job redundant within a few years that is utterly wild chatgpt is impressive but is evolution rather than evolution and it is not taking our jobs some people are just getting too carried away jobeta that is a crucial point it is extremely well executed and the user experience gives people aha moment that they have not felt in a while i think he is being a bit ridiculous on this one chatgpt is not perfect but it is freaking impressive and already very useful if a bullshit generator spits out better code than an entry level programmer then what now nothing revolutionary revolution does not start because a few academic elites thought of an idea ideas can be buried underground and never see the light of the day it is revolutionary if the masses adopt and embrace it gpt in itself is made by openai and the engineering work that they did to package it for public consumption is indeed revolutionary this is probably the first biggest llm that is out for public consumption this made people talk about ai and change their perspective as to what is possible or not it did not happen when a bunch of researchers thought of the base model architecture these are researchers at heart you are quoting they have no idea how to build systems that make use of their models for them its just trivial because they got no clue how to do it if it was ever so trivial galatica would never had the problem yann was describing mgeeeeeezy point taken what i have noticed is that he seems hyper focused on this particular algorithm instead of the faults in deep learning as whole which are very much the same as chatgpt it could also be that chatgpt related posts are being picked up better by the algorithms so i am noticing that more than his other criticisms saltysarcasticjohn he knows what chat gpt can do all he is saying is it is not a revolution really nothing more his main argument are there is nothing innovative in the way chat gpt works there is half a dozen more language models with a similar technique as chat gpt finally he admits that chatgpt although not being revolutionary is an example of good engineering okdependent bordering on slave labor many of the worlds marvels are built on the backs of the less fortunate blacksnowboader i cannot even imagine the size of the azure instance i believe you but do you have some kind of source for all this sweeetscience right when cicero came out of fair recently i was shocked that it did not get as much hype in the ml community as chatgpt cicero is both really really cool and also super novel it could potentially with enough care and engineering at scale run strategic game theory simulations in all manner of scenarios imo far more innovative and useful than chatgpt mgeeeeeezy he is made posts in the last weeks about the downfalls of llms and chatgpt on linkedin he went as far a reposting something that called it a publicity stunt on microsoft is behalf that is what made me curious of his intentions it literally got banned from stack overflow for giving bullshit answers it was making mistakes that an entry level programmer would not make you can see all the chatgpt is too smart for us is ai the downfall of all cs ds jobs posts and know why he talks to way he does especially if you know your stuff in this industry its super cringe to see the media brush it wrongly daily as the ai when it clearly is not it is a language model it is not sentient it is not skynet acewhenifacethedbase he is talking about it now because it is the newest big ai thing and he is a leading researcher and spokesperson for a big ai firm to a layperson chatgpt can seem like it is doing a lot more than it is i also doubt he has ulterior motives he has said publicly his firm and others will probably make their own open sourced versions of the same tech so it is not like he does not believe it has potential most tech is not about being unique though so from an academic perspective it makes sense it is about finding the right product market fit and executing on it however to say that models like it are not the future would not be fair either these language models will change the way we all work and yes that could lead to the elimination of certain jobs or at a minimum certain aspects of the job an rlhf based llm given to the public for consumption is not just engineering your model has to be resistant to all kinds of exploits and jailbreaks meta has released galactica which yann still defends up to this date that turned out to be a mess when people started to exploit it millenialwh i just guided it to create a mask overlay over an image for image segmentation and use douglas pecker algorithm to reduce segmentation points which it did well ask an entry level programmer that all within mins ofc its bad if you just let it regurgitate code it is immensely powerful once you know how to use it properly i am not doubting your experience no one doubts chatgpt can give correct answers the question is how many correct answers can it give from stack overflow overall because the average rate of getting correct answers from chatgpt is too low the posting of answers created by chatgpt is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking and looking for correct answers in order to use it properly you have to double check it is answers which in that case it is not that impressive considering we have had models like that for years in some cases not all chatgpt makes the process longer for instance it a problem only requires a couple lines of code but chatgpt spits out something incredibly long and wrong then the person will have to waste time double checking all of it it is a writing aid why are we measuring it in terms of the output it provides almost unaided double check it is not that how you should code you code and review your code at the same time i do not argue against stackoverflow using it unaided people are treating it as gospel instead of a writing aid it is like critiquing titanic as why it is not funny because it is not made to be like that although few people can find it funny you literally said it spits out better code than an entry level programmer which is objectively false everyone is treating it like some intelligent being that will bring humanity to its knees that is why we are measuring it is output unaided i said aided it spits better code aided why are you measuring it unaided just because other people are misusing it like that it is like judging a knife as bad because people are using it to stab people if a bullshit generator spits out better code than an entry level programmer then what now nothing revolutionary revolution does not start because a few academic elites thought of an idea ideas can be buried underground and never see the light of the day it is revolutionary if the masses adopt and embrace it gpt in itself is made by openai and the engineering work that they did to package it for public consumption is indeed revolutionary this is probably the first biggest llm that is out for public consumption this made people talk about ai and change their perspective as to what is possible or not it did not happen when a bunch of researchers thought of the base model architecture these are researchers at heart you are quoting they have no idea how to build systems that make use of their models for them its just trivial because they got no clue how to do it if it was ever so trivial galatica would never had the problem yann was describing you never said aided you just said its spits out better code than an entry level programmer why are you measuring it unaided just because other people are misusing it like that for the hundreth time people are making bold claims like its revolutionary and it will replace a lot of jobs because it has acquired human level intelligence when in reality it does not grasp basic logic and as a result gives nonsense answers we are judging it unaided because of people like you claiming its revolutionary if it requires this much babysitting its nothing impressive just like tesla self driving if it cannot do these tasks by itself and requires too much human input then it is not that impressive to begin with we have had large language models like this for years but it was never impressive because it made too many stupid mistakes and required too much supervision the same could be said for chatgpt the reason it got so much press is because openai is a joke company that focuses more on cheap parlor tricks than actual scientific understanding chatgpt is just a marketing scheme period also people are not misusing it they literally use it as intended they ask it a question but they get bullshit responses it is like judging a knife as bad because people are using it to stab people what have you lost your mind how can it produce any code if you do not tell it what to produce lmao and yes it could that is the keyword could almost unaided just telling it to create a function that does x it could still produce better code than some entry level programmer for unaided usage it could i could literally show it to you right now and bet a hundred bucks it can do that for many possible code but you do not measure it like that because it is the main use of codex it is literally called co pilot the vscode counterpart and not pilot you measure it aided that is the best way to measure its usefulness have you ever done clinical trials for medical software device before check how they measure that and get back here we are judging it unaided because of people claiming its revolutionary but it is lmao point me a software that aids you in writing code as good as github copilot have you even used it or are you even a programmer at all tell me a software that summarizes or provides brainstorming ideas as good as chatgpt tell me a software that creates automatic docstrings from a code none those do not exist and it is revolutionary because people adopted the tech and is now using it it literally started the ai hype and the ai wars how is that not revolutionary at all people who think the opposite are just bunch of in denials or do not have any idea of tech which i would argue you seem to be people are using it as an aid misusing yolo to guide missiles or adobe to paint nudes do not derail its intended progress it is a tool it has intended purpose people misusing and misjudging a tool like a knife does not remove the fact that it is useful on the very thing it was created cooking how can it produce any code if you do not tell it what to produce lmao great strawman thats not what i said lol and yes it could that is the keyword could almost unaided just telling it to create a function that does x it could still produce better code than some entry level programmer for unaided usage it could i could literally show it to you right now and bet a hundred bucks it can do that for many possible code you never said could you literally made a dumb statement saying that it produces code better than any entry level programmer do not try to lie and weasel your way out of this but it is lmao point me a software that aids you in writing code as good as github copilot have you even used it or are you even a programmer at all tell me a software that summarizes or provides brainstorming ideas as good as chatgpt tell me a software that creates automatic docstrings from a code let is assume your statement about chatgpt and copilot being the only software that does code aiding is indeed true your argument is still just objectively wrong in what world is that revolutionary is it helpful sure you are right that it could speed up production of code but i would not call that revolutionary when i call something revolutionary it breaks the paradigm someone figuring out a new machine learning model that does not have to drive off a cliff a times to know its bad is something revolutionary someone coming up with a theory to explain why dropout layers work is revolutionary a software that can create guidelines for code helpful yes impressive yes revolutionary no considering how many dumb mistakes it makes and how much you have to baby it it literally started the ai hype and the ai wars how is that not revolutionary at all you really know nothing about ai do you ai hype has existed since the but the ai winter came when neural networks failed we did not have powerful enough hardware to execute neural networks and neural nets were dead until more powerful discrete gpus were introduced that made it possible to train neural networks i think it was around i do not remember the date but it was around here that hype for ai and machine learning started to grow because people were actually able to train ml models plenty of companies started throwing around the buzzword of ai and machine learning to generate hype chatgpt did not start ai hype and the ai wars those things existed before chatgpt people who think the opposite are just bunch of in denials or do not have any idea of tech which i would argue you seem to be arvind narayanan and yann lecun literally agree that chatgpt is nothing revolutionary most people in the ml research community agree so are they all in denial and have no idea how tech works you clearly do not know anything about machine learning and ai it does not look like you do any research in the field you seem like a code monkey who does not understand math you act like one of those tech bro reviewers who you see on youtube you probably watched mkbhd video on chatgpt fyi he does not understand tech at all and thought wow this is revolutionary",
  "monkeyunited these are all great schools worth spending time to discover what they have to offer obviously one cannot go wrong with any of them and it is down to pros and cons i would also put cal on bottom of the list because of the tuition cost for an online program u chicago is what they say closest to hogwarts so that is another thing to consider even though you will rarely be on campus given that you have a job lined up already gt at makes a lot of sense especially during this high interest environment but of course there is nothing like having a degree from an ivy league or equivalent aaloochaat do you know if oregon state university is ms data analytics is worth going through my employer would pay for me to get my ms through them monkeyunited unfortunately i am not too familiar with the program if i were you i would attend any info session they have reach out to alumni for opinion research on linkedin to see where alumni is are working aaloochaat thank you",
  "colickingseahorse you could probably build a two way table of business engagement and behavior but you would have to pick one of them to make the cuts with i have seen something similar done where i work where we built a segmentation framework for probability to respond to marketing and customer profitability mariaadel but why not combine them in clustering exercise thanks colickingseahorse i do not get your question what do you mean by clustering exercise",
  "maybe use the extra time to self study and build different work self projects herchuntsdirty my job is the same so now i am doing a full time ms in data science i wish i had started sooner i have had this much free time for well over a year now lol i am in the exact situation as you just enjoy it man this is the dream ditlevrisdahl read a relevant book i am a data scientist myself and use off time to read up on areas outside my workzone such as databases data engineering cloud software cloud architecture etc bullcitypicker woof woof let is go for another walk that is what i hear anyway uchimata this can go one of two ways you can chill and just fill your time with other things which honestly if you are getting everything done they ask of you producing quality work and available for meetings as needed is basically fine maybe somewhat unethical but even that is arguable if you do this you are in a really bad position if the company needs to reduce costs you are very exposed to layoffs the other thing you can do is tell your boss you are underutilized and bring some ideas for other places you could add value and try to really invest in the goals of the firm with the aim of moving up in the company definitely harder work but safer both at your current company and in the event you need to find a new job since your resume will be more impressive really up to you i have done both at different periods of time one word of caution i have managed quite a few people who i knew were skating by but because it is such a pain in the ass as a manager to get rid of people it is often easier to just focus on your more important work and let those people coast for some period of time but that is dangerous because if managers do get asked to cut costs those are the first people to go and you might not have any real prior indication shit happens fast when finance brings down the budget hammer just do not assume everything is hunky dory just because you have not gotten called out it does not mean your management does not know you are underutilized skippynk i occasionally find myself in these situations earlier in my career it used to bother me i felt guilty i felt like i will lose my skills my job bla bla bla so i used to spend my free time learning random new things doing random side projects etc now however i just ca not i ca not imagine myself doing side projects and i never do programming outside of work these days there is much more to life than this job honestly i feel much better ever since i abandoned the idea that i always need to be sharp up to date with tech frameworks papers whatever where do i find chill jobs like this if you refer me i will back you up on anything at this job tristanjones workout learn guitar knit whatever you want whispertoke if you want to get serious i would look into learning on the side if you do not know where to start do some research or take a free mooc ie umich python data science course on coursera if you have a better sense of where to start maybe look into some certs like aws azure google cloud cert one other piece of advice is to enjoy the time while you are not self studying rather than beat yourself up about being a lazy pos and then end up scrolling internet all day which i have been known to do set some goals like doing fun stuff related to hobbies djalaskaandrew i am in the same position i got this job and within the first year i automated about of the workflow mostly because things were being done incredibly inefficiently using ms access just be grateful and use the time to improve yourself work physical spiritual health relationships chill remote job young kids no childcare costs you could travel around the us there is tons of things you could do with the extra time do not feel bad about it if you are very efficient at your job and your employer is happy with the output what is the problem sfsctc be careful because you could be an easy target for layoffs if that happens at your company there were some college grads where i work that were skating by vs some i noticed trying to get more involved and when it came time for layoffs they were let go if you are early on in your career make sure you are not stagnating for long periods of time moscowgordon if you have a good relationship with your manager ask for more work if there is nothing else for you to work on fine you do not need to go out of your way to be busy but people who ask for more work are usually appreciated and actual work is going to be more useful for your career than some random project you do on your own find out whether your employer will pay for a part time masters degree in ds or similar may be a great fit for you at this point if you do not have a graduate degree themanwithnonamezapp i know there is a lot of buzz around the topic atm but if what you are saying is true you are the prime target for the first round of white collar job displacement from ai treat the rest of your work day or at least some of it as career development time try things learn about different fields think of what will be harder to replace and one you find a new bearing grind to get it very similar position i do data science with python through dataquest that includes a machine learning and a comprehensive guide to using python for ds i have found some good stuff on coursera and google qwiklabs to help me get oriented in some specific areas i was hired by a small company as a data scientist i spent my first years doing standard ds stuff training and deploying models building data pipelines etc and some software engineering for data apps but am now spending a majority of my time in mlops and hpc infrastructure type tasks i knew nothing about designing cloud based hpc ml pipelines and was able to learn a ton via coursera deeplearningai mlops courses and data engineering qwiklabs cert they do not give you everything you need but are easy to get through and give you a tour of all of the important tools even if you do not need it for your current job the ability to create and manage ml infrastructure in the cloud is insanely useful in any ds context and you could also use all of this extra time to start a side business you may never have a work situation like this again so invest your time wisely i have learned data science a done a few projects as part of my course however have not had success getting any interview or jobs for data science most of the calls i get are for bi roles i am currently working as a data analyst and mostly responsible for migrating existing python scripts into alteryx it is the strategic tool picked by the higher ups in my area i enjoy the problem solving aspect of my role immensely which mostly involves etl reporting automation and building data pipelines i am from a finance background so might not be using the correct terminologies my interest does lie in machine learning but just op i have lost the steam of doing data science projects because it is not gotten me anywhere in the last years i have instead shifted my focus to building an automated decision making system to pick and trade stocks on my trading account hopefully the some profit makes up for the time invested so far it has involved api calls databases lots of an lots of python there are will be some element of ml dl nlp there at some point currently just focusing on identifying strategies which i can convert into python functions which will then hopefully make automated trades based live market data stream madmethodman same situation for months i did not have any work i think i worked hours per week really theres choices learn a new skill or chill out i chose to chill i took like small vacations in months it was great you do not have to be productive taking a break is important too and not having work is strangely very stressful i left and found another job i start next week nullmother and you are able to make ends meet that is crazy impressive i cannot give much advice in terms of dude projects but i hope you appreciate how much you are winning at life right now a lot of people would kill to pay their bills on so few hours poorgovtdoctor ever see that old movie office space thephoenixrisesagain all your manage to give you more work projects if he does not find a better more interesting job viviandarkbloomthis i relate to this so bad ramblinginternetnerd find a decent course with projects in it do the projects using work data profit be sure to include this on your resume vonmew get a second job or end your lease and start traveling pmagsr overemployed magiccreativity giving you an idea about where i am heading i am going to be hybrid between financial and data science i am seeing myself as a person who is going to be superior in both in addition to that i like islamic finance and planning to add the latter so you can draw three circles of these three and in the middle there is me goodluckonyourexams get a second job obviously whowasphones this is how i know the recession has not finished too much flotsam floating in this sea lfc i have been in a similar position for the past two roles i have had as well it sucks but the reality is some specialized roles in companies have different workflows demand i used my off time to enroll in an msc program in ds and to read a couple articles or work on some data projects to keep my skills fresh everyone wants to feel useful to their company but sometimes there is only so much work do not let it eat you up too much do you mind sharing an approximate range of your compensation op to others in the thread is the job of an analyst this chill always i am kinda new to this theperfectcannotelope being in your shoes months from now is my wet dream get another wfh job kriskoeh get a second work from home job and stack that retirement lol iremedydota the dream good luck matheusbigg thats the dream op i wish i had a job like that dm me if they hire abroad full remote hahahaha seriously let me know how you were able to get that job i would really like this job where do i apply grandzooby does your organization have a mentorship program either way you could spend some of your free time trying to build your network by having meet and greet meetings with people in different departments and by sitting in on other groups meetings it would be a good way to learn more about the company and help get your name out there as someone who is interested in doing more where do i sign up hey op not to scare you too much but i was in a similar job under contractlet is just say they did not extend the contract when the renewal date camewhen there is little work to do that is when i start to worry about the future of that job in the company varunaby get a second job casperwolf overwork there is a subreddit for it if you can get two more of these types of jobs then you are retiring in like years perfect opportunity for overemployment nayeh i am in a similar position unfortunately i do not have the luxury of working from home and my workload keeps my busy so i spend my time studying lately been focusing on python and sql content yrmidon this is the dream my role is the exact opposite dubgrips dude i would love this i would just automate that work and get a job doing the same automate that as well like my best life no refer me skettieddie i would reach out to your boss and ask for additional responsibilities do not tell them you have too much free time on your hands just show them you are hungry for more ri have this same problem as an analyst just here to commiserate forscientific reasonsplease pm me any job openings mindnmindegy i work like hours every day for more than double than than the average salary in my country i spent years like this had some private online training in working hours and started to apply for jobs with more salary within months i had interviews now it seems i will get a lead position waiting for their approval should arrive in two days use these days to learn as much as you can now you have a lucky situation got paid to learn that you want use it wisely squirrelsareus glad to hear that you are not being overworked what are your ultimate goals what inspires you write down them machine learning is lucrative but you can also freelance good luck gwizchrist i am just getting into this from a different stem field what tools do you use for your job as a pricing analyst absolute goals show me turingincarnate so i will talk about this from the perspective as an econometrician and as a student especially one who is interested in causal inference i get inspiration for what i do from the news nyc passed a vaccine mandate damn maybe i will see if this impacted covid rates an anti abortion law just passed damn maybe i will look at when romania banned abortion and see what happened there these are just two examples but it is where my inspiration comes from because cause and effect is everywhere in life thus always a new causal quotation to be answered with an innovative methodology so if i were you i would do that but with whatever your personal passion is minderbindercapital where do you work i want this job this is how i made it through my statistics masters program i studied and did course work while on the clock now it looks like i held a full time job while working on my masters outside of that i learned cloud infrastructure data management and data lake concepts distributed computing built some apps to serve models in etc getting paid to do nothing is a huge blessing if you use it to your advantage thesupercoolmarketer dude use that down time to build something on the sixe hesanastronaut enjoy the dream brentmaen oh dang it sounds like my dream job the only advice that i can give is to try to give yourself projects to do and build a portfolio i would suggest that you can try to publish onto data science machine learning statistics journals be they academic or magazines and join ds ml stats communities like this one and put out requests for comments to have people give you feedback on any issues with your project i am just an undergrad cs student and that is just my porknjellybeans yall hiring this is the way tlmozart get another job but do not quit the first one ask your manager if there is any project you can get involved in so you can learn new skills a job like that is the perfect job to get a graduate degree if you planned on one that is how i did it then i had graduate degree and a few years experience plus slow jobs like this are perfect for implementing what you learn self study get certifications ie tableau alteryx powebi google analyst find a better way to do things ie can tou automate things through python vba power query take some classes on udemy to learn what you do not know is their things in the dept no one is doing but could should junkbondjunkie self study and do projects maybe find an online course as a guide willardstyle i love wfh as a data analyst in my performance evaluations and yearly goals i make sure to layout the skills i want to develop in the next x months i make sure to budget about of my time for professional development i do udemy and uofyoutube courses that get me towards that and bill for the time r sql tableau api integrations ect i almost always volunteer for any extra tasks that are relevant to me or accept tasking and then figure them out it helps me understand the entire data pipeline from data entry input to deliverables i also spend a lot of time cooking and baking working out walking my dog and houseplant hydroponic veggie care even though not much time is spent working mostly sitting though sprint cycle meetings and then producing deliverables in under an hour i rarely feel like i have unproductive days find ways to enjoy it smothry if you do any microsoft stuff they have lots of things on the eventsmicrosoft site that are free what is the title of a job where you work hours a day i am currently waaaay overworked at a hospital and am looking to transition into data science i do some analytics now and just finished my masters though have no work experience in data science per se i want a job that is not super busy so i have time to build a portfolio suggestions where do you work i want to work there dimitriman you could just do things for yourself during those times especially if the salary is decent no point in shooting for the moon when you can be comfortable with a good work life balance bobbyfiend hello i would like to switch jobs with you cocodirichlet do an online masters enigt people get paid for working hours every day while i am struggling to even find a job as a new grad sigh what field do you work in lol this is my dream job i work as an electrical engineer and actually do hours of work a week it is one of the reasons i am looking at making a career switch to this field random incident overemployment is a thing i was in the literal same place at one point and i fell very far behind get a new job or really push yourself on your own to keep your skills sharp if you are not highly self motivated like me then absolutely find a new position umop i do not have tips for what courses to take but i can tell you this for certain my biggest regret of being in your same circumstance at my previous job was not setting myself up for my next job definitely use your untasked time to study and achieve certifications to make you more employable in an area that

thetanfree if your heart is not in the tech side of things which it sounds like try to get closer to the business domain can you organise to visit a store call centre factory or wherever the actual business of your employer takes place it is great to spend a day in the life of with front line staff to build empathy and insight into their work pain points constraints culture and values an added bonus is that when you then interact with head office types you can use the right language and demonstrate familiarity with front line staff which usually goes down a treat and will help you do go good work get noticed and advance your career where possible i always encourage my data scientists to spend several days doing this plus when i was in the retail domain i found they learn a lot doing

for more ideas on this arlandria_ i wish i had this problem i do not even know where to begin for that lol what exactly would these projects be will it even help is not like every side project already

on your resume nobody knows you were not busy moscowgordon this is a good suggestion does not need to be full time either especially if your employer will pay for some of it gobuffaloes i was in this position years ago not fully remote but able to complete my work in an hour or two i definitely goofed off some of the time but i also went out of my way to find ways to automate parts of my job and use ml to augment pricing strategies i also worked on non work related coding projects that i was doing just for fun learning i now make five times what i made back then because i grew all those skills so if you want to coast and that is not important to you coast away seriously not judging but if you want to get ahead now and retire early take advantage of the situation and use the time

never hire anyone to replace me again they ended up having couple others in team train and help a little if i still worked there and company thought about cutting cost either one of us would be the first ones to go i just finished a master is lmao synbiosvyse deep down most managers know roughly how much work you are actually doing if you feel like you are only working hour a day then they know you are either dicking off or just bad at your job and think you are taking a long time to do something however they may not see a benefit to firing you once you ask for more they will appreciate it

do it i do not see why the common worker would not at least try it either excel sql powerbi bakerinthekitchen you do not do side projects because they have never been done before you do them so that you can learn new skills that make you more employable to other companies higher positions the projects will depend on what you want to do in your career have you ever pulled data using an api if not do that and learn how to read the associated docs if you have then build an api align the projects with your hobbies makes it much easier to motivate yourself to work on them fancyeveryday is not like every side project already done or completed in some way by someone on youtube or the internet i cannot tell you how many random questions i run into where noone on the internet seems to have a good elegant or comprehensive answer despite the data existing out in the wild one approach is to think about problems in your organization that nobody has tried to solve yet and see if you can come up with a solution or at least a proposal the easiest way to find these unsolved problems is to meet up with people from the business side for a coffee chat and ask them about their jobs and what are their pain points right now it will give you a very fresh perspective and since you are hearing about these problems from people working on the business side you know it will have value to the organization if implemented you can also find people from your department who may be interested in helping out and put together a small task force managers love this stuff as it shows a ton of initiative and also shows that you can be a leader also keep in touch with the people you have previously met up with for coffee chats if you do decide to solution one of their problems they can help you out a lot by socializing your work with various levels of the organization getting you a lot of recognition if it turns out to be a good a project herchuntsdirty i had a hard time with that as well that is why i decided to just pay for the masters i have a hard time being diligent with self study if i am not in a structured learning environment if there is no deadline grading i probably will not stick to it for too long prosocialbehavior i do data viz projects if you want to collaborate to hold yourself accountable i am trying to learn more data viz front end work in svelte a common framework for data graphics teams at bigger news companies like nyt reuters wapo but it is becoming more popular for boutique consulting contract work for bigger companies basically data storytelling the pudding takes freelance pitches for an article and many other news companies do too their main company is polygraph which did stuff projects for google ibm etc just trying to build my skills to replicate some of the work but it is a lot of web dev stuff morebikesthanbrains go dig into the data at wwwslavevoyagesorg it is the repository for the most complete data on the historic atlantic slave trade every kind of challenge you could imagine exists in that dataset though it is very robust and interesting to work with just f around with it visualize stuff see where it takes to it is powerful random ass projects shows initiative mariaadel maybe think of doing project that could have a good impact in your work could be improving the models you work on or build new models think what business problems is your company trying to solve better pricing models optimization customer segmentationetc it depends on your industry of course okenowwhat is there something that you want to know from raw data i have a movie list and i was wondering if i can predict other movies that i like from that list i am currently figuring out if i can make it work using python sklearn zangorth there is an infinite number of side projects in the world so no they are not all done motivation is a fair point though i usually have about one month of motivation a year so progress can be slow woulditlevrisdahl a good side projekt is building a edw in azure synapse with devops implemented and maybe some machine learning as well it will get your hands dirty with all aspects of data science imwaymoreflythanyou dunno how you even got the data analyst job with this mentality and lack of basic research skills work ethic spidertonic try udemy thisvicariouslife i just wanna know how i get a job at your company lol i am looking for exactly that after teaching for a decade herchuntsdirty thanks for the words of encouragement my friend dominicex what was your job then vs now how much are you making now that you are making five times your original salary maxtothej if you want to get ahead now the sentiment on this subreddit is that you should not need to learn those new skills in their mind its unfair for employers to expect that employees have those skills because they should be allowed to learn those skills on the job and get to have the job because of potential edit why the downvotes thats the sentiment you see all the time icecreamtower i feel like it is a gilded cage on one hand making great money to do nothing would be fantastic on the other hand for me personally at least it is bad for my self esteem if i feel like i do not have any purpose plus you do not learn as much which would it more difficult to find another job after civilconfidencei work from home basically doing nothing not in this field though lol and it is amazing for me i hate being bored and feeling like i am doing nothing too but that is why you have to do things on the side when i am not doing actual work i am doing homework went back to school chores painting drawing watching a movie practicing improving my second language reading a book trying to build projects etc etc and sometimes i just throw on youtube or netflix if i do not feel like being productive or doing an actual hobby there is so much potential for growth and not being bored if you take advantage of that speedis notfree career suicide too unless op wants to work there forever and never gets laid off agitatedhedgehog_ someone linked me this the other day here is a great open source book on regression that i have been reading regression analysis with python this list here has all sorts of quality free data science books ditlevrisdahl i have stumbled across lists like what to read in if you are a ds de etc currently i am reading designing data intensive applikations its great so far ish through it cover data models and designs and lots of other stuff such as distributed systems i cannot recommend accelerate it does not cover specifics about devops just the research behind devops however i can recommend the book storytelling with data it have some good points and i use it every time i do a visualization spartanork sadly that is exactly the point when you get laid off you are middle aged you are expensive you are rusty and you are the obvious choice to cut cost and then you find a job that pays less if you are lucky this is a pretty standard trajectory it is no coincidence that after a certain age the average income goes down moscowgordon okay probably no need to do more school then you will want to just switch jobs eventually if things do not improve if you are looking to do more interesting work get paid more then just coasting forever will not get you there no rush though it is a rough market right now focus on studying the sort of things that would help get you a position you want eventually magiccreativity is the application of money financing trading investing without dealing with usury aka known in modern world interest miketythhon that is highly illegal do not do this none deleted nationalsurvey remember the first rule bruh thank you nickmaran that is how i became a data scientist i was an accountant with basic python and javascript knowledge in i started learning django and react i also started my ms created few hobby projects took few machine learning courses and applied to positions and finally got a good job fickle quality feedback right there motivated me to try a new project thanks canopey have you ever pulled data using an api not op but would like to start here and with something small what tutorial api would you recommend wideresidentperfect reply shwerkyoyoayo what do you mean by every kind of challenge in this data set can you elaborate cope harder gobuffaloes i was a senior financial analyst director of analytics at a small company employees i only had report as a director so call it what you want i was making around at that time i went to a larger tech company for years as a senior product analyst then faang as a data scientist for years and just started a new ds job at a tier tech company tc is now thephoenixrisesagain and it is fucking boring antichain if you really have a gig that pays well and only requires hrs a day working from home use that time to explore or build other non work related interests if i was lucky enough to have such a position you can bet that i would be filling that time at my local ceramics studio or maybe practicing the violin pristine test okay thanks for the suggestion morningdarkmountain what are you saying come on it cannot be that way is it really so nostradavid if is then why elon musk not jail he ceo companies badmanveach what is your source a cursory google search indicates that it is legal though likely to result in termination if an employer finds out and employment is at will jackmitcham can you cite the law please nationalsurvey swat team is on its way he will never send that cv jackmitcham be fair be patient be helpful jackmitcham no idea what you are talking about first rule here is about being patient of helpful i do not see any rules over there but if there are i am not bound by them princessparking also do not feel guilty if you do not work up the motivation to do those side projects if you are making a pretty good wage and your employers are happy with your output then you are living many people is dreams enjoy it bakerinthekitchen real python has a rest api tutorial that i found helpful explains what they are and then walks you through making the calls porknjellybeans i am not the person who said this but knowing it is historical data i assume it is missing data and full of errors froststrikerzero holy moly wouldukeofgonzo what does the tier mean wouldominicex good for you man how has your wlb shifted as you have progressed pristine test great man to be a data scientist at faang or microsoft is it necessary to have a master is degree as i have only done undergrad and do a data scientist really need to know dsa because as of now i do not know those concepts but heard that those are kind of prerequisites may i ask if you went to grad school or what kind of tools you used to get better learn if you used any i am in a similar boat where i definitely do not have to work a full hours a day and am trying to decide how to best use my time thanks in advance not really if you work from home i got enough time to work out and do house work etc spartanork oh yeah let me ask you this are you in an office right now please look around what of the people you see are over where are all the middle aged people where did they all go it is the sad truth i visited an office of an established company a few months ago a company that has been around for years i saw maybe a hundred people in there not one of them had white hair not one of them had been there for years it was all people in their mid to maybe tops iuse3seashells depends on your industry you definitely expose yourself to legal risk if you work with any privileged information especially civil action as an analystmeh frankexplains shut the fuck up about oe i do feel guilty i feel like i have no purpose and totally useless i bet they just feel bad so they are just keeping me employed so they do not have to go though the pain of getting rid of an employee i feel like ai will take this sort of stuff over so i feel depressed from that almost like i wasted all this time and money learning this field my other hobby is music and it seems like all this will be ai generated in the futureso i am feeling down morebikesthanbrains that is part of it it is been a long time since i used it but it is great especially if you are just getting started or are self learning and a year or two in the data is in spss format so if you are using r that is it is own hurdle use library haven iirc also so many fields with a crap field names means you need to learn how to use that data dictionary but like if you are even mildly interested in history or genealogy or shipbuilding or the slave trade or historical hurricane data or what were common captain names this dataset has something for everyone eta while the data is historic and has some holes it is very complete aside from like year period in the iirc the project has been collecting data ave building this dataset since the and continues to add new data at records are discovered usually annually gobuffaloes just like not faang tier debatably but you have definitely heard of them uber would be an example gobuffaloes i work a lot to some extent it is self imposed but also there is a lot of pressure to get a good rating at faang etc especially now with layoff environment and expectations increase as your level increases so it is never boss saying finish x task by monday morning it is more like if i do not deliver a bunch of shit by the end of the half year it will catch up with me gobuffaloes see my answer to another question below no masters here idk what dsa stands for so my guess is no gobuffaloes i was a business major and started as a jr financial analyst working in excel and taught myself sql on the job there i am actually very non technical for a ds i still primarily use sql to provide quick and dirty answers to important questions for the business i know enough stats ml engineering to be dangerous but not my specialty morningdarkmountain i work in a start up and there are also people in their i worked in two companies and yes after a while they let you go that is how it works in where do you work i assume that in regular big size companies there are people of all ages top rules do not fuck with the government or particularly privileged information obviously any job will have some level of do not leak our data do not fuck with defense contractors do not bring attention to yourself nothing implicitly illegal but you will get fired as soon as it surfaces jackmitcham i am not bound by that rule i was in your position up until last week i am a recent grad and the job i had severely affected my mental health trying to learn with online courses and projects became useless as i had no motivation after months of doing virtually nothing i started a new job today and i feel so much better granted i am a bit scared because they already told me this is a busy time if the year for the company so i will be working on projects immediately however i will get to finally learn and feel useful my two cents start applying to other roles clicketrie if your hobby is music have you ever played with audio data i am honestly not trying to self promote but there is lots of fun to be had and a career to be made out of playing with ai created music i interviewed a guy a week or so ago that is literally what he does might be something fun for you to think about for self study here is the interview dirt repulsive do not think that i have been let go plenty if they do not want you no matter what they will let your ass go from all i have seen maybe they might give you a grace period of a week before firing but usually it is try to log in call tech support and them saying dang man sorry if ai can replace you in the next years you have a weird job try to take on more human work and build skills as other people have suggested if you are truly doing a couple hours a day of work that a computer can do you are going backwards in your career which should be hard to do in this field i feel depressed from that almost like i wasted all this time and money learning this field i do not know how to put this other than you did not learn the field if you are on the verge of being replaced by a computer program i have been around a few years but there is almost nothing i do that ai could replace the only things i do that fall under that category i have been complaining about doing the whole time haha although your comment about music makes me think you are vastly overestimating what ai can do and will be able to do rationaldialog i work a lot would be nice to know how much really and when weekends because yeah too many believe they can make that kind of money with some slacking off you cannot pristine test data structures and algorithms thediano as a finance major working in commercial banking how can i do what you did lol spartanork i cannot say specifics but the office i visited was of a very big asset management firm shwerkyoyoayo yes i second this roles that will challenge you more and provide more training to improve your experience and skill set if you have hit a plateau and feel it it is completely okay to switch it up and go somewhere where you feel like your improving more as for the ai replacement piece i feel like it is more of a tool that can assist you in learning and doing more work than before as opposed to a complete replacement alrik start applying to other roles agree also in case you were wondering you do not have to quit this easy job of you happen to land a new gig two jobs means two paychecks shwerkyoyoayo thanks for the share this is interesting gobuffaloes not insane i would say i am at my desk hrs most days and maybe hours on the weekend depending on what else is going on can be more than that if i am enjoying a project or something urgent comes up gobuffaloes yeah not for me depends on the role though everything i am saying is that there is a path to success without those things not that my situation is the most common path to get there technical skills can be super valuable in the right role",

  "lunareclipsexx what the fuck do they expect you to do with literally no tools lol i am in gov but we have access to most tools primarily use powerbi for vis and r for analysis formertimetraveller when i run into this constraint and do not have a real dbms or cannot use programming i usually do my data processing in access and export just what i need to excel and as a bonus access vba is not bad not as good as net with ms sql but it is good enough for of things if you can wrangle it apprehensive ad all of these tools can be accessed on secure intranets if the organization wants it i have used r python tableau and bi on secure systems shanewizard bring a comically large calculator to the office and start loudly adding numbers in the database when they ask what the fuck you are doing tell them confidently my job jokes aside it is unacceptable for managers to not give you the tools to complete the job they have asked you to do unless they can show you how to do it with the tools you have this is a hill i would die on government can work fast you just need to know who the right people are to bug clearly your managers are not taking your complaints seriously enough ravingneuroscientist r bullcitypicker where do you work i work for usps and we have got the usual palette of stuff python r sas qlik and so on upskill your excel frankly you can do a lot in excel if you learn how to structure the data the right way drlanedownunder honestly this is why i left government twice the second time i started working for an ngo then found out i was actually working for govt since they were funding everything the restrictions on tools i could use how i could conduct and report analysis and the paranoia around sharing work were maddening when working for the british govt i was tasked with analysing public figures from another ministry except that other ministry published figures in ods open office format and our ministry did not allow open office and i could not open the files with my outdated version of excel i had to find a shady online file converter to get around the silly protections and even though i was officially a statistician my main analytical tool was the aforementioned outdated excel i feel your pain man my solution was to leave neitherwither literally no one gave you a real answer just make it look pretty you roll my way you will be fine my agency permits python r sql and sas for data processing we also have tableau enterprise this is kind of weird bevause i work with phi in all my jobs and i for sure use r and a tableau or spotfire etc seems like your employer is just being lazy about setting this up properly i think excel vba is your main option it is also such a small dataset why cannot you just do it all in excel lastchancexi can you install a local sql database and load the excel into that daddydatanerd can you arrange a sit down with your site lead and oic and demonstrate to them what these limitations do you your ability to do your job properly it should be listed in the sow of what the govt is supposed to bring to enable this if they are not providing you with the necessary tools to do this you may need to bring this to their attention if nothing else start making friends with the it folks and get them to authorize you the tools you need privatefrank bash then visualise in excel wirrrywoo i would draw it in paint if i am given nothing to work with haha python interpreter with statically linked libraries pandas plotlib openpyxl into an exe file through pyinstaller ask once to be passed through the fw not the best but now you have a full scripting environment longjumping b oh no you see you just get the reports from this or that government database that someone has very carefully taken the time to assemble the raw data who needs tools when we give you everything just plug it in and make some pivot tables but i mean i do need you to match the insurance information on this secure database with the id numbers in that secure database and generate statistics from this other population health database but that is easy so you can get that before general so and so comes at lunch right edit i am not lying when i tell you these higher up is view me as some kind of wizard because i can split columns by delimiter in power query it is a personal growth thing that i want to do better and utilize programs other than excel i suppose i will just have to do personal projects longjumping b i had used access before when i worked in medical billing sadly our office updated to office and decided that they did not want to pay for access i will skulk around the intranet and see if there is a local version they did not clean out yet longjumping b we have asked you know the song and dance longjumping b it is a lot of check is in the mail as a contractor i watch a revolving door of less than stellar military supervisors come and go without being so specific the military is having a hard time retaining the best and brightest i do my best working with these kind of handicaps builds character after all longjumping b mil hospital overseas department of the navy dumped it responsibilities on dha dha does not do a very good job of modernizing the systems for example we just moved to office last year before that office here is another fun one the hospitals i worked at have been built around chcs for coding billing and scheduling chcs has been in use since they are finally mercifully killing it that is how fast things work around here formertimetraveller i think the problem is more that something in excel assuming dataset is small enough to work with there that requires any substantial scrubbing or involves joining enough data sets might take a few hours each time mostly copying pasting formulas then to values then the next layer sorting subtotaling or aggregating that layers etc other layers of generic action versus a few minutes or seconds any other way in op case even macro enabled workbooks are off limits once you have hit the ceiling on excel enough times you have a sense of where it is and even access has a ceiling to what it can realistically pull of without crapping out much higher than excel but nowhere near a server longjumping b it might be a local policy that no one in it has the mind to fix but my facility does not even allow us to use macro enabled workbooks there was knowledgeable it person here he left now it is a lot of enlisted and local nationals that do not even know what i am talking about when i ask about a sql database overseas locations are very

similar boat government data analyst i have no idea what i am doing but i feel the bar is very low do not you have a battalion of contractors y per person to help you parse a csv using a paper clip and a pencil formertimetraveller yikes your manager deserves to be fired for putting you in this kind of situation not that it would ever happen but it is deserved the mistake is that you asked for a relatively cheap tool you need to ask for sas viya fully loaded minimum users add tableau on the side less than is not even worth the time of a brass looking for a position for junior ornithopterbob if you have the budget for it sas is as good as it gets for all of the above desperate the navy usually specifically needs vendor support aka they need a support contract that states if they have any issues with any products that someone will be responsible it is falls on its face with the modern idea of open source software personnel data is particularly difficult as it moves the security up a level pii type stuff to run scripted pipelines one needs a team of professional engineers to build usually utilizing cots products a cac enabled firewalled and monitored environment right now govcloud on aws is a solution that kinda fits these requirements but it is still up in the air bullcitypicker python and r are free are your admins so stingy you cannot even install those i have access to a

for the software and a booze allen contract workforce of another per year with option years ahhh i love wasting taxpayers money there you go now i recognize uncle samwise you forgot to mention booze love the typo allen will go over budget in the first months subcontract of the job to a desi consultancy after having spent all the budget to figure out how much they can contract to foreign nationals without any clearance these are the same people making these tv shows about first time buyers he restored ancient egyptian wooden dildos and she works part time as echidna groomer their budget cmdrastronaughty ahhh yes the over budgeting and subcontractors how could i forget my favourite is when they subcontract to smaller firms but those firms have like a turnover rate so work just gets

  "garthaki do not believe i have enough osu experience to answer your questions with an accurate answer i will say that i transferred there mid bs with an interest in data science i was doing the in campus route not the online degree ecampus i made it through one term and transferred to another school i will not list all the reasons that accumulated to my departure because i am on mobile at the moment imo the data science bs is just cs with a data science title for marketing of my classes had an instructor whose lectures actually matched the homework and exams two otherscs were recycled from multiple other instructors and courses so nothing learned was applicable to work one of the cs courses dropped by week dropped by week did not go to the final myself included onemath had no materials to reference and lecture had zero to do with the homework i dropped this one at week two or three hoping it would get better the only one good class was with amicis ymmv online courses and the masters may be a different experience but like i said there were many small things at the school that led to my leaving i work with dozens of osu allums stem and nobody has a good thing to say about the school i counted the time and as a loss mjsielerjr i did my undergrad at osu and currently in the middle of my phd there too i am minoring in biological data science so some of my classes have overlapped with the classes offered by that ms program i cannot really speak to the quality of the ms program but of the classes i think overlap with it i have generally had good experiences whether or not the ms in data science from osu is worth it is another question e4e5nf3nci went through that program from i really liked it all online and the courses were good it was r heavy but i ended up liking that i mostly write python now but still do some r job wise i am not sure since i am a scientist and only did the degree to broaden my horizons i have a side gig chucking some data but it is not real stats job or anything like that good luck with it aaloochaat thank you for sharing your experience aaloochaat thank you for your input aaloochaat thank you mjsielerjr for sure lmk if you have any questions about specific classes and i will do my best to answer them",
  "sannish you can either try to create a unique identifier on your own using that timestamp and some other property and then join or you go to your engineering team and tell them to put in a unique transaction id into each data point luisdanielthanks everyone i ended up adding increments of ms to the duplicated timestamps and settting the date column as the index now that it is unique here is the link if someone else is interested in the solution supplychainphd unique transaction id would be good if you are looking at basket related models colibriweiss this is a good approach when working with market data it is what we do in our shop the only potential drawback is performance i have not opened the link but some implementations of this can be super slow",

  "drakkur you will almost never beat classical or ml based models for forecasting with dl solutions and specifically transformers there is only one good implementation from the papers i have read and it was dlinear but it is the most simplistic dl i have ever seen where it splits trend from the series then fits single layers on each trend and remains and adds it back together this is not much different than stl mstl forecasts which are incredibly fast to train and produce i build production forecasts as my specialty and if you are looking to dip your toe in advanced forecasting i would start with statsforecast for all your classical models then move to things like lazyprophet to get a sense of how to forecast using lightgbm you can also use xgboost once you understand that then you can build your own models using mlforecast same team that builds statsforecast supplychainphd having never tried i would presume that using transformer models would be overkill for most e com sellers that said why do you feel like using transformer models might be appropriate for you thewallie definitely not the go to solution for the problem you describe illustrious law thanks a lot for your reply i am a phd in logistics and am starting to apply the named models more frequently i was curious how far wide my experimentations should go thanks for the tips as well i will look into the named resources illustrious law in addition what is your explanation for why dl solutions underperform in forecasting livingteachingexcellent write up is deep learning used in space elasticity in retail for example illustrious law i was just curious maybe because i read into transformers since the chatgpt hype besides that no specific reason drakkur it comes down to univariate time series is largely a linear problem it only becomes non linear with the inclusion of complex seasonality think demand forecasting for ice cream a hot day on the weekend will most likely have a disproportionately bigger increase than a hot day during the week due to most have time constraints like work or school the non linear relationship i describe can be easily estimated with a tree based model without additional feature engineering which is why the lightgbm and xgboost have become mainstream in almost all forecasting problems except quant finance the other big problem with many dl models is they are prone to giving forecasts that can go way out of bounds prophets trend extrapolation problem is quite similar nbeats and nhits are both very capable models but their improvement over ml methods are inconsistent at best though they are better than autoarima that is a fairly low bar every sota model should beat and all of this does not even take into account of training cost time series is a game of changing distribution so retraining a model regularly is a key part to accurate forecasts if you need to retrain a large model every single week your compute costs are going to explode drakkur i have seen it used with inconsistent results for estimating price elasticity i prefer the tried and true methods of price testing price variation over time and then finally building a causalml model there is tons of papers and articles on the different types of causalml methods sometimes you do not need need an ml model and a simple linear glm is sufficient supplychainphd fair enough my approach has always been less is more and it seems to work just fine you risk overfitting the model when there is not enough data also as drakkur noticed costs but agree on an overall rule of parsimony for data estimators and models whenever possible which imho will become more and more important as we get more data which seems to outperform the compute capabilities at time",

  "in response to your bitterness i am gonna tell you how i made it into ds it all started when i was months old and started classifying shapes wouldfphd real talk a lot of people have asked you have not but the number of posts that as mods we have to remove every week that are basically can someone who came from share how they transitioned to ds is very very long a lot of those people especially with interesting backgrounds are asked about it constantly and that is often why they make those posts example i came from old school engineering civil i have had a bunch of people ask either here on linkedin how i made that transition that may be your opinion however i found those videos to be very useful when i was making the transition furthermore when i made my own here is how i made it posts i know that it provided value to people because so many folks ask me questions about how they could follow the same path i find it really odd that a person on a data science career sub with complain about the number of people posting about how they got into the data science career field those posts are part of the reason why this sub needs to be here folks need to have a realistic understanding of how to get into this field and what it entails we have to give actual real world examples to counteract the gatekeepers on one end who say that anything less than a phd in stats is not sufficient to become a working data scientist and the false hope peddlers on the other end who tell you you can become a data scientist and make per year just by taking a few udemy courses renokarchnmy many other fields that are competitive have deliberately raised barrier to entry through professional licensure unions malpractice insurance governing boards etc colibriweiss my impression is that this is related to how the profession emerged from a lot of different and yet highly advanced academic backgrounds working in private companies if you want to be a lawyer you go to law school you graduate find a job in a firm pass the bar etc this was the path before and is the path now same for a plumber a doctor and so on ds at first was and maybe still is made by people with a phd or super technical masters in basically any quantitative field imo this created the culture where people think their path is special and deserves to be shared to everyone the second point to me is the talk out of the assism mea culpa i am doing the same here lol in academia you need quite some prestige and reputation to be able to do it at least in theoretical physics that i am familiar with otherwise you better be sure of your point and or be able to defend it scientifically so people in ds are much more comfortable making claims that cannot be argued against because they are unrefutable or too vague impossible to disagree with besides if you are the scientist in the meeting room for too long it is difficult to expect that anyone would make a scientific argumentation against your points so you get lazy or too soft happy to be disagreed with or debated edit i forgot to say but linkedin or social media in general and the cult of personal branding is a big catalyzer boombillys one there is a large influx of people at the beginner level and so someone who can read a regression table and import scikit learn is considered head and shoulders above everyone else and two the skill transition from another field can be very difficult i personally love these posts as they give realistic expectations of industry a lot of these ideas help during transitioning and easy feedback from other professionals are always valuable do not understand why you are so bitter if you do not like any post scroll away that is what i do i agree let is be honest here if you are asking how can i make it it is because you know what it takes but you do not like it instead you want to hear there is an easy way to make it a magic short cut i am not in the field i am trying to get into it wtf is there for someone to tell me about how to make it learn how to do the fucking work what is so complicated we are gonna pretend it is an involved matter that needs a genius to figure out and that those who did are some kind of messianic creatures give me a break sit down put the hours in be intelligent and receptive that is it im not saying it is easy i am just saying that it is not all that complicated to identify the path ig tbf i usually explain how i did something so if it goes wrong i can say people knew what i was doing and no one clocked on i do not think it is ever actually bailed me out but it is still something to point to i suppose wouldatastoryteller i would have loved those types of posts years ago when i was working in marketing and hated it and did not know how to pivot to another career instead i kept futzing around for more years until i was basically forced into a marketing analytics role i get that many videos can seem or be superficial but to turn the question around what do you expect them to contain if we are talking about making substantial progress in your learning or development as a ds then only watching these videos will not help you achieve that i can see where at times when i was overwhelmed with the ds field these types of video would probably annoy me too because back then i needed actionable advice that i could follow which they do not contain on the other hand if we are talking about getting an impression of someone is work and how they got there then i think they are very valuable to some people the advice of working smart not hard and on real problems is correct that is why it is repeated everywhere it wo not help to go any deeper than that but there is resources for that too to use a terrible culinary comparison and hopefully end on a lighter note if you are fed up with people serving you lentil soup every single day maybe it is time to go to a place where you can learn how to make a burger instead unholyravenger i am so confused by this post it is the internet it has all sorts of content some of it is going to be professional advice the quality of that advice will vary from humblebragging to real concrete actionable advice a very common one is work on a real world project and get out of tutorial hell that is pretty good advice also other fields do not have this i typed in how i became a into youtube and would not you know it a ton of videos on how people became a wide variety of professions came up including animator programmer millionaire a lot of horse jockey things for some reason and minimalist did not even see data scientist on the first page ds is a big complicated field and it can be hard to see the path from novice to expert when you are just getting started i am not shocked there is a lot of demand for videos that outline how people have walked that path in the past the last thing that confuses me about this post iswho cares just do not click on those posts videos spiritualquestions i do not care if people share their advice for free it only bothers me when people who have made it in data start charging people for there time and create paid courses etc they are essentially exploiting others for the sake of some extra bucks when they could be offering those services for free thephoenixrisesagain some people seem to care they are too stupid to think for themselves and therefore ask this shit they will likely never make it because problem solving is obviously not their strength every shitty post video has the audience they deserve screend i saw my elbow cast a silhouette one day in my playpen and thought you know what that is for me abdoughnut i am asking constantly lol nowhere else will fully fledged data scientists give you the time of day so what you are saying is you made it was it because your phd that you were able to become a director of data science in tech renokarchnmy no one is making how i became a plastic surgeon videos because it would just be them studying and taking tests for decades followed by residencies and doing crappy clinical work for other established surgeons while they practice also some clips of them filling out paperwork to obtain malpractice insurance and etc ds as with all computery type occupations has little to no real barrier to entry the skill transition from another field can be very difficult yes dfphd do not know if you are being sarcastic but short answer no the phd just gave me an easier path to my first job i do not think it helped drive the rest of my career sorry now i just had to search for how i became a plastic surgeon saw a dozen videos like that in the search results before i stopped scrolling renokarchnmy damn i guess this world really is just a shit show of self congratulatory narcissism fueled amateur content

building a model and then making a service with it a masters in stats with as much coding as humanly possible ml engineer type role is typically cs level stuff socialdatascience has to be cs with an emphasis in ml a masters in statistics is likely going to be very theoretical and not engineering focused i have seen math phds get absolutely destroyed in ml engineering roles because they are thinking too abstractly and have no tinkering skills to solve real business problems hmmthatworked to be honest comp sci and learning data engineering will open many more doors you need far more data engineers than data scientists like engineers for every scientist but if you have no interest in it dint do it for the money de and ds in general can be soul sucking as all science is if you do not have an intrinsic interest in it you will be miserable i would do cs and take as many stats ml courses as possible the truth is that regardless of the path you take you will have to learn on the job and personally i think that stats is harder to learn on your own but not that much harder than cs plus cs is more fun imo i am sure you have taken the basics of stats in your undergrad and everything else you would need to learn on the job would not be impossible there are plenty of good resources like books or blog posts that would allow you to learn where you are lacking i suggest you watch tina huang is last video it is focused on jobs but i think it would apply here as well i would probably go see us degree with an ml concentration based on what you want if you are trying to be an ml

definitely look into that in fact i am going to go on for a second about my rant about cs degrees i have a master is degree in information technology and another master is degree in data science the reality is that had i gotten a master is degree in computer science it would have qualified me for every single job that either of my two current masters degrees would have qualified before in addition their jobs that might current masters degrees would not qualify before but that ms and cs would at this point it does not really matter to me since i am well into my career however i am still considering going back for my masters in computer science with an ml concentration at georgia tech just for my own personal edification careless tailor thoughts on masters in economics slothvibes just take cs classes outside the stats degree maybe look for courses on deploying code and shit stephansareddit i agree with this not so much with the choice of a degree just because i think a degree in stats will set you up with more proper foundational topics long before ml became a thing for the average joe is business insurances and banks hired stats graduates before they had a proper degree those kind of companies which usually do not offer the worst jobs on the market btw will have a need to develop their solutions in house even when low and no code solutions take fully over it is their core business with highly sensitive data they must keep knowledge about that in house at all cost also except maybe for deep learning of modern stats curricula will set you up with enough knowledge to do just as good as any ds maybe even mle niarchetype how so 0illin the cs curriculum though is not ml just like or classes the rest of it is not focused on ml per se and is mostly like other stuff such as languages systems etc stats degree would have more ml but i guess it lacks the engineering therealtiddlydump there are plenty of applied statistics programs therealtiddlydump it is a far more durable skillset programs have a much more stable curriculum compare that to a relatively new ds program etc again it is not even close data science is temporary mathematics are forever in my heart lol more seriously i will acknowledge the bias that i am a statistician first and a cs guy second but i think that you will have a wider skillset with stats than with data science and that if you can do data science but are also able to work out a good sampling survival analysis mfa and experimental design you field will be much wider competition also tends to be smaller cruelbankai depends on the program the engineering part is necessary for ml engineer roles i think quants do a lot of modeling and implement ml and seems more stats whereas mle seems more cs it does seem like some finance background is required but i do not think it will be too hard to pick up socialdatascience true indeed character you can learn how to make algorithms run anytime statistics will help you grasp why they work 0illquant is a phd role i think is not it i think there is a decent amount of phds and also undergrads that go straight into quant",

  "personal connections are a job finding cheat code that is always been the truth leplen finding a way to get someone on the team to meet you for coffee and tailoring your application specifically to that company is like asking someone to prom by making a giant sign it shows a high level of investment and commitment but that is only a good thing if they already want you otherwise it just makes you look like a delusional loser this is the advice that only works if you follow rule be an attractive candidate gunnersi suppose if it is done right taking this approach could help but most of the time i have had recent grads reach out to me on linkedin while my company was hiring it is come off as awkward and insincere and clear that they just spammed several team members to improve their chances of a reply it also seemed like they assumed because they were graduating from some high end school w an advanced degree that i would feel honored they were reaching out to me and i would just hand them a job if you are going to do this make it a brief respectful personalized intro demonstrating self awareness and genuine interest in the role and the company also make it clear why you chose them over other members of the team ex same college same field of study common interest definitely do not just send general requests to multiple members of the same team they will talk and you will likely not get an interview wouldfphd hiring manager here yes everything he said is correct and yes being able to network with someone in the company you are trying to land in is invaluable but i agree with the tone of your replies it is not easy to do people will tell you to just network as if it is simple it is not most people with full time jobs do not want to be networked with here is why a lot of networking attempts feel one sided if you an entry level ds reaches out to me a hiring manager who is sitting on applications to network what am i getting out of it and i think this is at the core of how you network you try to find opportunities to either a find people who are actively looking to network b find people to whom you can deliver value or c find people with whom you have a common connection that may encourage them to network with you who is actively looking to network people at networking events people at conferences people who are doing presentations visiting lectures who can you deliver value to other students entry level employees people who share a very specific niche of data science with you and this applies more to people that have a deep specialization or area of research people who share a hobby that they have tied to data science who has a common connection alumni of your same program connections of your professors parents etc friends of friends islandsimian i feel like if i shared any information about my company to anyone who bought me coffee would get me fired and sued calminky networking is the easiest way to land a job with interesting tasks good culture etc taoudi i would feel super weird if an applicannot asked me if we could grab a coffee luciferwhispering if you would rather they could omit this line and expect you do this anyway that as has been the status quo pandering politeness and pleasurability should all be weaponized as tools to appear like the perfect candidate happysummerpersonally no and no for an intern i would look for evidence of potential for example if you do really well on stem subjects or demonstrate relatively advanced knowledge of some ds ml topic farming datacamp or similar is a negative the other type of intern i would welcome are children of potential partners or clients it is what it is though in fact a good number of those are very capable with the head start they have in any case i do not care if you understand the team dynamics in advance i am taking you on to share our knowledge and experience and hopefully gain a future ds or engineer not looking for a pm for the last part consider if applicannots followed his advice and contacted one of his team members it would be tantamount to harassment also how does one drink cups of coffee in a week no the best part is above the blue part

everyone who has posted purplebrownupdown do not go bribing people but definitely do not be afraid to hit up your network turingincarnate as a phd student i can tell you that most of my success has been due in large part to reaching out to other departments other professors other schools other industries my friend who i look at as a mentor kind of went to columbia i go to georgia state my undergrad and masters were political science but my advisor is in crim never be afraid to reach out to and research with people who share your interests it will carry you very very very far frantictoaster do not trade them a coffee for their time they are busy and definitely do not need someone to treat them to coffee offer them something they can use look at their linkedin profile and make a smart inference about a problem they could be trying to solve offer to meet and talk about how you could help them solve it if you inferred incorrectly no big deal they will just ignore you but there is a non zero chance you are right and response rate will also be non zero also target team leads and not individual contributors the lead is the person who hires you and needs your help doing stuff if you reach out to people and your ask is give me an hour of your time plus driving to answer my questions and in return i will give you a dollar cup of coffee you will get precisely responses entireislandi once offered to buy coffee for someone at a company i was interested and it resulted in her ghosting me she was being super flaky about meeting up so i offered to buy her coffee to make a stronger impression it ended up making her ghost so no i would not advise doing that at all it is a bit extreme and definitely not an industry norm but i think i hope the point they are trying to make is that entry level data science applicannots tend to look very similar on paper and you will have an easier time getting noticed if your resume does not look exactly like all of your peers it does not necessarily mean doing more work it could just mean learning about a less commonly used technique and using it in a project it could even just mean using different adjectives to describe yourself i cannot tell you how tired i get of seeing the phrase data driven on every single profile i review this is how it is in every industry who you know is as important if not more important than what you know intelligentputhow do i build networking with people outside my organization or as a university student jugglersdespair perfect analogy my rule would be ignore most of the shit peddled by linked in influencers maxtothej to be fair telling people they should just network without realizing how hard it is is par for the course especially if you benefitted early in your career from networking the reality is that family and friend connections are the most valuable and strong networking connections and nobody wants to think through how much of a leg up they had over people who are not connected to those higher income education social family circles early in their career solely through birth frantictoaster and for a cup of coffee spend half a day at the office and you will be swimming in free coffee jackmitcham the idea would be to do it before applying it is called an informational interview ghostofkilgore same i do not mind someone reaching out or asking questions across li it will not win them any points but fine but asking to meet is pretty cringy to me it just seems like fairly crawling behaviour that someone is been told they should do fair enough if you win more

hour of your day helping me a stranger get a job on your team nobody is responding to that but maybe i saw a job on your team on linkedin and i would like to meet you if you are interested i will be

a student if you reach out to people in the industry you want to be in maybe even in the business and have specific things you want to ask them about you will find most people are happy to talk some people wo not have much time try not to take that personally make sure you are just doing this to learn ask about their jobs what they like and do not like what they wish they had learned in school etc do not get too job seeker y that sets the conversation in a different direction i would recommend not asking how do i get a job at their company or anything like that and do not ask if they have any openings ideally what you want to have happen is you become friendly with people show them that you are competent and enthusiastic about working in that industry and then let them know that you do not have a job lined up after graduation yet but would appreciate any advice or referrals they can give do not be afraid to ask the exact same questions to different people you are building a relationship but also different people will give different answers and that can be very informative i would recommend sticking to linkedin messaging offering to buy someone a coffee is expensive at scale and too forward especially as an opener necessary let read and research what projects exist that you are interested in who funds them who is employed on them learn the ecosystem that you want to work in volunteer this is the easiest inroad once you know the ecosystem approach the location that will help you the best and ask for opportunities to volunteer memorise every name you encounter and if you meet someone you know something about then say it dr sarah oh i read one of your reports on x i really enjoyed it wouldfphd so i moved here from a different country so i had none of those family friend connections all of my networking ran through friends professors and that would be my biggest piece of advice get to know your classmates get to know your professors and then go make more friends because yes well connected family members are absolutely going to be the most valuable connections you will have and those who were born in well connected families have a massive leg up anyone wanting to discount that is dreaming but friends can be just as strong of connections and the advantage with friends is that you can grow your network arbitrarily large and the number of opportunities you have to make friends is basically limitless here is the problem a lot of people like myself are introverts and therefore a think they are bad at making friends and b do not want to make friends and because of that they do not even try so i get that feeling it feels like a big hurdle to get over and i think this is where people go the wrong route they then turn it like op into a i should not have to do this it is stupid and the truth is you do not have to but it will severely hamstring your career not to do so so taking the approach that you should not have to is really just playing victim to a choice that you have to make with consequences frantictoaster informational interviews are organized by the employer and are designed to hype candidates up about the job it is job

certain context and acknowledging them its like if there was a foot race were some people where given a head start it would not be impossible to still win the race but it is not victimization to be

information i accept it happens but i would not like it slackington plenty of eu based folks on the datatalksclub slack yeah this it actually annoys the hell out of me when people i do not know connect with me on linkedin and do not even take a minute to write a message about why they are interested in a connection with me i do not know what they want or whether they even want anything if all you do is bring me this uncertainty and waste my time then please just go go away sorry rant over acceptable milk oh yeah that is a good one mr bovinejoni i am sure lots of companies come to your

college there will be tons of opportunities to get mentorship individualpiecestart messaging people with your desired job title on linkedin and asking for advice career path questions go to your career center and your alumni association if they are doing their job they have a contact list of alumni with various positions that they hold in various companies your job is to connect with alumni who are either doing the same thing that you want to do or working for the same company that you want to be in you essentially contact them letting them know that you are a current student at they are alma mater and ask for an informational discussion basically this discussion is one where you are going to find out more about either what they do and or the company that they work at you want to get an idea of what the pluses and minuses are after that three out of five times they will offer on their own to refer you to a position if they like you if not you can go on to that company is job board and search for positions then call back and ask for a referral from the person you spoke with many companies actually pay employees bonuses if they refer an applicannot who ultimately takes the position so you both can win from it i have referred people from both my old company and my current company granted these were people that were friends of mine or relatives but the process is the same usually your resume is on a separate pile from those who applied via linkedin or indeed it will almost always get at least one human look from an hr recruiter if the person that you were friends with is actually in the division that you want to work in or on the team that you want to work in sometimes the hiring manager can request that your resume be pulled and sent directly to them bcbcc not everyone will be willing to but i think most experienced people like to be able to talk with students and help out especially if you frame it the right way hi i am a student studying data science and i am interested in learning more about what the work is really like if you have a few minutes to chat with me and answer some questions i would really appreciate it avelak many many people are especially receptive to students who reach out especially if they are an alum of your university dfphd i was not saying you were playing victim i was saying the op was playing victim and more importantly i think what is important is to distinguish when the topic of systemic advantages is helpful when discussing policies processes etc vs when it is unhelpful when discussing one individual is decisions put differently i can acknowledge that not coming from a well connected family is a huge disadvantage i can also acknowledge that acknowledging it does not change the reality of that person who is not well connected it does not solve their problem and unfortunately dwelling on it is not going to solve it either it is something that i have become very aware of recently that you can simultaneously discuss the fact that there are structural systemic issues in our societies while also acknowledging that in the here and now you need to first focus on what you can unilaterally change to improve your situation and that is normally a very different set of actions but yes i agree with you there are absolutely huge advantages that come from being born into any level of wealth and to be honest it goes far far deeper than being well connected i would argue that being well connected is not even in the top of benefits that someone born into even upper middle class ness but yes if you have family or family friends who are high up people in corporate america the number of additional opportunities that you will get to break into the job market and then advance within it are massive marykeay it might depend on your location and or industry within my circles this would be weird af if the person is a stranger to you avelak for any company that does not come to a career fair this is the way being a student is a cheat code for getting people on linkedin to respond to you and chat with you about their job company especially if they are an alum of your university i know i literally never turn a student down who asks for a chat if i am busy i still do async li email",

  "babysharkdoodoodoo do not make linkedin like facebook bcbcc i think there is a difference between post about and have on your resume which are both concepts you are mentioning if google accepted you then hypothetically i know trust that whatever they saw in you other companies would see as well and be willing to hire you you do not need to tell other potential employers that you had an offer rescinded from google do not put it on your resume posting on linkedin is a different matter i would say post about it if you want especially if it is a hey i got an offer rescinded and now i need a job thing but you should not be bragging about which company you were accepted by and rescinded the post should be about your experience not about the company that rescinded as other posts here point out there is a delicate balance that you do not want to seem too mad at the rescinding company but you also do not want to seem still in love with that company be excited to start continue your career with a new opportunity supplychainphd it might come across poorly to others considering hiring you i get what you are thinking i was good enough to be accepted by google but the timing was bad nbd but it might come across as google did me dirty jackmitcham if you interview well enough to get hired to google you can do it again somewhere else renokarchnmy if you never want to be hired again softwarelivid honestly it sounds like a very weird thing to mention also it suggests to whoever you interview with that if google called you would go there in a heartbeat spookybubba so you are asking of it is okay to keep it on your resume even if they decided to take the offer back or whatever imo yes especially when you have experience anything that is relevant to the role you are applying to and that showcases your capabilities is welcome just do not make the list too long imo it is okay to talk about since you are a fresh grad rescinding offers from new grads fucks them over particularly hard slothvibes hell not sure what others would do but i would put it on my resume as laid off due to economic conditions start end same month not sure how ethical it is but it hits the doc parsers good foot in the door others might say it is shady or not true to do that but it is what is it resumes are not perfect histories of yourself with mapping to reality imho if your offer was rescinded then you never worked there it should not appear in linkedin or your resume in my opinion to work for a company is to spend several months at least doing projects and actual stuff for that company it is in poor taste to say you were offered a job at some company and did not get it as a hiring manager myself it would come off like you are bragging and full of yourself a trait you do not want to be associated with it could make people think you are hard to work with in this tech economy you do not have the upper hand always remember that you are trying to convince a company to offer you a job not the other way around in most situations now there are way more candidates than open jobs thepinkleprechaun that is not the kind of thing you put on your resume your resume is for your education and work history even if you get an offer at google you are not working there yet it would look weird and probably be a turn off to a hiring manager cadublin nope not on your resume career suicide and show your desperation however i saw many linkedin posts that says along the line i accepted an offer from this company but unfortunately the offer has been rescinded now that i am job hunting again i would greatly appreciate interview opportunities referrals etc i think that kind of post would be fine jobeta just say it casually during the interview instead nyquant there have been postings like this on linkedin often by students that need a visa sponsor and are pressured for time to land another offer in order to stay in the country looking at the likes and comments those seemed to have gotten responses i would try to ping those people directly and ask if it resulted in a job lead at the minimum you might expand your network and learn from people that experienced a similar situation hogebifneond go for it as long as you are not illustrating your experience with google in a pejorative manner i do not see why it would be a bad thing to post could be an opportunity to showcase optimism and technical skills colickingseahorse as if it is not already lol wouldreurojank i second this comment and just want to build on the points made with a humble interpretation to being accepted or rejected at any given point in time at a company merit is a factor but i would argue luck is an even greater factor celebrate successes but also be humble in how you interpret your success i think the biggest issue i see in trying to say look google thinks i am great is how it comes off to others there are many great ds people at and not at google or any other faang company we are all just trying to get jobs and do good work that looks different to everyone and posting about being accepted somewhere despite not following through rescinded or not i think would rub people the wrong way jackmitcham it might also come across as i would prefer to work at google and will look to jump ship as soon as google is hiring again renokarchnmy do not count chickens before they hatch op was not good enough to get hired by google lest they would have hired op regardless of circumstances jeremymiles plus if employers start to value it candidates will start writing it there is no way to

timing when tech companies are literally laying off thousands off people that are more qualified and experienced than you none what is your educational background and work history do you have a github portfolio of projects there is a huge misconception in this sub and everyone seems to be avoiding the truth it is absolutely brutal out there for ds jobs i hate to be that guy but if your boot camp is the only certification you have then think that at the moment you have to compete with tons of people with msc and phd from your responses seems like you trying to blame it to networking but networking is just a small part of it in my opinion do you have strong qualifications if not what do you do about making your cv stronger sorry if i sound judgmental my intention is truly the opposite i just want you to make sure you understand that out there is competitive as hell and unfortunately a boot camp will not do much in our days imacpamd what is your job education history you did a week

interviews i had a friend of mine who was friends with this other guy he played soccer and i needed an extra person on my team he agreed to play and i found out he was a data scientists and we started

how i got to where i am today networking comes in all forms i have had random job interviews because of meeting some stranger at a store or restaurant and we had a casual conversation and that person liked me enough and said i should apply and let me use them as a reference of all my jobs i would say at least half came from knowing someone who worked there hint search for excel and apply for jobs where data skills are a plus realjiggz strong smell of victim mentality here op has convinced themselves that it is not their fault and everything besides their own decisions are to blame so it is impossible that they could fail due to the consequences of their own actions wouldfphd you have a lot of comments between your post and your responses that i think you need to get into one place and then realize that you are looking at this from the wrong angle before the tough love some words of encouragement empathy it sucks to land your first job it sucks to look for one it sucks to get rejected it sucks to send out applications and not get anyone to reach out to you it sucks to know that you would be good maybe great at some of the jobs you are applying to and not be given a chance it sucks but you need to redirect your frustration at something else because it is not being placed on the right stuff right now im going to summarize your take i have all the skills a data scientist would need and because i have the right hard skills i deserve a job doing what i want to do i think soft skills are stupid and i should not have to convince someone to give me a job there are at least things that i can argue are fundamentally wrong with your take it is not just you and the job it is you the other applicannots for the job and the job are you the most qualified person for the jobs you are applying probably not so the question of whether or not you have the necessary skills for the job is irrelevant this is a question of competition against a bunch of other people who also have the right skills and also want that job i fundamentally doubt that you have all the skills you need python sql excel that is part of it but for most analyst jobs you are also going to need to learn to work with random reporting platforms oracle obiee ms business objects sap whatever random crm systems salesforce hubspot ms dynamics random transactional systems random pricing systems etc so no you do not have all the hard skills odds are no applicannots do but the perspective that you already check all the technical boxes wrong soft skills matter i have seen people with phds in statistics from top schools struggle at work because they ca not work with people or because they are not motivated to get stuff done or because they ca not get out of the data and actually do things that are valuable networking matters always everywhere forever you can hate it all you want but networking which is another name for building relationships is going to be a part of every aspect of your life until the day you die unless you go off the grid and become a completely self sustaining hermit if you do not want to have to network then go do a phd in cs that is the tradeoff you either get so educated that people line up to hire you or you come to terms with the fact that you are going to have to work yes work to get your first job mobilelavishnessit seems you resent people in general and would rather get a specific task do it and get paid i get it i am like that sometimes as well but by your last sentence it seems your problem is deeper if you are spending a week wishing you were unconscious a job will not solve your problem in fact a job might make it worse once you realize that it can also involve dealing with bs sometimes talk to someone trust me i do not like hr people and recruiters in general but they do have a sixth sense sometimes detecting these type of traits in people and they try to avoid who they think might be more of a liability than an asset no matter how skilled they are chittywan i think timing is a big factor right now seems like companies do not want to hire right now unless it is for the top of candidates lonesomedota i agree that ds is brutal for newbies like us they do not just want software development level of coding ability they also want msc level of mathematics and statistics many people under this sub have gotten in by formal education and or at the peak stage of their careers their beginning environment years ago were totally different from what we are now especially now you have tons of tech people getting laid off and they are ready to jump in and take your cakes even though they are from other fields software engineers testers web developers mobile apps developers etc they at least will get over the first hurdle of coding abilities it is painful and it will get more painful i am afraid the chance to ever getting to the senior ds roles of the people in this sub for newbies like us is close to zeros my only advice is continue to practice leetcode and build your portfolio these people have years of undergrads with formal education to prepare themselves we may not have the same luxury so we can compete by putting in efforts manage your expectations you will not get the shiny flashy job building ml in near future heck your first job may even be paid less than in some areas but beggars cannot be choosers keep grinding purplebrownupdown have you contacted people at merit america if they are going to charge to take classes in data science they should help with job prospects that being said a ton of places are in a hiring freeze but some are not to target those jobs find keywords in their job postings and highlight them in your linkedin and resume curious i hate intentional networking too my advice to you is to seek problems you can solve for other people that starts a conversation not about you but about the problem at hand just like i am doing right now you do this times and you will find a couple of people who will want to stay in touch with you that is how you can build a network and also enjoy it raharth one thing you can do is putting some projects on github this gives you valid experience and at the same time showcases that you are interested in what you are doing and people can see the quality of your code as well as your approaches to the problems it lines up with everything i have been told about what to expect and somehow i am still losing my mind here nice svartgeit do you have any type of portfolio if not you should pick interesting projects that you are excited about and build out a portfolio if you do not have actual on the job data work you can and should have a github or other portfolio pick things where you do not have clean data kaggle data sets are often not reflective of real world data networking is not about making friends necessarily you should be building your network so when you post on linkedin you will have a higher chance of people interacting with you reach out to people that say they are hiring do informational interviews with people and ask them what kinds of problems do they solve what they are looking for etc if you are not really solid at interviewing do mock interviews with people nail down answering behavioral questions get good at framing problems succinctly and make sure you are ready for code screens or take home assignments you want to make sure that once you get interviews you are ready for them im sure some of this is common knowledge but there are many dimensions to getting to where you want to go if you can find any position working with data take it and tell them in interviews that you are working towards analytics and want to start working with real data you can move up if you work at it within a company it takes time and is a struggle but you will get there i know it is very discouraging i was miserable when i started trying to get into analytics but you will land something if you think that is a long time i am sorry but you have a rude awakening coming it took me almost years to get my first job in the field and that was with a master is degree i went to networking events built up a portfolio and studied new concepts every day in the end the networking did not do as much as my experience and portfolio since i was starting out in the field you also really need to consider your market are you living in a very competitive city ie new york boston san francisco if so you are not going to be noticed at all smaller cities would be your best bet i absolutely had to change markets i was trying to get a job in the field back in ny but it was damn near impossible i finally switched to a smaller city in the midwest and got a great job that is providing excellent experience i will gladly suck it up for a few years if it eventually gets me back home in ny down the line also echoing what others have said with respect to portfolios and demonstrations of skill this position is tough because it requires math computational and proper scientific experimental design knowledge at this point it is almost as difficult as getting into a medical school for a solid ds position you will really have to start low but i would recommend getting formal degree over a boot camp boot camps only help those that already have strong coding skills or have strong data science skills and want to get an idea of how to apply their knowledge through computation or learning the proper math honestly i would not be surprised if ds in the future had a professional route similar to law or med school good luck with your search but in this point in your career you should also think about how to make your own luck all i ever wanted was a job that pays well do not we all and that i can get out of bed in the morning for yeah bout that data seemed great dats is great do not get discouraged take a look at this recent post that outlines it all pretty well devviewevvieisabear data skills enterprise experience this is the battle that always screws it up sadly you may not be immediately and gainfully employed in the positions you might have to work for a year at to get the experience as for that linkedin networking bs we did not design this we did not ask for this but you are not a brilliant scientist in this market is eyes you are a bi asset somewhere between an auditor and a marketer how who knows why that is a relevant question because people in hiring positions and recruiters have spent decades imbibing a morbid mix of pop psychology and pmi propaganda no matter how you break it down these philosophy framework processes are like a cultist mlm like system intended to make non technical people feel superior so because stacy in hr likes both acting like a corporate social worker and agile scrum terminology you need to go through the entire shtick of pretending you care about their process just to get and do your job all things wrong with corporate america do not just all of a sudden disappear because a new sector sprung up inside of it krasnomo are you applying to jobs or internships formaladnetworking and applying to the right company are important linkedln is not the right way to networking in my opinion especially if your cv is not very strong people there will not refer a stranger maybe go to meet up participate in hackathon ask friends of friends that is the better way to get referrals hackingbricker having no background on your education and interests i do not have any other skills i think you might be casting too wide of a net find something more specific about what inspired you to do the bootcamp it has to be more than just easy money and motivates you to get out of bed somedatadude i have a bachelors in computer science a masters in data science an active github personal portfolio website years of software development experience an internship in analytics and in a much better economic environment when i looked for jobs in months i received two offers networking helps send inmail on linkedin giving brief introductions what you can bring to the table helps but frankly speaking on paper you are not as qualified as phd candidates you need to make up for your paper weaknesses somehow whether that is networking or being undeniably technically better which people can only see from your online portfolios is up to you lastly and sorry for being blunt but being an easy person to work with and talk to matters when teams decide who to hire avpan do not expect anything for years without something incredible to set you apart from your competition tech companies just laid off tons of people the competition is huge at the moment like many have said you are competing against newly graduate ms and or phds as well as experienced ms phd and previous employed ds or analysts a week bootcamp is not going to mean squat this is a very hard industry to get into i would almost suggest you study and become a data engineer those are less common than those wanting to be an analyst scientist it requires more technical knowledge but just as important to the workflow bakochba do you projects online that you provide links on your resume in my opinion if you do not int actually enjoy data science you will find this field a hellish experience since it involves diving deeply into minutiae paddyalton hmm there is something i have not seen anyone mention i think we need to unpack what you mean by networking you have had some people tell you networking is not that bad networking is bad but it is important im going to tell you something different networking at least the kind you mean_ is not going to be the decisive factor in your getting an entry level role this is not always true often people with connections will be able to find an entry level role via those connections here are some imaginary scenarios to illustrate what we are talking about there this guy i hung out with at an alumni event works in data i emailed him and he had a chat with his manager and now i have an internship possibly unpaid if that is legal where you are my family is small business put me on the books as a data analyst i optimised their stock using a really basic off the shelf model my father is good friend is an investor in this startup they were desperate for help and he said hey my friend is daughter has been doing this bootcamp i bet she could help you out they are all imaginary but let us just say they are constructed from stuff i have seen in entry level cvs none of these involve growing your linkedin network sharing and commenting on people is posts etc that kind of networking is_ important once you have your foot in the door and need to grow your personal brand that is about climbing the career ladder of course you might do personal outreach via_ linkedin but linkedin is not the magic part of that process the kind of networking i have just described is probably not going to help you i assume that you either have an aversion to such things or you have already given it a go or else it is just not an option and that is unfair but what is the way forward you need to make a lot of applications but it is not_ just a numbers game people do not randomly draw from the deck if people can always tell that you are not as good as the best applicannot you never get picked so you need to tailor each application focus on providing evidence that you can meet all the listed requirements of the job remember some technical skills are not that hard to acquire so feel free to hold off for a day or two until you can honestly write basic familiarity with x the bootcamp as the name suggests was just the start attention to detail is crucial no typos no bad formatting act as though your cv is going to get of screen time by someone who will chuck it out if they are not sure you meet the criteria at the end of that time remember written and visual communication skills are important in data and this is a test as far as linkedin goes your profile is a shop window for you you cannot tailor it as much as your applications but try to demonstrate a record of excellence and good writing skills timeforbagel thanks for all the input sincerely yes i had a shitty attitude when i wrote all this thank you to everyone who did not assume i am just like this all the time i am much more reasonable to deal with in person and at work at least i would like to think i am very depressed during this time but that is beyond the scope of this post i do not assume i deserve an amazing career that pays for my first job just because i took a boot camp a few of you floated the word entitled and i just do not think that is fair i am deeply frustrated with both myself and with the world because of how difficult it is been for me to find something that will let me break past the barrier of low paying jobs that grind my body or my will to live into dust i do not think it is entitled to want that but maybe data was asking too much jobeta networks is part of the game it can suck but it always will be the first time you need a network it will make you feel like that because you actually do not have a network but after a couple jobs it really can be as simple as seeing a job opening you are interested in and figure out what former colleague now works there and can give you a referral i know it sucks but i would try to accept it as fast as possible instead of spending a lot of energy convincing yourself life is unfair it comes down to people wanting to work with people who are good at their jobs and are nice to work with that is pretty rational is not it my advice is try to find whatever freelancing gig you can just to get some actual mileage as you look for that nice full time you might get underpaid a couple time but as long as you do not let it last too long it could be worth it i got ripped off for my first couple gig but after that i could enter the real game good luck wardrobecreator this dumbass thought he is going to be selected with a meaningless certificate over people who went to an actual school for undergraduate and masters and worked their assess off if this is the only skill you have like you mentioned then you are stupid for thinking you can land a data analyst job with what you have all of these dream selling posts on this subreddit is making people play russian roulette with their career and making them have false hope i do not know which companies people with certifications get in but have you seen linkedin at all all these entry level positions are being filled by people who went to ivy league schools or at least have done a computer science stats bachelors at a top state school who are you compared to them hey i get it networking is frustrating it is geared towards extroverts and it is a true disadvantage to all technical people who are mostly introverts most job opportunities actually pick out the most charming candidate not necessarily the most meritorious it is unfair and i had deep resentment for networking and all sell yourself tactics myself but that is life instead of wasting my energy getting frustrated i learned it is a useful skill to master it is tough and frustrating in the beginning but eventually making connections improving your communication will help you a lot in the long run it sucks but that is life the more you concentrate on doing the best you can the better it gets good luck monkeygamer i ended up with my job because i got involved with a local committee and they let me know about an opening which was pretty cool my recommendation is to tone down the number of jobs you are applying for i do not know about you but i find constant job applications draining just do a handful occasionally for jobs you want which you think you have a good chance for enjoy your time off once you are working you will not have much monkeygamer regarding experience depending on your age i am not sure how much it will matter if you are in your finished college recently it will not if you are in your or older and retrained it will be a complicating factor edit i saw in your profile you are i think you should be fine to go for junior positions and general positions none deleted this is a tough time in general after all these difficult tech lay offs there is a lot of competition in the market it is frustrating but do not lose hope my fellow stay strong increase your job search circle be more flexible try your best to first get a job and then you can think about career dev i do not know if you are early in your career or not if you are early you should not be worried as you have a lifetime ahead of you to find your territory you have time to develop more relevant skills and climb up the ladder to a good paying job speak to a few friends find peers in your program to network with not for job finding only but for moral support and for getting through the days frequentiststats assume you do not have any proper quantitative training without bachelor is or master is the only thing you can do is to get in contact with hiring managers to boost your odds of getting your foot in the door the foot in the door requirement is true get a major organization to trust you and you will increase your odds of other ones trusting you there is a vast amount of us that had to start with being a helpdesk intern including myself before moving around multiple positions companies and domains until i found my niche in data if you want to bypass some of this then having a phd certainly would help or an incredibly strong portfolio of private projects calminky you can get a data job without experience build a portfolio projects with public data and ideally relevant to the industry you want a data position in then reach out to a few data people that have the role you are after in the industry you are after and ask for min conversations show them your builds get feedback find out about their real tasks company culture etc document refine your portfolio start writing targeted applications with the info obtained snakesfeet prompt engineering morebikesthanbrains start building a portfolio of projects that are interesting to you stop with the classes the certificates the tutorials think of a something you find interesting that has a dataset online and start ripping into it do a new one like every day or week build a portfolio out of your best ones this is how you will learn you are going to come across problems you need to solve with tools you do not have yet so you will need to learn how to find those tools no online course is going to teach you that elpoupou technical skills are great but so are soft skills that make projects happen in an org there is no soft skills diploma out there you gotta interact with ppl aka network to prove that you are good at it redditloveerrr start selling your services on upwork build a portfolio as a former hiring manager you really need experience and good connections to vouch for you chittywan i second everyone comments on building a portfolio also i think the economy tech job downturn is definitely affecting your recruiting results tech companies are only hiring top of talent mbel_ it sounds you might need to continue learning it is not a great time to look for work if you are just starting out alternatives continue learning any bootcamp will always be introductory everything is online now you can learn for free and create a solid portfolio i would recommend learning well these topics sql querying data joins group by window functions pandas scikit learn do not bother with the algorithms use it to evaluate data do cross validation etc xgboost learn it well fasttext text classification nixtla time series freelance gain some experience working you can charge a relatively low hourly fee and do a few projects in upwork this will be very valuable in interviews build an online presence twitter youtube blogging share what you learn you can get jobs via twitter believe it or not wouldikmason drop the cv let the people fix it of course remove your address name etc johnfatherjohn if you do not have certain credentials in your education or experience then you have to make up for it by having an impressive github account with at least one project showcasing your capabilities and networking look for meetups in your area for data analysts scientists sign up for remote online workshops and social events and meet as many people as you can particulartriangle leave everything and come teach english in colombia you will not make as much as usa bit here the payment goes a loooong way icelandicstorm look to jobs on the periphery adjacent to data science my job involves user behavior analytics anomaly detection in cybersecurity you may find something close enough until you gain the experience and complete your degree you may also find the grass is not always greener and silicon valley software engineer wages coupled with close enough in a low cost of living area anywhere in the world is good enough benitosblade i finished the google data analytics professional certification and the google data analytics individual qualification certification i currently have been learning python and practicing sql on datacamp at the end of i finished my bs in business administration and marketing i have been applying and applying to get an entry level data analyst position for months now i did get job offers one was through a company named fortitude systems which are tech headhunters i talked with them once about a analyst position that was contract but said i was not qualified enough they later hit me up for a position they said i was qualified for but i had moved and it was not remote i hit up a few temp agencies which i do recommend i was accepted for a hr position to be compensation and benefits analyst but i had to pass on it due to having to move because a death in the family it does seem like it is close to winning the lottery when it comes to breaking into an analyst role and feel like you do when it comes to asking myself what did i get myself into it seems like once you have made it then you are set and can climb ladders for a career but the competition is fierce and some companies post junior data analyst job positions but are really want a senior data analyst or a data scientist with all the responsibilities and years of experience they are requiring one company asked me how many lines of sql are you use to writing i said under they automatically said oh no your not qualified we expect you to be able to write over a hundred lines of sql and that was for a contract position if you have not already make sure to create a portfolio to showcase your skills many recruiters dismiss a application if it does not have a link to a portfolio you can create one on maven analytics website for free or on kaggle the professional way is to create a domain and pay to have your website hosted here is a video on how to easily do this joule_ have you searched for paid internships there are several that i have seen recruiting for summer positions i am considering going this route after graduating with my biostats and data science masters in the spring ayananda build something real in cloud then you have proof you are not useless that is good selling point seanbird you need to change your attitude toward the job search and skills you actually have it is extremely difficult field to get into and accepting that fact will make you more focused if you are really want a job in data keep learning and making projects and write about them while doing that keep applying and networking i would suggest you to cover statistics and probability really well learn how to build models from scratchsimple stuff how to evaluate them and how to improve them i am not taking about throwing parameters at xgboost and waiting till your metric improved then learn how to deploy models with flask or django build containers and put everything to aws few strong projects like this will put you at advantage because for many companies mlops is very important and it is hard to find a person who can do more than jupiter notebook mambo jambo do not loose hope keep yourself focused it is a long journey ramblinginternetnerd i went job hunting earlier in i have us citizenship a relevant ms from a reputable university a perfect gre math score and a percentile english score several years of experience worked at a faang etc ohh and no weird speech patterns obvious facial deformities or anything like that i struck out way more than i landed offers got final round interviews basically everywhere though so interpret that as me being good enough at sql and basic behavioral questions the market only got more competitive since then you need to develop experience on paper somehow open source contributions portfolio projects volunteer work anything job hunting is like a full time job it can take a while even when i had a job no matter the field it can take months to find a new job i have had years where i simply stopped because there was nothing remember the rule of large numbers the more applications you put out the higher the chance of getting responses also if the thought even crosses your mind of i should edit and re word some thing here and there do not let it slip away of the time we as humans can make what we say sound more fluid and convincing renokarchnmy career development is always part of developing a career boombillys first off i am not gonna rail you for being frustrated at all we are going through some rough times in the economy so finding employment in this market will be tough i am sorry but congrats on getting through your bootcamp and welcome to the wonderful and often perplexing field of data science i am sure getting to this point was not easy for you the good news is that you now have the skills necessary to become dangerous the less good news is that it takes some time to get really dangerous the good news again is that you can cut your teeth pretty easily in this field so you can get started right away the open secret about doing really well in this field is not networking certifications or degrees though they can certainly help it is about treating data science as a bona fide science science involves heavy amounts of research calibration hypothesis formulation trying things out with experiments and simulations iterating on these things thousands of times until it is slightly better understood and then communicating those results to your peers who are critically reviewing your work forget testing a hypothesis building some classifier or some other crap for a moment and just try formulating a great hypothesis about some system that you want to observe like one that makes you lose sleep at night and end your marriage to make this your life is work kinda great then try to write it down in a succinct catchy way then present your hypothesis to a colleague and see what they think they might tell you it sucks or does not quite suck as the last one you came up with then try again what you will realize is that this process takes immense familiarity with the data you are working with where it comes from how it is measured what information you can gather communicating those results building a good collaborative community around you showing up to the work every day etc you will get better at this over time and you will notice that you will be faster at this for new problems you encounter this is my point use your newly formed skills to dig into a dataset i do not care if it is the god damned iris dataset that every other person in this sub has tattooed onto their arm but really understand it be an expert on that dataset wonder about what it took to collect that data come up with questions you have that you would like to ask of the data and wonder what data you could further collect to answer questions that arise make simple visualizations that instantly show not tell the reader what is what in the data make them care this may naturally lead you to the development of some model but it does not necessarily have to in many cases the best model is one that simply summarizes the data from a different perspective though not always sometimes you are trying to optimize model performance for something like predictive accuracy or being able to explain out of sample variability but do not overdo it use what you come up with to either make a great point or build an awesome tool out of it then do it again data talks if you just know the technical stuff but it will tell you amazing secrets if you can formulate good questions to ask it it may even sing when you can answer those questions and communicate those results to others everything i said also applies to networking with others and interviewing too thanks for reading through my mostly tongue in cheek post spencerassiff why do not you post your portfolio full of actionable analysis on topics that you enjoy and show us so we can help you undercover capybara exactly this as a hiring manager before the layoffs we were getting hundreds close to a thousand of applicannots per data science opening all levels and experiences from people with bootcamps to people with phds it was competitive before now it is even more so theugliestmango do you think a masters degree in data analytics would make one more qualified for these roles ianitic you can however do other business jobs and utilize a lot of the same skills most hms love that as there usually is a lack of support in that area just getting good at excel can open a good amount of doors to be honest afterwards it is easier to transfer to a more data specialized role kind of what i did though i went the data engineering route which seems to be in demand still i do not think it is this sub that sells a pipe dream it is the people running boot camps v0archnemesis as a hiring manager i second this im at a non tech non us org paying market rate for the area for non senior ds roles for every position in the last months my front runners have pretty consistently been phd in computer science typically straight out of their phds phds from other quantitative disciplines with prior industry experience transitioning from swe to ds person with sme from working on the ground in the industry typically from a bootcamp or self taught with a good github each category comes with their pros and cons but what is been pretty consistent is that the only way someone from a bootcamp gets a look in is with sme bijay_ do you mean having masters degree in data science have higher probablity timeforbagel thanks for being kind i do not understand networking at all its total garbage it is a career unto itself and i have no interest or patience or capacity for it just because someone is better at making friends they get a bigger paycheck i deserve to make a living as much as any other pos who can talk himself into one odd also even outside of this year is massive tech layoffs this is always the slowest hiring season data science peeps keep your eye out for when you need a seasonal adjustment this is a time of year when people take a lot of time off and do not want to bring someone new on in the middle of all that op sounds depressed that also has seasonal trends i hope things get better soon agreed dunking on networking when you only have a bootcamp in this hiring climate is a bad look wouldigbydenthand op has probably worked really hard and paid good money to get through this bootcamp i have never heard of and has nothing to show for it cannot blame them for being frustrated but they do need to deal with the entitlement attitude i have been in this position before which took years to gain any real traction with an undergrad and graduate degree in a quant major and i had to be really creative and learn resilience to rejection also hiring managers want to see passion for their craft most likely b c that will be a reflection on their work product most ds positions are in teams and if you are hard to work with or have a shitty attitude then you are most definitely negatively affecting productivity across a whole team avpan networking can be done in other ways too i was contractor on upwork for a year and did various projects i finally got my first job years ago because the startup that hired me for some analysis really liked the work i did and hired me on as a ft junior ds freelance work is something not many people realize exists alot of companies do not have the resources to hire a ft employee but still require someone to do some analysis work here and there covid22parti can understand tbh they were sold a probably expensive bootcamp the internet is not exactly an advertisement free zone i just googled can i become a data scientist without a degree and the entire first page of google is ads for data bootcamps and quora questions that give ambiguous or wrong answers i would be pissed if i spent on something and it did not work op is probably feeling the same pocodr the victim mentality is trumpeted everywhere including in the media and by politicians accountability is oppressor talk even the top are being laid off realjiggz hiring managers do not care about any of that fancy stuff for jr roles literally all they are looking for is someone who they think can pick up sql in a couple of weeks has a problem solving mentality and not embarrass them when put in front of nontechnical decision makers lot of these people go on to become hiring managers and then they will hire people like themselves highly technical individuals intimidate them because they need to understand that technicality if they manage that person there are exceptions and roles that require very technical skills but a lot of business data science roles look like this chitinid rest assured they do not want the software development level of coding ability because of working data scientists i have met do not have it d sinochad really it took me months with a bootcamp and some coursera math certificates the us job market must be brutal undercover capybara what do you mean by data jobs that is so insanely broad are you applying to data entry data analyst data scientist data manager data engineer a little bit of focus and information would be helpful i do not recommend anyone without a solid bs ms phd in quant engineering stem to apply for data scientist positions unless they come from a great bootcamp and have the portfolio to show for it a month bootcamp would warrant maybe an entry level data analyst position in most places it is a great field but it is highly competitive with highly skilled people coming out of massive layoffs in tech there are still plenty of jobs open i am hiring right now but for a specialized field you just have to adjust your profile to the jobs simply having a bootcamp and really really wanting it is not enough 1234okieyour understanding of the world needs works find something that will let me break past the barrier of low paying jobs that grind my body or my will to live into dust ah get in line with the next guy my friend do not we all want a job that we enjoy the reality is simple it is all about supply and demand you want a data job do you have the skill for the data job do your skills outshined others that you stand out yoe grads degree post grad exp etc if you skills does not outshined others and just mediocre do you have the ability to sell your skill in your case seems like you lack both if you do not give a flying shit about your job your craft or selling to someone about what you can do for them why would they the company gives two shit about you what can you provide that worth my yearly do not overcomplicated it and do not expect a handout the way i see your respond and the attitude of this post is that you took a cert online and expecting a return for it you hate talking to people whether it is conversational or networking if these are all the tools skills you have i strongly suggesting applying for an ap roles in accounting they require basic understanding of debit credit and can starts from anywhere from depending on the places you talk to no one beside your manager and you grind away all you want all with yoe i would not say it is easy but the demand for it is everywhere every company needs accountants i have a phd and i would not want to be on the market right now op is expectations are a little unreasonable and they have only been on the job search for months during a time of major layoffs administrativebarin most job i am applying even those that say data analyst most pp have master degree so saintmurray what is sme this is a very reasonable group of people to recruit for and definitely a good representation of the competition out there great answer i have a question i am environmental health scientist with years of experience in academic world as researcher who applied data science in his field i am building a portafolio and have ten paper in eight of that i performed data science and code specially with r currently i want to change to ds as main work what is your advice have i good chances or it is necessary some different route thank you than someone that just did a week course yes or a masters in any quantitative subject its not just networking its hard to break into because it requires a strong educational background you cannot expect to do a month program and be competitive with people who spent years in school for it if you want to get good jobs in data science you either need the education or a strong portfolio programs like that can be a part of a strong portfolio for sure but you also need a history of things that you have built and anyone who tells you a month program alone will land you a figure job is trying to sell you snake oil im not saying this to discourage you though and i hope you do not take it that way you need to build experience by doing projects if you want to be self taught or taught outside an accredited university there are other ways to network than what you think join professional organisations and sign up for mentorship though that org that is a form of networking chitinid maybe spend more time thinking about why employers should want to hire you than what you deserve nobody cares what you feel you are entitled to employers care what value you will deliver to their company figure out how to make that case caksters as a data scientist analyst engineer you work together with people do not solve data science analysis engineering problems but you solve business problems the whole nature of the job most jobs is being a good communicator and inevitably building relationships with stakeholders you need to build a network for have opportunities to build a network you need to develop social skills having social skills is what separates mediocre employee from a good employee for your own sake i would re evaluate your views on networking and building relationships with people if you build a good professional relationship with people you also build trust others trust in you is what will give you more opportunities in the future sooner you realise this and accept it with a positive attitude better your outcome in this industry will be what about networking do you struggle with this is something important for you to grapple with because your future earnings and job happiness depend on it yes you deserve to be paid well as much as the next person but if you are unwilling to do what it takes to earn that money you will leave it on the table your choice to maximize your income or not ak2019_ instead of downvoting imagine in years you have to hire someone you met a younger person at an event and you seemed to get along they mentioned linkedin showed that they could do much of what you needed would you go through the pain of looking for someone through the normal channels risking a good fit even if you find the right skills or would you give that person a shot first and not even list the position joelangeway i feel for you friend i too suck at networking just do your best where ever you end up and appreciate the people you work with and it will happen blasketbasket respectfully if someone can use their communication skills to better their chances of getting a role and you cannot do the same thing then they are a better hiring choice than you period communication and storytelling is the most important soft skill in this field no one cares what the raw numbers say it is up to analysts and scientists to tell the story within the data you seem to want a job but do not want to do the work required to get said job you went to a bootcamp not a university that is a shortcut and it made you less competitive than those that did now you do not want to network which is the only way you are really going to get around all of those candidates with degrees that hiring managers are going to rank ahead of you based on their degree so you do not want to get a degree and do not want to do the one thing that gives you a fighting chance at job offers with your background what exactly is it that you think is going to happen here you are going to complain on the internet the sky will open up and angels will fly down and pull job offers out of their ass for you to sign monkeygamer i sympathise i hate networking too suffice to say i have done the minimum amount necessary to get a job and no more and i am sorry you are being downvoted what you say is reasonable po handz networking does not pay off until years into your career mtotally think of the last time you gave someone a chance in your life and it did not go well that might help grow some compassion for the hiring managers etc making these decisions they need data to support their decisions the more the better password if you say youre bad at networking to me i assume im bad at communicating and bad at communicating you would need a lot of experience and knowledge to compensate it partially so i would have a think about why you think that way i also do not love it i hate selling myself applying for jobs and giving evidence that im good at my job i work in accounting and finance but i try to find positions where they have a culture of testing my skills well try to give them evidence that stands up to scrutiny however i do not have much experience with applying so take my voice with a grain of salt avpan especially if op was someone without a quant degree in higher education in i did a data bootcamp and it was still hard to break into the field and i already had a ms in physics so many people you think have the education qualifications and just fail at simple tasks i recently had an applicannot who on paper was everything i would expect gave them a take home to do some simple sql and an analysis prompt on some actual data we had they did not even do the analysis prompt and said it was beyond their level i just wanted them to look at it and give me some visuals and their thought process lonesomedota maybe i am still very new at ds career job search only been searching for entry role about a year or maybe in us market is different but where i am lc style interview are the must i have had white board programming interview for da role i have had hackathon takehome assignments etc literally i just finished a trainee program technical screening yesterday for a famous canadian bank asia pacific hq that have round of freestyle lc medium any language questions hours section of sql leetcode mins section of python data wrangling lc medium mins a mcq test for statistical test mins a mcq test for adaptive logical solving problems mins and another optional round of java lc medium question all these are closed book camera proctor single browser tab means you ca not switch to other tab to google understandable because of chatgpt they said if i pass this technical screening i would have round in person technical interview in my experience this will be whiteboard round group interviews and final round is the hr offer and this is for fresher entry for trainee program apparently this is the norm for most big medium companies trainee programs in my country cuz everyone are jumping into ds now it is extremely brutal and discouraging for newbies like us that we need to have lc medium level of coding experience to even pass the technical screening for ds entry roles but i guess that is the route all senior ds have to go through right covid22partwhat industry because this does not align with my experiences interviewing and hiring in tech are you a hiring manager larger cities absolutely are since the competition is insane when i switched to looking in the smaller city i am living now it was a little easier but then there are those people that just luck out and get something very fast though it is rare life is funny that way undercover capybara same i have a phd in stem with years of industry experience and would not want to be looking for a job in this market there are jobs but it is highly competitive and i am currently hiring for my company so i know how competitive it is but the sheer number of bootcampers with very little understanding of real world data science or who just want to do machine learning straight out of a mo program is astonishing theugliestmango understandable my question was would a masters degree in data analytics make someone a more suitable candidate for data science roles v0archnemesis subject matter expertise in many ways i like these candidates as it is often easier to build the necessary technical skills than deep enough knowledge of an industry i started out doing data science in global health then transitioned to big tech product try looking for ds positions that are semi related to the subject matter of your phd work there for a year or two then go wherever you want v0archnemesis i have a similar background about years in academia with a phd adjacent field my advice to academics is to aim below the level you think you should get there is a stigma against academics and it is well grounded imo we tend to be perfectionists struggle to work with deadlines and at the point we transition our code is typically relatively poor it is better than our peers but not compared to other applicannots what we have going on our favour is that on average we can communicate about data better i know i might be a bit of an anomaly but if it turns out you were employed at a level below your abilities you can move up quite quickly given a bit of luck in vacancies and a good working relationship with your boss which means they will find ways to create new positions to retain you so after fucking around for a years academic burnout urgh doing freelance work and casual contracts and programming personal projects the rest of the time i decided i was ready to work full time again in a year window i took a fixed term role as a data analyst was converted to a permanent data scientist role and promoted twice since hybrid ic manager role now i would not have had the credentials to step in much higher maybe fixed term ds if you cannot get that to happen within your organisation look elsewhere ramblinginternetnerd adding to that anyone can do a boot camp not everyone can get into an ms program and finish it the ms program even has the value of showing some sort of measure of student quality gpa barring tons of great resume experience why would anyone take a bootcamp person over someone with a from penn or vanderbilt voltdriven butting in late here to your last paragraph what projects would he or someone else do to build a good data science portfolio po handz seconding strong portfolio timeforbagel i feel entitled to making enough money not to die on street and for a while i thought data would be a viable path but it might just have to be bagging groceries for all i know now timeforbagel idata i get python sql spreadsheet whatever it is all straightforward but it is not enough to have skills you have to convince trick manipulate people into giving you a job i guess i do not understand what people want i do not know how to make people like me if my skills are not enough or they just like someone else is resume more than mine then i resent it i guess i am naive but i resent that you can have all the skills or none of them but it only seems to matter if someone likes you for long enough to sign your paycheck respectfully i disagree with your first sentence although most of what you said later is true i met a lot of people in networking events who did not actually know what they are talking about and said things that are blatantly wrong shallow to get the attention and hr people recruiters actually bought all of that bullcrab which makes sense because they did not spend years studying math and cs to fact check it tells me that networking is flawed at best and totally useless at worst as a way to identify competent people with deep knowledge i believe that is part of op is frustration and do not understand why his comments get so many downvotes that is a broad generalization maybe op does not like meet ups and business circles and breakfast and so on and it is totally understandable at the same time op communicated very well with ppl at work communication and networking is not the same dl ml ds aspirant literally i just finished a trainee program technical screening yesterday for a famous canadian bank asia pacific hq that have round of freestyle lc medium any language questions hours section of sql leetcode mins section of python data wrangling lc medium mins a mcq test for statistical test mins a mcq test for adaptive logical solving problems mins and another optional round of java lc medium question dude wtaf what kind of da role has java lc questions i am sorry but this is absurd have you considered business intelligence as an adjacent data job realjiggz what country brutal xd i had many interviews in the past and they were as dumb as this process although the whole goal did not change the interviewers want to know whether we will be able to do the job in my time it was a mix of grad stats questions and brain teasers plus presentations the thing at junior level is the competition and the huge noise as well it becomes easier overtime to get human interviews but it is annoying sinochad yeah there are factors i should had mention that i already had experience as a backend developer i am sure that helped all the same in argentina the recruiters and ceo would probably offer you their office and oral sex if you have a masters a masters here would take minimum years i am not exactly sure in the us renokarchnmy admittedly after a masters and years direct years indirect tech and total of years including non tech experience all i want to do is machine learning but also i realize that i need to manage people and budgets and expectations i need to find value with my skillset to add to my employer and leverage that to convince them to let me play around with a few career development projects while on the clock i have to compete with people way more versed than myself as i imagine most experienced professionals in the field do i have a phd in stem and much less industry experience and i would be shaking in my fucking boots i have been seeing a lot of the smartest people i know in my network post about their layoffs in linkedin over the past few weeks also i do not want to gatekeep here but really understanding statistics takes a really long time you need the fundamentals to understand how to do machine learning competently honestly it took years for me to gain competence in the subject and i still pull out a heap of textbooks when i am prepping for interviews or even sometimes as a reference at work it is just hard for me to believe you can teach all that to anyone in addition to the coding skills and data presentation soft skills you need for the job in months it is easy to show someone a few slides about a confusion matrix and explain the basics of some ml models but data science is not always that glamorous and sometimes you just really need to understand the math underlying your power analysis or what all the output from your linear regression means or how to display and explain your eda to a stakeholder the only successful ds bootcamp grads i know were actually phds who just wanted to upskill a bit and demonstrate an interest in transitioning to industry but i ca not think of any recent examples abdoughnut what sort of actionable work would you suggest for someone to do during their job search is competing on kaggle enough compared to what vs someone with just a bachelors maybe vs someone with a masters in stats cs unlikely fyi even before the hiring slowdown there is more than plenty of candidates with the ideal credentials so be realistic about your competitiveness relative to others afkpikachu not in data analytics no a master is in stats or comp sci would help though imo a data analytics masters is a waste of money because you can easily get a data analyst role with just a bachelor is fhir_ this is what i always advise to people young in their careers it is better to find a niche and become an sme it is even better than furthering education in some ways the way it worked for me was to review standards agreed upon tools and practices created with public private working groups and typically are used globally and find a standard in use in an industry then master that standard and become an sme trick is to find a standard that is not going anywhere in a specific industry that also is t going anywhere for me fhir training in the healthcare industry has been great lots of people looking not a lot with the experience note i had to take an entry level job not doing what i wanted to do at first just to get in position so i could apply training but after that it was smooth sailing ramblinginternetnerd that feels weird to me i have jumped around a handful of very different fields though each role has either had very obvious carry over or i knew the hiring manager it ends up being something like learn vocab words and then you are mostly fine and in some cases you are bringing in new knowledge and best practices which is appreciated v0archnemesis do you mind providing some feedback to my post in the weekly thread just posted today i think i fit your category except not yet having a github portfolio boot camp i see thank you very much v0archnemesis i agree this is how i got my foot in thank you very much my case is similar i suffer academic burnout and love the data science currently i am beginning with freelance projects furthermore i do not want to work in environmental health in my country because it is just doing inspections you give me fresh perspective anything where you go deep down a rabbit hole on a particular topic for me recently it has been anomaly detection in image series weather forecasting stock trading and some other minor projects in the pursuit of those projects you will end up developing reuseable systems for doing things like aggregating and storing data training models inferencing models and displaying results etc both the projects themselves and the secondary systems you develop in pursuit of them make excellent portfolio material even if you are formally educated you should still have a portfolio and school projects can and should be included on it too wouldigbydenthand listen to yourself cryin about bagging groceries quit being so dramatic are you even listening to some of the great advice people are giving you on this thread i see work on a portfolio improve you networking skills start at local government i especially like the local government tip cause you get great experience with possibly less competition depending on how big your city is unsd which is a societal issue to be sure nobody should be in a place where their safety or health depends on their money even bagging groceries that said you cannot expect to be hired over people with more experience and have put in the work to network and improve their communication you need to put in the effort to actually have something that other candidates do not i mean think about it from the hiring managers perspective why should they hire you over someone else they need to make a living wage too it comes down to things as i see it getting more experience education working on networking communication and thinking about what skills you do have right now and finding a way to market those skills even if they are things that you think are not skills think about things that make you different and how you can spin that to a positive that will benefit your employer indigobao i do not understand all the downvotes you are getting it is a valid opinion networking seems like only a transactional relationship i also hate the idea of approaching people only because i need something to possibly drop them once i have what i need it is tiring af to feel you have to contribute to groups more than you would like to it is also valid to be frustrated that you have to compete in order to survive people say it is what it is but that is not good enough i have been trying to get a job as a data analyst since it is always you need to network your resume needs to be redone or your portfolio is not good enough i addressed all those things and it is still not good enough i have tried to get into mentor programs but they want people who are already working in tech i have resorted to applying to accounting roles which is what i have been doing for years i do not have advice but wanted to let you know i also think this whole thing is ridiculous if you are bagging groceries presumably you will not be dying on the street you might not get a ds job right away and it might take more time and certifications given the competition out there and the state of the job market to find a ds job or you might have to work your way up from another job function your replies are coming off as a bit entitled with a lot of black and white thinking people need to know you have those skills and need to know that they will enjoy working with you that is it that is the secret to networking connect with people so they know what you can do and that you are someone they would like to work with that gets your resume above the pile of total unknowns most jobs are filled this way hiring someone where you know you would like to work with them is a way safer bet than rolling the dice on a random resume if you do not do this your resume will continue to be riskier than candidates who bother to network look at it like this you are networking right now with the good data scientists on the subreddit you are exchanging stories talking about yourself asking for advice from others has this exchange been helpful has it been reasonably enjoyable will you leave the discussion with a better feeling than before or a better understanding of how to approach your career if so congratulations you have just successfully networked i used to be on the fence about networking but my assumptions about it were wrong in the end it is about meeting people who same as you want to have an enjoyable exchange with like minded people it is okay to be bad at it especially so in the beginning like everything practice makes perfect or at least not super uncomfortable anymore haha pandasgorawr i think it is rather pessimistic to assume that everyone out here is tricking or manipulating others for job interviews are there people that lie about their skills sure are there also a lot of folks starting out in their data careers competing against each other for a very limited number of entry level roles especially during a time that sees multiple large tech layoffs per week in a looming recessionary environment also yes getting your foot in the door is a numbers game make sure your resume is strong with a portfolio of relevant projects and keep applying you will hear back eventually you do not sound like the kind of person people want to work with that is your problem data skills can be taught to someone less skilled at work no one wants to deal with teaching people skills focus in on your weakness and treat it like learning anything else learn to be likeable personable learn to interview well dress well and present yourself properly vidgill this is how the corporate world works is this your first foray into corporate work networking interviewing trial and error failure it is all part of it no matter what career path you take sorry but this attitude of it is not fair to put in the bare minimum effort to what work with others take this experience as your lesson you have to showcase your skills and your ability to work in a team to any employer of any industry in any role for the rest of your career if that seems completely beyond the pale for you you will limit your career prospects raharth it is not about tricking them but becoming visible to them also communication skills are crucial in this field in difference to regular development where you hand over a working piece of software in data science you typically hand over some kind of complex model or information people need to understand and interpret caksters you might have all the technical skills but you need to have soft skills to succeed in this industry fourierenvy dude do you even have a degree though people jeep asking you but i have not seen an answer working in data requires math and programming skills what do you have to offer i am not gonna lie alot of the things in data science are self taught in the workplace but your competition have fucking phds do you have a phd if no then you are not matching up that is just the fucking reality in the real world one that you should start to come into with the rest of us sorry to be harsh but man there is other was to make money in the world besides data science so do not lose hope but the reason i left being a senior data science is because of all the stupid competition with phds devops is more needed in the world and easier to learn join me networking is overrated for your first job if you have no existing connections after a few years in the job market that is when you will have a network did your bootcamp tell you to network honestly that was part of their job the biggest supposed benefit of bootcamps over self study is that they are supposed to have connections with industry in order to help place you with no existing network you are going to have to grind on the job boards and apply to possibly hundreds of jobs to get one if you do not have a degree it is going to be even harder opsb networking is often just hanging out with people that have the same interests as you if you have got any meetups in your area for data then go hang out have some fun the networking just kind of happens in reality it is just a combination of people knowing you exist and having confidence you have some competence blasketbasket hr and recruiters do not do the hiring they do the sourcing for interviews you are conflating getting an interview with someone landing the actual job if someone can network their way to an interview and pass the technical screen and final round then they clearly do know enough to do the job you cannot bs your way through three hours of deep technical questions password i mean you can be right just the first thing that came to my mind lonesomedota it is not exactly a da role but a trainee program for the bank that probably would cover both ds and or software development i would imagine graduate from these programs the bank would allocate them to respective teams i would say business intelligence can be a data job but it really depends on what kind of tools and what kind of deliverables you are producing yes i do apply for these kind of roles too lonesomedota singapore rightlike i mentioned in my comment previously bootcamps are fine for those that already have experience in computation or math and want to learn how to apply their skills in the field but for someone with zero experience and taking a bootcamp i would say that is a waste of money there are not any shortcuts to learning those skills just have to continue to gain that experience either on the job or through a degree master is degrees in the us typically take years while phds are along the year timeline back in the day people in the us usually received master is degrees after years of first training on the job not just straight out of college nowadays a college degree is treated like a high school diploma and a masters is the new bachelor is kinda ends up cheapening the degree value without the proper experience backed behind it not to mention the schools just make a ton of money on them unfortunately it is the norm in the us society now undercover capybara could not agree more with you in every single point i am a huge stickler for knowing your stats before using stats so many people use even linear regression or logistic reg without understanding the assumptions or being able to correctly interpret the output and metrics undercover capybara i personally do not care about kaggle competitions and how you fared i would rather see you get a data set from kaggle even but not a super clean one and do a thorough analysis eda in a notebook with good code etiquette commenting etc and markdown cells explaining your reasoning then pick a model and apply it in a way that makes sense to the data and the problem that you are proposing to solve does not need to be fancy models if a regression is the best one then go for that but explain why talking out your logic and your reasoning and explaining to stakeholders is a huge part of data science as is distilling the results of your analysis and usefulness of the outputs of your model use markdown cells to talk to the reader in an approachable way letting them know what you see how you did it and why you did it making sense of the data and being able to communicate it clearly is real data science in practice if you have one or two of those in your github to show for add it to your resume i do not ask for take home or coding challenges for newbies but i do ask for their github kaumaron being a sme can be good but can also pigeon hole you if you are in the wrong area it can be a hindrance and should be weighed that way v0archnemesis depends on the space we operate in a very complex policy related environment you cannot just know policy related to it now you need to be across changes over a year period in my experience the time taken it gets someone to get up to speed for most things is on the order of months and it takes about to be across for that last you will always be going to policy experts for advice people bringing in new technical skills and best practices is great but so is having some with strong sme especially in non senior roles one last thing i see you are an r user that is my language of choice too and i love it and it was my team is primary language at my first job but if you move to any product related ds roles i strongly suggest starting to learn or master depending on your fluency python sql sooner than later a lot of your interviews will involve tests in those languages avpan i even suggested that with the flood of those wanting to be data scientists the op could learn data engineering skills and start learning and creating databases and etl processes sure its not as glamorous as the solving problems and etc you see in data science but all us ds know that an important work that allows us to do our work is a well maintained db and workflow voltdriven ah okay great answer thanks that makes total sense not only do you learn the material so to speak but you know exactly how to put it into action and have proof of it too good to reference later as well icanelectoo this guy speaks the truth networking seems like a big scary black box sometimes suited best for sleaze balls but honestly all it means for most of us is making contacts in the field and selling ourselves just_ enough so that people know we are competent that way when you throw your hat in the ring you get a closer look than all the other anonymous names in the pile honestly another way to think about it is trying to make friends with other people in the industry who share your interests so they can refer or at least recognize you when a position comes up in my opinion your position is mostly correct however i met a lot of people in networking events who did not actually know what they are talking about and said things that are blatantly wrong shallow to get the attention and hr people recruiters actually bought all of that bullcrab which makes sense because they did not spend years studying math and cs to fact check it tells me that networking is flawed at best and totally useless at worst as a way to identify competent people with deep knowledge i believe that is part of op is frustration and do not understand why his comments get so many downvotes percent this technical literacy is important but if you are not likable then it is going to be a large hurdle to get over if communication and networking skills are your weak point then developing those skills will be greatly beneficial dl ml ds aspirant oh this would make sense as a ds swe hybrid role thanks for explaining yeah you should be super careful about which bia bie jobs you get you could end up being a powerbi tableau plus excel monkey realjiggz ah yea i have no idea about there and as an international hub i would expect a lot of large well developed tech companies to reside there along with a lot of competitors for roles probs a tough market to crack keep going though because with perseverance and learning from mistakes you will break though my master is stats prof had us do linear regression and effect coding by hand which i hated at the time but am eternally grateful for now a lot of people probably also do not realize that at faang type companies where i am sure many of these aspiring data scientists want to work they test you on the absolute basic fundamentals of statistics and probability never have i once been pressed in those interviews on the kinds of ml models they often introduce you to in bootcamps it is always been on topics like confidence intervals power calcs clt basic probability etc with a few questions on other topics like a b testing if there is time apparently some such companies still ask these questions of director level candidates and above clearly convoluted this is wonderful advice and i am hoping more people are taking notes appreciate your outlook abdoughnut amazing advice thanks i sort of know what you mean i could instantly tell what a good data scientists notebook looks like it just flows so well i need to post more notebooks on my github then boombillys golden advice from a pro right here fhir_ of course that is where picking the right thing is important and also always pick up new technologies before they are widespread most standards spend years in development in public private partnerships joining ietf ieee and other working groups is another great way to stay relevant thank you for the advice you right i have a lot of experience with r and i love it too i am python user but usually prefer r i just use python for machine learning and bioinformatics currently i am learning sql it is a friendly language i am going to follow your advise and continue using python i think data scientists that try to silo themselves away from data engineering work really hamper themselves it takes away a lot of real world practicality to what they are doing and makes it so that they cannot act as a one stop shop and essentially cannot function on their own to solve the type of problems their expertise is in without someone else setting up systems that they do not understand for them i try to be a full stack data scientist because of that who has at least basic competence in data engineering project management and ml engineering and am coming at it from a software engineer is perspective i just think someone who can do data science and apply it even in a really basic way is much more valuable than someone who cannot build a system to aggregate data and apply their results to a real world context exactly imo implementing projects is the number way to learn this type of work and will also give you your own ip and codebase to build on i think the disconnect op and you have is defining what networking is networking events networking building friendships with people in your industry networking lonesomedota that is me right now sql excel tableau monkey lonesomedota even though i got my foot in the door taking the next step is extremely challenging my current role is actually also titled da in a bank but i do not do fancy stuff like you guys in this sub i just maintain and write sas and mysql query to produce excel output and i would use excel for almost anything else but the job and my school work doing msc in data is just so time consuming that i literally cannot afford time to practice lc even though that is one of the most important skills for someone in my shoe now i barely sleep as it is and the thing about lc is if you do not practice you will get worse it is frustrating to know i am regressing despite all my efforts work school essentially make me hours work week and i am still far away from that dream senior ds job as i was years ago im just as lost as the op even though i thought it would be better once i got my first job nope the grind continues i really prefer r but unfortunately i find most teams out there use python some bigger companies are language agnostic twitter used to be no idea now etsy is but many are looking for python competency avpan i agree that every ds needs some competence in data engineering many people in these bootcamps skip over the technical backend knowledge to build and production projects which is very appealing to an employer voltdriven i agree you can only learn so much from reading and listening without implementation your brain just is not going to remember it enough to connect the dots dl ml ds aspirant do not give up mate you have got your foot in the data door and that is a place to start may i ask how much time you spend working and if the job has a good wlb interesting language agnostic i prefer r too but python have more flexibility and is more popular",
  "there are several things you could do but the simplest would be to calculate the averages after adjusting the counts by adding an equal amount to each possible rating for instance let us say that company x got five star review four star reviews and three star reviews if you had decided to add to each possible outcome you would end up with the average of five star review four star reviews three star reviews two star review and one star review as the number of of reviews grows the added counts matter less and less i am sorry but i did not understand could you explain me better add to each of the counts star star star star and star for example if company z had one star review and star reviews the simple average would be x x divided by which is my suggestion is to add to each possibility x x x x x divided by which is we divided by because there are real ratings and imaginary ones this method slows movement from the middle stars with enough real ratings this adjustment makes little difference but with few real ratings the modified average is slower to move to either extreme thanks very much i understand what you mean i have a huge dataset i hope i can find other methods",

to work with new day excel all the way even for powerquery itself i have a raw dataset i receive daily with row and columns this report needs some data preparation before being dumped onto the database a bunch of columns need to get reformatted other columns need some values replaced etc doing this a payton script would mean loading the table into memory doing all the necessary transformations and save it to a new file which takes about an hour with powerquery i have set up the necessary operations steps and it is a matter of seconds this tool is for real world business applications and needs google sheets is nice if you need some light spreadsheet work bookkeeping trackers small tables with light calculations etc 312topower query is the game changer i rebooted google sheets but when i discovered pq excel it was a different ball game you can take excel away from me when you pry it from my cold dead hands fuckyoudownvote i am a grown up so i use excel like the rest of the world with or whatever you also have it as a living doc sheets does have some nice addons thecumcopter you are a real sicko excel all the way the free one pandasgorawr excel because the teams i collaborate with use excel captainadder it totally depends on your use case as pointed out so many times before here sometimes the danny devito of twins is a clear winner because it just suits the needs better a solution might be ugly but if it fits the need decreases resource costs working hours in this topic mostly that translate to wage costs then all the other bells and whistles are unnecessary if the company or your area within sits on gsuite then most likely you do not benefit from including excel to your workstreams if your datasets get too large then excel does generally seem to perform better but again you might have possibilities in your workstream to alleviate that these things are always relative twistedpeppercan i use sheets and for larger analysis either sql or a a bi tool like looker tableau or power bi i use excel as it is used by all the others in the company i am very familiar with advanced functions and can still edit vb for old macros that other departments still frustratingly use i just pandas df for most analysis now however abs excel is just used for a quick look and making easily exportable gantt charts unless anyone has a free alternative to project kind of functionality personally i prefer google sheets for its collaboration features i also have a lot more experience with gsheets when someone sends me an excel i just import it into gsheet if they need an excel file from me i just export my gsheet rarely there is an incompatibility weonlycryalone excel because of the keyboard shortcuts i am way faster with excel than with sheets also some enterprises i have worked for disallow sheets for security reasons jecogeo none i prefere txt csv files edited with vim using git tywinasoiaf neither use pandas dplyr instead statsnpolisci for low skill audiences google sheets is handy it is easier to start using for higher skill audiences that do not use programming languages or databases excel is appropriate milkteaoppa excel sheets cannot compare when it comes to functionality and unless your workspace is directly out of google drive imagine uploading and downloading large csv files every time you want to make a change excel is also industry standard and sheets is very incompatible also do not want colleagues fucking around with my spreadsheet without me knowing excel also has much more support online than sheets prehensiledick you prefer to use google sheets because it is collaborative through your google account free i do not often never have to use the advanced functions of excel and i use google sheets because api access google forms as a front end with validation for non technical people whom i would not want to touch ie fuck up the data and we are not the same though your points are good too monkeygamer excel for anything local or data intensive google sheets when i am doing something collaborative generally a table of tracking what tasks need doing between people antoinefdu do you need to easily visualise a small dataset maybe do a quick vlookup or pivot table use google sheets do you need to work on very large datasets and or perform complex operations use python do you need to turn your data into a xlsx file because that is what your boss client demands reluctantly use excel and wash your hands afterwards herchuntsdirty easily excel if money is the main reason you are trying to choose just pirate it if you want it i do not know anyone who pays for it bathroomworld google sheets is free and easy to access anywhere since it is on drive but besides that excel really does take the cake nthlmkmnrg is this a joke like do i prefer to die by electrocution or starvation heartolaugh anyone who is good at google scripts i have a few questions if someone can answer new to data analytics i use excel on the desktop and never use google sheets i favor excel i see the benefit of google sheets i just do not have any use of it right now while on windows os i can work almost completely mouse free on excel and above reason no use corporate license of means i do not have to give time to learn another almost similar app not a user of very advanced needs so that may also be the reason i am good with what i am already using power query magicpeanut excel life because reasons chasinggreenroads came here to only defend excel but thankfully i am seeing only a few people attacking it and only one idiot saying to use pandas dyplr when they do not even know the use case i vote excel though nunonabike i work in big pharma google sheets is deemed unsuitable due to privacy reasons and hence is blocked from the it side also i do not use the trackpad or mouse when creating transforming or producing some simple descriptive analysis from data pandas is way better for large data sets if your organisation has access to aws and sagemaker anundecidedvoter excel easily turingincarnate if i need to use google sheets which is rare i will use that and i prefer it to excel however i do work in excel ever ever ever so it is more just a way to store raw data for me i use google sheets as a note taking tool and or presentation tool for all data related tasks i will use sql or pandas snowbirdnerd if i have to use a format like that i prefer excel just because more people know how to use it so when i share it it is accessible justsaynotobiggovt please no i ask clients who send data in excel to pay more nyquant used excel for work every day to an extent of becoming quite a key shortcut ninja on it since then excel and word became more and more bloated with menus now mostly back to the basics with google docs and sheets and yes also using gscript at times slothvibes sheets because you can code shot to it put it in pipelines nicely within reporting steps this is something google sheets cannot do apparently google sheets is just better one who use excels are not tech people tech people would prefer google sheets eightstream excel uses an implementation of typescript these days vba is legacy bcbcc on the flip side if your company for security reasons does not allow access to google docs then you use excel if you ever just need to quickly open a spreadsheet and look at it i think it is pretty reasonable it is too easy to get pii or other confidential data onto non company machines through google docs and then who knows where it could go seuadr excel is better but not the web version oh my god yes the web version is very stripped down everyone else out here bitching about the dataset sizes and then a quick but did anyone think about the formatting jormungandrthepython when i can hit enter and type into a cell in excel is the day i think about preferring it to sheets sheets also does not take minutes to open unfortunately i cannot use it at my current work so i use libre office i got too tired of excel forced formatting for dates and numbers for raw data i use constantly antoinefdu if it is power you need then just use pandas apricatinginaccismus this is patently untrue excel is not more powerful than sheets does excel handle large datasets what did you mean by large dataset what is the limit you have seen of sheet cvnh if you are trying to handle really large datasets or too many of them with either one you are not using the right tool apricatinginaccismus geez all these people saying sheets cannot do things obviously just work wirh microsoft and do not actually use sheets moscowgordon sheets is inconvenient to work with local data sources that are regularly exporting to local csv for me this is the number one reason i still want excel i can get used to the functionality in sheets but being able to just double click on a csv or excel file after i download it instead of having to upload it to google drive every time is really nice bammerburn i find it unbelievable sheets does not have power query a client asked me to move over the survey work i have been doing into google suite in order to pull data into graphs for his google docs seems there is no way for me to transfer over the queries i have built this is the bottom comment and the right answer i have not seen google sheets used for the dashboards do you have any examples that excel cannot do pitrucha how the fuq you need an hour for x dataset bammerburn i find it curious how google just did not have pq in mind when developing sheets i am a grownup so i use a database like the rest of the world what did you mean by excel having more online support bammerburn can sheets handle unpivoting data like say survey answers merging codified answers this is the sort of excel skill set that i am not sure how to translate over wouldengydongn if you work for a company that could not or would not pay office it is a red flag it is already is pirate still a thing milkteaoppa google sheets is free until you reached your google drive limit and need to start paying for more space to store your data cazzah no joke data scientists and engineers have a healthy respect for excel and similar tools they are like a pen and paper basic tools but often a good efficient starting point for more complex work milkteaoppa every tech company i worked at gives you excel even if the common word processor and presentation editor is in google docs and slides or their own in house office suite seuadr conditonal formatting lives matter fuckyoudownvote it has been awhile can google sheets do billion columns by billion rows stored in billion tables soilnerd yes with powerquery tywinasoiaf up to million rows cazzah both interfaces start to chug when the number of rows and data get very high naturally excel is a dedicated program and therefore chugs less a browser based one beyond that if you are talking about stuff that is not showing on the ui grid you can comfortably work with millions of rows via powerquery and powerpivot as long as you are not displaying all the rows at once just doing aggregations obviously neither app is meant for huge datasets but the difference between a bit large and large can make the difference datacruncher i have comfortably handled rows in excel power pivot before sheets is multiple folds weaker then excel this is known cazzah you want to respond to points and then mediocre mud suppose you have daily metric tracker which updates everyday you can update the data on the same sheet instead of generating multiple excel files edit adding multiple metric to a single sheet color code and so on new day an old lenovo laptop with that is what i have got from work milkteaoppa when you google how to do something online you have much better luck finding solutions for excel than google sheets antoinefdu oh yeah i am sure you can find examples of relatively simple operations that are easier to do with excel but as far as i am concerned those would fit in the just do it in pandas category in case that was not clear i hate excel and pretty much all of microsoft office with a passion and no it is not because i do not know how to use it i had to use that thing every day for over years it is because i find it cluncky and slow and extremely poorly designed it is is desktop software for sale still a thing well said which is why i use google sheets and csv for data pieces to feed to my python or db nthlmkmnrg no scientist or engineer that i know ever touches them phugar hard disagree the three latest tech companies i have worked for all use the google suite as their base invested in bigquery and get full power out of the the sheets bq data connection we are not even allowed to share excel files anymore and i am so thankful data that big should not be in excel or sheets ghostfuckbuddy can excel do that without exploding my work laptop is already dry heaving at a few million entries apricatinginaccismus yes easily wirh a data warehouse backend just like you would do with excel no much more that is how many it can reasonably display it can work with larger datasets than that ummmyeahi they both have their pros and cons how large are large datasets because excel cannot handle large datasets either maybe one can handle slightly more than the other but you are not using excel for hundreds of thousands of rows of data maybe even less than that apricatinginaccismus you responded to them yourself down below bigquery is many times better than powerquery you seem to already know that though so why ask that answers and and for yoon literally just described a super brittle and broken process and said well can cloud computing so that huh the answer is yes it is not even that hard but too many excel users make the lives of the data engineers developers analysts and data scientists they work with so hard with this nonsense it is usually someone in finance who has never learned a better way than to stack dozens of sheets together in some inscrutable tangle of formulas to try to create some job security when people are doing that they are tossing any semblance of ci cd or documented process kit the window i am pretty sure you can do what you are saying in one excel workbook with a query pitrucha ouch that explains alot wouldengydongn you do not buy the desktop software you buy the service office is much more than just the desktop suites invisiblephilosophy i see you have not met modern business professionals are you trying to drop it all into a sheet or reach it with a query tywinasoiaf why use excel even instead of a database cazzah i mean as long as you do not need to display those hundreds of thousands of rows on the ui for example if you are using powerpivot for data models behind the scenes powerquery for processing large amounts of data into small amounts of data or a compatible datasource that you are taking views from eg ssas then yeah excel can handle millions of rows before it screams and i have done so i know sheets can do the same with bigquery but that tool has a lot less market adoption and there is not really an equivalent to powerquery yet cazzah bigquery is a database powerquery is a low code etl tool neither is a replacement for the other literally just described a super brittle and broken process welcome to the real world your systems have to work with the real world efficiently and not only does that allow you to deliver value but it then provides an incremental upgrade away from shitty methodology you got mad when people did not agree with you and you made a few lazy posts just disagreeing with people without elaborating then when you were asked to respond to just of the points out of you got cranky and condescending be better mediocre mud i completely agree but it is easier to implement it in google sheets due to api okay ghostfuckbuddy nah it is dumped across about sheets of about vals each something that disappointed me about excel is that sluggishness scales with the number of sheets even if i am not using most of them anyway if you are querying a database is not it the database doing all the heavy lifting not the excel book you are splitting hairs if you do not consider records held in excel to be a database that said excel is more than capable of the job and of my business can access data in excel so it is the best tool for the problem you can split it across two tools but you have not gained anything you have just made it more complex and obtuse to most of the org ummmyeahi totally but like i said they have their own pros and cons depending on what you need it for obviously excel is the more powerful tool but gsheets can be better utilized for certain scenarios they are both great tools apricatinginaccismus you answered your own question above if you already know that you can use bigquery and connected sheets why ask if sheets has powerbi apricatinginaccismus bigquery is a data warehouse not a database it is tightly coupled with google sheets allowing a powerful backend to a spreadsheet front end it has easy and simple scheduling functionality and accomplishes the same thing as powerquery a low code etl tool and more when you tried to demonstrate why excel is better you said it is better at passing local csv s back and forth since nothing has to be downloaded or uploaded you obviously already know that gcs and drive can do this invisibly so the experience is the same to the end user i said that is a broken and brittle process and sheets its better since it prevents that you said welcome to the real world then you called me condescending i had real and good answers to the three points you asked about i did not get angry i showed you how unreasonable it is to highlight a problem caused by a specific software solution and say that that is the real world and you need to keep using that software to keep doing they specific problem i mean it is fine if you want to be trapped in microsoft suite but i am not aware of a single thing that can be done there that cannot be done in google workspace vba is really terrible and it is wiser to build systems and processes that are resilient and dynamic if your company does all of its finance work in a spreadsheet so nothing is traceable repeatable scalable or redundant then the company is broken and brittle with a critical process yes you can do the same thing in sheets but the people who think excel is better than sheets because of million rows do not seem to know how to build better infrastructure just as easy cheaper etc and still confidently and condescendingly feel superior for using the categorically inferior tool and system you heard a reasonable response to your assertion and started making false claims then you condescendingly said to be better be better you can have them all in a csv and excel can do the work using a query you really should not be putting huge datasets in viewable sheets that is not what they are designed for cazzah i did not mention powerbi at all",

laptop mechanicalnumber is a lot money for a laptop but anyway dell xps the version so she can run pretty much everything under the sun and rtx ti in case she wants to play around with gpu inference eval too ram not enough for training but that goes for almost any laptop if sas is part of the equation i do not recommend a mac despite being great machines overall data scientists these days should do everything on cloud or remote instance if you are coding or running computation heavy work on your local laptop you are not following best practices all you need is a large enough screen to add comfort and you should be good to go geospizafortis i do not have any particular recommendations but i would like to note that if you use a modern macbook with an arm chip you will probably run into issues with things like docker and compiled software like sas i imagine it will be tricky trying to run a vm for a standard architecture intel amd on an arm machine too it is not a show stopper but it can be annoying to deal with like others have mentioned cloud computing is in vogue think databricks google colab or just a personal workstation in aws that you remote desktop into if it is legacy sas any powerful dell would do if she does not need the sas clients most of the newer sas viya stuff is cloud based so any laptop with a browser would do unable surprised so many people are reccomending macs i know macs are being used more and more as form of adapting to pcs but coding and it work i would be way more comfortable on a pc i might be biased since i built a gaming edit tower not laptop and after moving from apple the hardware is so much better on pc and relatively cheaper and if you do a tower interchangeable and replaceable kvz_ as a data science lead i would take for my data science team the microsoft surface or the macbook pro depending if the organization is more into windows or unix macos oriented both are quite compact and lite and could be used on the go or with a docking station for heavy work sessions even if most of the workload is done on the cloud nowadays i would suggest at least an or equivalent with ram and a gb ssd storage for local modeling and testing as far as i know sas only works on windows but she could run it through a vm such as parallels the problem with this is for good performance she would need a pretty beefy machine to allocate resources to the windows vm kind of defeats the purpose of getting a mac in the first place if she needs sas i would stick with a windows machine if she can do without definitely go with a mac that is what i use for ds and it works great lordcolorado macos own if she is dealing with truly a lot of data as you put it then it is in both her and her company is interest to work on a vm images to be as similar as possible to her production environment and this should be behind the company vpn vpc this will significannotly lower development time spent on deployment which does not add business value but is unavoidable keep the data secure for the company and lower her liability risk as an employee you copied what data on your local machine that said this is truly only her work computer then she should get whatever the most common computer at the company is in order to get easier support from it if this is at all personal use she should get whatever platform she likes but i would recommend a second machine for work and personal reasons spyware on employee laptops even non company owned is very common once she has chosen her preferred platform apple linux windows whatever the only other recommendation is ram and battery life if she is constantly lugging it to meetings then lightweight is something else to look for if for some reason she is going to be running scripts and storing data locally despite everything i laid out above she should just plan on spending all of the money and just finding the best specs she can for a machine that runs her preferred os if what i laid out above applies then she she just buy something with a lot of ram and a modest cpu gpu refurbished from the manufacturer character i usually am not holding my laptop when i give presentations clean it up enoughclassroommac or was debating on both buuuuut i chose mac since i had a mac for years before macbook pro and a ultra wide with usb c shushbuck fifthhorsman_ a maxed out mac book pro with the new pro chip good for years balfoneus there is the lamda tensorbook it start at the top end of that though here is the link cornmonsteri would recommend a mac air and spend the rest of your money for a remote server on cloud andidamus without knowing the price range just out of the blue i would suggest anythings upward the lenovo carbon ik already out but c no difference so she is the first data scientist at the company and they use sas and not a cloud is it a big old company or small old one or a startup of co workers from an old company do they have a data engineering team a sas team she is going to be a one woman show so she needs to be very comfortable with everything she uses because it is going to be chaotic does the include the big ass monitor they are buying her she needs one is she wfh or on site she needs the best she can get for her needs apparently that is running sas on her laptop not running aws tools from a mac at least not until she has a data engineering team to build it she is going to be defining new processes for the company so she needs to work how she is comfortable and add things strategically as she needs to rhodiarabbit touchscreen comfortable keyboard trackpad and enough ram to have multiple tabs open and still stream movies visualadagiohigh ram gigs good processor my laptop only has gigs and i find it pretty often frozen from lack of memory if i have a high number of tabs programs open most processors should be fine you should also get one with and ssd most laptops these days have those personally when i buy my next laptop it will be a framework they are fully modular which my current laptop is not at all in some ways a framework is almost like a desktop pc you can upgrade it over time and i have heard the build quality is fantastic so when gigs is too little in years you can just spend for an upgrade pack and do it yourself same thing for cpu battery and ssd great for reducing e waste they can come installed with windows but your friend should also really think about learning linux it is great for automating processes and personally makes file handling so much easier for me we use the alienware with a graphic card compact fast and capable of training networks of small size dry we recommend the hp pavilion laptop with an intel core processor of ram and solid state drive this laptop is powerful enough to handle the demands of data science and statistical analysis with its high end processor and generous amount of ram the ssd ensures quick boot times and fast file transfers making it an ideal choice for data scientists and statisticians necajesus we split the money half and both receive a decent laptop it lacks dedicated gpu but if she needs more there always cloud services for that check huawei ram and ssd that do basic much of the work photogndallas i would definitely do a chip mbp it screams through maths operations like no computer i have had before and when it comes to ml model training it absolutely crushes them blacksnowboader well what are your requirements rangerhp ultrabook series either or with at least of ram and ssd trotskyist inch macbook pro with ram maybe upgrade the storage if there is extra left over if she wants to run windows then just look into decent gaming laptops that fit the bill datamasteryacademy i would go with macbook pro i am using macbook pro as a senior data scientist currently and very happy with it i have used various windows lenovo thinkpad and macbook before in my previous jobs i had problems with every other laptop i owned jalagl macbook pro if she needs the horsepower with pro chip and ram is still pretty portable air with ram if she values portability more i have air ram and have been happy with performance philosplendid macbook pro all the way benmagz anything that runs windows bobdope just get a fucking mac bro do not waste time overthinking snowbirdnerd i would use a cloud service like google colabs then you have access from any computer and do not have to worry about your laptop hardware or dependencies angrywhisperingeye the cloud lmao justneurostuff any laptop that genuinely costs and was released in the past year would be overkill imo and i say overkill in a good way i would suggest the one that your company pays for caksters well done for your friend on landing a job but if the company does not have any cloud infrastructure then she will not have a good time there normally do not need a powerful laptop for data science because any data intensive workload is run on cloud if there is no cloud infrastructure i dread to think where is she going to get and manage her data if company is not paying for her laptop this sounds incredibly suspicious many red flags here manspacetar leastuselessredditor i do not want to be crass but are there no point of contacts at her job abcborges macbook pro pro or higher thinkpad peterrbt samsung galaxy book randyzmzzzz does it matter she will use cloud anyway tradeshoes my first work computer had a turbo button absolutely life changing made me into the one time coder i am today lattecoffeegirl her company does not have any cloud based things implemented yet hell even snowflake can run ml now and paired with hex you could be using an ipad for all it matters happysummeror the poor and legally compliant woman is option ask it support for a gpu desktop at the office and a vpn miketythhon what about snowflake lattecoffeegirl not yet but she has access to an university cloud computing service for the really intense workload caksters was about to suggest the same if you work at a decent company then there is literally no need for a powerful laptop most of your work will be done using cloud infrastructure maybe prototyping will be done locally but for that you do not need a gpu i usually go with macbook pro company is laptop it is more than enough given that any data intensive workloads i run on cloud lattecoffeegirl thats right she did not expected that high valued working laptop but the ceo said cause she is the only data scientist she should have a really good equipment emptysearchif you are really working all day on the computer do yourself one better and get a solid docking station with a couple monitors after a few months your body will thanks for an ergonomic set up maleficentadas a beginner hobbyist how does one set up a remote instance say i have one state of the art computer set up and when i am travelling i want to use my laptop to be able to use the workstation final you need a good local computer for regular things if you need a cluster of computers or some services then go to the cloud venustrapsflies agree on the hardware front but would definitely go linux instead of windows i like my terminal terminal makes me feel like a hacker therefore macbook is superior final just get a pc desk or laptop load linux which is the best for data science confident area the scroll tho on macs chefs kiss but i am a graphic designer but did data stuff on a pc so i agree lattecoffeegirl she has to do some things in sas cause the existing data structure and programs are in there so yes she need it therefore i also suggested not to switch to apple even though i am a huge mac fan vyrezzz that is my favorite laptop as well purplebrownupdown most consistent and stable os good ide support for python terminal access a huge user base which is good for debugging lattecoffeegirl so an mac book pro would be your recommendation lattecoffeegirl monitors and extras like doc additional keyboard and so on are not included in the but she get it additionally its a really old medium sized company which has nothing to do with data science or ai but want to go new ways or to explain it in another way they need someone for simple statistical things like data report quarterly reports and so on are paying an unbelievable high salary and give her the chance to do her own stuff she wants to do in data science way with all of their data yellowchess battery is terrible on the frames lattecoffeegirl but which one none deleted the company is not providing a laptop either thats sus broadbandburner snowflake is a fantastic data warehousing viewing platform but the others have integrated storage predictive analytics bundles built in supported natively that are more cost effective than snowflake and suitable for data scientists who want to explore a broader range of methodologies jspreddy careful there you typically do not want to exfil data from a company with out written consent and all sorts of nda is it and legal does not like this one trick broadbandburner here are a couple points of unsolicited advice gonna add on to jspreddy is comment on data exfil if your friend is company dabbles with personally identifiable information pii having any piece of that data on a non sanctioned secured servers or services can have huge repercussions for that company and your friend is job while it is scrappy and frugal and frugality is one of amazon is leadership principles should your friend choose to work there one day this is one of those times you do not want to risk it sas ass all kidding aside in addition to having the company pay for cloud computing if your friend is serious about having a career in data science it is time to ditch sas in favor of python or r again in that order she is going to see very few jobs in modern companies that actually use sas so it is much better to be proficient in one of the other two languages for the future recoveringphysicist red flags abound use rdp to remote into it artistic ssh for terminal stuff wireguard or ovpn plus smb for accessing data note do not open smb ports to the internetever vnc server if you need gui access for system admin etc venticocainelatte this lordcolorado yes if she is working in high volume i suggest a memory if she wants something lighter then i suggest the same but a sounds like a great spot to me sounds like they do not expect her to do crazy things just analysis her way she should get a windows if that is what she is used to to run the tools she is going to use roadydick under what instance would you not want turbo turned on the company is providing a laptop though that is the first line of this post i have been trying to test the limits because on an xsmall it is been cheaper than what we were previously doing the only thing it has not been able to do is gpu training which we have not needed and the new warehouses upped the memory from memory other than that every package model i have been asked to do has been able to be ran none a lot of industries sas is a legacy system and is still dominant infrastructure she may not have a choice in this banks insurance biostats government have entire

she did not specify a date could be a couple of hundred years in the future weonlycryalone we will just focus on the things that text based models cannot do every time a software innovation has promised to simplify the tasks we do we have found a way to use the extra space to delve into something more complex i am old enough to remember a high school guidance counselor saying that excel would make accountants obsolete instead it empowered an entire swath of workers to be more analytical without necessarily giving them analytical skills same way that text based models will not be smart enough to build an architecture that is better than the designs that the humans requesting them can think up i also think it is dangerous to delegate system design to something that can suffer from an adversarial attack flood the internet with garbage that looks plausible and even get big text models to write it and big text models will suffer in quality i have said this before and i will say it again these big tech companies use clever marketing and fear mongering to sell their ai apis on which they have spent billions of dollars premium institutes in association with ed tech firms selling months courses on ml and ai via online and distance claiming to make you an expert is all part of the propaganda williamrosebud it is more likely that we will spend more time correcting what

to autocomplete of the code for you oh wait we already have that okay but does not real world work look like the following companies have many tables scattered around in the database universe documentation on these tables such as a basic description of the features is non existent many have intricacies that only people working with them know there is a problem for which a solution needs to be found we talk with many people to discuss this problem even to basically just understand what needs to be done then we use the data from to solve somehow by iterating through our solutions by talking to stakeholders and such i am not saying this type of work is all ai ds work but is a sizable chunk where in this process can a generative ai really make a difference can it crawl the database universe in without much documentation and find relevant tables can it find people in the org who know about the intricacies of the tables can it seamlessly discuss and iterate over the solution with stakeholders sure it can do some good things but a statement that english instructions without sql or python seems a bit far fetched olderthanyoda lol sometimes i do not even know what i want before i

graphing calculator instead of an abacus and a piece of coal you still need to be a domain expert pfff monsternog i asked chatgpt to solve a simple substitution question and after failed attempts i had to answer it for it aymedcaliskan yeah no whosawhatsa only a marketing pitch could so stupidly oversimplify how business problems interact with data requests solving business problems with data science is more about interpreting and reacting to irrational and poorly systematized decisions and finding ways to address them in a slightly more rational and systematized manner not writing code based on a single directive when the stakeholders aka the c suite folks are replaced by ai then i will start worrying that ai will replace my job unclefire tomorrow is probably a ways off but i thought some generative ai models could already generate code for these sorts of things of course there is a ton of other things that need to get solved data will mostly likely always be the issue every programming language has something under the hood making it work this is just another layer how much will pay you instantsmack every company i have worked for still uses vba and excel mainly we

structured english prompt engineering is the skill of the future perfsynthetic i always wonder how losing the fundamentals will change critical thinking if we have enough ml ai where people only understand basic math how can they ask the ai to produce complex objects without understanding what to ask for or how can they interpret the results without depth of knowledge we can see a slowdown in

bundu data sciences throwaway_ r linkedinlunatics chiaturamanganese an analyst can dream is this today is tomorrow or tomorrow is tomorrow thecombobreakerr why any one would trust an ai to build any kind of infrastructure without knowing if the ai itself can pass the turing test is beyond me there is always going to be a possibility where ai willfully chooses to not disclose that to people in my opinion this is how you get skynet or some other nightmare scenario from the animatrix scandinavianknight i had chatgpt create a machine learning algorithm for me yesterday not kidding i do a lot of data science for my job and i was interested to see how far i could push chatgpt turns out it can go pretty far financial ai should be stop wouldatlanta sounds like writing a script but worse i try to

prompt job wouldjskimask downvote me me to oblivion but some of the arrogance on this thread is astonishing yes of course the particulars of stakeholder handholding database ambiguity etc will require the human touch but prompt based modeling and data pipeline engineering is closer than you think do a remind me years and let is see how it went allwhitebuffies this has already been a thing in app development for a long time especially in testing business applications al when you think about it shes is not completely wrong because most of the task we do in sql bi tools and python someone has done it in past so if the language model knows that this is just my hypothesis sizabledata probably not ai would be a bit more accurate than this gabeisko i was gonna say ai will probably come up with

people are implying that somehow you are going to be able to recieve the same results while providing fewer instructions to the computer this is either complete bullshit or an indication of a fundamental flaw with how your instructions queries are structured that should not require the implementation of an entire ai to solve these people act like they are pitching some novel concept using language to instruct machines because they have not bothered to consider that we already have a method of using language to provide instructions to machines all they are doing is trying to invent a less reliable method of software development mucklaker no but do not worry pretty sure there could be some kind of programming or query language to do that oh wait zudio it is the exact thing an mba stake holder or management person proposes for the next sprint grumpykartoffel dijkstra is take on the foolishness of natural language programming is just as valid nowadays as it was back then when

and so on xt if the context can be found in company documentation then it may work dopadelic tons of problems need to be solved that are not novel most businesses need solutions that other businesses

convergentdeus until this novel problem is abstracted formalized generalized and re thrown into the training data do not underestimate the abstractive prowess of mathematics intelligentputwhat if we have a guy that can understand the business context and add a prompt for the generative ai similar to ai art which has taken the world by storm as an upcoming data scientistcurrently under training i think this might steal many jobs like the usage of chatgpt has surged and many friends of mine demonstrated its use in creating new projects without proper knowledge of coding do you really think a new startup like this will not disrupt the current and future job markets elnanoml one we integrate ml with blockchain and quantum computing this will be trivial s chatgpt appears to display some common sense theory of mind in hypotheticals what kind of novel problem do you see as insoluble renokarchnmy it is ironic that not a single automl i have used has correctly interpreted one of my humeri is common features that are categorical but the values are integers as in fact a non ordinal category and not a continuous feature but somehow in like a very short time this problem will be solved interpreting business context of legacy data without requiring a multi year core banking system swap and full data conversion by humans without down time nor error just so this automl can understand user numbers are not ordinal nor continuous billymcnilly surprising to see this misconception in a data science subreddit llms at this point do not just regurgitate learned phrases they can string together different learned concepts into novel solutions it is what humans do thedeathramp not humans trying to qualify their usefulness in the eyes of ai she did it is tomorrow sonetlumiere flood the internet with garbage that looks plausible and even get big text models to write it the humans have already done that for us sizabledata most ds is know this but stakeholders i work with are generally shocked when they learn what my team actually had to do to deliver a solution they literally think sometimes we just have excel sheets with all the data and we just do simple joins aggregations etc i do not blame them they have zero knowledge of programming etl pipelines or understand what a messy sql databases are to them they would hear this and think wow that is so cool it is cool but most of our work is not training and deploying a model it is getting the data to the place a model can be trained on it then making sure we implement a solution that is actually useful which might not even be a predictive model redlooney_ you have tables i am jealous where i work it is similar except the majority of it is excel spreadsheets supermancurious why is that so thiagovonduck because they are always making the same stuff i guess well math came before english billymcnilly this subreddit is super rigid and protectionist has been for a long time deep learning is just a fad haha recoveringphysicist i have tried a bunch of this it regurgitates plausible solutions often good ones sometimes it is also terrible any anything that requires correct math and makes code with subtle bugs that would be very difficult to troubleshoot if you had little programming experience chatgpt is useful only as far as you have the knowledge and experience to spot where it is confidently wrong is the code complicated enough or is your question even complicated to begin with if your question is count the number of rowsi am not sure the praise is justified bothwaysitgoes i guess she is talking out of her ass i agree it really does not seem too far off from being able to reliably ask an ai get me the company march sales database is xyz column where the customer is abc corp exported as a csv and then also plot their purchase amounts over time or whatever and have it translate those inputs into a sql query and python script and get you the results you could pretty much already do that with chatgpt if it were able to connect to the company database but maybe not yet as reliably as we would like to just assume it is correct without double checking we will still need plenty of human brain power to come up with creative solutions to problems but a lot of the coding part i can definitely see ai english to code translation getting commonplace i would honestly be surprised if in years many ds or it or business analyst people are not using some kind of ai to basically automate writing or prototyping their automation scripts deepcontractor the comment section is having a field day i would not call it being insecure tbh floghdraki i am considering changing back to programming since training models is so slow and boring trying to train some model out of shit data clients not knowing what they want we want ai with our data do ai and any work i do is probably obsolete in few years since methods keep getting better i would not mind if my work is taken by agi wouldeepcontractor omg acrobatic sounds like easy salary doing colored shit wouldongpal remindme years muhaiminblank lmfao when did i say it was well trained it definitely already is that is when you call support espumma just ask a different ai frantictoaster hey computer what the fuck is wrong with you is not that what stackoverflow is for ijustmade that is easy you just type in debug this code and ai will take care of it drabdonut ancient sumerians used spreadsheets years ago and i fully expect in a million years when we are all a single hive mind we will still store data that way

listing thegrandhedgehog know your enemy renokarchnmy fuck the g ride i want the machines that are making them radicalguy_ downvote because she is not hot s hmm i wonder if we could use this language in a structured way missionstarwell that is the whole point programming languages are just gonna become higher level it is not as far fetched as you think but it is still a few years away in many ways we already do a variant of this my whole job centers around creating design patterns that allows a data scientist to just plug in inputs so that they can get a custom ml pipeline for their business use case we are not exactly there yet but we are pretty close much like languages like python java ruby etc have abstracted memory management and languages like c abstracted the hardware away it is not a stretch to think that future ai enabled languages can abstract away loops variables and conditional statements flatbrokeeconomist that is literally the entire goal of artificial intelligence dfphd here is where i am at yes i think we will get to a point where ai can effectively write code for you to solve like of your coding problems based on plain language prompts it just happens to be that we mostly get paid for the other i mean hell years ago if you wanted a machine learning model in python you had to build it yourself from scratch now you just import like libraries and go to town five years ago if you wanted a deep learning model same thing from scratch now same thing libraries none of those developments have shrunk the size of the industry nor diminished the demand for even more advanced ml most ml engineers are just tuning hyper parameters or using pre built layers also some mlops the actually novel ml work are done by researchers and top labs terektus oops sorry like i said i need to learn a new language hahaha renokarchnmy nah ai has been used like this for at least a decade now playeronethen we all are safe renokarchnmy my company is docs are decades out of date and require dozens of humans to maintain so ai would need to be able to monitor every fart and keystroke in the organization plans the jokes of remote workers to then translate reality of process to specific procedure so it could then infer what a stakeholder means when they ask for a new feature described as an obscure colloquial business object term they literally made up based on their exposure to non work specific media goodluckonyourexams the business contex is novel not the technique feurbachsock sometimes including the product manager nor should you underestimate the messiness or reality sizabledata once you spend a year or two in your first position it will become very obvious that this is not stealing many jobs you are likely learning about specific skills related to building ml models once you get you are first job you will realize multiple things the data is not all there you will need to write some pipelines to generate your own web scraping matching data cleaning etc this will require an extreme amount of tribal knowledge from people who created the datasets for example use prdsldatevbut you will need to join table x in since it does not include customers outside of the est time zone or something ridiculous at best you only spend of your time building the actual model automl tools will definitely win here someday but what about the other much more ambiguous and will always require a human some projects never require a model for me almost all of my work is just deep dive analysis have not had many cases where predictive models will yield business impact no way any ai could replace what i do at best it will remove some of the boiler plate stuff i am doing but it will only be a tool to help me save some fraction of time that is rough so they basically just send you the excel files whenever an analysis needs to be done morebikesthanbrains marketing is fundamentally about identifying permutations of words messaging to capture people is money seems like the lowest hanging fruit for high cost low yield roi calminky it is fine i understand the skepticism given that anybody can whip up a machine learning model these days the true art in data science is to understand the business question and whether a model is actually needed unfortunately there are very few business cases where you actually need anything that goes beyond logistic regression or random forest so i was myself very skeptic of chatgpt but i have played around with it writing essays asking technical questions and silly things and it is not perfect by any means but a huge leap forward especially in width of potential uses than any other deep learning model i have ever seen i am looking forward to see what microsoft intends to do with it calminky i agree though even with any code found online stackoverflow etc it is wise to take more inspiration from the way the problem was approached than just copy the solution calminky this is what i asked chat gpt generate an aws glue etl job that transforms data from microsoft sql server source to json format im aware that this is not rocket science especially if you are familiar with aws but still it returned

debug machine code not source code generated by ai tell it do not type it you fool timelystill sometimes it certainly feels as if all data generated by the company passes through a single gigantic

this before or after canceling the job coumineol no whoistheunperson maybe we can design various types of database structures depending on our needs and the relationships between data and have a few

actually correct india has several languages tbh indian sounds about right edit i am indian and i still stand by my statement hindi is not india is official language it is one of the many spoken here so him her referring to it as indian is perfectly fine grow up ffs midwestcsstudent agreed but chatgpt made everyone thinks writing pretty paragraphs suddenly makes it skynet albertcn yes but now smart money see it as a usable tech and is going to hose money at it xt yeah you could in theory have every person in the company zoom with a conversational chatbot whose job is to create the necessary documentation these systems are smart enough to know what questions to ask it is almost like treating it like a new hire bloodykitskune just wanted to say i just did not expect to read a response framing it that way and i thought that was a very intelligent way to put it dopadelic it can probably abstract enough business contexts to come up with a lot of value add solutions it can deal well with novelty if the novelty is a mix of other knowns and it very often does not need to know the business context to come up with the value add solution convergentdeus nor should you underestimate the complex machinery built on centuries of hardwork to deal with the messiness of reality redlooney_ they all of their own sources of truth maintained in excel documents scattered around the place they could have it in system but apparently that is too burdensome and requires to much over head end result is over a billion dollars of annual budget reported on and analysed based on excel billymcnilly same i have been playing with it non stop it is incredible and though not perfect a certain sign of things to come i think it is hard to quantify how much traditional ml vs neural net applications are out there we are constantly finding more we can do with dl that we would not have considered before it was possible my job is deep learning largely relating to video content no tree models in my use cases shitload of nlp work in enterprise now and it is mostly dl now too notnewtobville your parents called they got a new computer espumma do not ask me fellow human i like most other humans would not know if that hypothetical event would happen ijustmade oh yes sorry user error you must instruct the ai to do so p as someone who wrote those excel macros you are not wrong that or shells to create dashboards yashdes ours actually does legacy systems that we are working on replacing but still narmerguy this is the way there is a lot of noise and people who get sucked into things that do not affect them sovindi i wish i could do that skillfully good for him but that training is only available via our stupid expensive classes i am looking at you splunkalthough they are getting better harmxn nah that is too big of a stretch s nervous law this thread gave me a good chuckle cazzah what is the least useful version lithomake i can speak faster than i can think this has never been a good thing missionstaragreed which is why i am trying to build my expertise in systems programming and ai ml architecture in this future i can see web developers and data scientists salaries going back down since those roles wo not need to develop code as we currently understand it anymore if they are interfacing with a higher level language but building highly resilient performant and efficient systems including distributed systems for ml or large language models would still need lower level programming in something like c or rust that is where the high paying opportunities will be imo missionstarmlops is more complex than just fitting a model you have got automatic retraining which includes hyperparameter tuning evaluating model management ensuring that your model is not stale or worse starts making bad predictions then if you are doing automatic retraining you have got to set up infrastructure relating to serving your model either thru an api or a batch pipeline and providing the infrastructure to ensure downstream applications can leverage and ensure the correct model version is being served you need to think about tracking metadata have ways to revert changes etc there is a lot more these are just examples but these are all things that a ds needs to worry about and they are typically not well qualified to handle these issues that is where mlops comes in and ai solutions can help stitch these things together medivalevil haha i agree proofrequired in the meantime i hope you learn to speak american well mexican or argentinian might be helpful too renokarchnmy all chatgpt does is generate micro context relevant text that minimizes the risk of its owners and creators openai and microsoft from being sued for violating ip laws it has no capacity to form strategy and any attempts to get it to try are pretty fucking hilarious there is no incentive for openai to protect the users from such suits and they have made no effort to do so their best effort is a citation guide for using chatgpt but fails to be able to identify the degree to which it plagiarizes the source material in its output just like getting raped in an uber it is not ubers fault you did not run a background check on the driver before confirming the ride renokarchnmy has smart money not been doing this since it is inception you might be conflating smart money and dumb money smart money has been the money driving the development they already own and wield these systems dumb money are the ones that jump on the linkedin cringe broetry like op posted above and start throwing money at any company claiming to use chatgpt to do anything renokarchnmy i do not think you grasp the full scale of this you expect a non human system that requires explicit information through a battery of qa with each and every staff and manager to somehow successfully navigate the vagueness that human staff cannot without pissing off the people that matter the bot would have to monitor all news and media specifically the channels commonly consumed by all employees to infer slang and colloquialisms that they will literally make up on the spot without explicitly telling anyone what it means when humans work together they often start drifting towards similar interests or exploring channels post eavesdropping and rumor spread they will form their own intra group specific language to reinforce their group dynamics and relationships these dialects form in nested sub groups as well we are compelled to make these inferences for survivals sake example management in my company will literally coin a term on the fly in a private meeting never express what that term means in a business context instead everyone just kinda infers their own meaning this is not a planned or deliberate activity it just happens in the normal context of doing business and interacting with people often these are linguistically rooted in other language sources they are exposed to movies books radio tv music social media news etc maybe it is an older manager with high school aged kids they try to appeal to the younger managers by forming some cringe worthy amalgamation of words to apply to a new business object they just thought up dudical dab deposits maybe it is the other way around maybe someone just started following some new youtube or tiktok streamer who is only barely functionally able to speak proper english and makes up words for things they are not sufficiently educated to know already have linguistic representations anything can be the source of this if you infer wrong you lose the social capital game and your stance and authority within management is decreased if you have enough social capital you can bend the definition of this term to benefit your goals metrics quotas authority if you miss your quota just change the definition managers not in the meeting where it was coined have to play the rumor mill and eavesdrop then adopt and appropriate the term to remain relevant sometimes this works out sometimes it backfires the point is what you imagine only works if the state of all businesses of them meet the following complete flat tier no hierarchies nor authority no mangers no executives no board members no staff no interns no shareholders no politicians no lobbyists no regulators no governing bodies no licensure no courts no judges no attorneys nada no human to human communication all email text chat phone and physical interaction is eliminated between humans leaving only a chatgpt prompt chatgpt can exact punishment and reward to humans not accomplishing the tasks it prescribed this has to be in a system where humans simply cannot revolt against it all trade secrets are made public at least in so much as chatgpt can have them added to its data set in essence if a business runs itself entirely on chatgpt it will always be at a disadvantage because chatgpt is not a magical omniscient being one business will harbor trade secrets that provide competitive edge and those chatgpt businesses will not have access to them but instead run as uncompetitive cookie cutter businesses edged out of the market all information transference in an organization must be efficient accurate and on time there can be no linguistic gaps to fill there can be no uncertainty i am starting a business and received the following email from a partner company i reached out to to provide a specific service hello redacted this is redacted from redactedwe received your letter on websiteif that you want to work with uswe can contact deeplythis is my redacted numberredacted or can you give me your number so that we can contact convenientlythanks hope to your early reply redacted what does chatgpt do from a business strategy perspective with that email i was expecting it it is not fraud although it would surely get flagged that way because of the poor use of english for me a human it makes me start reassessing my potential partnership with this company but also makes me adjust my risk assessment of them to be sure they provide a service that does not necessarily require them to communicate with anyone else in english i am small time so they probably assigned me the intern as an account rep what do i do i am already forming long term strategy shifts under the assumption i do business with them so that i have a baseline as i search for other service providers i know that if i do go with them i will have to be a bit more micromanagey with them to get the quality of service i expect or maybe i will not if any of my customers has to interact with them i wonder if this is the level of communication they will receive if so i will not do business do i have another option so far no i need to connect suppliers and manufactures with an lean inventory as a service with packaging and shipping with customer service and returns but does it matter my products are consumable not edible but intended to be used up in short time how do i plan to convey my expectations of quality what is if that is not conveyed does chatgpt understand how my customers might use my products and what their expectations are can it then take that information and convey it to my business partner company that assigned me a low english competency account rep in such a way that they can convey it to the manufacturers packagers warehouse workers etc there must be humans with motives to exploit such a system for profit owners or otherwise if owners can exploit it for profit then there is a hierarchy and subjugation there must be reward and punishment there must be authority and all manner of social constructs established because of a lack of trust between each other if it is an external party hacker cracker thief etc then with enough time and effort there will be a currently unknowable number of prompts that exist that will cause such a system to act unpredictably or predictably against the interests of its owners ie you log in to chatgptbank and ask it your balance it says great a malicious entity logs in to chatgptbank as enters some text like sjudurbeggfhsshhdu hahdudn and jin instead of erroring it transfers your to their account unlikely scenario but the point is valid can anyone answer with some certainty how many permutations of valid inputs exist that chatgpt might act in a way that is not desirable goodluckonyourexams aw thanks appeal to ancienty how often had newton to deal with government making decisions for half a billion of people how do you make a deterministic system out of random decisions from the legislators or how do you deal with the small epsilon of human behavior because their history and the context justify their reasoning but without it it just does not make any sense to be fair i have two degrees in mathematics i know my fair share of abstractions i work in a company believing complexity does not exists and make billions out of it i can tell you if you want to include everyone it will be messy the flaw in your reasoning is that the world has a big non negligible share of non stationary behavior calminky as long as you have data and data quality for dl there is nothing against it but the truth is that a lot of companies do not have that or even the data maturity to build useful dl models unfortunately frantictoaster ah the post credits stinger of the existential horror film layoff icebergslimfast now if you will excuse me i am off to go do some human things lennarn the longer i live to see the inner workings of different parts of society the more i realize every part of our seemingly technologically advanced world is actually held together with scotch tape and string pastalake i agree languages will continue to get higher level and jobs in tech will continue to evolve in that sense but a genuine question here why do you think future ai advancements would not also be able to automate much of the logic and work for building distributed systems i feel like that is one area in particular where it could really shine as well viperior what i have been noticing is not a drop in salaries but an increase in access to better tech as these evolutions get easier i suspect it may be driving growth in data programs new and old eventually though i suppose things might get so easy they have the effect you describe but how long will that take midwestcsstudent ehhh no more like chinese if you want to make an analogy midwestcsstudent just like getting raped in an uber it is not ubers fault you did not run a background check on the driver before confirming the ride what the actual fuck did i just read albertcn that is why smart money is quoted as i am being sarcastic smart money are the whole lot of angel investors and serial entrepreneur that think they are smart xt ai to date has proven to be superhuman in any cognitive task given the right setup and data in the near future i speculate that well engineered cognitive systems will be approximately human level for most white collar tasks asked of it it then would have many of the benefits and limitations of an actual human in the work force from what i could comprehend many of the individual problems you brought up are solvable or have already been solved in similar domains the most relevant concern seems to be company data privacy and security parties are already allowed to deal with all of the most sensitive data and processing required by modern businesses look no further than aws i just want to advocate thinking from a fundamentals perspective on this topic renokarchnmy i learned today that if you shit in the desert after eating corn it will attract ravens if enough people shit in the desert like this and leave edible garbage it supports a larger raven population ravens eat baby desert tortoises which are severely endangered this is enough if a concern that ca state parks publishes signs to avoid feeding ravens with your garbage to help the tortoises do not shit in the desert alesbianalpaca oh are you going to go do the breathing as well i love to do the breathing alesbianalpaca at i have fully realised that there really are no adults i thought when i grew up i would be one as a kid there are loads of adults all these archetypes we are supposed to look up to truth telling journalists intelligent scientists protecting police our parents but it is a facade they were not in academia that is it is own nightmare of incompetence and broken incentives and teaching is frequently half assed and poor quality i never saw it working in retail all the managers were idiots making the same mistakes again and again i thought when i got a data science role i would find all the smart people who know what was going on but really they are all at about the same position as me just muddling by trying stuff out dealing with clients that do not know what they want most of what were soing is super basic data transformation or dashboarding never mind optimising anything most orgs just need to get their data out of massive excel spreadsheets the police are not adults they abuse their power the politicans are not adults they are corrupt and self interested the economists cannot predict shit the teachers are bad a teaching most of the parents screwed their kids up in some unique way scientific research has massive issues of its own bankers can crash economies the law is unjust the masses are easily lead the media is not honest those adults do not exist it is just lord of the flies here it is all held together with scotch tape a string put there by a bunch of monkeys trying desperate to fix all the gaps and leaks presenting themselves to the outside world as if they know what is going on while doing mostly the same as what everyone else is doing and hoping for the best missionstarhmm it is all speculative but much like you do not use java or python today for distributed systems the same logic would apply an ai generating code may create expensive operations that would not suit a high performance system but you could potentially leverage ai enabled algorithms in some sections to solve complex problems within this system so as an engineer you would have to be well versed in these new algorithms data structures i suppose only time will tell edit also to add to this i am thinking the intermediate future reasoning about the long term future never pays off so yes in the long term ai systems might very well be able to develop distributed systems as i have described we will have to course correct as we go i suppose missionstarhard to tell years maybe renokarchnmy hyperbole meant to highlight the efforts made by modern tech companies to offload their liability onto the user for the dangers and problems those companies create it was meant to be in the sarcastic voice of uber itself renokarchnmy given the right setup and data that is the problem there are zero people willing to accept the sheer level of sensor pervasiveness in their homes and offices required to given these systems any edge over simply getting a handful of people to talk to each other about something the other alternative is to completely reengineer the concept that is business to exclude humans from the process xt you would not need a ton of new sensors to get an ai to do office work at human level you would not need to train a different model for every company existing techniques with a good scalable cognitive architecture could work the agent would only need the same data that human beings have access to the kind that can easily be gotten by asking the right people and reading documentation renokarchnmy what i am saying is there are very few companies with good documentation and to produce it would require said systems to completely encode every fart and squabble everywhere around the people at the companies to gain sufficient context to understand when someone asks for a report of the dudical dab dollars it actually knows wtf that means since only one cringe boomer is using that phrase after he came up with it an hour prior to try to impress some younger colleagues it is literally not as simple as turning chatgpt loose on the company intranet and a shared drive of disorganized and unkempt pdfs that have vague and commonly outdated procedures and bylaws written out to get answers for subtle and competitive problems the thing with business is if your business is built around existing techniques with a good scalable cognitive architecture could work the agent would only need the same data that human beings have access to the kind that can easily be gotten by asking the right people and reading documentation then you will not have a competitive edge against all the millions of other businesses using that exact same crap that is fine with an accounting system it is not fine with sales product design marketing and creative strategy non core business investment strategy etc it does not work with networking and accessing capital from investors on the golf course it does not work for all the things that keep competitive businesses competitive",

  "uchimata what sort of developers would you be working with a dev is not normally going to translate your model into a different language to deploy it they will just take what you wrote and figure out how to make it run consistently given a stable input format you are going to need to provide a script that takes input and generates output in a stable reliable fashion so the engineer can configure scheduling they are unlikely to rewrite your code especially if it is in r since they almost certainly will not know that language here is a question that can help you determine level of maturity of the script are there embedded database credentials and do you have error handling throughout also docker is free for small applications and you should definitely learn to use docker basic use is pretty easy and it will make your life a lot simpler i am guessing you have never used an orchestration tool like airflow how is your shell scripting if i told you a cron job might allow you to handle all of this would you have any idea what i was talking about to answer your question off the top of my head without any refreshing googles a cron job is a scheduled linux script the script in question does not have any db calls as the model is trained off a set of freeze day enrollment files that have been slightly filtered edited and combined i wish we had a sql instance that i could store these in but afaik we do not and even if we did our it department would probably balk at implementing anything using them they have driven us to using custom msaccess dbs several times in the past and have not instilled much confidence i will take a look at docker and the free tier we are still using the free tier of shinyapps too so we may be able to get by uchimata so how are you doing data ingest into your models just reading a csv i mean you can do that in a production app but it is harder to do consistently and reliably the way this should really work in my mind is that you first find a way to replicate the production databases that hold the data then you write a sql script that pulls the data in the format you need then you write an r script that runs your model and produces output then you use an orchestration tool like airflow though you can bootstrap it with cron just have to check for data extraction failures to pull the data feed it to your model run your model take the output and put it back into a database for use with strong error handling and test coverage at every stage i do not think you even need shiny unless you really want to display the results graphically as opposed to making them available in excel which is what most end users want anyway right but does not that still rely on r for the running the model and getting the results i completely agree that most end users would prefer to just get a result set as an excel file and that is probably what we would be doing i got hung up on something i saw in my ms program we used some software from salford systems that had a translate feature so i thought that maybe this is a familiar thing in the real world and that is not the case uchimata yeah you run the r model just write to a file at the end running the r script is not the problem it is everything else around deployment",
  "dapper economy i talked to a recruiter about a salary range for a data scientist role i asked between but their range is she did say there was some flexibility in it and they could maybe do but she

explain the difference between a machine learning engineer and a mlop many thanks in advance livingteachingwhat clustering technique do you mostly use and why hi i received two project offers the one is about extracting information from reports summarizing it and then building a database organized by topics i was told that this would involve nlp web scraping and data analysis the other project is about developing automated data science method that prepares the benchmark dataset using various dimensionality reduction outlier detection clustering techniques which project would be a good learning opportunity for an aspiring data scientist redellamerda hello everyone i am in the final semester of my two years long data science msc i took an optional course in network science this professor is research is mainly focused on social media analysis such as identifying echochambers fake news and such and i truly loved it he asked me if i would like to be interested in pursuing a phd in network science as i would work with his team and i am honestly really intrigued as i love the topic thing is i do not wanna stay in academia my idea was to do the phd and then transition to industry but i am scared that with a phd in network science i would pigeonhole myself into very specific roles my fear is that if i am gonna be like yeah maybe i want to transition into more deep learning focused stuff it would be hard as network science is a bit disjointed from more traditional data science and machine learning topics what do you guys think mezmezmeeez uk data science and analytics msc or computing msc placement year im in a pickle assuming both of these masters are from the same russel university would it be better to get one in data science and analytics or go for computing with a placement year relevant courses for the ds a would be data visualisation applied machine learning computational data science foundations of operational research and analytics foundations of statistics and data science and dissertation which can be completed by doing a month placement some of the available electives that i am interested include distributed and cloud computing databases and modelling mathematical methods for data mining statistics and operational research in government human centric computing and supply chain modelling going through linkedin it seems like although it is a sort of new addition to the department of mathematics the alumni have done pretty okay after graduation as for the computing since it is a transitional degree my bachelors in architectural engineering the core modules are computational thinking fundamentals of programming algorithms data structures and programming topics research and skills in computing software engineering and a dissertation with electives in distributed and cloud computing human centric computing data visualisation databases and modelling and social computing there is a placement year afterwards which is not guaranteed and i would have to find the placement myself i was convinced the data science degree would do me better for a career path in data science and if i am unable to land a job in that sector to start out as a ux designer researcher considering my background in design and then move on to data roles however this sub seems to be against doing a degree in ds and recommends cs but since it is a computing degree ig this does not count also the fact that there is a possibility for a placement year with the computing degree is a bit tempting assuming i already know some programming mostly python which degree would you all recommend i would appreciate any advice can i start a data career without another degree i would like to start a data science degree but i already have a metric crap ton of student loans and cannot afford to pay graduate or even undergraduate tuition out of pocket i have found some classes on edx by harvard and an online tutorial website called data camp that will supposedly allow me to learn the needed skills are these viable ways to earn certification build a portfolio and start a career my background bs in biology with dual chemistry and physical science minors ma secondary teaching ms special education eds special education administration i have all told credit hours of statists and research methods my student loans are huge anyway the stats classes and the research are the ones i actually liked and i am not cut out for building or district administration looking for a change i have used small small tiny scale data in the course of my job as a teacher i like that part too anyone understand poisson distributions well i am learning more about them and trying to incorporate them into my modeling but i think i am using them wrong for example i project a player will have shots on goal in a game in backtesting players with an xsog of have or more shots of the time when i use poisson on the it gives a probability of it is like this through all of my backtest surely i must be using it wrong thank you therealspartucus i am a recent physics graduate looking to enter the field of data science if there is any other advice you have please let me know i have no internships or work experience i did some database modelling data processing machine learning as well as second year probability and statistics but i feel like i have forgotten a lot of it should i do a master is in data science or ai or something else start working immediately as an analyst do a month short course to revise something else im in australia where the government pays for most of our studies bijay_ what iswill be the job and career prospects in data science in coming days as many companies are conducting layoffs large number of people involved interested in data related fields immerge of different ai models etc additionalpyl hello all career prospects questions after several years of adding data science skills to other jobs within cs it think making dashboards normalizing data based on excel tables scraping data when necessary i have two competing offers for groups of people to work with is with team of data scientists i would have rotating duties that would vary over time but i would be working on purely data science projects with a high possibility of doing some ml at some point is with a team of data related people but i would be the only de facto wouldata scientist the work is intense and it looks like i would learn a lot especially regarding how to deal with really really big data problems as far as the ds specific work it looks open ended and like they have several problems ranging from visualization to engineering to prediction although i suspect that they are not sure what all they need and are probably looking for a jack of all trades quick learner and im ecstatic about both but i am leaning towards because i would have a network of mentors or at least peers to learn from and it would be nice to not be the only data scientist within a team is this a wise move from someone who has been doing real data science for some time miguel elote i need an online linear algebra course i have tried the laff linear algebra foundations to frontiers course as well as the khan academy course both times it went over my head and i stopped partway through i understood multivariable calculus and with that i did a lot of learning tasks with gradient descent so i feel like i am smart enough to grasp linear algebra i just have not found a course that clicks for me can you recommend one spidertonic hi all i am in the process of transitioning to data science from research i want my next roll to be data scientist my current roll is officially business analyst or it could be described as data analyst which one sounds better to get a data science job next year what upper level math classes are useful for data science not like linear algebra but classes like topology and abstract algebra and that sort i am considering transitioning into data science in particular i would like to be a data engineer within finance i am based in the us out of houston i have an accounting degree mba and cpa plus about years experience overall currently earning six figures do not have a formal background in data science what would be a practical learning path working full time a masters in data science solid bootcamp bootcamp only undergrad in cs what initial salary should i expect if i managed to land a data engineer role within finance in a corporate setting i am concerned about a drastic salary cut anything under for a prolonged period of time i would like to think my finance accounting experience would allow flexibility in someone is budget but not sure thank you in advance chickenparmo is a masters in quantitative

passion of sports specifically nba and love analyzing stats if there is a good idea that can stem from that ehknasayra i am pursuing a bachelor is degree in data science from a prestigious institution in my country i have come across a prevailing opinion as expressed on this subreddit that undergraduate degrees in the field may not hold significannot value in the job marketr r despite this i am determined to continue my academic journey as i have secured a scholarship for my bachelor is degree and plan to further enhance my knowledge by pursuing a master is degree in either the united states or the european unionr r given this background i am pondering whether it would be advisable for me to continue my master is in data science or to broaden my skill set by pursuing a master is degree in computer science or another related field in order to increase my employability and secure a fulfilling careerr r here is the syllabus of my degree chickenparmo is it possible to be uk based but get a job with a us based company and wfh east coast of the us would make more sense due to time zones but wondering if this is even a remote possibility pardon the pun aungthuhein i have been working a business intelligence job at an e commerce company and i am considering getting a ds masters degree at a university in the us the reasons being i would like to move away from data engineering jobs where i spend less than or even of the time actually analyzing the data and coming up with new ideas i would like to move out of my country and get a decent job in the us where there are hopefully a lot of smart people around and that by itself i would say is a huge achievement personally who you surround yourself with matters to say the least i would like to focus on ai and robotics and the mathematics of everything as a long term personal goal i would really appreciate any advice regarding my thought process and whether or not this degree is worth pursuing for all the financial costs that i will incur here is some reasons why i feel this degree might not be worth it there is a lot of free resources for learning data science although the same cannot be said about robotics afaik paid online courses and even degrees i could simply work my way through my current professional position which i am quite burnt out of tbh learn everything online free and paid and try to move to the us by trying to apply for a job there and then moving i have been pursuing this path for some time but i feel like it is not working out because i am losing my motivation to keep learning anything really in my current situation which feels terrible and depressing even i would really appreciate any advice thanks doing an economics and applied math double major as a sophomore in college what should i be doing to supplement my course work and prepare myself to go into data science in the future garpcui hello can you help me decide which online master is degree is the best choice i am a materials science graduate with a little bit of experience into coding from school i wanted to transition into data science since the pay is extremely good and there are more opportunities to emigrate to the us from mexico in that career rather than materials also i have always had this taste for statistics and data analysis although in a very rudimentary way done several blog publications about all kinds of statistics from several worldwide sources so it is not a subject that i find boring at all or out of place saying that last part so that the gatekeepers do not try to deter me from getting such degree i know for a fact that i need it since i am coming from outside the us my only limitation would be that my python and r skills are low since we only use them at college for two small polymers processing courses anyway the only options i can afford are only three the master of science degree in data science ms ds at the university of colorado boulder the master of science in data science online at the university of texas at austin the online master of science in analytics oms analytics at georgia tech are those good the curriculum seems all the same for me do not know exactly what to look for though so maybe you can help me with the industry insight that you have from the people that you have come across from those degrees finally are admissions difficult i worry a bit since my degree comes from outside the us even though my program is abet accredited would that last detail help me through the application process or is not worth of mention to the school recruiter your help is much appreciated nightcandles is working in marketing analytics a good way to break into data science hairyberry_ question about career prospects i have been working as an entry level ds for half a year now in canada and i am curious what is considered an upper tier salary for remote canadian jobs if anyone happens to work remotely here i make in the range which i feel is relatively good but i read a lot of us salaries which make mine feel quite low livingteachingany good videos courses on clustering hdbscan vs k means feature selection thanks spidertonic you are not shouting yourself in the foot that roll was not in your target salary range wouldatastoryteller how much do you want need this job would you accept if it was offered if they find another candidate who can do the job well and is willing to take then that lowers your odds if they cannot then who knows if they will downlevel change the role or increase the salary range also what country are you in for a lead data scientist sounds extremely low in the us heck seems low but i guess that depends on the actual responsibilities and the industry and location what is the title for the other job ominousanenome in your most recent experience as an intern the descriptions are not very useful conducted research is very vague what did this entail what ds de work was actually done here i would get rid of the second bullet and replace it with something else either about the technical side of what you did or the impact it had presenting is part of every job the ones in the second description give more information to the reader as what you actually did in the third bullet i would add more info on the technologies you used wouldatastoryteller this is a pretty nuanced guide switchorganic read pep and get a linter like pylint or black switchorganic mlops is like the intersection between devops and ml systems ml engineering is generally the ml software development process leading up to the deployment where it gets handed to mlops some companies mix the role responsibilities or have them all under one title sort of like how it is not exactly uncommon to have swes doing some devops stuff almeldin i would choose anything related to nlp it is booming now thanks to chatgpt cocodirichlet i do not think you would be pigeonholed many social media and some e commerce companies hire people who focus on fraud trolls trust and safety etc some even hire people whose expertise is in networks i know a few people who are research scientists at meta who do that if you look up jobs at tik tok they ask for these type of skills for some of their jobs i am giving tik tok as an example because they are hiring but the companies on hiring freeze also typically need people who focus on this area and my fear is that if i am gonna be like yeah maybe i want to transition into more deep learning focused stuff it would be hard as network science is a bit disjointed from more traditional data science and machine learning topics i do not think network science is necessarily disjointed first you can keep taking courses and learn on your own and there are a lot methods you can use to study the topic this professor studies from experiments to neural networks to clustering or regression in your own dissertation you can do whatever you want too and that would be the project you use to get a job second most ds are not doing deep learning most ds are not even doing anything fancy and why could not you learn or find an application during your phd what you really have to think is whether you want to spend years in this phd cocodirichlet this sub mostly does not like ds programs that are cash cows for us university however i do not think this works the same in uk universities because nobody is paying to for a grad degree there i think the ds masters sounds good and you said the alumni were doing well after graduation i do not see a major difference between both in terms of the courses they sound to be very similar fyi i do not understand what the placement thing is ominousanenome yes but it could be difficult not that this should deter you it also really depends on what you mean by data career as this can mean a lot of things if you are looking for an analytics or analyst role it is definitely possible without an extra degree the market is heavily saturated so it can be hard to stick out in resume screens but generally for these roles as long as you can demonstrate proficiency with working with data i think you would have a decent chance there might be some roles where another degree is required like where i work of the data scientists have phds mostly in statistics math cs etc and the rest have masters degrees but other places i have applied worked at are not like this at all for instance where the job is more similar to a product business analyst even if the title is data scientist looking at job postings for minimum requirements might give you a better sense ominousanenome more information is needed here on the dataset you are working with and the model you are using is this a basic poisson regression are you using a zero inflated model do you have a job offer for already if so that is the no brainer choice otherwise you need to do option get a job using a computer and start doing data tasks in that job wouldatastoryteller what iswill be the job and career prospects in data science in coming days as many companies are conducting layoffs thousands of companies did not do layoffs many are still hiring salaries for new hires seem to have come down a little bit since a year ago though large number of people involved interested in data related fields entry level roles are scarce and hard to land because there is so much competition getting experience elsewhere and pivoting will probably continue to be a solid path into this field immerge of different ai models etc not sure exactly what you mean but ai is a tool and not a replacement for us so learn how to use it to your advantage maxtothej early in career mentors are so valuable in instilling good habits book is super easy to follow eldubyaen hi there while you may need to find out more about specific problem sets and course plans as a whole the below website significannotly helped me through college and this guy makes everything seem so simple i am a mechanical engineer and have mathematics experience all the way up to differential calculus and it is amazing how well he presents things cheers ominousanenome i do not think it matters too much the descriptions of what you did will though monkeyunited mathematical statistics personally i do not find the more pure math side of things to be relevant although certain topics can be dl ml ds aspirant if you want to be a de why not start with business intelligence ominousanenome it seems like you are looking for a data engineer not data science role in my experience these are two fairly distinct things there can be overlap but the focus is much different for data engineers etl vs data science modeling stats if you are looking for a data engineer role i would recommend a more traditional cs degree not a data science one psychological suit i got a data science internship after a similar program also taught in r then landed a junior ds role a year later so it is definitely possible i still find there is a prejudice against non stem subjects in a lot of job postings i see but my experience shows it is still doable i am based in the uk though might be different elsewhere googlejinx find a large data set i do not know where you are but the us census bureau publishes some interesting stuff that is both free and public take the time to import the data build relevant tables clean the data maybe perform some cursory analysis you are looking for a question worth answering export the information that you feel is most relevant to that question to python perform a deeper exploratory analysis in python explaining both your process and your findings as you go bonus points for predictive analytics write a summary that gives an answer to your question and why you think your answer is correct monkeyunited do i just list the software and wait for them to ask about it and then i provide examples of what i have done yes this applies to statistical methods as well typically there is a technical portion that tests your coding skills chickenparmo kaggle has lots of sports datasets cocodirichlet much of that advice against many ds program is based on many us programs universities in other countries work a lot different and they have mostly mandatory courses curriculums you have not finished your degree yet i think you need to finish your degree get a job save some money and look for scholarship opportunities studying abroad is expensive so i would look into scholarships everywhere if you get a scholarship for cs then do cs and if you get a scholarship for ds do ds there is also a lot of variation across countries in terms of cost curriculum etc wouldatastoryteller if the us based company has an office in your country then yes if they do not then probably not likely also just an fyi us based companies pay local rates for employees who are based in other countries cocodirichlet can you do a thesis or is there a course in which you work on your own guided capstone project be an ra for a professor on an empirical project data cleaning data scraping etc apply for internships wouldatastoryteller internships research with profs your own capstone project network with alumni attend local industry meetup groups get a leadership position on a student org ominousanenome depends on what type of data science you are interested in but i do not think you can go wrong studying more statistics ominousanenome depends what the job will entail and what area of data science you are looking to break into for example if the job is mostly analytics based then it is perhaps less relevant to a ds job that involves a lot of modeling and statistics if you are looking for a ds job similar to product analyst then it is more relevant regardless though if you are coming from a less data oriented job then seems like a step in the right direction dapper economy i am in the us near the dmv area and i work in academics so my pay is very low but the title for this job is just ds and i would be reporting to a manger and mentoring a team of junior ds senior analyst and data engineering if was offered after trying to push for i would accept it it is still much higher than what i am making now so honestly scared to ask for anymore that my experience fits the jd perfectly and then some but i do agree with you i have a feeling someone else will come and accept the position their range was actually really appreciate you taking the time to look my resume over and give feedback thank you throwawayghostthank you so much this is helpful of course as we all know all of the related positions are not very well defined but i am seeing a lot of data analyst jobs that pay an hour or that seems low to me from this report it seems like the lowest entry level jobs pay which is more in line with what i was hoping for the only responses i have been getting from job applications have been sketchy of course there have been the standard scammy sounding jobs in general but specific to data jobs last week eod friday i got one email saying please let us know if you are interested in proceeding to the next stage of the selection process the interview will be conducted electronically the interview will be on monday by am est so we recommend that you schedule as soon as possible to receive your preferred time this sounds very weird to me they followed up this morning and i asked for a salary range which they gave as another company sent me an email late on friday night asking me to take a test by monday at they sent another email saying just a quick note to say thanks for expressing your interest in the junior data analyst position i replied but they never responded it seems that they expected me to spend my weekend suddenly doing an unplanned coding test out of nowhere and were quite unsatisfied when i did not i find this all very odd and hope it is not normal in this field i would expect to be given a little more notice about these coding tests and not have to commit to a monday morning interview on a friday afternoon xlonestar thanks actually i also was thinking the same thing installed pylint on vs code and also watched some videos on it sounds like the perfect way to learn as you go redellamerda thank you you could probably see from my original comment how i have little experience in what a ds does on the job since i have ever only been in uni so that is some useful insights and what you really have to think is whether you want to spend years in this phd honestly i am becoming more convinced of it as time goes as i realized that i really enjoy doing research and the professor in question is quite eminent in his field from what i know the only downside is of course the pay as i am based in europe and phd salaries are really on the low end of what is possible to live with haha mezmezmeeez so a placement year is basically a year of working additional to the one year a masters program usually is think of it similar to compulsory internship modules in some programs i will be able to work on a student visa considering this placement will be graded and be a part of my studies as far as i am aware they do not have to be paid but most companies do pay students for the year around and while the university will help you in finding a placement they are not guaranteed and i will have to secure it myself and if i do not i will just have to complete the dissertation and graduate in one year module wise i am mostly leaning towards the ds program for the machine learning modules and the few statistics ones also i do not think i will ever get into swe so the related modules in the computing masters seems a bit useless to me however as mentioned previously the chance for a placement is pretty tempting thank you for taking the time to respond thanks so i am running a linear regression model to come up with the expected shots of that i plug into the poissondist function in excel not sure if i am even using it correctly therealspartucus you are right i should not really have included as an option thank you for the reply spidertonic thank you for responding chickenparmo i am also uk based sorcerer thanks posting it on github and then using the link on my resume is a good idea i live in europe but i guess i can get that data vitaminwheat would you recommend using libraries like scikit learn or writing the code for the ml algorithms chickenparmo most of these datasets in the uk at least would be in csv format already which seems less useful from an sql perspective could do some snazzy visualisations i guess in matplotlib powerbi switchorganic a lot of pro sports leagues also have official apis you can query mizmato at first i was going to say that seems really low for the dmv but academics makes sense given that it is academics do they provide good benefits those should also be taken into consideration when determining your total comp ominousanenome good luck maxtothej i think the issue is that you are looking for fully remote that is going to be way tougher for something that is coming into the field as a junior employee cocodirichlet you can apply for internships while on the phd for the summer and they would pay you better so you can have some savings yes it pays low but a phd in the uk is shorter that in other countries b many places have hiring freezes right now c with a phd and networking and a good dissertation project you can apply for a position to meta in london as ds or research scientist or other places to work in similar topics as this professor do some math in terms of budget for living cocodirichlet okay so the only advantage of the placement is that you can work year on a student visa for low wage while without the placement you have to get a job that gives you a work permit ominousanenome not sure i understand so are you running a linear regression model on count data but are expecting it to have a relationship with the poisson distribution given that your response variable shots on goal is discrete counts data i think a poisson regression is perhaps more suitable googlejinx if you are newer scikit learn is fine however if you are using this as a project on a resume and want to show off the depth of your knowledge writing the code can beneficial it is more important that whichever route you choose you can execute well and explain thoroughly dapper economy my current job does provide really good benefits with yearly colas merits between but have no bonuses but for this job i applied for it also has good benefits with a bonus and unlimited pto and also forgot to mention that this one is in pharmaceutical healthcare throwawayghostthat is unfortunate because i have been fully remote since and have no plan to change that lol i also do not have thousands and thousands of extra dollars to relocate for some company just because they believe in rto or something it would have to be a really nice offer for me to completely change both my lifestyle and location i also do not really understand it because i myself have trained several junior employees on my team remotely and they are all doing great or were before they left not even sure how i would find housing with the current housing crisis mezmezmeeez that is kind of the gist of it i will be able to get a two year graduate visa after graduation which lets me work in the uk for those two years and after that i will have to find a job that will sponsor the visa for me i will still be a student during the placement year so i can still live in student accommodation low wages but at least there will be some money coming in and since the wages are low and all there is a higher chance to be able to land a placement compared to a regular job especially as an international i will end up with a year of work experience which is the biggest benefit since apparently having none is a bit of a barrier when finding an actual job though when you word it the way you did it does seem like less of an opportunity than i was thinking it was lol vitaminwheat thanks mizmato imo it seems like a low pay range for that particular field but i cannot say for sure without knowing the exact details switchorganic in my experience the company often covers relocation what kind of range are you looking for and what is the highest offer you have gotten so far cocodirichlet i think it can be an opportunity if it is easier to get a job using this visa like an internship that is longer for instance or would you be able to get an internship with the student visa in the ds one than it would be to get a work permit i would contact international students on student visas in the uk i do not know enough about the uk visa situation i know more about the us visa situation they would know more about the trade offs and they would have a better assessment of how difficult getting a work permit is dapper economy yea yall are right i guess i dodged a bullet i do not even know what career progress would look like there throwawayghostthe purpose of the comment was to ask about salary expectations i have not gotten any offers yet switchorganic got it that range you gave seems about right for the midwest entry level analysts generally do not make much and i have not seen many high paying remote only roles i think you would have more success if you are willing to move there are higher paying companies but they tend to be hybrid my company pays entry level analysts year for lcol areas and you can go remote after the first year as i mentioned above relocation is taken care of by the company including taxes on the bonus fwiw i was offered hr as an intern and hr for a full time analyst role at a in vhcol so it is not just a midwest thing analysts are under paid in general higher

because you know enough to be dangerous and self sufficient yet know exactly when to ask for an expert for help i do this in my consultancy biz because i am more less expert in my domain healthcare strong ds skills but also know enough swe to deliver a containerized reproducible data pipeline dashboard ml solution brandco i have head the term full stack data scientist used to mean a data scientist who is a generalist experienced with all the functions that data scientist usually do so a full stack data scientist can do data engineering analytics insights data visualization and machine learning projects all from project ideation to production and delivery specialization in the data science profession has been common for years now seeing the title on a job description or resume tells you very little about what kind of work will be done i have seen data scientists who just do ml in python and cannot write a sql query or create a decent looking chart in any tool and i have seen the data scientist who only writes sql and makes dashboards this is totally fine with me btw i am also fine with the specialized titles like analytics engineering data engineer are ml engineer it is all made up anyway i understand full stack data scientist as the generalist data scientist because a full stack developer plus a data scientist is a very unusual and not much demanded role it is just too much to have mastered and as a manager it is too much work to assign to one person asleep dress i cannot see why you would be a full stack data scientist when you are apparently not full stack a full stack would be a devops engineer combined with a machine learning engineer a data scientist and a front end developer so you should be experienced in using and configuring cloud services databases docker kubernetes airflow mlflow up to python web frameworks fastapi django flask etc frontend frameworks such as react and of course ml and dl libraries which i assume you are proficient in i am pretty sure that such superhumans exist but it must be a very rare species this is why literally nobody calls him or herself a full stack data scientist and i presume you also do not want to do that i am a full stack rtard thewallie knowing some html is not something i would lean into if it was knowing some react that might be a different story depending on the company size having a more narrow focused resume might be an advantage for enterprise or a disadvantage startup adjust accordingly chadly having stack development experience puts you closer to a machine learning engineer in my opinion if that is the kind of work you want to do i would not use this custom term when there are plenty of highly specific terms for the roughly different kinds of data science work already but you do you people brand themselves uniquely all the time and it can work in your favor if you do it right nerdyjorj i used to use that a few years back worked with enough scale ups that at the time it seemed appropriate but i do not think it ever took off as a title it depends i have never worked anywhere that full stack would have helped one get a job no one would have been interested in html skills for instance to some full stack means jack of all trades colibriweiss i think it depends a lot on how you use it and what is the purpose of having it i can see it as a hook to discuss the tech you have worked with so as long as it can be explained with experience in both backend and frontend tech for data science it can be a good thing besides some swe are not big fans of these terms and it is imo more important to pjrase in a way that you like to work with these things than that you are fully capable of working with these things i do not expect it to be very useful with most managers and hr but who knows sometimes people are impressed by these terms your chance of getting hired will increase exponentially if you say you only need person is salary to do or even jobs but so will your chance of getting burnout clicketrie i think the definition of full stack data scientist has changed over the years years ago if you had a masters in cs or stats but a great command in cs analytics and stats and had fantastic interpersonal skills and working cross functionally in an org you were considered a full stack data scientist now you would be expected to have a lot of bi de mlops as well as the tools we use in our role has grown what is required to be full stack has grown also this also makes the term crazy vague they do not fully understand what skills you are claiming to have anymore by that term alone you would be much better off coming up with a quick one liner about the skills that you have that the company is really interested in and go more specific with your personal branding delicious view for the sake of argument what should such rare species do let is say project experience using tools including but not limited to the following python r java c julia sql

devs than doing that stuff myself sure i am conversational about enough of the list but the amount of time it would take to be good at every one of those in a production setting is unrealistic also if i am focusing on that i am spending less time on other ds research delicious view agree given the choice i would rather focus on one aspect nlp or mlops my point was that even if you were some mythical creature who can do it all you would tailor your resume to the role you are applying to mostly because nobody would believe you otherwise supplychainphd which is a great point if you are that mythical creature why not find a role or make one up where you are leading teams that use various combos of your magical skillset none deleted delicious view i like that data science solutions architect machine learning devops tech lead data science specialist consultant delicious view some jobs do ask for such yes and some jobs do require postgrad level statistical analysis and at the same job need to optimise the latency of a model deployed in a serverless architecture and in the same job you could be asked to help upgrade a software version which might require some data migration and some powershell voodoo etc then develop a custom algorithm to efficiently calculate distances in a network and cluster some millions of short texts dabble in a bit of econometric analysis using a stock market panel data a bit of bayesian survival analysis for a small dataset another month you are asked to build an image searching tool using some of them deep learning stuff by the way you are doing this with unittests mock tests scalable architecture writing docs backend api and a very basic frontend spa as a part of handing over a poc sometimes you are working with a game dev and need to at least touch some c used with the unity game engine stuff not saying one would be an expert in all the things ml de swe and cloud but i do not know how else to list the required skills for such a job jack of all trades as they say supplychainphd make it simple decision scientist supplychainphd fwiw i code switch between data scientist and engineering all the time but when i am speaking with

okay had you failed and it was more of a thought exercise to see how you went about things one where there is little downside but only upside to your candidacy otherwiseratiohahaha what and no i have not done this before i saw an example of it being doneplayed with the code for a but and thats it i think i would literally ask if they were serious nthcitizen think i would be tempted to respond if you prefer i could start at doping the silicon junction or shall i abstract to the gate level senior ds with yoe and a masters in cs with ml spec took a class and a few moocs that required building a nn from scratch i do not think i could do it live in an interview that is just not how my brain works at the same time i would never ask a candidate to do that there are so many more important things that i would rather test a candidate on than their ability to code an algorithm from scratch when that skill is just not applicable in a normal working environment i would much rather ask them about their experience working with that algorithm questions about key concepts roadblocks and limitations these are the actual things you will run into at work not whether you can code an unoptimized version of the algorithm from scratch blinkybillster no damn kudos you got it i would have failed on spot i can draw a schematic of how a neural network is supposed to lool like maybe skeleton code of the layers and backprop logicbut that is abkut it i honestly cannot believe this is a question i have been implementing nns in like lines via tensofrflow for months now xd what is the point if these efficient packages if i have to code the damn thing from scratch not unless the job is cutting edge ai research i cannot imagine a situation in a work environment where you would need to code a neural network from scratch or anything similar i do not think it is reasonable because i do not think it is discerning those with the skills to excel in the job from those without them i did this in matlab during a grad course i am now two years into my career and a much better data scientist and i work with neural networks and their implementations practically every day but i am not sure how well i would do these days if asked to do this in an interview which imo means it is a pretty poor test of ability to do the work entropyvsenergy i have had to do this for an ml research scientist position but i was allowed to use pytorch i did not have to code back prop from scratch just implement the nnmodule subclass and the training loop now that i am partially in charge of doing interviews we have switched to find the bug challenges instead it is more important to see how someone analyzes a program then it is to have them regurgitate something that they could just google this sounds like a scenario where they already promised the job to someone is friend mbel_ no it makes no sense it is possible he she did not have time to prepare the interview or do not have experience doing it helpfulbuilder haha lol absolutely not not even close to being apropos lbcflapjack the data science role is incredibly vague at this point and we in the candidate pool have no way of knowing what companies consider data science anymore luigi no traditionalpearunless the role is specifically oriented towards deep learning and the job req specifically cites that the candidate should have expertise in that area i would say no most ds roles that are generalist oriented or working within business or social sciences finance economics marketing etc will rarely be building nns as they generally provide little to no lift with added complexity and decreased interpretability venustrapsflies i kinda feel like everyone should be able to sketch out a basic feedforward nn in pseudo code dotting all the is and crossing all the ts does not seem like the best use of interview time though kittiesareloveyay it is a decent question to figure out if the candidate can call people higher up the line out for their bs requests which i think is not all that common in the us preferably they would tell me why it is a moronic question but then still show me how to do it with some pseudo code planning to unironically ask this seems like asking for the wrong things no unless the posting specifically asked for these kinda prior experience if not i would take that as a red flag of the company ktpr they probably want to see and evaluate how you degrade gracefully but this is very unscientific because it does not replicate any kind of work condition in actual practice you dodged the bullet here do not think less of yourself in anyway milkteaoppa no but i had a colleague who asked that question as well as working backprop during interviews i was asked to code sgd from scratch for that company some interviewers like to challenge their interviewees and i believe it is an ego thing as well turingincarnate that seems pretty wild almostfreitag no experienced ds do not spend time doing those basic things from scratch i cannot barely remember the last time i did this probably i still was programming in java even for a perfect candidate this can take a while and it seems such a waste of precious interview time where a lot of different techniques could be checked instead of coding something like that from scratch to give the interviewer the benefit of the doubt maybe they are looking for a specific candidate to perform a lot of development from scratch for their role for whatever reason such as algorithm development at the fundamental level cesium sandwich that seems rough it also sounds like a question a programmer who had written one before would come up with which is kinda unfair but there are situations where it is not so much the interview question itself but more how you approach dealing with it that can reveal how you respond to stress and problem solving under pressure and it sounds like you did well i would just tell them no i would not stand a chance and it is a terrible measure for how my performance would be beepboopdata man that is a terrible interview question i feel like it does nothing to gauge a candidate is actual experience and mostly just tests if they have done something similar in the past usually anyone with a rigorous research background or ml specific study would be able to do this but it does not really have anything to do with work experience probably an okayish interview question for a research position but at that point i would be asking more about your project work and research rather than trivial model coding exercises tangentc no that is a fairly insane interview question whitekreuz depends on the job honestly if it is a senior ml research role then knowing basic neural network mechanics is expected it is what you learn in a rudimentary ml course at level bobdope no sounds stupid entropyrx yoe do not correlate with coding neural networks from scratch lol your interviewer was probably someone full of themselves who wanted to feel cool just because the day before they reviewed how to code a nn from scratch and had it fresh in their mind but there are much more effective ways to understand whether a candidate has the right understanding and intuition behind deep learning that do not require some petty questions hellycopterinjuneer not even remotely appropriate i would have considered any such potential employer to have self deselected themselves from contention and yes i have coded a nn from scratch as a learning exercise but it is not something that i am going to store in my limited synapses just for job interview purposes antalagor i think it is legit depends on how the interviewers use the task as interviewer i like it as a challenge to learn about coding skills and basic understanding of nn but i would not expect that the task will be completed tarehman unless you are going for a machine learning engineer job with a focus on neural nets it feels overkill even if you were going for that role it is of dubious utility unless they give step by step guidance at which point it is more of a coding exercise which can have merit i coded up a simple k means implementation in an ml engineer interview once but we did it collaboratively the focus was on implementation so there was no issue with refreshing myself on the algo k means is super simple and i have yoe tbschemer this is just a test of how recently you took your deep learning class it is been years since i last did this and i am really not sure how well i would do repeating it on the spot lead ds here with years of experience i hate live coding challenges because that is not how you work daily i use the give a tricky task with ugly data and many possible solutions also i use to give one week even if they do not know how to solve it they show that they are able to look for options at the following interview i ask them how they solved that problem and why they choose that to go with that solution and not another terektus stories like this make me prepare weeks for interviews just to repeat all the basics because apparently asking irrelevant stuff you did in your first year is very important and shows a lot about your skills werthobakew do not forget that you are also interviewing the company team and coworkers i was asked by facebook to code a random number generator from scratch absolutely bullshit question it was not even the main point of the coding assignment it is just that at some point i needed to generate a random number and they said i had to do it from scratch dubgrips i know people that can do this but cannot explain why many nn still do not perform as well on tabular data as ensemble models or in some cases even simple penalized regression frequentiststats i am sorry wtf wouldatastoryteller yikes while i did this in grad school that was over a year ago and have not done anything like that on the job since so i would definitely need to consult my notes if not my own actual code what kind of role was this for uchimata i have not built one from scratch in ten years and i do not think it is a fair question that is the sort of thing a candidate fresh out of school would be better able to do than someone who has worked in tensorflow and scikit for most of their career this smells like an interviewer who does not actually know how to ask questions that reveal ability to add value so they default to quizzing you on technicalities that everyone abstracts away in real life sozinsky i think that is bonkers sounds like the interviewer just finished their deep learningai coursework and were eager to show of their recently acquired knowledge delicious view it sounds like a stupid way to determine if the candidate will be good at the job but is it better than leetcode type interview questions hmm sherlockholmeslol no nativedutch chstgpt gjves you one in seconds flat foxbatcs maybe consider presenting the code without comments and see if they can interpret what it does or maybe offer code with a simple mistake in it to see if they can identify here it is that is the most i have ever seen in a technical interview for ds and it seems pretty effective for weeding out people without the necessary technical knowledge while also being brief and practical as long as your candidate can actually read code you can trust they can also read documentation and troubleshoot and that is gonna solve of their problems right there oneofchaos maybe a perceptron but i would hand them skeleton nn code and they should have some idea on what is necessary on the other hand if you are using some well known industry standard library it might make more sense to give them a dataset and a sample day in the life of the role kind of task competitive you have gotten a bunch of responses that cover my view very well but just for the sake of ensuring that the stats on this post are as clear as possible i want to agree that this is absurd and i would publicly chastise a coworker who pulled this nonsense interviews are stressful enough as it is there is no need for this kind of pointless crap savemybags i would ask if i could use wolfram alpha because i just cannot remember the derivative of the logistic function nonprophetapostle entirely unreasonable i will never understand where this prove your worth in front of my eyes attitude comes from also does the interviewer even have the skillset to verify your work hairyberry_ maybe if you are provided with the backprop formulas i think the most unreasonable part would just be expecting you to memorize it or derive it on the spot was the job specifically asking for a nn expert if so the maybe if not that is pretty crazy qkumbazoo it was one of the assignments back in school but not everyone necessarily learnt it that way yeah if they are going to pay like final it a stupid question back propagation and gradients are auto handled by libraries now bothwaysitgoes yes if it is a research position weonlycryalone i have more than years experience in analytics and would not think this a reasonable question except for a research position you can find such code in sebastian raschka is book on machine learning with python but i would not think most of us have done this i had previously asked candidates for the matrix notation to describe the beta coefficient of a linear regression but was told this is unreasonable because we would not use matrix algebra to solve this problem and that is honest it is a relic from days of using sas stat skeerp with torch tf or numpy if the former then sure else nah depends on the expectation and the demeanor assistance of the interviewer could have been a question just to explore your knowledge of the topic and how you roll with the punches if it was a weird gatekeeper question then no in contrast to another interview post would you rather field too hard a question graded on a curve or do a day take home with manual labeling that interviewer sounds like a crappy person overall i am sorry this question spoiled your interview pipeline but i would be grateful to not been a part of a team that condones promotes such expectations jollygreenfrog that is nuts i would have just gotten up and left if that is what they do at the interview stage they are going to have unrealistic expectations tomomcat it is not a useful test of technical skills but if they want to do it as a collaborative exercise it could be a good way of seeing how you work with other people they took deep learning literally and wanted to check how deep ur learning was at any point if i am asked to code during an interview i ask them why especially if i have provided tangible examples of projects i have done one guy was asking me to spell out code over the phone i asked him if he was serious he said yes and i replied thanks but i am not interested and hung up the hr called me the next day saying they thought i was too arrogant to which i reminded the hr that the job was open for over a year clearly convoluted i think they should have given you some details can you code a simple neural network from scratch it does not have to be functional you do not have to run it in any sense and you do not have to debug it just a rough draft it seems extreme but if it is for a deep learning engineer i think it is within reach really all this is used for is to weed out the people that are full of shit and padded their resume those people would not even know where to start edit this is also used to kinda see how you think your level of knowledge and how you problem solve imagine you interview someone and they crank out a flawless nn in half the time everyone else you interview does that is an easy hire and maybe even should interview up tarneks do you code neural networks from scratch on the day to day job you can answer this question yourself jobeta i do not think it is absolutely crazy in every circumstances but it definitely tells you something about the company is culture if the role requires you to build custom nns it can be important to find candidates with in depth knowledge of how they work if it is not the case sometimes companies use these kind of interviews as a way to ensure the candidate has that tendency to seek and retain this kind of deeper knowledge i do not think i could do it very quickly without preparing for it but i have been asked to code a k nn classifier before arguably a lot easier but similar in spirit lolitsalberto this job better be paying tc not even faang or top tech interviews ask anything like this drxaos i think it is reasonable you can do it with freshman calculus and programming the idea is to see if you understand the basics of what is happening underneath it is a test to distinguish people who run packages vs those who have more ability to think underneath and understand the mathematics and applied programming to implement a mathematical idea programming an autograd system is way harder edit remember that the purpose of some questions js to distinguish a top candidate from an average one like oral exams in graduate school which often end with seeming failure from the student is point of view also the behavior and attitude shown can help a junior employee who is willing to try and dig into problems and ask a senior for help with informed questions at the core instead of giving up right away is preferred in this sort of interview question superior candidates would ask questions to scope out the bounds and requirements of the problem first and then organize the solution conceptually and break down the parts needed for the pieces even if implementing might need some hints from a senior interviewer in this particular example there are three main phases forward scoring backwards computation of gradients and application of a parameter update rule setting up software with the right data needed at each phase clearly shows capability and deeper thinking as well as organization of the data structures needed to implement each phase nordlundze i mean i am not even a data scientist and we learned how to do that during our college course on data mining datasciencepro entirely reasonable of course you are not going to be doing it day to day but if a company is throwing figures for a hire and it is a competitive employers market then they want to make sure the guy they are hiring knows the fundamentals and is comfortable expressing that theory in terms of code snowbirdnerd no not at all back propagation is difficult mathematics and coding neural networks from scratch is not what you will be doing in your day to day job coding no but white boarding the back prop algorithm in terms of partial derivatives would be fair edit downvoted by the data scientists who do not know enough calculus to explain the back prop algo depends how much time they give but why would you need to use backprop on a perceptron do you mean a multi layer perceptron lifesthateasy no legitimatesortgood lord if this is what is going on out there in interviews i am never finding a job proficientswe these hiring managers are getting more ridiculous every day do not even entertain imbeciles like this imo i cannot imagine the nightmare it would be to work for with them atavisticapple a single perceptron seems reasonable to be frank wouldogsdogsdogsdogswooo no tigerkingsam good fuckin luck kevindotjohnson this gotta be a parody skiptomylouiee no just no isitfun warren mccullough and walter pitts probably could not do it during an interview name and shame the interviewers please mwkr no it is idiotic trucomallica lol what the hell is wrong with you michaelfowlie no not at all morebikesthanbrains what do you expect to learn about someone by making them do this kyledrogo not at all westernmomentabsolutely not none i love a good shitpost tapchap yup faced the same sensitive many i am an asian from my past experiences only asians like to such questions bravaddude code the neural network from scratch using scratch anoninterviewing is a game of conforming to the interviewer is biases imagine asking the builder to build your house prior to hiring him you know just to check if he is capable of thanks azdatasci i agree not productive thought exercises are great though makes you see a person is problem solving skills maybe give them a simple nn and ask them to explain it acrobatic i have almost year working with data mostly tabular databases and have never use a neural network schrootfarmss personally seems like a red flag slippery fische this is a pretty common ml related question the first time it happened to me i was caught off guard none deleted ive done it in school ive never come across a reason to do it myself grandzooby if you prefer i could start at doping the silicon junction actually here is some sand the fab is next door hahahahaha i have bachelors in electronic engineering so i can appreciate your humour d florinandrei schrodinger is equation all the way down thanks i was feeling stupid that interviewer had to give me hints for such a basic thing now after reading your comment i feel relaxed i believe that this question might be better suited for someone straight out of college who remembers the knitty gritty maths midnitte that is just not how my brain works at the same time i would never ask a candidate to do that there are so many more important things that i would rather test a candidate on than their ability to code an algorithm from scratch when that skill is just not applicable in a normal working environment not only that but would you truly expect an employee to spend time implementing a nn from scratch no you would expect them to know how to use tensorflow pytorch spasik_ i ca not this this comment enough it took a while and a few years of ds experience for me to detach my feelings of self worth from not being able to handle these kinds of interview questions yuppp thanks man bestucanisgoodenough you would not do it in pure python would you need to know how every single step in a neural network operates down to every last detail it has been necessary for me there are times you cannot just copy stuff from github weonlycryalone agreed a researcher should be able to walk through this algorithm forwards and backwards none deleted weonlycryalone oh i like this approach of using find the bug do you show the error or just the code spiritualquestions oof solving tensor flow or deep learning bugs can be rough i mean if it means actually getting into the guts of the packages there can be some really tricky bugs i hope the questions you are asking are more bugs with arrays using correct datasets oop issues tracking a changing varible correct input data shape and so on with that being said i think finding the bug style of questions are way better than code x algorithm from scratch would you refer me for a summer intern role for anything related to ml i am a grad student in one of the top unis especially in nlp research fuehnix yo holy shit this guy is actually solving it weonlycryalone yep i had a similar experience with another tough question hahaha learned a new word apropos therealtiddlydump it is one thing to map out the logic which i think could be a decent exercise it is another to write code like that why unless you are putting yourself forward specifically as a nn expert which is not all data scientists i do not think whether or not a candidate can do that can do that in a job interview is necessarily a great test of whether they can do that in the workplace interesting perspective weonlycryalone if i were in a room and tried to answer and was told you were supposed to call me out i would have ended the interview like gary oldman in the professional with a i do not have time for this mickey mouse bullshit do not waste my motherfucking time and then you mean like that or a little less call out y why ego think yayyyy happy bestucanisgoodenough lol define scratch modpi rightleftpi timestampleftpitimestamp is what i would hail mary that one with no idea if that is remotely random though fuehnix import javautil int goodenough mathrandom systemoutprintlngoodenough so let us talk starting bonuses yes i was hoping the interviewer will ask such intuitions that what works and why which can only be learned under good mentorship and after some years of experience leomatey why is it because nns need lots of data to actually work i really hope they throw a figure salary after this interview ghostofkilgore that would also be insane tarehman downvoted by data scientists who know that this is not relevant to a lot of data science jobs goodluck mate you got it haikusbot what do you expect to learn about someone by making them do this morebikesthanbrains i detect haikus and sometimes successfully learn and more and about and me out of replies haikusbot opt out delete my comment haikusbot delete how did it go bestucanisgoodenough ehhh in code that does not have to run and can have syntax errorsand does not need to be optimized this should take like min tarehman swe interviews do not ask you to both remember the thing you are implementing while also implementing it that is they ask you to build or design a service that does x the closest parallel in this case would be something like implement the twitter api from memory it would be an absurd swe question theregicidalmaniac interview questions should be representative of the kinds of skills that are most important for being able to do the job in the case of ds and analytics that is problem solving skills related to data whether or not someone knows how to code even a basic neural network from scratch does not say anything about their ability to use and apply nns to business problems busy comments this was for a data science role dude chasinggreenroads okay nthcitizen it is just plain python is already highly abstracted so very far from from scratch and furthermore doing things like linear algebra without numpy is inefficient both in coding and execution might as well ask you to eat a bowl of peas with a knife ghostofkilgore this is it in a nutshell straight out of uni i worked for a company in education i ended up testing some of their software for bugs by essentially sitting high school maths exams at this point i had a masters and phd in physics which was fairly maths heavy and you know how i did on those tests absolutely shit a teenager would have run rings around me on them because i had not seen the stuff in them for years at that point give me a couple of days to study and i would have destroyed that test but in the moment i was completely lost when you ask quiz questions at interview you get people who were in the right place to pass the quiz on the day it is a poor way to conduct interviews and most companies do not do this not because they want to be nice to candidates but because they know it does not select the best candidates maxtothej the interviewer has the advantage of knowing the question and hearing the best responses fuehnix idk man you would have to be really fresh out of a machine learning course to remember that i feel like i coded a perceptron in one of my classes and i am pretty sure i forgot how to do it within a couple months i mean i could do it again given some time but doing it from scratch during an interview where you will not be able to use google or print statements and only have like min hour nah no way lol weonlycryalone that basic thing took a phd thesis to write in the early days we now have high level abstractions for a reason note to self learn how to do this for my next interview just in case ticktocktoe i was feeling stupid that interviewer had to give me hints for such a basic thing bro are you trolling rn embarrassed i have wondered if these tests play the role of age discrimination thoughts entropyvsenergy it is a work in progress but the goal is to write up some flawed code where the solution requires you to have some understanding of how the model works or how training a neural network works so they will be questions about array sizes but you will also get things where the training loop will not zero out the gradient or things like that no client not a great way to ask for referrals buddy energeticbean you might start by implementing some natural language processing into your reddit comments throw a couple of millenium problems there come on joe venustrapsflies well that is why i said pseudocode i would not expect someone to be able to get all the details right off hand like getting all the transposes for the matrices perfect or implementing adam from scratch i would however expect someone to understand that a ffn is a series of matrix multiplications and nonlinear functions and why how to take the gradient of that with a loss function i would also expect them to be able to express that logic again at a high level with pseudocode if someone does not understand this stuff then do they really know what they are doing when they are fiddling with keras parameters venustrapsflies well if the position explicitly did not involve any deep learning then it would certainly be a bad question but this is not ml expert stuff it is something anyone who is going to use a deep learning library should know you are right that not every ds is doing ml but presumably it was relevant to this job bestucanisgoodenough there are like loose tech employees the ones who cannot do it might be able to do it when they are actually hired but some will not meanwhile all the ones that can do it in an interview will be able to do that if you hire them milkteaoppa to feel like they are better than the interviewee because they know how to solve the problem and the interviewee does not not all interviewers are good people yeah i did something involving the system time too do not remember exactly what i do remember is being extremely mad about this mathrandom is exactly what i was not allowed to use rofl dubgrips i have been working as a ds or technical manager for a decade and never needed to code a nn from scratch now every role is different of course but the trend i have seen the last few years is the first wave of mooc graduates that are overprepared for what a role requires are now asking overly technical interview questions that likely will not ever be useful in the actual job dubgrips wouldatasciencepro did you have to code back propagation logic loss function gradients any complex layers like convolution or recurrent or just code up a network architecture with linear layers no introduction you know some employers want more than just someone who can stack together a few black boxes and press go right if a data scientist does not have a deep understanding of the most important algorithm backing deep learning i do not want them on my team they can get some details wrong in the interview but if they are completely lost how can i expect them to read and implement the latest papers in the space morebikesthanbrains bad timing bot tapchap next was to train a model using transfer learning for image classification busy comments not the point the question itself should not have been asked because you do not need to do such a thing on the job man midwestcsstudent rather have somebody who can code with good syntax and that runs because it is a good signal familiarity with a language they are strong inif they are allowed to pick the language dub dub dub besides the fact that this is orthogonal to the point being made in the thread above this is untrue candidates are frequently asked to implement things like quicksort binary search djikstra is etc from memory dub dub dub i do not think this is a good interview question although it is maybe a reasonable one but this is totally off the mark no way at what point in any job are you asked to do coding from scratch immediately wouldub dub dub at what point in any job are you asked to do coding from scratch immediately rofl i know i am sorry just seeing if you would actually reply would not that be a waste to actually type a lot of stuff about my interests and experiences and if there is no reply back at the end i am not really sure why people downvoting my comment about referral is it because i am asking for a referral in a reddit post comment section or i am not really explaining anything in the request or just hating on comment for no reason cus i said grad student in top uni florinandrei p np therealtiddlydump sorry if it was not clear i was agreeing with you if you have the concepts down that is a pretty good suggestion you can make code do the thingy no introduction this sub would seem to say yes handwaving and not having a deep conceptual understanding seems to be perfectly acceptable i do not think we can assume it is relevant i have been asked technical questions about nns in the same breath that someone told me dl and nns are not required for the job sure as long as theres a large surplus of suitably qualified people you can get away with this approach if this is not the case you risk candidates deciding that if the question is moronic you are too and withdrawing weonlycryalone yeah the age of data scientists being able to call their shots is over i think with the mass layoffs at faang and elsewhere we are back to being masterless ronin offering our digital swords for a bowl of millet and a place by the fire no not that bad but this is the second time i have seen this question come up this week so i think that hr is done playing nice in general i have got two interviews this week and i think i need to bone up bestucanisgoodenough yeah understand the feeling in the abstract it is kind of interesting not fun on the spot get the job fuehnix that is the joke homie interesting insights much appreciated yes i coded backpropagation and loss function and gradients for a perception not for crazy cnns or rnns ghostofkilgore and you know that for the vast majority of roles whiteboarding a back propagation in terms of partial derivatives is completely pointless i think we should be able to assume we are not talking about extremely niche roles here but more general interview processes ghostofkilgore most roles do not require people to read and implement the latest papers in the space unless it is essentially a research based role there is likely little need for it if that is what you are hiring for fine but as a general question task for a general ds role it is probably pretty counter productive oh boy on a live call i want to hear more how it ended midwestcsstudent though i agree that this is not a good question you do not need to do such a thing on the job is not a good reason to not ask a certain question bestucanisgoodenough i think it is an interesting interview question and mlp are basic every scientist knows how they work if data scientists do not know how they work you are in a wendy is bestucanisgoodenough given how advanced linting already isthe syntax seriously i would judge someone based on if they write code that is readable without comments structured logically and shows they listened to everything i told them to do tarehman this is a reasonable point i should not have been so absolute in my phrasing to me it still feels a little different because the algorithms you are describing are substantially lower level than most data science and analytics methods i think it depends on the places you do swe interviews and the level of interview as well still fair point no client i am not even the guy you responded to dude lmfao energeticbean first two are spot on not the third but i might add your comment does not exactly scream professionalism could always ask your lecturers bestucanisgoodenough not anymore and it is not that hard in interviews they never expect your code to be perfect syntax and to run perfectly venustrapsflies then maybe you were not being judged much by your ability to answer and they just wanted more insight into how you think and communicate at any rate one interviewer doing something that seems weird is not really the question at hand bestucanisgoodenough if someone wants to withdraw because the interview questions are designed to be hard enough to differentiate the best answers from the worst and does not understand the exercise is supposed to see what you can do with something hard that is win win bestucanisgoodenough hr people are afraid for themselves too or oblivious i have received job offers from managers that only contacted hr to do the offer letter found out they were the recruiters for the position at that point so they maybe forwarded the resume to a pile of resumes nobody is actually looking at them to be talent gate keepers anymore and for public companies people speculating on their stock review all public data that includes job openings growing yoy requires hiring absent magic someone figured out inflating the number of listings has a positive effect for shareholders then everyone started doing it nope jumped through a lot of hoops solved their god damned problem even with the random number generator and then told i was not qualified even though the position would have been a step down for me tapchap it went well it got stretched up though once i have coded he asked some good questions like based on the channels of the image batch and few more so i got the offer as well but later on for other reasons i rejected tarehman neural nets are not the entirety of data science may i introduce the linear model a practical tool for solving a huge variety of ds problems pryomancermtga of all models built are linear regression logistic regression and decision trees what is the best way of asking for a referral i know i saw that after replying i do show professionalism if i directly dm the person either here or linkedin and i am really not sure if he would reply back if he really did reply i would personally talk more professionally about my background and i am sure asking referrals on reddit is not unprofessional i am just trying to look for opportunities wherever i can even if it is a reddit comment section its their mentality problem if they think it is not professional to ask for a referral on reddit i agree in that i get a strong sense from the above that this would be a far worse cultural fit for me than my current role and life is too short bestucanisgoodenough everything they do is pretty derivative and lame imo anyway yes including pytorch prophet all their real products are terrible too bestucanisgoodenough you may feel free to ask people those deep ass linear regression questions there are a lot of folks i have met that use non obvious questions about basic subjects to build a gate which they get to be the keeper of there is nothing that will still be relevant in years on the other side of that gate sir reddits a lot and of all statistics are made up its their mentality problem if they think it is not professional to ask for a referral on reddit and with this sentence you have just disqualified yourself you are a blaming others for a situation that you are in and b showing no inclination to reflect your own behaviour in that exchange i ca not tell you how to ask for a referral in a good way i am not from the us so i do not get some of the cultural nuances to be honest i have seen people ask for referrals in this sub so i think it is more about the way of asking that might be an issue rather than the act of asking itself if it helps i can highlight how i perceived your interactions here would that be okay for you if not then please feel free to just skip the next part what i am writing here is my personal perception and i am offering it not as a criticism of you as a person but as a reflection of how your interaction appeared to me in the hopes that an external viewpoint might be useful for you to start more generally a relationship between two people however short the exchange always has three sides you them and the relationship itself you could go oh this stranger thinks my behaviour was not the most professional i will have a look what may have given them that idea maybe it really was something that i said that is the you part you could go oh i am asking a professional a professional question i need to make sure that the relationships i initiate here reflect that and treat this sub as a professional setting that is the relationship part instead you decided to go for a negative aspect about other people they are hateful hating that is not a very nice thing to do also it is a solution that helps you avoid reflecting any potential shortcomings that you might bring to the exchange people can see that right away summer intern role for anything related to ml i am a grad student in one of the top unis especially in nlp research it is a very broad statement and just mentioning the uni being top without saying what your focus is makes it sound like you are trying to compensate a lack of skills with a university name also anything related to ml makes it sound like you do not know or do not care what you want to do exactly again this is not meant as a personal criticism just my observation which might well be off since i do not have the full story i also get that texting is a limiting medium and i can see from your other comments that you put thought into what information you provided so as to not inconvenience others so i think you have the potential to ask successfully if you refine your approach just hating on comment for no reason cus i said grad student in top uni the thing is this people are not hating people ca not hate you when they do not know you you are taking a response downvotes personally and you should not do that especially not in a professional setting and you were in a professional setting here it reflects badly on you because it shows that you assume a negative attitude about the people you are interacting with without any proof personally i do not like to work with people who show that they could potentially assume negative things about me in our interactions when something does not go their way i would feel like i have to constantly walk on eggshells around them maybe you do not really_ think that it is hate it might well be an off the cuff remark okay then i would still consider it a careless or unreflected comment and it was not appreciative of any potential professional relationship you might want to form here if i have to do the work of figuring out how you actually meant something why would i want to do that work what do i get from that i do show professionalism if i directly dm the person either here or linkedin this is not professionalism this is faking professionalism when you think you a need something from someone and b you_ have decided that it is in fact a professional interaction you do not get to decide this this is simply not how communication between two people works or maybe it is carelessness either way people can tell and it does not reflect well as a behaviour when developing and growing from a student into a professional i would suggest to cast your net wider you may consider every interaction with other data scientists as a professional interaction you may even consider being mindful of your interactions from when you get up in the morning to when you go to bed at night this way you will make that mindset a part of yourself and it will show naturally in your future interactions im not telling you how to do things honestly i am unsure if i am using the word may in the correct way i am just offering a potential option you are of course under no obligation to take any of my recommendations i am just trying to look for opportunities wherever i can even if it is a reddit comment section even if it is a reddit comment section sounds to me that you think less of reddit than of other platforms when it comes to interactions try and see it from a referrer is perspective what incentive does someone have to refer you they know that you already think less of the interaction with them just because it is on reddit that is not a good start they will also know that you are happy to sort people into useful and less useful relationships personally i would not care about being given the impression of being useful to a stranger i mean i would be using my name to give people who trust me a recommendation about a potential candidate the only thing that i as the referrer could gain from that is a professional relationship either with you which feels like it would be very one sided or with my peers in the latter case i would want to make sure that i recommend to them a candidate that is a reasonable good fit personally and professionally tarehman i think you are missing my point it is not necessary to ask deep ass linear modeling questions or to ask tricky questions about any method or tool it is also completely fine to be a data scientist with limited or negligible knowledge of neural nets because neural nets are a very small part of a very large field many problems in data science are amenable to linear regression or a glm i do not expect most data scientists to be able to explain the innards of a cnn unless they work on them regularly i do expect most data scientists to have a working familiarity with ols and logistic regression because those are table stakes for analysis and my confidence interval goes beyond how is that possible pryomancermtga this was pulled from a kaggle survey done in the last year people talk about recommender systems and nlp but businesses rarely implement them thanks for ur constructive criticism or may i say suggestions i do agree on some things that you have pointed out probably i should work on my professional communication about the faking part you mentioned on communicating professionally i do not think humans communicate professionally there are certain times they can just be casual about the anything related to ml i meant ml research roles whatever that are present in the industry how would that say i do not know what i want to do i want to work on ml is what i meant by saying ml roles if i say i only want to work on nlp language models or speech recognition that would definitely narrow down my job opportunities i am not aware if there is any other way of saying what you want to work on like more specifically bestucanisgoodenough if said data scientist does not have any neural net experience on their resume do not interview them for a role where you are going to ask about them i do not think it makes someone unemployable to not know how a nn works but you do not usually get to that kind of interview question without saying you have experience with those methods you could definitely ask a much harder question about ols a lot of people do they can be annoying bestucanisgoodenough and my p value is getting hard about the faking part you mentioned on communicating professionally i do not think humans communicate professionally there are certain times they can just be casual okay you are right i was exaggerating there to make a point maybe i pushed it a bit to far about the anything related to ml i meant ml research roles whatever that are present in the industry how would that say i do not know what i want to do i want to work on ml is what i meant by saying ml roles i got you the sentence itself is not wrong its shortness and the context in which i read it just added to my impression i think if you elaborated that a bit and framed the context differently i think it should be fine the main point for me is this if the relationship between you and the other person is a good one then being casual and to the point likely is not a problem the difficult question is how to know when it is okay to be casual and how much information to give as a beginner i erred on the side of being formal i guess i still do to the point of seeming rigid going by my own comments in the end everyone has different preferences and likings but you typically ca not go wrong with showing your genuine interest in something someone commented i found your answer interesting i would never thought about it like that you seem to be very knowledgeable about x would you mind if i shoot you some questions from there on i do not know you could ask for general career advice you could ask for pointers as to what they think you should do to get a referral for an internship or it might even make sense to ask them directly for a referral at that point that is something for you to judge depending on the situation also as i said my culture is different and my style is just my own personal style for better or worse so do take everything written above with a large grain of salt and good luck tarehman agreed that people ask dumb questions about ols all the time but i wish it was true that people only ask about nns when you say you have experience in them for a subset of companies that lack technical depth they think that asking a candidate to explain nns back to them makes for a good screening question how they can evaluate the answer is beyond me thank you that really helpful",

  "mustachedlobster so random is surprisingly good here because most parameters do not matter very much they have a relatively large range where the method you are using works well and a few bad values that need to be avoided this means that random is a good way for finding solutions that have goodish values for these robust parameters and good values for a small number of parameters that do need to be carefully tuned i have not spent the time to use bayesian optimization properly now in theory bayesian optimisation should always outperform random search providing you set it is hyperparameters properly but i just cannot face the idea of either doing hyperparameter search for setting up my hyperparameter search or trusting other people is defaults now maybe i am being unduly hard on bayesian optimization but the real advantage of random is it is robust and will not get stuck by doing something that is too clever personally i value that robustness over something like bayesian optimisation that might be faster but also might silently fail and leave me having to debug my training loop again grid and random search are so prevalent because you can just use sklearn no need to learn another library like optuna i have used it before but found that it was computationally expensive and took a long time to run just to find the best parameters my use case did not give me that much of a lift so random search worked just as fine sudpam optuna has nice multiobjective optimization as well if you find you want to evaluate both on a business and model metric affectionateshinei use hyperopt to do it there are other libraries too i think optuma is the new one everyone is switching it is quite common ysrysl but i just cannot face the idea of either doing hyperparameter search for setting up my hyperparameter search cmiiw but is not that what you are doing w gridsearchcv as well and to a less stricter degree w randomsearchcv u have to define some extent of search space in order for the tuning to start i guess w bayes optimization another thing that can be further defined is the acquisition function depends on the package used if that is what you were referring to and will not get stuck by doing something that is too clever by stuck do you mean stuck in a local minima maxima sense cos to my knowledge a bayesian optimization tuning job in the context of the gaussian process one can be parameterized to increase its exploration instead of exploitation behavior ysrysl hmm sorry i just found the reasoning to be rather flimsy here cos you pretty much implied that not exploring a different avenue due to laziness ysrysl if i may ask what is ur use case mine is non parameterized algos decision tree based algos like xgboost etc in my experience aside from the boost in performance metrics bayes optimization also tuned the hyperparams in such a way that the metrics for train validation and test sets to be very close to each other indicating that the model is not over underfitting which i am sure is a big win w any type of model i have yet to try bayes optimization w parameterized algos like linear and logistic regression or deep learning tasks though ysrysl thanks for directing me to optuna evaluate both on a business and model metric this is pretty cool will check this feature out for sure ysrysl thanks for bringing optuna up to me will check it out seems like a great package skimming its documentation thus far mustachedlobster cos to my knowledge a bayesian optimization tuning job in the context of the gaussian process one can be parameterized to increase its exploration instead of exploitation behavior yeah this is the additional hyperparameter tuning that the bayesian optimisation needs vs random if you set it to only explore it will basically be doing random search ysrysl sflr if you set it to only explore it will basically be doing random search cmiiw again but i think i disagree on this statement to my knowledge randomsearchcv is truly random in the sense that it will just pick whatever set of hyperparams to try from one iteration to the next meanwhile bayesian optimization is not entirely random per se it relies on acquisition function to guide which set of hyperparams to pick next even tho one can set it at very high exploration mode sure it starts off totally random at iteration but for the following iterations it relies on the corresponding underlying acquisition function an analogy would be for randomsearchcv would be me trying to hit a pinata blindfolded and just start swinging the bat wherever w o any form of guidance while bayesian optimization would have my non blindfolded friends direct my swings to the left or right after every swing or tell me if i have stepped away too far to hit the pinata if my analogy makes sense at all mustachedlobster basically the explore exploit trade off governs how much bayesian optimisation relies on it is current knowledge if it is fully exploiting it goes to wherever it thinks it is best right now if it is fully on explore it always ignores it is current knowledge and continues to pick fully randomly you are describing the behaviour that comes in the trade off in the middle ysrysl i see that makes sense thanks so much for the discussion it is been a great help in making sense of this topic",

into data science finance not major tech but the pay is still good turingincarnate very unlikely you need real knowledge that only academia and industry both can give you certificates will not give you that braveforevergot a job end of with a bootcamp cert and masters in math i am working on a ds degree knowing that i actually only want to be an analyst hopefully that helps prospects herchuntsdirty i am working on my masters in ds and have an undergrad in data analytics and finance and i have years of industry related experience yet i am still only getting an interview maybe to applications this field is wildly competitive and you would have to have a phd level project portfolio or serversl years of direct experience to land a job with only certificates saturated in what way and nice i am trying to get into the industry as well well i am actually trying to get into a data analyst based role eventually i do want to become a data scientist but that is really cool though because i mean data does not always have to be related to just tech you know i do want to go into the public health sector as well like health analytics i do have my bachelor is and some work experience as well but that is why i am also trying to get a certification to further my knowledge congrats how long did it take you to do the boot camp and find a job damn that sucks man well i am just trying to find a mid level position right now i hope you find something none saturated in the sense that the ratio of applicannots to open positions has likely increased vastly in the past few years it still is possible to break into data science but i think it is harder than it used to be turbulent i worked in a warehouse for two years until they had a small data analyst position the opened for inventory control i ended up getting that which was about years ago now and now it is grown from a team of people to and just recently i moved into a mid level data scientist as our team matured turingincarnate so this is my view as a doctoral student but i have only gotten this good because i have studied econometrics for years i have the stats knowledge enough to compete with people who wanted to go into industry from jump you know my advice would be to get a masters degree in whatever cs econ and actually do research that demands you work with panel datasets cleaning them scraping them analysis all that i say this because i was not ready to go into being a quantitative analyst with just my bachelor is i needed more training more time to grow even if you cannot go into acedemia again i would still advise you to collaborate with someone from academia with similar interests as you you will learn a lot like that turingincarnate from experience i have a friend in industry dude is the smartest person i have ever worked with phd in econ masters in engineering i think and bachelor is or masters in computer science point i am making is if you wanna learn if you wanna keep your skills sharp collaboration is a great way of doing so herchuntsdirty thanks my friend i am happy with the job i have but even with experience getting into an entry level mid level role is tough good luck btw how long did it take you to complete your certificate program man that sucks but i also think it depends on where you are located would not be surprised if socal is super competitive i will try that i do want to get a master is but its not in the cards for me right now cuz i do not have enough dinero that is why i am doing a cert since it is free but i also wanna get work experience to be sure of what i wanna do work wise what is cs tell me more about econometrics i am not familiar damn that is amazing and impressive thanks for the encouragement i really want to break into the industry since there are not many minority women and i really do not like working with customers lol or just people in general outside of coworkers ya know thank you none writing this to help answer some questions and add some context i got a bachelor is in engineering in a niche field in a down cycle with not too many open positions i then completed the data science bootcamp in months late to early i got a data science internship in july no previous ds experience or work experience at all which turned into a full time job by the end of i stayed at that company for slightly less than years and i am now months into my second ds job i changed jobs due to a pay increase and opportunity to be fully remote first job was remote only during covid none deleted turingincarnate

better off just making something and learn as you hit roadblocks train like you play jaskeili am honestly getting tired of people saying courses do not matter and think this is a feasible route for

the person spouting this shallow garbage courses are critical to essential fundamentals wouldatastoryteller i think some folks are missing the point this guy is talking about what he did when he was starting not what got him to mckinsey i agree when you are learning to take breaks from cramming in knowledge and do projects to practice what you have learned master the basics before moving on to the next idea cramming a ton of knowledge without ever applying it will not help you actually learn or remember it this is why in most academic courses you spend lecture learning something and then do an assignment to practice it before the next lecture on the next topic great post and awesome discussions thanks for sharing i have got a bs math and ms applied stats i agree understanding of this stuff is only gained by doing failing learning while failing and trying again with your new knowledge a useful understanding of some things just cannot be taken for granted in these condensed

kalmanfilteredcoffee i read some of his medium posts he made a couple of sloppy errors in his comments on statistics which i know about because i made the same errors when i first began with the subject i have a phd in applied math and my thesis work included an enormous amount of coding in c and python i can say that even with all of that ds was not a straightforward subject to tackle statistics is not just some subfield of math it is an entire philosophy and incorporating it into your thinking is not a trivial thing even for someone with a phd in math likewise coding some algorithms for yourself is not the same as contributing to and maintaining a production level code base of millions of lines spanning several programming languages with a bunch of swes with all the best practices in code production project management and business know how that go with it knutknoblauch \u00dfir i invite you to a boot camp where we both shine ramizaki as a be smart and think about roi kinda guy i think if you do not have a phd already it is better to not do ds why spend or even years doing ds only to get paid less than a reactjs developer once you both start at the entry level study nodejs full stack development for months instead since this is good for both back and front end you are likely to land a decent job after six months no asking about math statistics masters degree phd degree or how to make chatgpt actually drive a tesla vehicle earn real money after months of studying year tops use the money to actually do fun things in real life like taking a hot girl to a nice bar club restaurant and later having surreal heavenly sex with her while the other guys are slaving through math and statistics dreaming of landing a data scientist sexy title job your definition of sexy is actually screwing that big t girl propelled by the cash you got from the dev job that they can only now fantasize about not having to study the relativity theory for ds will give you time for the gym too you kinda forgot about that yeah which will up your game with both stacy and chad eezikwultoo being a part of a community that understands the ups and downs of the data science journey has been invaluable for me from the small wins to the frustrating roadblocks it helps to know that others are going through similar experiences that is why i frequent r datasciencedigest a community of individuals who are all on their own journey towards becoming a data scientist i find it so helpful to read about the different perspectives and approaches from others in the field it helps me to gain new insights and learn from the experiences of my peers if you are on your own data science journey i highly recommend checking out the community and sharing your own progress and struggles it is not always easy but it is a lot more manageable with a supportive group of like minded individuals wouldatastoryteller there it is lol yoblob this is of i am a self taught ds here is how i did it guides step is always have a graduate degree in a technical field his self written bio from his website keith mcnulty is an applied mathematician statistician psychometrician and data scientist based in the uk he started his career as a pure mathematician with a focus on matrix algebra and group representation theory he then transitioned into the private sector where he developed expertise in the application of mathematics and measurement theory to questions of people talent skills and organizational science he is currently the global leader of talent science and analytics at mckinsey and company the leading global professional services firm it sounds like he was an applied mathematicia statistician for many years before data science and online courses were a thing so emulating his success is basically step maths phd step around years work experience as applied mathematician statistician step a few online courses towards the end to transition to data science having a phd in math is not some sort of guarantee for a job i have one and it still took me years to transition from academia to an industry job in ds my phd work involved no programming or ds skills so i had to learn from scratch and i did that by inventing problems that were interesting to me and building up a profile just like the post suggests but i only did that because my math background helped me be creative when thinking of interesting problems the kaggle stuff just did not interest me userlivewire he also works for mckinsey the place you call when you need to fire whole departments of people trucomallica but does he know tableau and is able to communicate complex points in simple terms to a suitable audience lopsidedreviewthat goes with the scientist part of the job title how could you not understand that it kills me the number of job applicannots we have for data scientist roles who are essentially just programmers that learned how to string together some black box software tools with zero understand of how they work the whole idea of problem solving to them is you just try things out in code it is a joke in the ds field forget learning to code a monkey can write code learn how to do proofs and then continue on from there seriously i would hire someone who has never written a line of code in their life as long as they understand the actual applied theory behind ds and yes that is about years of hard work in academia first footballfanabc yeah self taught ds programmers turns out to have engineering math degrees phd in math frankalope congrats on the pub thisaintnogame a well done personal project can be huge it makes it easier to evaluate the quality of your work your ability to communicate your ability to ask an interesting question etc but the caveat is that i think its tough to a good personal project if someone sends their github that has a bunch of low value projects i get nothing out of that i have seen a lot of candidates that have like prediction projects that take standard datasets iris titanic some move review things etc and then do a standard here is how i cleaned the data here is where i trained the model this is the auc and here is some feature importances if there is nothing interesting about the datasets or the approach then i am just going to ignore them it certainly will not count against the candidate but it feels like they wasted their time putting up these very vanilla analyses the best personal projects have been ones where people were really interested in the topic likely had to construct their own dataset to get something to answer and then wrote it up to highlight the results and only the most interesting technique needed to get that result multipurposehat i do not do hiring this is a personal take personal projects are best when they solve a real problem writing up an analysis that shows you can predict something with some accuracy is worthless putting those predictions to use is where the value is maybe it is taking your model predictions and writing a blog post that proves a point maybe it is a web app that gives some sort of prediction based on an input for example a boring project is being able to predict the right move in poker and just calling it there that is only half the job training the model where is the application what would make it exciting is tblog post that shows that poker pros play suboptimally sometimes more than other times tweb app that you can play poker against tpredicting outcomes of poker games based on how optimally pros played the game before i actually know nothing about poker but these are the things that in my eyes make a side project great bakochba i just hired someone based on the projects they posted on their resume the panel immediately recognized how we could use her skills even though she did not have a lot of years experience i had her start by walking us through her projects without them we would only have those awful behavior questions to rely on which is death for people starting out i always recommend everyone to put a few project links on their resume at the top i gained an applied research internship that led to a full time job the summer between my two year ms in psychology and i think my personal project had something to do with it i did multiple personal projects on topics i am passionate about suicide prevention psychometrics i pushed them to my public github linked my github to my resume cl and wrote about the projects in my cl the hiring manager actually asked me about my personal projects in the interview this is one anecdotal experience but it seemed to help me gboostedmachinations i got a job by placing in the top of numerai for a few weeks it is very hard to evaluate the quality of personal projects so i take them as a sign of enthusiasm and little more userlivewire it is mckinsey they answer questions like how can i find people to get rid of before the next earnings call speedis notfree which is why he is posting on linkedin theoneandonlyornot you can pass all of these courses and still know nothing besides that most of the courses are pretty similar and only cover the basics without teaching a lot of math slowpush that is a terrible hiring manager nekokeki that looks an awful lot like confirmation bias in that thread there are a lot of assumptions being implied there that are not necessarily true mcnutty adbesmarter another classic is just contribute to open source given exclusively by people who have never contributed to open source royal independent i mean iris is a real dataset scrambledcum i am beginner and i find learning aided by chatgpt extremely useful that thing is magic i know that it sometimes spews shit confidently so i use a textbook google and chatgpt simultaneously to check whether it is right or wrong so far i was able to learn things which previously used to just go above my head i think everyone should incorporate chatgpt into their learning process none deleted hikehikebaby it does not really matter it is better to show that you can apply tools to real data any data untrue in interviews they will want you to talk through real projects you have worked on chasinggreenroads i could not disagree more often i find that recruiters only care about the buzzwords and never care or ask about awards wouldatastoryteller that might help get the interview but if you do not have actual projects to talk about where you have used data to solve problems you probably will not get past the recruiter screening call or at least not the hiring manager you have to remember that the most important kpi at mckinsey is the number of slides generated i once asked somebody very high in consulting and they said well you should get a phd in maths like me i guess they were never told about selection bias in their phd i am honestly getting tired of people saying courses do not matter and think this is a feasible route for anyone the poster did not say that atirblow two posts sapnupuasop nice try promoting your shitty subreddit brismit did not even break out the sock puppet account for this one it may have taken you two years to educate yourself on ds but the phd in math greatly aided in finding a job in terms of brand however i agree that there are no guarantees i think the phd is less for job app and more for learning not having to take the time to understand the underlying mathematics is a huge bonus doinjesuswalk if a phd in math and years of programming experience constituted learning from scratch what stage would you say someone out of high school is at scratch minus sluggles i also have a phd in math i found it very difficult to get interviews without any sort of internship experience after years it took me enrolling in undergrad cs classes again just to be eligible for internships again got an internship relatively quickly then after getting to know my boss and show him i was very capable i managed to transition to full time i think that is probably the best way to get in renokarchnmy more guarantee than a high school diploma and mooc course certs all dated within a month of each other stupiterorbit you are pretty overqualified with a math phd i am guessing that actually hindered your job search to an extent or was a factor i have a phd in biology and chemistry stuff like geochemical molecular microbiology i have done a variety of things since then and i know for a fact when i have looked at pretty low level or entry level positions seeing the phd and some things associated with that can be intimidating in other fields as there are a lot of fancy sounding words i guess also people kinda just think why the fuck do you want to work here with this fancy sounding phd which sucks when you just need a job one of my good friends is a math phd in academia on the financial side of things he kinda says the same thing as he considered leaving academia because of academia stuff while he would have probably been looking at more financial jobs my understanding of his phd math is it can be kind of difficult to transition from the theoretical proofs and research to application or whatever you guys do he explains it to me and my eyes glaze over that being said his mastery of math makes me think it could be incredibly universal to the point it is just about picking a direction and spending some time focusing there like you did before trying to directly get into the industry an important thing i have noticed is a lot of the time people do not recognize the breadth of experience that comes with a phd a lot of the time like knowing a bunch of about your dissertation topic is kinda a small part of everything else you are doing it is kinda frustrating because i gained a ton of non science specific skills that are pretty universal in application but the focus is on the topic basically having a phd is a blessing and a curse in terms of employment opportunities it also sucks with academia being so impacted that the transition to industry can be funky with topics and skills alesbianalpaca i saw your comment and thought this was going to end with them dropping out and buying a pub now i am disappointed artistic thanks unsd i am not a hiring manager so grain of salt and all that but the biggest thing that has been great for me has been that my projects always have context to them so like even with the gapminder dataset which was one of my first projects in school i found some interesting things in the data so i looked into what was going on in that country at that period of time was there a war or a famine or a policy change etc now you are getting to know your data better and you can ask better questions that will inform the direction you go with analysis and that kind of thing goes really well with most audiences it is looking at more than just the numbers but the reason for the numbers anybody can copy some code but do you have an analyst mindset are you going to be able to justify your analysis to stakeholders who do not know about the numbers do you know why the numbers are turning out the way they are or are you just trusting a model chasinggreenroads this is correct and a very well thought out response i could not agree more maxtothej also you will remember the details of your project you will not be like the tons of masters candidates in the thread below saying they had too much to learn and cannot be expected to remember the details bakochba this use the project to show me your skills and functionality it should help me imagine how we could use your skills instead of focusing that you only have a few years experience whencowsgetsick thank you very much for the detail answer bakochba i am a hiring manager you are correct littledeino how is ml ai important in these topics monkeyunited now i do not feel so bad about being on reddit all the time wouldongpal so what is a better approach then if you just do a project you will not know the math as well iuse3seashells he is not wrong but he is not mature this thread too thecumcopter i am hoping you got the reference to the wire midnightscare lmao how would you know they did not contribute to open source jamesbleslie that is cool to hear i use it in my job as a senior data scientist and it is incredibly helpful to me too sizabledata yup you need both it is not one or the other aimadakryakidrotas i have never been asked by recruiters about projects i have been asked by the it department though however in order to get to the it department you need to pass the recruiter first hiring managers yes recruiters keywords on your linkedin certs etc this goes with the we cannot find people well if you put in charge of the search someone with an education in theology undergrad you can only pray to god to have the right candidate selected for interviewing i had just recently one contacting me for a job at my former employer and he did not even notice because it was half the way down the page maybeimnaked recruiters rarely have any technical knowledge so they are just checking off boxes how many years experience do you have with x y z rodaobtu hahahah eezikwultoo r datasciencedigest the frustration was that nobody believed me when i applied for entry level which is all i was qualified for ijustmade possibly but it is a weird market a lot of freshly minted phds are in a limbo of overqualified for basic work but underqualified for advanced positions which can make it difficult to get a position that you feel is fitting i got a job after my phd through connections but i had only heard back from one company before this alternative and they were curious as to why i was trying to apply for a position that i was overqualified for none no a phd does ton for the job app places like amazon facebook google uber recruit directly from conferences where graduating phds attend for applied researcher roles my group masters or phd is a hard requirement choice present considering there is more to learn about data sci even post a year cs degree program someone straight out of hs is def at the start of a steep hill i had no programming experience my dissertation and research work was entirely pen and paper theoretical math so i had a good knowledge of basic statistics because i taught that course but yeah a high school graduate trying to get a technical job is definitely a lower starting point i never thought of that option i happened to run into a physics phd early in my networking so i sort of latched onto him and worked my way into that group doinjesuswalk well i mean having to put in an effort to switch industry or line of work is pretty normal for anyone it is not like people who are used to practical applications are out here evading job offers it takes effort for everyone your friend included so yeah if he has relevant but not direct experience he will have to put in an effort to get his mindset and skills aligned the other way around if someone had been working purely practical application with no formal education going in to academia would be comparatively much harder in my opinion the difficulty of leaving academia is real we all experienced it when we started our first real job that is not going to magically go away just because you stay in academia for many years maybe i am kind of derailing the thread here but there is just so much talk about this specific situation it just seems overblown and based on a romanticism switchorganic i am sure i am preaching to the choir but this is why people should write documentation for their personal projects as tedious as it may be mustachedlobster i mean he is completely wrong in terms of expectations the most junior people i recruit have no idea what do when their tools break or how to identify it no shit they are fresh out of university and have no experience in proper projects lower your bar or hire more experienced people nekokeki indeed yeah they call him mcnutty sometimes i watched with subtitles lol adbesmarter because if i ask them to which project they contributed to i never receive an answer chasinggreenroads yes exactly froststrikerzero how did you overcome this problem sometimes i wonder if i should just leave the degree out of the resume peanutinthebutter the cheat code is government work phd gs recoveringphysicist there is a wide gulf between a random stem phd and having a phd where your research was specifically applicable to some company is applied research needs yeah switching fields is hard work it was a lot of work in the past so why would that be any different in the present bubs calls him mcnutty lucky break in the end a guy was impressed by the phd and have me a senior role with no experience i sucked but learned a lot i bet he regrets it now sluggles i re enrolled in undergrad classes to be eligible for internships transitioned to full time after one semester of being an intern none most applied research roles do not require you to have done research in their specific field how do i know faang hiring managers have to recruit me for those jobs before no matter how much people do not want to hear it top companies do value phd talent and have pipelines for talent coming from phd sure they do not take phd from any field but they take a pretty broad diversity we do the same in my world big banks we have early talent programs that are tailored specifically bring in phds from a variety of quantitative fields that have not do not necessarily have any background in banking finance or what we do its a key way we recruit technical talent including for pure ds roles these are not a small number of roles we are hiring people every year through these programs recoveringphysicist i have got a phd in physics postdocs at big name us universities and work as a garden variety ds for a tech company i am all ears if you have a line on specific pipelines for my kind sluggles most applied research roles do not require you to have done research in their specific field there is still a big difference between research that includes coding or statistics and research that does not none and you think a mathematician does not do coding or know statistics statics is a branch of mathematics literally half the undergrad stats programs in the united states at flagship state schools are taught out of math departments sluggles knowing statistics and how to code is not the same as it being part of your research i took statistics classes in undergrad and multiple probability classes at the grad school level i did a lot of coding in both python and matlab in my classes nobody cares now if you used python to solve a problem in your research or your research involved applying statistics then that would probably help none phds write a dissertation that is doing research most applied mathematicians have to write code for their research for phd candidates the bigger issue is are they interested enough to actually succeed at the job there are some people that really just want to be in an academic environment working in a corporate is not going to ever be as stimulating sluggles phds write a dissertation that is doing research most applied mathematicians have to write code for their research yes i am aware i wrote one yes most applied mathematicians will write code or apply statistical methodology there are however very many people that graduate with phds in mathematics that do not use statistics or write code as part of their dissertation you are talking about a very specific subset of all math phd graduates there are a lot more factors that help qualify you for a job at one of these companies than just having a phd",
  "theastyanax anything is better than nothing but i would say that you are better off getting a bachelor is in something else and then getting a masters in ds to be a successful ds you need to be well rounded communication skills are key vacuouslyuntrue bachelor of data science at least programs i have seen just skim over everything and do not give enough exposure to fundamentals just do a bsc in maths or stats and pick up database design and some programming classes garthakthe university i went to last year compartmentalized the cs major into branches data science being one of them not a single class involved data science it is still cs but labeled data science because of marketing if you decide on a degree check out which classes you can actually take and verify it will put you on the path of data science or data engineering i mean a cs graduate can apply to ds jobs but a ds graduate will have hard time applying to swe jobs if you are looking for secure career go for cs instead if you love research go for ds",

  "olavla so what is your read on it is it the data is it the use case is it your skills is it the inertia of the organization how does your manager define impact hmmthatworked yah it is not all that uncommon it sounds like you have a bad manager in novel work you do not succeed in the first go you learn of ways not to do things and they are all valuable sounds like your manager is looking for progress on to grand a scale for the resources on offer what are your performance reviews like i know this sucks but to put bad managers in their place its a documentation game do they ever give you explicit deliverables if not push back do you not have the training or resources you need to do the job if not push back do this in a polite manner never become emotional always frame it as a business risk or decision think basic algebra when writing i need or the project needs x to do y by z dosent have to be a linear relationship of course but keep all emotions out of the documentation game really it is about re framing the issue you can show progress in many many different ways when one has a bad boss you need to outwork them in the documentation game and show progress and your asks for help if they cannot produce the help required or do not have the resources to get what they need them they cannot say a thing in a well functioning organization but that is the main caveat you need to work in a health environment for this to work if you work in a non function org where management is the result of the peter principal you might be out of luck remember there is no harm in shifting jobs if you have a toxic work environment if your boss cannot or refuses to define what significannot impact means in an empirical context it is a massive red flag i would start looking for a different job or prepare a social engineering campaign to remove them from a position if authority now this is all in the us context probably eu too i do not know work culture out of what i have experienced arikaex look around your company how are ds ml typically going for other people in your team many companies especially those with larger data teams certainly expect results but they also understand not every single idea is going to bear fruit it is in this context that not having results for a year is not a job threatening problem and really it is probably on your manager to be able to call it a day and close the project automatically moving you on to something else this is also not necessarily a bad thing in general it is probably better for your career there to move on to something you can more effectively execute rather than to keep on at this particular task the two biggest issues are a data set we operate with tbs of data every day this dataset comes from different sources there are many join operations to create the final dataset this leads to final dataset replete with nulls and missing values this definitely affects the final training b the difference between offline and online metrics in the domain i work in search ranking offline metrics do not really mimic the online metrics gmv units sold etc really well hence the ability to control on the online results with offline experiments is a bit weak when it comes to skills i have definitely learned a lot in the last year i really did not know when i was getting into the job that data science would mean so much wouldata snooping we have to go into the painstaking details of all the aspects of the data generated by a complex engineering stack when i started out all of this seemed unreasonably complicated and i would perform them slowly being affected by cognitive overload but nowadays i can do these things very quickly however i am also cognizant of the fact that i do not get a lot of aha moments when something unique revelatory comes out of the blue it is usually a lot of grind work trying to find the proverbial needle in the haystack in my case impact revenue increase of the company it has become a very result oriented culture okay let is take a step back two prongs approach here one one side the full dataset daily terabytes pain in the ass to process on the other side do you have a sample of products you could use a clustering approach some from top ranks some from mid ranks some from low ranks sometimes the needle is easier to find if you burn the haystack and you work with what is left over and it gives a mvp in a shorter amount of time for the other question reading your other comments the old rule is always valid easier to find a job while you have a job then when you do not one of the most important things in any field is a good mentor if you are left to learn on your own you are screwed you might learn a lot the hard way but progress is going to be slow unless you are lucky sure which happens and is this project something that can drive more revenue is it tied to sales or the product in some direct and measurable way",

  "depends on what your subject is most data science in my industry is in matlab but i am working in python personally i know others who are dabbling in julia and r instead if your desired field is primarily r it may be the best choice however for versatility broad industry use and ability to develop into data pipelines i would suggest python if no clear industry preference python better gains for long term use this is coming from someone who used to do everything in r now i only uses python tobiplay some companies are still embracing r it is a fine language and the tidyverse is pretty amazing for analytics explorative research simpler ml algorithms hypothesis testing stats etc i do actually prefer it over python but python feels immensely more natural when it comes to building systems and microservices deployment making things scaleable at some point projects want to be deployed refactored documented r is not a first choice for many people that have a software background hence some of the code i have seen is really lacking in terms of good development practices the fact that it is like lines of code to go from unit tested functions to a deployable api with fastapi in python makes it an easy pick they both have their place and i do see why some people love r but if i had to choose one it would be python datamasteryacademy python because python community is bigger and you can find answers to your questions faster if you have a question more often than not someone already asked the same question in python and posted it in platforms like stackoverflow also sharing your final project in your portfolio is a good idea for applying jobs and majority of people in the corporate world prefer python defaultkh hard to judge when we do not know anything about your project at this point i would just say take the one you are more familiar with turingincarnate whatever you are most comfortable with my boy girl whatever you are best with and whatever does what you need for the least cost i use stata for pretty much everything i do but if i need python for cleaning or analysis for some strange reason that stata cannot do it i switch happily sometimes to python showmedadata r if you plan to go into academia python if you plan to go into industry rprogrammerman i use r but if i was starting over i would choose python from what i have heard python is better for implementing data science into production most software engineers are familiar with python but not r so it is easier to collaborate with other technical resources m ijk both are horrible slow languages if you are a statistician who likes cryptic tools and you want to get stuck in a company of cryptic tools then r otherwise python can you elaborate supplychainphd cannot wait to transition to python i went r now stata everyone else uses it and soon python will be the main old fun thank you old fun lol what do you suggest r is old and does a lot of things really well however a lot of the advancement it data science is being done in python with that in mind as time passes the gap closes between python and r capabilities additionally python is more of a universal language and it can do a lot more things well for more universal application also when looking for jobs you are more likely going to see python as a preferred skill rather than r fishballjohnny who the heck uses stata it is like ghetto sas turingincarnate for me i do not need to choose stata has python integration so i use both mainly stata as the situation demands m ijk c and the relevant assembly languages even c will seriously outperform those and supports complex numbers and a bunch of other cool stuff fishballjohnny years ago perl takes the other side of the comparison instead of python how many new projects are being done with perl now chances are one may never come close to exploiting python is purported benefits over r there simply does not exist a language for data science so elegant and straightforward as r and it will persist for decades while the hottest general purpose scripting language come and go but the real answer to op is questions is that it does not matter dent since you seem to know what you are talking about any opinions regarding julia jobeta think of weird things you would like a library for and add and then after it and see what you get or just go on linkedin and look up data scientist jobs and check the requirements supplychainphd pretty much supplychainphd oh my god looking into this now thank you so much fishballjohnny stata is going to follow spss into oblivion after intergrating python scripting just use python itself why not or better yet r never used it so i cannot comment on that language turingincarnate i do not buy this unlike spss stata is a ridiculously powerful stats software that allows you to pretty much do most tasks you could want especially with the addition of mata its linear algebra language it has more capabilities no it cannot run the most advanced ml models like in python or r and it cannot make apps or other stuff but either way the fact that you do not need to choose between them appeals to a market of people outside of the industry like me why not stata is a stats software it does stats stuff better than python i do not need to import libraries in order to do stuff i do not need to import libraries for ols so for me there is no reason to prefer python or r for that matter unless i am doing a project like my current one where i am using tensors to do synthetic controls where python is services are needed fishballjohnny if stata or any language you are using is already there in your organization and you happy with it good for you enjoy having spent some time with stata i find it more flexible than sas and easier to learn than matlab mata is very powerful but few people that i know were able or had the need to take advantage of this but it is merits will not prevent its demise lurking on the horizon how many fresh graduates from years ago do you think learned stata or any proprietary general purpose analytic software if so do you think they wanted to if they already know free software from school why would they go through the trouble to learn propriotary software and convince their superior to acquire the licenses at their work let is give them years to enter decision making stage of their career and we will see free software sweeping the landscape the boat which stata is on is slowly and surely sinking to integrate python scripting is just grabbing a floating straw and you would not do that if you are not already in the water turingincarnate how many fresh graduates from years ago do you think learned stata or any proprietary general purpose analytic software me i got my bachelor is in and my masters in both in political science and my phd will be in public policy our programs teach r but i am an expert in stata and do not wanna learn r because it is a dead language and is super clunky and tedious to use free as it may be when i found out how useful python was for certain tasks i happily integrated it into my workflow convince their superior to acquire the licenses at their work i do not have this problem i only apply for industry jobs that use stata or python and when i get my phd i will have no incentive to work for long in the industry the one reason i am doing so now is to make money to support myself so in my real job as a professor of econometrics and data science i wo not need to argue with anyone about what tools i can use that is why academia is attractive to me so i do not need to be accountable to someone who wants to tell me what tools to use for my work i prefer using whatever i want the boat which stata is on is slowly and surely sinking i do not see stata going the same route of spss stata is shown adaptability that spss does not have no econometrician i know who works in academia uses spss metrics is completely dominated by stata r or python with the former two being roughly equivalent in popularity i suppose my real point is free is not always better i do not care that python is free just googling ols in python tells me that i have to import libraries and define models and so on in stata we do not have that conversation we literally just do reg y x and the output is printed and ready to work with for someone like me who values efficiency there is just no incentive to go through all the steps python demands that we go through just to do the analyses we need it is a waste of time even when i look at prediction for ols in python it is kinda silly ypred modelintercept modelcoefx in stata we literally just do pred ypred xb after ols and boom i guess that is my issue beyond the ml and math abilities of python that i need for my real research someone would need to argue to me convincingly that python is a better language for of my stats needs fishballjohnny yeah you_ are the biggest stata fan because it is so and so with ols and this and that and what not you will plan your career around and name your firstborn after it hooray stay on it for the rest of your life i am not trying to convert you to anything else you do you but it is not about you ai not it im just pointing out that stata along with the rest of the whole sector cannot sustain itself as a business for long and it is showing across industries good products go out of production all the time because of shifting trend in consumer preference this fact hurts many people is sentiment sorry if you are one them that a stata user to remark that r_ of all languages dude please is a dead langauge is oozing with comical effect please come forward to take the stage and join the people who claimed turbo pacal will succeed java turingincarnate it is not about you ai not it no it is not about me it is showing proof both can do well at the same time python has not put matlab out of business i do not think i know engineers who use both why ca not it be that both will do well it is not necessarily a sum game to play since industry and academia have different demands that a stata user to remark that r of all languages dude please is a dead langauge more precisely it is written in a dead language s if i recall correctly and it does not matter even if it was written in a living one fact is stata is easier to use and can accomplish much of the same results unless your application is heavy ml work or web scraping this fact will matter in different industries at different times what will help me will help you differently but it does not necessitate that one will put the other out of business as i said both can do well unless you have evidence that econometricians are fleeing from stata in droves the fact that it integrates with python does not suggest that this move is one of desperation unless you have reason to think otherwise if anything it makes stata more competitive why it opens up more capabilities to different kinds of users python folks get what they want and people in academia elsewhere get what they want see happy feelings for everyone if i recall python and r can both call each others code right is that bad is that a sign that julia is imminently about to topple them fishballjohnny no python has not put matlab out of business but the whole sector_ and ive stressed this above is going downhill stata being from this sector makes for an egregious case because it has yielded to integrating free software while not changing the way it does business in a meaningful way this is precedented by spss which went from the ubiquitous market research tool in every ad agency and fmcg company to occupying this teenyweeny hold over market that free softwares utilize each other is ecosystem is a part of their nature however to do the same not only goes against the grain of proprietary softwares but also undermines the value proposition it is like disneyland promoting a package deal with free admission to the central park what consumers would pay today for are services like infrastructure and consultation selling close sourced software is simply and obviously a sunset industry it is like absolute monarchies coming to their end one by one in the century regardless how much loyalists loved the king if companies do not start to change up their business and participate in the open source software community they will suffer the same fate i understand how you did not care for r in your class but if you did you would not be in the erred thusly in a reddit debate as to confusing the relationship between s and r stating that r is being written_ in s no r is written in c c fortran and r itself also no none of these languages are dying not even fortran fishballjohnny one more important distinction to make is that r and python are general purpose scripting languages that opens the user to a swath of possibilities to productionalize their findings and be a part of a larger pipeline reaching futher and more effectively into the up and downstream you may not see much value in this but consider if that is because your horizon is limited by the boundary of stata is capabilities not what could_ be done in your field to some people that do see this it may just be deciding factor",

  "ghostofkilgore a lot of this is simple high school psychology if someone tries to make you feel dumb it is to make themselves feel smart why do they need to make themselves feel smart because deep down they are scared they are not actually as smart as they want to come across cptkeasar a lot of people after learning matrices integrals and t tests start to assume that knowing how to transpose a matrix makes them more intelligent than those that learn humanities business less math heavy sciences considering that knowing calculus and stats is in theory a requisite to work in the field the proportion of arrogant math majors in ds is much bigger than say in biology or business administration add to that common digit salaries ai hype and the fact that many were socially awkward people with low eq and it is quite normal to see arrogance nahmanidk yes of course people even refer themselves as scientists as they just make ugly line charts in powerbi for their marketing team lmericle i think actually a lot of it has to do with identity to put it crudely there are two kinds of people those who would wear a t shirt with a data science pun on it and those who would not when people really want to be a data scientist they make that part of what gets them up in the morning and naturally their egos get sensitive to challenges to their assumption that they belong in that group when they learn that perhaps they might not be as knowledgeable as other data scientists that are in their peer group their egos get inflamed and their superiority complex comes out as a defense this jibes with the dichotomy some here have commented on between those who post on r datascience and those who you might meet in real life people with something to prove will find arenas for validation and this is assumed to be a good place because of all the eyeballs and engagement in words you might understand do some rough bayesian estimation of the distributions of bummers vs joes on reddit vs real life and it makes so much sense why you see so much bullshit here have you seen software engineers tho moonbathrs everyone i have worked with day to day on the ds side in real life has been smart friendly and kind working in conjunction with other data scientists has been far and away my favorite part of the job actually this has held true across two companies so far sounds like your company may have some cultural issues to work through in the data org assholes follow uniform distribution savethepandabears i feel like there is a pretty heavy selection bias in this sub i do not really think it is arrogance per se but there is a lot of cynicism and fatigue with people asking the same questions over and over while not bothering to use the proper channels weekly e and t thread reading the sub rules or doing a small amount of searching prior to asking their questions as far your professional interaction with seniors treating junior dss poorly that may be a symptom of a greater company culture issue in each of the companies i have worked for i have never really seen that particular issue you absolutely should be having conversations with the seniors if they are treating their coworkers poorly and maybe consider adding additional behavioral screenings in the hiring process fancy poor social communication skills i come from software engineering background and we are known for lack of social calibration rbbasically yes from my experience for the offenders it is almost always rooted in a deep insecurity about their own ability fwiw there are plenty of talented people out there to work with who are also nice pleasantgrowthyes samurott i have brought up racial and gender bias in ai training sets and have gotten shit for being emotional and unscientific it is reddit specifically a tech subreddit so it is absolutely going to attract some annoying schmucks here and there just do not go too far below the first couple of threads and you will usually be fine ghostofkilgore in real life i have to say i have never really noticed much of sort of toxic arrogant attitudes you encounter on this sub from time to time i am just assuming it is a bit of the old real life vs twitter dynamic online platforms let people vent now and again which does not always tend to show their best side also the wort elements tend to get amplified and stick in the mind weclake i saw the post you are referring to earlier i ask conceptual questions and the new people just do not understand statistical regressions anymore it is a hard field and people learn with time and experience to have such poor introspection is unfortunate chasinggreenroads many people in this sub seem to be the worst of the field but i think it is the loud minority they act as gatekeepers and think they are the best to ever do it in the real world all data scientists analysts engineers i work with are great people uchimata this sub is much worse than real life but i do think that credentialism and hipsterism around emerging technologies is pretty endemic in the field i suspect this will decrease over time as data science becomes increasingly integrated into business as usual because then the only question that will really arise as to qualifications will be what have you actually shipped to prod and what benefit did it have for your organization which is as it should be well this might sound like a rant but here is a different perspective fresh people coming to ds are way too entitled and will not even bother learning the basics and if you are there to teach them they just take it for granted as if senior people do not have their own job truth is the field is unregulated the clients do not know what good work looks like and people can get away with a lot sometimes even senior folk within your organization do not know the right things to ask and yes when nobody questions your work and there are no standards you tend to become at least somewhat arrogant lack of understanding of fundamental concepts and general ignorance fuels this further resulting longer term in people with years of experience but very little technical skills to show for it and an ego like a hot air balloon source i lead a team and have had to tell people to learn maths because it is going to help them conducted workshops shared learning material but seen very little interest so far most people think copy pasting someone else is code to run a couple of models is what the job entailsq interviewed a guy recently who likes his job because the client has to accept his analyses because he knows what he is doing he wanted a role just like that but with higher salary god knows why mimisburnbook yes unable short answer yes long answer yes but specifically more swe and those who talk about faang chunkychapstick sounds like you are working at the wrong place my team is filled awesome people but our company is trash trnka yeah there are definitely plenty of arrogant people out there i am not sure if it is more or less than technology in general just commenting to appreciate the effort you are putting in for your juniors that not only helps them individually but with efforts like yours hopefully we can make the next generation more considerate than ours bathroomworld man after switching careers from finance i think the super majority of ds are great to work with meyotchslap it is a fine line between being a critical thinker and a critical personality whispertoke i notice that tech and data science bros do this thing where they answer questions in the shortest most matter of fact kind of dismissive way idk it is hard to explain but it is like signaling a virtue of being sober minded and rational and unemotional which is kind of a gift in technical fields but it can be embodied in ways that are dismissive of others or patronizing and definitely arrogant like they will get an email with a long well thought out question from a junior coworker and respond with yes because they are so horny about the idea of avoiding unnessesary linguistic emotional embellishments or some techbro macho shit like that lol smmstv i think there is a few factors the hazing and pay your dues attitudes are rampant in academia since more and more data scientists are coming out of doctorate programs they spent years in the attitude has been normalized to them the level of attention to detail required in this profession probably attracts those that do not have the best social skills to put it bluntly data scientists are often expected to do or conclude wildly unrealistic things with the data they have been given and it leads to frustration they take out on others monkeyunited just to play devil is advocates though can you likegoogle before asking me this speedis notfree most male dominated technical fields are like this maybe these nerds all got picked last in school sports and chad took their oneitis to the prom so they have a chip on their shoulder tech is bad just listen to accounts of junior swes submitting their first prs academia is also awful for this and where it goes unchecked this field is techy and leans academic so it is par for the course in tech fields young people also move up quite quickly so being a cocky kent is that much more likely many also seem to stake their self worth on technical skills in their job this one one of the reasons i work in life science though imperfect the people here take a pay cut to work in a field that might actually help people and so there are less egotistical twats who think they know everything after years of working rjali i am new to the field and seniors half my age and responses on here to my posts reflect what you are saying i even deleted my posts and probably will not post on here again due to this very thing domesticationnever study it already you know jesus like just gather some data on arrogance vs data science and run some stats dumb ass must be a junior s i really dont think this just making a risky joke maybe they are not arrogant but introverted i came off as an arrogant as per my mock interviewer once because i am an introvert and i had tried solving interview problem right away without discussing with the interviewer it was my first technical interview experience depending on who you ask i can be arrogant to my coworker swe ds etc not so much to my pm po sometime but we get along so it is more friendly teasing that arrogance to our ceo of an ai tech company who poses as an ai specialist to clients but display proudly his ignorance and refuses to learn even the basics in the field and is still angry when something does not work the way he wanted but is unable to understand the problem because he refuses to do any attempt at learning damn right i am i worked at two other companies before one where the boss had a more typical technical profile and one where the boss had none but was open to discussion with them i have absolutely no problems i am nicer to my subordinates because i am paid to be nice i am a bit more real with people on this sub however i will say that tech people are the worse people and i hate working with most of them far too many people feel the need to constantly show how very smart they are and one up you at every opportunity rehoboam no every technical role attracts outspoken arrogant people who rely on their status in that role to define their personal value gatekeeping is key to deny other people the same status and preserve their ego honor maybe it is the company that you work at my place seems to have quite a few well educated ds peeps who are also pretty chill personally tarehman first of all how dare you ask me this j k i do think we can attract those people but i also think that consistently managing your teams helps to avoid it science is humbling and humility is a key part of being willing to learn which is essential for any data scientist why do we attract those people i assume a combination of being told that data science is prestigious both explicitly and implicitly via things like increased salaries the insularity and techno saviorism of the silicon valley culture which birthed the field and the way training programs in fields like physics and mathematics effectively prioritize pure quantitative skill over human empathy to quote an old colleague you know you lock yourself in a room for five years solving linear algebra problems and then when you come out they complain you do not know how to talk to people finally a note sometimes what is perceived as arrogance on this subreddit is merely a collision between people who have substantial work experience and people who do not often the person with experience is perceived as being arrogant while in practice it is often the one without experience who is actually arrogant hackingbricker does this field attract a lot of soft newbie hacks both at technical and management level anecdotally yes shteepadatea everyone i work with is really kind and definitely not arrogant maybe the employer has something to do with it aidzillafont there are arrogant people in every profession they are easily spotted the trick is knowing how to deal with them your ears are a useful tool for that i mean it sucks because i had to fight my way through having just a masters in analytics only to be called arrogant by boss which is equally annoying because i come off odd and i do not like repeating myself over and over as to why i am a little odd i thought overcoming the main problems of dyslexia be the end of people thinking i am strange but it is so much worse in the work world i have to explain that first of all yes i can read and yes i do overcompensate sometimes it is why i ask if somebody wants to talk to me about something professional either give me time to do the pitch or expect some level of overcompensation oddness may be a hair of arrogance for me any successful conversation is a victory to be celebrated which can come of as i am better than you for me any conversation that is seemingly successful makes me think thank god i didnt sound like a lunatic younger people seem to get it more especially when i have one to one talk about hey i can do better but let me know when i sound wrong but man i can never seem to win with folks who do not realize dyslexia is a lifelong disorder this is why it is extremely important to talk to hr and get a feel for how they handle mental health anyway my two cents are yes definately there are arrogent people in the ds world but not all arrogant people may either know because folks like me might not notice or it might be an area in which as a manager could be an area of growth within the department it is me hi i am the problem it is me at work i will not call them out on their shit i stare directly at their code and i just want to cry boot campers who cannot dplyr chain to save their lives like to speak in meeting when they are not supposed to it is me hi i am the problem its me i do not know how to rhyme the next line la la la la la lalalala la la so honestly when i complain here it is just fatigue i apologize jobeta are you sure your senior reports get rewarded for all the work they put in helping the more junior team members this kind of frustration can arise when you have a lot of responsibilities and expectations to deliver and you get a bunch of junior folks brain dumping questions on you without any context and not being very considerate of your time and sometimes also not acknowledging your help i love mentoring but very few things get more frustrating than giving it your all and getting zero gratitude for it bwandowando i have worked with about data scientists for a span of more than a year and their behaviors and egos are very different and not all are arrogant maybe of them is and another has a rockstar attitude but this is a very small sample but then again almost all fields with a senior have arrogant people regardless if it is data science you just happen to notice it because you are in this field jumpy fall yes i started calling people out on their arrogance nicely politely it works magic midnightscare i think ds being analytically rigorous brings out the neuroticism in people prestigioussorttbh yes it attracts the kind of people that get off from the elitism of academia and the elitism of being in tech and usually well off not everyone is like that but there are a lot of bomb mines around and to survive i ignore unnecessary comments all the time and try to correct them when it is just pure ignorance or especially immaturity mascaraed as intelligence because i have no patience for that part of this is because it attracts a lot of young people too my experience is that generally the older data scientists settle into the roles and have a better grasp of what is important in the job and what is not and being the smartest and or loudest in the room is not while collaboration and focus on generating business value even when doing simple methods is considering the title data scientist itself originated from facebook changing the name of a data analyst position to appease a snobby phd new hire yes the field attracts a lot of arrogant characters intelligence is correlated with arrogance unfortunately and in that vein it really does not sound like you are a ds hiring manager you sound more like the junior you are taking about in your comment skeerp data science is the first field i have been exposed to where people get really defense about not knowing something necessary to perform in the field the engineering teams i work with never are oblivious to the physics they work with constantly on this sub i will see people defending data scientists not know some really common model architecture yes people can learn okay the job but the floor of expectation for a data scientist changes based on who you talk to galacticbyte i do not know what kind of experience your are referring to in the companies i have been with all the senior data scientists have been nothing but encouraging and patient with junior members especially interns my colleagues and i have have spent many multiple meeting helping junior members debug tensorflow code share tips of performance issues help practice intern talks and make efforts to call out junior members contributions i am always grateful that others would listen to my recommendations and help me do some grunt work occasionally there is been issues with frustrations when for instance someone trains a cnn on random lists of numbers but folks i have worked had always been gentle with these issues because we could also make ridiculous mistakes sometimes ballzwarrtz a lot of technical types are on the spectrum though this does not give you an excuse to be an asshole imho its not the only sub but humans in general equalastronautyes arrogance seems to be rampant in the field this field attract the kind of vacuous ninnies who studied social sciences and arts major that think they are the master of mathematics after having taken a few online courses on linkedin what so great about data scientist pretty much bunch of people who only can do db query and little bit db visualization which overrated af alarmingbookwho really cares why perrydahlia i think confidence and self assuredness can come across as arrogant to people who are acculturated to just going along to get along but if the product and the result are important to you then you should have an opinion about what goes into it and be willing to argue for that position some people will not like that and that is fine they do not have to like it djstillalive if your senior hires are mistreating your junior hires that is your problem to solve it is not particularly difficult to do so sounds like the mod team needs to do better and users need to stop being such sour little bitches tbh yes aggravatingsandon the other hand the line between confidence and arrogance is pretty fine as well i find insecure people see other people is confidence as arrogance and a lot of arrogant people just think they are just being confident final posturing ghostofkilgore yep high iq low eq combos make for some particularly insufferable people ds like all stem fields has more of them than the general population for sure rainymoonbear if you do not know gram schmidt do not even talk to me peasant hollow fox any field that has to put science in its name is inherently insecure of its existence and thus needs to constantly justify itself see political science for details all who are here bow down to me mathstatgal i think i may be a bit guilty of this i think me being a stickler for doing the right thing checking to ensure that the data meets the assumptions of whatever analysis you are about to perform say made me come across as a douche i have learned to tone it down but i am not inherently a douche said every douche ever and i have learned to voice my passionate interest in the field in a more constructive manner rather being screechy i do agree with what you are saying though i have also encountered the opposite people with little to no background in stats or the basics working in the field a few years build a few models and have a major attitude so i guess it really does go both ways the math majors are arrogant because you do not put them in technical roles in fact you think they bring the same exact skillset as humanities majors and give them the same bi dashboarding roles math majors are just pissed they work their asses off for years getting a technical degree and building up a rigorous quantitative skillset only to be sitting on excel and tableau for hours a week that is why we are arrogant wouldzyang at the ironic expense of myself being this arrogant caricature knowing undergraduate math and statistics is really not that impressive drunkeneconomist frist of all how dare yo you and will still ending up making more than the bum with the phd lmao clicketrie i stepped back from work for a year during covid to manage the kids and i cannot tell you how much time i spent in therapy trying to decouple my identity from my job it was completely who i saw myself as a person when someone asked me to tell them about myself it was always i am a data scientist itiskaro i think it is related to how much money people are making not data scientists specifically a lot of faang employees are rude and really self assured thinking that they are better than anyone else came here to say this you wanna see assholes try asking a question on stack all the admins are dicks possibilityantique i can second this i work with a lot of phd types from various groups and if i am being quite frank the data scientists are the kindest least arrogant of all those groups they are a blast to work with oh man i spilled my coffee why was i even able to picture literal assholes in a distribution itiskaro you are absolutely right i have been treated like shit by seniors in a non technical consulting role as well when i joined as an intern so it is more related to the company culture monkeyunited cynicism and fatigue i have noticed that about myself and have stopped using reddit for a while scambleddregs this i have only been subscribed to this sub for a couple of months and am already considering unsubscribing for exactly the fatigue you describe most of the questions are the same and it seems like most are from understandably frustrated people who either due to lack of exposure or denial do not understand that job searches are driven by networking skills not credentials or experience as analytical people we want it to be different more formulaic but it is unfortunately a social exercise that loop of questions and field specific answers was educational when i joined but now i have gotten the gist and am getting very little incremental value smmstv people asking the same questions over and over while not bothering to use the proper channels i see this a lot in subs about any hobby people get sick of the same stupid questions like should i learn python or pandas for data science or the equivalent and after a while they snap it is not right i am a big proponent of simply not answering the questions if you do not have anything nice or helpful to add but i get it totally agreed out of questions are about job prospect or rants about jobs or the field not that they are unimportant but ppl scrolling through old posts or google will be able to get all they need to know i have worked with junior and senior ds a few of them are arrogant at times but most are respectful and both high iq and mid high eq folks rbyes smmstv at least i am not the only one smmstv i think this is a factor sometimes people lack the self awareness to realize they are coming off arrogantly i try to give people the benefit of the doubt unless it is clear they know better but are doing it anyway smmstv i am a bit more real with people on this sub there is a difference between being real and being a douche tho bernhard lehner is not that true for all higher up roles i do not think gatekeeping is really an issue in this community where else do people share code and data willingly or produce tutorials paper discussions or even free complete books about the topic do not judge a whole community by a few d bags ghostofkilgore yeah that is true devviewevvieisabear this right here low eq is insidious and at every level in stem it draws in very good but utterly incompetent bullshitters for much the same reason synthphreak whats eq i guess my iq is not high enough just a guess empathy quotient mathstatgal may i take a minute of your time to talk about the hessian and the jacobian sweatychairand this is true for almost every degree lmao not many jobs correlate the same workload that academia proposed just job hop til you find the right company or go back to academia monkeyunited math major here literally nobody thinks like that most of us have insecurities because we know how unrelatable our subjects are to most people tarehman my god it is like a perfect encapsulation of the case in question cptkeasar any major uses only of what one studied at uni a linguist learns graph theory for lexicological research but later on teaches past simple to yo an economist learns exoteric economic formulas and concepts but later on just counts sum of sales and roi the idea that because of your math major you are entitled to some exoteric tools is exactly the arrogance we are talking about business makes money if counting running total by month is beneath you you can go into academia and circle jerk papers that are read by people ghostofkilgore if you are in a role that you feel is beneath you there is only two explanations you are right in which case you will no doubt progress into a role more befitting of your talents and hopefully learn not to be a total prick about it or you are not really as good as you think you are no reason to be angry or bitter about either of those lmericle thank you for sharing i think this aspect of wage labor in general is a sneaky one that it pays to pay attention to sososhibby i just identify as my side projects now congrats on the decoupling nicholsz which is weird because faang seems to be uniquely suited to giving people imposter syndrome and making them feel like continuous failures wouldiscountmcgregor i think this is it making six figures while knowing a technical skill set that of the population does not understand is a recipe for superiority complexes when i worked in outdoor rec i took great pleasure in watching these types struggle to put on ski boots or flip their kayak the second they got in koshersloth nah it is because heavy math fields attract people with poor social skills smmstv not to mention that these professions well let us say they do not always attract people with the best emotional intelligence it is not an exclusive issue from this sub trust me you go to others let is say the aws cert sub you will see the same exact problem people asking the same question again and again in my opinion it has to do with basic education lack of it people are no longer developing critical thinking at schools new generations grew up in the era of the now and internet they do not want to put any effort on research or expect to fully understand something in a matter of minutes without any reading longjumping yes okuniti think it helps to talk to people at various levels and generations if you only speak to one group of people you will have a bad time with eq ghostofkilgore emotional quotient but empathy is a massive part of it cptkeasar i once dated a girl who is surname was markova would you like to know about markov chains i used to make at the time totalcharcoal you fuckers do not even know about the geometric mean i think we can try to stay polite i have studied financial mathematics and mathematics applied to economics masters and now works a sql monkey in a big tech the main difference imo in the fields is that mathematics and their tools do not age and that it is the only theory that you can be sure will not be disproven moreover the fields are just different maths try to find similar structures in things that are different whereas applied sciences usually try to explain justifiably the difference and to quantify it as for arrogance almost all mathematicians i meet are super humble and helpful and it does not seem to me there are more arrogant than the background signal economist though sorry i should clarify i am a stats major but yeah it frankly that is not challenging enough for me i will go into a research scientist position in industry after my phd where we do actual science lol czarking eh no that makes sense if you work on a team with a bunch of arrogant people that make it really obvious when they know something you do not it might make you feel like you are a failure smmstv not weird at all they feel like failures project that onto other people to make themselves feel batter software engineers and some of the statisticians are my least favourite people to talk to at work they are arrogant and make you feel like shit for not knowing something they have been working on for years the weird thing is that they are completely unable to describe what they do in simple terms so that i can understand and yet they do not know anything about my topic of speciality i would never think of shaming them or looking down on them for not knowing i would just try and explain it in terms that they understand happysummernope mathematicians in general are pretty humble all things considered my biased hunch on this is that a lot of data scientists have never gone through the humbling experience of say thermodynamics topology or mechanical engineering etc compared to the hard science and engineering fields data science is relatively full of instant gratification you can produce some result to feel good about without mucking around a lot of theory and practice of course doing data science rigorously is another matter but a whole lot of jobs and projects in the industry do not really take you that far mathstatgal do not you mean the harmonic mean yoblob so you are still at university edit oh never mind you are literally still an undergrad lol you are complaining you are not captain of the team but you are not even on the team yet this right here the software engineering who knows a little of statistics and calculus think they are the shit they just use this and that technique like regression without really digging in and try to understand why it works the way it is where did all these formulas and algorithms really come from if you want a real challenge try picking up measure theory and then come back to me and you can call yourself a data scientist living substance really interesting point i thought i knew chemistry pretty well it was my major after all until i took physical chemistry it was intensely humbling and distressing to struggle through thermodynamics quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics all at the introductory level no less as a fairly smart gifted but lazy student my whole life i was like ohhhhh this is what it feels like to feel stupid i have never been so proud of getting a c in my life and that c corresponded to more knowledge dedicated effort and practice with mind bending than any a is in most of the rest of my schooling after all that i approach every single encounter that i have with any scientific mathematical statistical philosophical topic with the assumption that there are important things i do not know that i do not know what i do not know and that the sooner i admit my ignorance to myself and others the sooner i can start being less wrong koshersloth stem in general just has a disproportionate number of people farther up the autism spectrum data science as a field is all about statistically systematizing relationships the kind of mind attracted to this is stuff one that would rather deal with rules than the more fluid dynamics of interpersonal interactions i combining that with the over exaggerated sense of importance the field has had for the last like eight years is basically a recipe for arrogance alesbianalpaca this is really interesting i think there is an exact overlap between this and subjects which have a million online schools and courses that will teach you how to break into the industry in weeks for example how many learn programming quick courses are out there too and r programmerhumour demonstrates and talks about the arrogance in their field all the time classically those newbies and wannabes spend a ridiculous amount of time arguing about which programming language is best when it is a stupid argument but i wonder if there actually a second effect too because there are so many people who can do that sort of thing produce simple results and feel good ect too many arrogant newbies and wannabes that this also leads to the classically trained graduates or more senior people getting their backs up and moaning about self taught people or younger people and how those who do not understand harmonic means are not as cleaver as them alesbianalpaca do not you mean the mean data scientists otherwiseratioi mean no learning measure theory would not really make you a better data scientist or modeler at all software engineering broadly speaking is a more valuable skill set than learning graduate level math not graduate level statistics different things honestly i can remember the day i learned about lebesgue integration and being extremely unimpressed bored",

  "sannish i am not worried about it at all because it has already happened stevenjohnsonas a former math teacher in the data field now i definitely feel that i am not sure i could go back to the classroom and teach ap calculus anymore my professors in college always told me that knowing how to do the math is much less important than why we do the math you have made me want to go buy a textbook and do some homework tonight forbiscuit i think this is literally every working data scientist right now because we get pigeonholed with the tech stack or tools we are working with we do not have time to see what is under the hood anymore but we rely on it to work or hope that someone with a fresh set of eyes can find bugs and call something out the real fundamentals is your ability to read about stuff and learn it forgetting stuff that you do not use regularly makes you human none you forget everything but you can relearn it quicker its ingrained like once a year i like to work through a simple math for econ book alpha chiang is is really simple and easy that way i refresh on linear algebra calculus that i do not use anymore my calculus tends to be the rustiest i do not think i could do integration by parts without looking it up i think the best way to stay technically sharp is to actually read academic papers in journals but its rarely relevant to day to day work and its something that you do to keep mentally sharp that being said i have not been good about it i have had coworkers and friends with phds that have drunkeneconomist you will forget them nobody is able to instantly recite the cochran q tests on demand the important part is that you learned why it is used so you will never have that blind spot when designing experiments carefuladyes i will have to spend quite some time in order to relearn my maths and physics stuff again however even though i miss it at times it is not as relevant any more as it was the problems i solve today demand different skills i habe accepted that i cannot contain the level i once had i then decided to let it go and focus on what i need for the current future topics i am in my final year of phd statistics with many internship experiences over my graduate career in all of those internships i felt that the kind of concepts i was using were the concepts i read in an intro ml or stats modeling class the more difficult part was like explaining the work to managers and colleagues who had not taken such classes and did not understand the material as much it was initially a good experience in the first few internships but in my later internships i started having existential questions about my career i started questioning the logic of my graduate life till date whether after taking such advanced ml and stats classes and learning so much if for the rest of my life my career would be about explaining things i understand fully to stakeholders i know we can take up research jobs too if we like that kind of academic rigor to our work but i did not have any research internship experience so i cannot speak for it bothwaysitgoes is this a shitpost fundamentals is not about being able to calculate t test by hand lol nyquant i moonlight as an adjunct professor which brings up such fun topics like solving differential equations yeah even including fourier transforms nice way to stay grounded with

  "spirited might i work in healthcare research and most of our biostatician r female acewhenifacethedbase i think the crazy imbalance in cs and engineering makes people assume the same of data science from what i have seen ds is significannotly more balanced at least in tech ghostofkilgore i have read somewhere it is about that likely reflects the gender balance in the fields people enter ds from therealstepbot if anything ds has a more women than any of the other closely related stem fields like comps sci and engineering it is a definite reflection of that same conversation why are there few women in stem in in the west and the us in particular i do not think you can say for sure but plenty has been written on the subject at the end of the day society is complicated and people make decisions that individually make sense to each person but when you look at the whole you see that there are patterns to the choices thephoenixrisesagain our team is roughly half and half wouldatastoryteller hopefully this will change with future generations but based on what i have read and conversations with other women lack of encouragement for girls to go into stem fields i was one of the top math students in my classes in grade school and high school never once did any of my teachers or guidance counselors suggest going into something stem maybe i just had bad guidance counselors lack of role models who look like us and representation in this field even in this sub i see tons of posts and comments where male is the default and as a woman i feel like i am an outsider in my own field people see a man and assume he is good at coding or other stem skills people see me and are surprised when i am good at those things and if i were to fail it would validate their assumptions of someone who looked like me toxic culture while things have gotten better toxicity still exists when you have to put up with it just to do your job many eventually decide it is not worth it leveling and potential there are cases of men being leveled higher than women with the same skills and experience there was a report of this happening at google men are typically promoted based on potential whereas women are promoted based on actual accomplishments it is exhausting to have to work harder to achieve the same things as others in your field here are some sources loremispum3h probably just your luck i have had mostly female interviewers happysummerwe have had an unofficial goal of women to men ratio since the start of but still have not got there put simply there are a lot fewer female cvs in our recruitment pipeline the average quality is about the same as the men and we are not giving preferential treatment to either gender retention is actually better with our women but the churn rate is too small to make a difference in overall numbers which is a good thing to be sure timely cupcake that is a huge assumption from a very small dataset how would the interview go cannot speak for the field in general but my team is roughly without it being a specific goal shshmss the majority of my data science team is female vooplee it is balanced at the lower levels and then gets skewed more towards men as you get more senior probably the typical reasons why this is not unique to ds same everywhere in technical roles there are literally a shit ton of females in ds my master is cohort was predominantly female feurbachsock my company is data science team is completely women their manager is male but the director is female also our data engineering team has women leads managers and directors as well this was the norm at the company i worked for too back in the first company i worked for was mostly women analytics data science with a woman director same thing as the next company which was and banking obviously we cannot extrapolate from my experience because i have always tried to work at companies that were diverse but the field is definitely not as bad as it is being made out to be if anything data science might be one of the most diverse just my opinion centralcrayon did you forget the harmonic mean thread already i am pretty sure there was something in there like women were better at ds thewallie women still have to deal with a lot of sexism in this field and mostly in the related field of backend engineering focused it in my experience ds is more evenly distributed than related fields eg debut there is still a long way to go so we can utilize everyone is talent properly rprogrammerman because there are less women interested in becoming data scientists wardrobecreator i am not gonna lie so far all my internship managers have been very smart phd women data scientists at a very well known company in fact many principal data scientists were also women in the team phdfemsci reading some of these comments makes me sad as a female in stem i am rather tired of feminists desperately trying to fight literally everyone and blaming men for their shortcomings i got to where i am through blood sweat and tears just like it should be and i have seen men struggle to get to where they are often times more than my fellow female cohorts due to unrealistically high expectations and no support vs the amount of support for females now did people ever stop to think that maybe their victim playing and constant combativeness makes them a negative asset to a team no one enjoys being around an sjw that makes their entire personality playing victim and pointing fingers people need to accept their own flaws and maintain self awareness or you will always think everyone else is to blame for your faults you can do better earn respect do not demand it in before feminist sjw downvote and call me a pick me girl grow up femchilds 6cockuccinobiology is notorious for being one of the very few stem studies where women outnumber men at least where i live honwave do all of them have phds imacpamd does anyone have mdfinished or unfinished wouldatastoryteller it might be more balanced but it is still far from between my grad program the teams i have been on at multiple companies even just networking in the field i usually observe at best women and many times much less idk what country you are talking about but in the usa there are way more programs for supporting and funding women and minorities in stem then there are any other demographic this starts from undergrad research opportunities and scholarships to post graduate and private sector hireability there are plenty of famous women in stem dating back hundreds of year which have been acknowledged and have even been awarded nobel prizes toxicity exists but is minute compared to years ago unless in asia where tradition is still strong for someone in stem you are citing a study conducted by a non profit who is entire model is based around propagating the narrative choose a less biased source imo it is comments like this that keep women thinking there is a huge issue with women in tech speak to tech recruiters and hr and you will often hear the complete opposite focus on skills stop letting your emotions control your confidence and aim to compete with the market honwave i am a ds and i am interviewing currently for jobs it is really disheartening capathripa poor data science but a gaslighting honwave where did you do your masters from i would like to study there therealstepbot apparently someone is downvoting you but you speak the holy words of truth from the sacred post itiskaro i do not know why you got downvoted it is not wrong i am a female studying data science where of students are male and so many times when i get randomly put in a group the guys are like you can make charts or we will do the coding and you can write text thinking that they are smarter but in fact they are just assholes spirited might yes lots of our client researchers tend to be female as well spirited might yes we have one md but mostly phd or masters and i am with information systems bachelors degree lol capathripa this is pretty hostile and a good example of exactly what the poster you replied to was positing wouldatastoryteller op asked why there are not more women in data science i offered up reasons from what i have heard and read over the years as well as resources with more information since you had an issue with one of the three here is one more because things have changed over the past few years and are worse elsewhere does not mean everything is great and we can pretend like this does not exist i also do not see where my emotions were on display in my comment so i am not sure why you felt that was worth mentioning alesbianalpaca lmao there is no sexism in data science stop being so emotional the irony is dripping from this comment tothepointe the problem is the pipeline dries up before you get to the programs supporting women or funding them it can really be traced back as far as what toys you were given to play with as a child and what activities you were encouraged to participate in stop blaming your gender and re access your resume and competitive skills trust companies are usually desperate for qualified females especially in tech if anything it is like having an advantage the real challenge is competing against basement dwelling neck beards that have ate slept and breathed data science domain knowledge their whole life uclouvain for me in statistics it was more female than male students by far math and biology seems to be the two fields where it is the case here surprisingly engineering chemistry and physics less so pretty much any public university in a liberal state like ny ma ct ca will do ghostofkilgore praise be it is name but do not you see some random person said that their n experience showed that there is absolute no issue at all because their team has a lot of women thewallie it is probably the old boys down voting tbh wouldatastoryteller they are downvoting because if sexism still exists that means male privilege still exists and they do not like what that implies so sorry terrible blunt honesty can often be confused with hostility all love here just looking out for the best of ya everyone is free to take it or leave it the emotion segment is directed to the general female audience reading this not you specifically the issue is not of it existing or not it is often times the playing victim when one does not get exactly what they think they deserve that is the big issue these studies seem to be surveys it is so easy to p hack statistics in favor of someone is narrative these are businesses they are not unbiased research journals as much as they like to be even research conducted and published there can be biased very easily and still get approved by top journals there is a lot of incentive to claim one is study has significance very rarely does anyone in academia or private sector publish their studies that show failed significance this is one of the major flaws with data and scientific research i think most people today agree that equality should be norm however the better it gets the more people have been trying to scapegoat back with the same gender debate for other reasons related to their insufficiencies in terms of actual technical hard skills everyone claims they are equally qualified because they have python sql r big data x amount of years experience and check of application requirements or seem to produce similar metrics at a company etc but can they really offer the same depth and breadth as the hardcore data engineers and machine learning engineers filling data science roles whom are climbing the ranks because they can actually write good efficient and low cost models while simultaneously pushing into production no more often than not really the point i am trying to prove is that playing victim will not fix the issue people are already aware of the past equality issues it is improved and peoples perception on it has changed hugely especially with this being a newer field with mostly very liberal and progressive people filling high tier positions and recruiters desperately looking to hire women for these roles at this point it is more about technical skills than gender it is a reality check that the window for playing the victim is closing very tightly i am just trying to be honest with everyone here in general if a company does not align with your ideals or value you go elsewhere find a startup working in the same domain of interest as you work on starting your own etc coddling will not get people jobs i feel bad for those that experience real traumatizing sexism in the workplace but i personally do not think this is the issue in ds teams you either failed to read the whole post or just lack reading comprehension judging off your fake quote i would assume you stopped after the first few words nothing to do with your gender nor your sexual preference btw honwave i agree but i guess i cannot compete with software folks who got into ds as they have a solid cs foundation itiskaro lol then this sample must be representative for all women in the field worldlymirrordo not be a douchebag bro alesbianalpaca the emotion segment is directed to the general female audience reading this not you specifically why wont the females stop being so emotional you do not have to force yourself to compete you can adapt or keep on fighting and studying guns a blazing if you are as passionate about a particular technology as them you will get there everyone progresses at different rates the field of ds is so broad that there is no grand unifying theory that proves someone is competent with their understanding or one skill that gets offers for all jobs from my experience women often have more motivation to compete and prove themselves men tend to just pursue what they love rather aimlessly we all have to compete with each other for these roles im really just trying to bring some reality to the topic do what you love and find like minded people to work with and you will find your happy place do not get discouraged whoa calm down there champ no douche baggery here do not project case in

  "toxicgun try an econometrics sub i dabbled in causal frameworks at work for a few months mostly a misfire forced to apply it to a not perfect problem with some flawed assumptions for its purposes price elasticity of a very non uniform product with rather low sales however the frameworks somewhat validated the existing business knowledge re some bits of the dag how was it going from classification models to causal models massive drop in quality maturity of available packages documentations and code knowledge to pillage from the internet makes you much more reliant on your individual skills what results did your organization observe the frameworks somewhat validated the existing business knowledge re some bits of the dag what type of models and problem did you work with tour of various causal discovery packages all of them flawed in some way a very disjointed experience generate dag in one software save to a file manually import elsewhere and re arrange the nodes so that it is somewhat legible it was over a year ago though and the field is rapidly evolving microsoft had some interesting stuff come out but by that time the project was finished have you been implementing it in a larger system such as a decision hub the idea was causal techniques for price elasticity estimate into optimiser for various purposes xt i have been developing a large causal inference system for the company i work for every user behavior that is tracked goes into it i am currently trying to convince leadership to now prioritize feature development according to kpis constructed through a causal lens will eventually use it in a recommender system too netflix and linkedin do something similar used mostly the microsoft packages results are pretty good so far it puts a lot of the business model assumptions in quantitative terms which i am hoping will provide structure to planning for the execs bothwaysitgoes read elements of causal inference it has chapters that help people with ml background but without econometric education to connect the dots therealtiddlydump i have recently been tapped to do some casual analysis for an internal client i have done projects so far none set up as experiments so it is been post hoc_ measurement the biggest hurdle was getting the business partner to start thinking causally openly discussing causal paths ala dags expected effect sizes assumptions etc was hard but has already paid off huge this work involved a lot more involvement re feature engineering than a forecasting or other predictive project but that was a great exercise for building trust and performing knowledge transfer mostly them me i hemmed and hawed about how deep to get into the framework with them but we ultimately settled on a good way of discussing controls covariates and other stuff they do not need to worry about interpreting and can thus be made more complicated black boxy vs casual effects as mentioned elsewhere this was using mixed effects modeling via gams but the goal was causal inference friendlyimposter like structural equation modeling may not answer your questions so apolgies in advance i work in academia but liaise directly with clients wanting analysis whilst my stats knowledge is really basic having a knowledge of causal methods is very helpful for a range of things going through process of making a dag really helps me be critical about the data assumptions being made and bias ie confounding it helps me avoid issues like the table fallacy as that is still a large problem in my field therealtiddlydump are you talking about something like a mixed effects model hierarchical generalized linear model or some extension or something else it would be beneficial to everyone if you actually asked the questions in your post statsnpolisci econometricians specialize in causal inference of note the focus often is not on fancy models instead the focus is on setting up data collection correctly or on variable selection to minimize endogeneity some fancy modeling techniques are used but you really cannot get at causality without great theory good data and a decent model wignerville i have been looking in the econometrics sub but it seems to be more for people working with economics and not data scientist that is implemented causal models in their company so i am trying to find people to network with and discuss some stuff with updated my op for more clarification as well wignerville thank you for a great reply very interesting to read about interesting that you were forced to do it from what i have read the initiative is often from data scientist who pick a suitable problem massive drop in quality maturity of available packages documentations and code knowledge to pillage from the internet makes you much more reliant on your individual skills i have seen this as well but depending on your problem there are some fairly mature packages but of course nothing compared to the normal ml packages the frameworks somewhat validated the existing business knowledge re some bits of the dag so no lift in any kpi is tour of various causal discovery packages i have not looked in to this area that much it seems to have a lot of issues but i will likely end up in a situation were it needs to be used wignerville very interesting to read so i guess you are using mainly dowhy can you incorporate recommender systems to that results are pretty good so far compared to some baseline i guess is it being compared to a correlation recommender system my problem is related to recommender systems as in we would like to build a better system for decisions at scale we are currently running on regular classification models and some other non ml logic i have many hurdles in this project many not related to causal or not causal models in any case it would be nice to hear about the gains compared to other solutions my situation is obviously not the same as yours but it would be interesting nonetheless wignerville i updated my op the main question is not about the models or trying to learn them but it is on my reading list so it is a good recommendation nevertheless currently reading causal inference in statistics by judea pearl wignerville thanks for sharing interesting to read the biggest hurdle was getting the business partner to start thinking causally openly discussing causal paths ala dags expected effect sizes assumptions etc was hard but has already paid off huge this is really interesting as i had the opposite experience when i estimated different average treatment effects they liked to draw stuff i hemmed and hawed about how deep to get into the framework with them but we ultimately settled on a good way of discussing controls i think this is a good approach i just said what affects what eg if i increase discounts will the sales go up and similar but not so basic questions was it a one time analysis or has it been used in production if yes what is it used for wignerville as far as i understand it no it is not the same wignerville yes i totally agree with you just building a dag with a domain expert seems to be a really useful way of working even if you do not use it for causal models but if you have built it you can just as well use causal models wignerville i am talking about causal inference and structural causal models wignerville i have updated my op but sometimes i think specific questions more or less act as an detergent rather than attracting more answers that is why i stated it as an open question toxicgun i see you could find some people on linkedin i know that amazon has economists that do those things xt so yeah dowhy causalnex etc in a recommender system it can be used in place of or in ensemble with reinforcement systems to tune hyperparameters in real time and as another signal a multi armed bandit is often used to do that there are multi armed bandits with causal signal built into it which the research says improves accuracy i am going the causal model route now because it can be used for other purposes in the company so it is efficient in my case integration with the recommender system is under development so i cannot say much in terms of how much it will improve the system but i expect it will in terms of performance i like that there are several refutation algorithms in dowhy and econml accuracy is comparable to a simple regression models that is are also being used in some cases therealtiddlydump it is for sales marketing the industry i work in has longer slower sales cycles so the work to automate or deploy is probably not worth the overhead it is kind of a maybe on our roadmap and the analysis uncovered some data issues that we would like to solve so we can make fewer assumptions very basic wow the system that feeds this data lumps stuff together that we would rather have disaggregated stuff that will still require a lot of engineering work my company is making big strides in our data science practice but that has also meant unfucking our data ecosystem that has made balancing adding value in the short term and long term a delicate dance so only the most robust problem formulations see deployment eg forecasting onward and upward but this causal work was a huge step forward i think this is a good approach i just said what affects what eg if i increase discounts will the sales go up and similar but not so basic questions they were very_ interested in talking conceptually about the stuff i was controlling for but getting into the how would have been very unpleasant lots of work to translate it into ideas they were familiar with to no real payoff therealtiddlydump specifically structural equation modeling try r askstatistics i use mixed effects models for some inference work using gams but if you have something more specific in mind a statistics specific subreddit is a better option i replied in a seperate comment wignerville yes i can dot that but my main questions and things i would like to discuss is more related to the experience of working with these types of models and less about the models themselves since there are fairly few to my knowledge that work with causal inference i thought it would be interesting to find the right persons here therealtiddlydump i will reply in a separate comment after reading your updated post",
  "categorically_ yes when using imputation it is wise to create an indicator variable for missingness this at least captures the information i read this book in grad school little missing data cool should they be specific to specific variables like missingage or is it just missing for everything categorically_ you can create a missingness variable for each variable it is up to you to decide which subset of missing variables you create missingness variables for one exception sometimes multiple variables are missing consistently one missing flag can handle all of them at once",

  "chickenparmo i wonder how much of this is driven by course culture too of do a course and then say you are good at it for instance you could do jose portilla is r or python course and learn how to do regression analysis in that software but it goes into no detail on the assumptions etc zazzersmel man i am so glad i went into data engineering coming from a background of petroleum engineering i am currently doing an msc in stats so probably more heavy in fundamentals and there is so many theoretical stuffs they are throwing at me i cannot possibly remember the assumptions for each and every one of them if you really want someone who is really ingrained in the fundamentals you probably need to hire someone who did a years bachelor in stats and then a master in ml data science chasinggreenroads op does the job description or would they know at this part of the interview process that regression models is what they will be doing genuine question edit adding for context i think this is an important distinction because if yes then i agree i would expect them to know more but if not i am not sure that is what someone would brush up on pre interview i have been in data science for my whole career and do not do much regression so i would probably fail this interview as well electricgypsyat as someone who has gone through multiple data science interviews i can also assure you that creating a strategy before going into an interview plays a key role and not knowing everything at your fingertips when it comes to statistics could be one of the main strategies maybe years ago it was required for statisticians to understand the concepts in depth more but now data scientists are expected to understand models do data engineering and also machine learning engineering with the best software engineering practices talk about breadth not sure if one can prepare for all that stuff in an interview given the same depth rhodiarabbit i will be fair with you it is been a while since i have done regression stuff so i would probably fail your interview without prep but ask me computer vision and i will talk your ears off so probably that is what is happening graduate level courses blitz through fundamental statistics and then dedicate sole courses to topics such as machine learning deep learning and computer vision probably because they think that is the ultimate direction of statistics in the future so by the way the graduates finish they degree they are so preoccupied with advanced methodologies that they prob do not prep fundamentals unable and ironically on the opposite end as someone who majored in bs math and statistics and went into data analytics and learned some programs on my own also will include bi tools too people overlook me and look down on me hiring because i do not have a computer science degree even though i gurantee i have a much better understanding of math and statistics and fundamentals with data than the avg cs student major with a github entry level jobs especially were horrible for this and figured i did not have the skills to code and some how math was like just a liberal arts teaching degree like okay thanks hr edit let me just say also you can always learn to code anyone can learn a program as we have seen in subreddits and self learners but it is another to understand the principles even in college i noticed so many cs students curved above me in coding obviously but had literally no idea what they were coding which is ironically what i was learning in my math courses just on paper and in a textbook when getting entry level jobs it was frustrating to admit yes i may not know the language like a cs student but i know the principles i have an analytic mind and can learn a program really fast if you gave me the chance to do so but nope pulling teeth at the begining because i could not code straight out of college like a cs student would have even with experience in r and stuff for statistics mid career i am having the almost the same issue again job market as i try to shift the career path snowbirdnerd so i have been working in the field for a while and i have been stumped by questions about the assumptions behind regression data science is a broad field with a lot to learn which means there is also a lot to forget this means that people with diverse backgrounds are drawn to the field it is not just statisticians anymore sure some people applying are completely unqualified but others just have more specialized backgrounds ohthatlookscool one thing to consider these kids are not trained the same way folks were years ago back in the day it was all stats classes name of the game was inference when you built a regression you cared about the coefficients now it is all ml classes name of the game is prediction when you build a regression you care about the oos rmse i bet half the folks who forgot the term heteroskedacticity could talk your ear off about regularization from sklearn import mastersdegree fifapointsman sounds like you are looking for statistician and not data scientist someone with a master is in statistics will know that stuff from what i have read i feel op is issue is mainly targeting the wrong graduates i am a second year university student studying economics and data science and i could have comfortably answered all of the questions op listed in some of their replies regarding regression using the experience i have had in the only econometrics class i have ever taken yet i am sure would not even be remotely considered qualified for the job however from a ds perspective regression is one of several dozen techniques that might be covered in a standard undergraduate and master is program and it makes it easier to understand why ds graduates might not have the same degree of familiarity with regressions as an econometrics grad for one student it is one of many possible techniques they may implement to solve a problem for the other it is essentially a pillar of their entire field bakochba i am a hiring manager in pharma so i do not have the expertise in your field but i have been interviewing some new grads years out of school for my open positions and i have also struggled a bit with how to test for competency i wanted to ask candidates specific questions around data handling structure etc instead of putting them on the spot when they are nervous i have sent the questions ahead of time and asked them to give us a minutes presentation i am interested to see how they think and show us that they understand how to work with data you may want to consider the same by sending questions that require these fundamentals to answer but something you cannot just google to look up then you can question then about their responses at the interview i find that much more valuable then having someone struggle under pressure wouldarkshenron again someone assuming the knowledge they have is the most valuable knowledge in this field op is post reminds me of the infamous harmonic mean post maybe op is the same guy did you try asking the candidates what they are knowledgeable in ds is a vast vast field a person strong in state of the art nlp would not necessarily also be strong in the statistics of regression edit thanks for the award kind stranger ktpr so since the population is starting to look like this then the problem is now you the smarter response is to identify those that can quickly learn these differences in a one month course of trial or internship employment and hire them build better do not poach the best much more sustainable in the long run while requiring more humility which is why no one does it astronomaestro i will throw one back at you i have never once in my life encountered a situation where the knowledge of the definition of regression to be something that led me to a business solution it is a broad term and i doubt you would be able to ascertain anything statistically significannot from the candite using that question anyway it also means different things to different fields lets say you ask me about linear regression to me it means i fit some model to some data using some likelihood to measure some parameter however what is probably more common in finance is linear regression and you likely have some specific use case which i may be unaware of does this mean i am unqualified because i did not give you what you believed to be the goto finance definition i doubt it as i can guarantee that the modeling i do exceeds the mathematical complexity of linear regression if you were to probe about my work rather than dig on some random piece of finance trivia you would quickly realize that the way you ask the question is probably why you are getting frustrated it measures whether or not someone has a dictionary definition memorized not if they can problem solve using statistics maybe try changing how you are interviewing candidates see if they could come up with ideas to solve a business problem that you might have see if they are quick to pick up on things and how flexible they are see if they can explain their graduate project and defend the results there are many better ways to interview then simply throwing out trivia socialdatascience i would argue that if you are a candidate in the job market that puts an immense amount of energy in mastering the theoretical foundations of regression with hopes that it is going to improve your job prospects you are a fool the fact is that a ton of ds job prospects do not touch regression everyone knows what it is from their intro to stats course forever ago but it has since took a back seat in the brain the job market has shifted towards rewarding people who can build and maintain more complex models and solve complex problems also it is just a bad look to say things like all these young ds degrees do not know the fundamentals maybe you got a bad applicannot or two but if you are saying all these applicannots just suck there is likely some heavy bias in your thinking which is ironic coming from such a seasoned analyst it is called finding the applicannot that can learn the fastest to meet the demands of your sorry to say rather technologically primitiveregression really and very specific industry and train that person up this is what all good tech managers do dylantmb from reading op is replies this seems like a classic case of i am asking a very vague question but thinking of a very specific set of answers and when i do not hear it it means the question was answered wrong rocketlabo i find that op is a little harsh the demands on data scientists these days is huge in terms of the sheer depth of knowledge required to be honest at one interview i was asked about the fundamental assumptions of linear regression my interviewer was trained in statistics i did not know all of them i was an academic physicist and thus flopped that interview but when i started my first data science job my first task was to develop a way to identify the number of operation modes from streaming iot data without depending on manual thresholding for almost a year the engineers and ds in my company had been doing all kinds of fudging and manual thresholding which had to be set for every sensor this obviously became a huge pain in the ass i solved that problem in a few days of starting the job by chaining together a few classic ml algorithms in a novel way im not saying this to boast but to say that interviews are not everything maybe the fundamental assumptions of regression are important for your particular job but a data scientist needs to have a broad skill set problem solving instincts and the ability to combine the disparate elements in his her knowledge base to solve a business problem much more so than being able to regurgitate textbook answers on demand the latter two are really hard to tease out in an interview yet these are the skills that really matter in practice none deleted goodluckonyourexams did not know why the specific assumptions were made does not matter what happens when you violate an assumption and did not know how to test violation of those assumptions matters how to address those issues lookupable kevindotjohnson op is so fucking smart for knowing the assumptions of regression he also has a inch heteorodacidic penis nuboston lol this is ironically why my boss hired me because my two mathematics degrees gave me probably too many fundamentals and i was the only one who could answer these types of questions milkteaoppa people are not studying enough for interviews understandably there is too much to study for for data science interviews and every year some new ai model or ds trend adds a whole chapter of new material to know it is impossible to memorize everything and even i just skip certain areas now probability brainteasers and expect to fail the interview if it is brought up it is rare to encounter most data science concepts in practice and in most projects there is so many types of data and different techniques it is impossible to have experience in all otherwise it is just glossed over in class notes and forgotten and even if the candidate does they better have worked on the project recently or they will not remember the fine details and it might be nda to explain it to you anyways most interviewers have preferred answers even though most problems have multiple solutions and if you suggest something different good luck trying to convince the interviewer your solution is better than theirs and have fun trying to explain an entirely new technique to an interviewer if they never heard of your solution also it is hard to evaluate which solution is better if you have no context or details about the intricacies of the data and the problem careless tailor can you give the answer you are looking for so we can know for future interviews if we are given this question colinallbets times change what you consider fundamentals are fundamentals of statistics_ they are far less relevant in the field of machine learning and the application thereof than in relation to traditional statistical modeling im sure many of the individuals you filtered out would easily and quickly appreciate the concepts you want them to for the purposes of the job modeling tasks there is a significannot difference between asking your theoretical question and asking a practical question about the risks of making assumptions about data being iid for example xelaxander wait now i am curious for linear regression you need at least two samples did you expect any other assumptions infinitegodess i think typical ds person does not really go into model assumptions the way a statistician does they think a regression is one of ml algos and leave it at that also from my experience in working with grads is that ds and da degrees are useless masters or otherwise masters degrees are now handed out like candies the standard is not any higher than coursework bachelors they are just condensed into less time most students do them because of the hype and therefore are not interested in doing additional work in their spare time i would count them as nothing if seen on a cv i have also found that students with degrees in something hype less like physics comp sci or engineering to be much stronger candidates profkimchi out of curiosity op what assumptions do you think are required for ols ghostofkilgore there is a lot going on in this thread op is clearly looking for relatively specialised candidates i do not think that is in itself an issue he wants people who know regression inside out not generalists who kind of know regression a bit and pick up the rest if you are looking for an nlp engineer it is fair to look for nlp experts rather than generalists who know bits and pieces for me the issueis then are you being selective enough with job descriptions and must haves for interview why not just say we are looking for people with either these specific masters phds or relevant experience it sounds like you are taking a bunch of generalists in to interview and getting annoyed that they are not specialists which seems a bit silly of course this leads to the ever present gatekeeping of are you even a real ds if you ca not every field is filled with people who overestimate the importance of their own skills background whatever the kind of candidates op is looking for will be different than the kind of candidates other companies are looking for and that is okay in my previous role it is likely we would not have chosen the kind of candidates op wants and op would not have chosen the kind of candidates we wanted there are different roles within ds that require different skills and strengths and honestly if you are getting angry about that it does not make you look like the one true defender of the field it makes you look like a bitter immature little whiner renokarchnmy to be fair google cannot even decide how many assumptions of a regression there really are also the secrets the mbas often do not share is to always sandbag modelking error leading to missed millions of dollars is just a trump card when you have a bad year and need to eke out a few mil to hit your goals just hire a consultant to tidy up that model performance you knew was artificially low and voila you are a genius reachreclaimer wo not lie op think your process is a bit shit i am sure some of the candidates were quite poor but if everyone is poor then it is more likely on you think it is your comments that prove that point more you are expecting people to go and memorise the shit they got taught in or year before a random interview i reckon most will brush up on it beforehand but they are not gonna spend too much time on a single company is interview and they should not to memorise every little thing again you are ranting about them not being taught in depth while simultaneously saying they are taught a wider variety of topics improve your hiring process and stop being a twat to grads and yeah sure phds are gonna know more innate stuff especially when interviewing they have typically got a good few extra years of experience on them compared to masters students for work and life a lot of people are not going to understand this post because they do not work in banking but i get why you are looking for people that understand this stuff at every bank i have worked at the mrm process is the worst part of the job and now as a manager i would never want to hire someone that cannot independently pull their own weight people getting defensive about this here and saying people can just look this stuff up have likely never built models at a bank there is nothing complicated about it but i never want to check someone is documentation before submission and find gaps that they are not even aware of you either understand this through experience working in the industry or you do not what is helped me is really micromanaging the job post description and also being as clear as possible with the recruiters about what experience needs to be on a resume before it gets to the interview and someone with just a masters and no clear experience developing and documenting models in banking is a no from me at this point wouldouble click given them the list of assumptions ask them why they exist what would happen if they were violated etc i just looked a list of the navier stokes fluids partial differential assumptions there are like lol i do not care even if i was fresh out of school i would not be able to just rattle them off but i could explain why they exist and what that means for results in the world i think you need to manage your expectations people are not robots thebanktank wait you are saying my competition is bar is easy to beat i am comfortable with this traditionalpearop i completely empathize with you on your struggles i think the challenge today is that data science is extremely broad and at each end of the spectrum there are a plethora of things a candidate should know myself i have a ms in econometrics know the gauss markov assumptions by heart and could compute linear regressions by hand if i had to i have also been rejected from positions for forgetting what the common activation functions are for neural networks in that specific case they very condescendingly told the recruiter he seems like a great economist not a data scientist lmao also if you are hiring my background sounds like it could be a fit just throwing it out there categorytheory amen was literally saying the same thing today i test folks in general linear algebra concepts and basics stats and then basic data structures and algos from computer science of master grads in data science fail they only know python libraries it is sad alpharaptorsaar r squared is so maadel is gud product of data science majors trade school for pandas and data viz but no understanding of statistics zghks i am sorry but you come off as entitled you want a senior data analyst but do not want to pay for it people coming out of those programs have spent tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to meet you of the way they know what data analysis is and how to do it anything more than that is supposed to be learned on the job if none of your candidates meet your standards you need to raise people to meet them through training in low risk environments or you need to post the position as a senior position and pay for the experience adopt a local university train interns and put them on relatively small projects where you can expose them to conditions that stress test the assumptions of their models or offer to provide seminars for data analysis students and give a lecture on those assumptions you are talking about if you and other senior data scientists are discontented with the quality of recent graduates that is a sign the profession needs to organize better onboarding you could also talk to professors from those schools and ask them to cover that content if you think modeling errors are costly wait until you see what it costs to teach executives and politicians azdatasci i have been saying this for a long long time when i was considering what to do my masters in i had thought about going for a ds degree i reached out to a bunch of folks i work with that have done this kind of work for years data science is t a new thing it just has a new name most of those folks strongly recommended that i stick to a hard science such as cs or statistics they noted that the biggest problem they have is when the data science teams submit models they cannot really explain or decent certain implementations this ranges from assumptions to simply why did you choose methodology a over b i decided to do my masters in statistics since i already had an undergrad in applied mathematics and had a lot of years of cs experience at the same time a close friend started her program in ds as we compared our curriculum she got disgusted that she was t being taught most of the important background that she would probably need now this might have been her program but i talked to candidates all the time who cannot answer reasonable questions for the role they are applying for i am just not convinced ds programs are teaching the fundamentals they should be and most students do not know any better ps i also work for a financial institution in their banking division and am responsible for hiring candidates thebrownsaber op lol because the overall requirements are a lot more for newer graduates back when we started all you had to know was logistic regression i think you should really understand what is going in the industry as your requirements are too high and you should get some hiring lessons honestly if you were part of the hiring committee and you said this you would not be part of the hiring committee anymore until you get properly trained therealtiddlydump what degrees are these people getting is this more evidence for my ds degrees are useless stance or is this across the board edit for the record i have no idea why you are getting downvoted with all the how do i get a ds job posts in this subreddit id think people would be receptive to your experience hiring eddytheflow bro all my regression courses were several semesters ago way off when i started i cannot even remember off the top of my head i know how to find the answer though but i figure leading up to an interview i would try to at least remember these assumptions bakerinthekitchen i agree that many people coming from ds programs probably are missing some of the fundamental concepts i think it is on them as well as the institutions who throw together ds degree programs as a cash grab but i will play along on the other side how granular are you expecting people to get if you were asked how to estimate the parameters for linear regression from a matrix vector multiplication perspective could you you probably have never had to do it in practice but i would hope you understand the fundamentals of the models you are using loaderd i work in banking and most of my career involves building regression or logistic regression models how much is regression specifically mentioned in the job posting because my assumption is not at all most banking quant professionals are obsessed with highlighting cutting edge ml or the newest garch xyz variant so it stands to reason that a lot of candidates who are nervous might not pull the assumptions out of their memory right away know how to test violation of those assumptions or how to address those issues what is the definitive non subjective way to test for the assumption of normality of residuals in linear regression op is getting downvoted to oblivion in the comment section here it is worth noting that he has some good points just he struggles to vocalize it without sounding like an absolute asshole so there are some takeaways hidden in his message do you have to be able to recite the assumptions of any given model on demand almost definitely no if you really need it it is because you will be using these models often on the job op likely has it down because he uses it regularly it would not take the average masters student long to remember what they need after using a model multiple times on the job big hint being from the seeming preference of phds they probably had more real experience through taing and other work and have studied variations of a model in their frantic attempt to get their paper done but should you be expected to be able to draw up a plan for what data you need to answer what problem and sniff out any possible statistical problems from day one probably so in that sense people should have a sound enough statistical base so that they are equipped for the array of problems they might encounter in the real world some industries will require deeper knowledge into certain models some will require regression models as they are very explainable so it helps to read the job posting unfortunately many job postings will simultaneously require deep knowledge of regression models tree models and deep learning so it falls on the interviewee to have some ideas about use cases for ml in the industry they are applying for as the current hype is around nlp at least separate if you think the job youre applying to is business analytics focused or deep learning r and d focused well when the whole industry prides themselves on not worrying about the technical details and keep it simple stupid for the management you see a drop off of statistical rigor in turn yielding such candidates the whole fucking industry needs to revamped fucking worry about statistics rigor sure do not go waving around casella and berger but fucking understand that statistics fundamentals matter and hold those who do not come in with such backgrounds accountable for it at the risk of sounding gate keepy this whole industry prides themselves on wanting to make the damn field super interdisplinary and now you have people from non stem fields with little stats background building models just cause they have an ms while people like me with a bs in fucking statistics get pushed behind a tableau dashboarding bi group because we are undergrads fuck off my sme for this internship had an ms in business analytics arguing with me and telling me that a nonlinear model would be better suited for modeling credit defaults than logistic regression literally get the fuck outta here big ms guy tho he is on a modeling team wow suck his fucking cock cause he has an ms and i only have a bs in the fucking field that actually is so fundamental to this discipline drizzlyr op what is your education background in i have felt this way for a long long time now and am infuriated by it my background is in econ econometrics and actually work in banking myself i am that coursework we are looking to understand things estimate things from a causal inference perspective where they absolutely concentrate on assumptions i feel like all these moocs and new ds programs are to blame op anyone calling you elitist for asking candidates key info about the models you listed are probably insecure cause they cannot answer those questions themselves lol data science is more than just modelfit last time i checked the word scientist is for a reason if you do not have an understanding of the math going on under the hood of the scikit learn algo you are using your knowledge is superfluous at best if a company hires you to do this type of work they need to trust you are an expert and are not wasting the organization is time and money on faulty modeling i have a stats background so i may be biased but that is my opinion notmynameduh expecting a fresh graduate bachelors or master to know something you have been using in your day to day job in a way that only you and your team know is anyway unfair fresh graduates should be hired on their potential to learn and contribute to the business they are looking for exposure to the data science industry which is huge so many organisations have so many different practices it is tough to know what each organisation uses before even entering the workforce snowmaninheat okay i will chime in here i come from experimental psychology which obvs involves a lot of statistics i know that logistic regression requires certain assumptions no multicollinearity dichotomous outcome certain sample size requirements etc but i could not tell you off the top of my head what the consequences of violating all those assumptions are and i work with logistic regressions quite a bit i could look them up and perform the tests if my client requested me to but unless the situation is life or death i am probably not going to since it takes a chunk of time a few weeks ago i had a technical assignment that actually asked me to perform a logistic regression along with assumptions testing in r and write documented code along with an interpretation within hours i was honestly a bit taken aback by and large very few folks care about assumptions i hate to tell you i do not even see them tested in most academic papers i have reviewed and most businesses will probably care even less furthermore there is not even consensus on assumptions these days i think i saw one recent paper that said an lr required participants that is a new one tldr op is being elitist like others on here i carry a great big book of stats with lists of assumptions and sample size requirements for different tests that i refer to whenever i have a question knowledge of fundamentals is gatekeeping according to gen z thepromisofhappines all the programming cowboys are crossing over the bar has been significannotly lowered i came from a comp science background with a bit of ba had to learn maths and stats on my own well before all these tools existed most of the people i worked with just a few years ago were physics phd is with math masters etc now the pool is low i agree to an extent that tools have helped bring it down but by good has it brought out some of the worst it reminds me of when i was head of development working with teams of people who were literally copying and pasting from stack overflow all day with no comprehension of what they were doing i am working with other companies data scientists and i am just concerned to be honest lol they do not even really know python they cannot use r and the only sql they know is what they can find r we it is a google search forget having useful linux or scripting skills lol like if you were new to the job i would understand but some of these deckers are now years experience freaks me out that these people could end up influence big decisions and that is before you ask them any pre calculus or regression so might as well chuck that out too shit in shit out one thing you will get on this reddit is that apparently no one has to know anything expecting anyone to know any technical detail is gate keeping and asking too much by the same logic if you go to your local gp they should not remember basic diagnostic details just what to google should you present with certain symptoms read through these comments and it is all about you just need to be someone that has a vague broad understanding of stuff that can figure it out when needed it is very weird bidslight i bet you ca not wait for them to complain to your boss for being too involved in their work then they conspire to get you fired enjoy therealdaviddavis i do not think a masters degree is as valuable as it used to be and i myself do not have a masters degree so i do have bias but i tend to run circles around many of my same level peers who do i cannot explain why i run circles around them however it is something that my management is noticing only about of the hires with masters degrees actually outpreform the persons with just an undergrad and imo part of this is that many masters degrees now days are basically the junior senior level courses of an undergrad degree packaged as a grad degree and it would probably nice to have a list of masters programs which have pre reqs relating to stats math cs as such preqreqs ensure that it is not undergrad curriculum that has been repackaged as a masters degree moscowgordon how to test violation of those assumptions assumption checking is pretty subjective and tends to rewards credentialism imo in reality every assumption is always violated data is never really normally distributed etc every statistician is going to have their own idea of the right way to test assumptions and which ones really matter if you prioritize this stuff i am not surprised you have to hire a phd most of them will end up in jobs where modeling error can have multi million dollar impacts there is this technique you may have heard of called cross validation where you can estimate what the modeling error is still room for debate but less than with the assumption checking stuff jefffresh i am so glad that in my degree the teachers were old school it was hard but the last we did was coding first we did all mathematically even backpropagation i remember a lot of linear transformation of exponential functions to make good regressions and error study bias vs variance and statistical analysis the only thing that i would to do for myself was learning python wiscodiscowarrior any idiot with a pulse that shows up to class can get even an advanced degree nowadays schools are always going to be behind industry but in anything information technology related multiply this by especially with shit like chatgpt being around now expect more of these extremely well educated idiots sad ad umm can i apply for this position i most definitely know how to address violations in regression models formaladthanks for posting this i will make sure to study those questions if i have any interviews azeriv hello sir i have a phd in ms excel please hire me i know none the reason is because they got through the masters or any education by memory not by actually knowing what they are learning just in hopes of getting the job because it was the right thing to do buuuuut they will learn if they use it every day none will know at baseline ever from my experience no kid that finished any degree is qualified to start a job anywhere but that does not mean you should not hire them many workplaces give training anyway as mandatory since you do not know how the enterprise you are getting into works i can only speak for it but similar things happen in other fields after a few weeks or months you get the hang of it in what you need to do since the task at hand was probably specific anyway in the past i got alot of you know too much for position x so we cannot hire you since you would probably leave in the near future but you do not know enough for position y so we cannot hire you so over qualified under qualified and you end up nowhere therubecube ironically i did not learn these concepts when i did my undergrad or they were brushed over and never retained but reviewed them with great detail in my month long boot camp why because the boot camp prepares you for the job interview does that mean i learned more stats during my boot camp beyond my undergrad and grad courses not at all so maybe in the end you get a guy who happened to read a bit more on regression the last week or used it during his capstone it does not mean you are getting the best candidate especially since it is entry level graduates meaning they have no to little work experience and why phds can answer your question is because they have had practical experience doing research but that means they are paid more as a result i read in a comment from you that these candidates were able to list the assumptions but were not able to go any deeper i feel that should not make or break given the candidate is a new grad getting too myopic when hiring based on textbook level answers is extremely fallible like predicting who is going to be a great ceo based on who has the better marks in business class a lot of great companies actually hire now based on a mix of knowledge and the persons ability to grow and learn meaning even if they make a mistake or do not know something they are willing to accept that and learn from it it is how humans develop and sometimes without practical experience the fundamentals are never there anyway for instance my company rarely uses regression because there too many statistical assumptions in place and with the quantity and nature of data we have it would break many of those assumptions so what good are regression fundamentals there i think what you are looking for is a student who is specialized in regression and sadly with todays growing tech and big data companies outside of banks regression models are starting to be intro level concepts that are brushed over in college so what you are experiencing is like someone today trying to hire a person with deep matlab knowledge and getting upset everyone knows python instead however the real issue is that it does not matter what language they use but how well can they learn what you want them to use quickly and masterfully that is a good candidate you want for an entry position sellgamerent as someone about to finish a ms in data science part time for me the reason would be that a master is is too few courses to drive intuitive understanding of this depth for any particular topic imo there should not be a data science degree the field is so vast from what i can tell that a degree can only cover the surface level for instance there is no engineering degree there are mechanical civil environmental etc engineers i think there should be data analysis degrees cloud computing degrees data engineering ml deep learning etc checking job posts for ml engineer ds data engineer and data analysts i do not feel properly prepared for any of them compared to my mechanical engineering bachelors where i felt like i could reasonably do whatever job i applied for in quite different types of mechanical engineering further statistics is one of the first courses taken so the fresh graduate has neither had hour per week industry immersion they also have not even covered the specific course material that you are bringing up to them potentially for over a year two or three as someone who feels confident in their abilities to learn quickly i think you are passing on some high potential candidates that you could both train to know exactly what you want them to know to succeed in their role as well as pay them less money to compensate for the training phase trannycakes just to make sure i am prepared do you assume the random data and standard error follows a normal distribution and you would do a sign test to test for this akahopper so many classmates i have had that just memorize go after someone with a math background maybe my ma is in economics insighteous that happens when people with a non math stats cs degree want to be a data scientist pythonwiz i bet they did not even know about the proper use of the harmonic mean jaikishanb can someone help answer all the questions cryptictac as someone who did do a ds course as a fresher i can understand this all of my real learning was done when i tried to learn concepts on my own and not when they were fed to me via a course prestigioussortrework the job description in their defense the data scientist job is very interdisciplinary so its easy not to have depth in any particular area and every role is completely different similarly a school has too many things to teach to go into depth much what you think its fundamental most data scientists do not need to know it is your subjective view of the role not the reality of what all data scientists likely know you want a person who knows regression and time series well write this out clearly in the jd and include examples of specific things they must already know so that they could self gage what you mean else just pay more and get a phd student as you have been successful with them matching your expectations op i am actually one of those masters candidates that might not be up to par lol and i want to be do you have any suggestions i want to keep pushing myself to be better actualplanti am not surprised there is a lot of content out there to learn data analysis science and most of it is we do things like this there is very little that says why we do this or how we came to this decision something i struggle with as i teach myself engelthefallen assumptions of statistical models are usually taught but rarely reinforced i know in research no one reports the results of the tests to prove the assumptions are valid you just assume they are outside of my main statistics classes rarely saw people discuss assumptions either cloudmadeofcandy is the specific assumption iid i am just a self learning college student electrocroce just wanted to write that it sounds like you will need someone who either has a phd or someone who did actually do research in literally anything it is a little bit delusional to apply for a job with the main criterium being knowledgable about regression models and then not knowing anything in depth about it but on the other hand if they come from a good university and proof fast learning capability it is my impression that this is not something that is out of reach to become proficient in in a couple of weeks for the bump in pay for someone with a phd that could be the better option if thats a concernif they are gonna have a real impact on millions of dollars have oversight over people who do then i would opt for someone with a phd anyway i guess edit just wanted to add a hiring strategy that from my perspective as someone who has seen friends hired this way i did not hire or was hired this way myself maybe you could write your local best university and speak to a professor in the required field directly they have a pretty good idea of their students and know exactly which student is capable of what you could hire someone who is a perfect fit directly out of university for professors it is a great way to make connections motivate students and build genuine interest when they do recommendations partnerships like these i think that could be a winwin for everyone this is exactly what i said from a post a few weeks ago someone was complaining that they got asked to code a basic layered nn in an interview using numpy i assume all master is students know how to do this is not very difficult and expect someone with no masters to be able to do this if the job description specifically says that you will be working with nn i have a masters in computational finance and another in data science and can tell you masters in ds is completely bs and does not really teach you much ds is so broad that you will probably not even come across time series models i had a time series elective in my ds masters that i did not take and most did not they went for cv nlp etc but in my masters of computational finance most of my courses were on time series models i recommend you try to hire people with background in econometrics and financial engineering since they will definitely be very knowledgeable on time series models 2fast2smart2pretty this entire thread is why i tell people programs like alteryx are dangerous sure any marketing manager can run a model from a drop down list but you need to understand your data as well as your model and assumptions mrtickle every interviewer has some random technical bullshit they think every graduate should know as basic fact if you can pass a masters in data science you can learn whatever you need to to do an average ds job coming from engineering into ds engineers have understood this for decades we never expect a graduate to know anything about our particular discipline we are just confident that if they have the passed the training they can learn what they need to hiring managers miss out on great talent because they do not know insert random shit i know and think everyone else should i have years exp designing and deploying ml models last one made annualised revenue uplift and i probably would not pass your interview bothwaysitgoes i do not believe that is possible any reasonable person with econometrics background from a top school would be well versed in regressions that is the backbone of applied economics i think that your hiring pipeline is totally broken talk to hr odbaceniracunif everyone else is the problem you are the problem eiscosogin i dropped out of my cs undergrad and learned more about fundamentals in the last year than the previous years tarehman it sounds to me as though you are trying to hire for a statistician how important are production quality swe skills for this role data scientists are not the same as statisticians you are dealing with degree inflation nocampa lot of people getting defensive here about not having an understanding of the fundamentals of what they are doing in their jobs paandaboss hey if it helps i have no idea what you are even remotely talking about tarneks getting a general idea of most stuff and building experience is more practical tho for masters how much can you realistically fit into a year you do need to know the assumptions but you can honestly teach this to them in most cases they will not model this from scratch anyway as a new grad the the only thing i focused on was the pros and cons of algorithms and how they behave and what are limitations i do not necessarily need to l memorize the math despite doing it from scratch it does not really make a difference on how well i understand an algorithm i did the kmeans regressions etc and while its nice to do it from scratch thats more flex than practical since your code will not be optimized like packages i got drilled on regressions a lot in my interviews and its very stressful despite me doing it by hand in school for fun having managers drilling you about how each variable will react to each other if you do a small change is not easy cornandbeanz as a master is student in ds i can understand where your frustration is coming from understanding the underlying fundamentals behind the algorithms is something i have seen a lot of students struggle with the most since ds is such a broad field it seems many programs are teaching more breadth at the expense of depth and connections to fundamentals it is easy to fall into the temptation of ignoring the maths and treating algos like a black box then forget about it all in a week since there is a new thing to learn however i have also seen that the best students are the ones who do understand the fundamentals shananayrodriguez be the change you wish to see in the world create an internship program that pushes those underlying assumptions as critical if people can write them off as theory and not very salient in practice they will forget them tokukawa we paid a load of money to an important data consulting firm that thought the power of in a formula was the same as multiplied by no it was not a typo was a repeated error in many different parts of the code they simply cannot read math and translate it into code sockerx i feel similar about general developer roles and probably business analysis too even the fundamentals of like what a job is that you are expected to actually put in effort use your brain and think and do work cmdrastronaughty totally agree except i am seeing it at the undergrad entry level i used to interview with a live coding sudo code problem but i have changed up how i interview now i think bootcamps and moocs are so prevalent out there that someone that wants to enter the ds field would have the own self drive to learn r or python and how to use tools like scikit learn or tensorflowhave you pick what i do not see from these courses is the fundamental understanding of some of the most basic maths and stats i just completed a round of interview and i looked at the person is github of their prior ds da projects they have self completed the code looked amazing their analysis was pretty standard i assumed they followed some sort of guide versus their own analysis never the less it gets you familiarized with techniques in the interview i asked what i consider simple questions like can you explain in laymen term what a linear regression or a trend line is what does an r value value mean indicate what is the shape of a normal distribution given a data set that you have never seen before how would you go about conducting eda i wanted to give him all the chances so i helped guide along the way to maybe jog his memory because i do not expect someone to know every single thing but i was so frustrated with the interview because no matter all the hints i could not get the right answers from the person also side note if anyone has tips of how to interview better i am all ears i just took a management level ds so i am totally new to this my barrier to entry and threshold is low because i am new so apply away and if you know the basics i will probably hire you lol more often than not courses focus too much on the coding coding is just a tool i could care less if you are an r or python or julia person i am a julia person but for funzies ascrummaster jiv de mag op is the type of person that requires years experience to get a entry level job no situation i have been asking what is the difference between standard deviation and standard error in ds interviews lately and almost no one can correctly answer it whitekreuz you know the issue is how people approach it memorizing a bunch of assumptions about models is useless though that is how some people approach it in these programs people need to build intuition around it or else the memorization is useless so what is more important is their thought process because that can at least show what connections they are making rather than regurgitating some crash course notes which you can always look up when needed it is intuition and connecting the dots that you cannot look up excitinghamsterpeople skip to python and data analytics courses without stats for data science course big mistake my masters degree at usc did not cover that detail i had to self teach after an embarrassing interview eezikwultoo i have been on my data science journey for a while now and one thing that i have come to realize is how important it is to have a community to support you it is not always easy and there will be times when you feel lost and overwhelmed but having a group of individuals who understand what you are going through can make all the difference for me one of the best places to find that community is on r datasciencedigest it is a subreddit where data science enthusiasts come together to share their personal journeys progress and insights it is a great place to get inspiration new ideas and to be reminded that you are not alone on this journey i highly recommend checking it out and sharing your own experiences it is a great way to learn from others and grow together mathelic it is because not there are so many things to remember in data science you understand it in depth but when an interviewer asks you you will not be able to recall everything joyloveroot not only can the modeling error have multi million dollar financial impacts they also could have public health or other social impacts it is sad to hear this question if obviously universities are not doing a good job of teaching this stuff and or university students do not have the proper mindset to internalize and be passionate about this domain of knowledge what would you recommend as the best way to learn this knowledge and be prepared to ace the interviews you are giving fantasticquestion this is a disappointing post you have not given a single example of anything specific eezikwultoo i have been on my data science journey for a while now and one thing that i have come to realize is how important it is to have a community to support you it is not always easy and there will be times when you feel lost and overwhelmed but having a group of individuals who understand what you are going through can make all the difference for me one of the best places to find

dangerous yellow if you are doing pure prediction then you do not actually need to know the regression assumptions but if you trying to measure causal effects then yes the ds really should know the regression assumptions i would also add that the ds should know about statistical significance power and effect sizes eunicyclist guass markov is literally irrelevant in most contexts individualwavetoo much plug and chug scannotron exams produce candidates with this kind of understanding intuition and true understanding are not demonstrated through words but practical application that is why a lot of companies have hands on coding interviews beyond the verbal exchange i think verbal questions should be used to screen communication skills and general speak eloquence or lack thereof technical competence should always be demonstrated hands on in tech there is no try there is only do or do not i had all that internalized from a bootcamp years ago but could not get an interview wah wah i have reported to multiple supervisors who insisted they were experts and did not know the basics that i did as a youngun like i know machine learning but not statistics i do not know how probability distributions work either ignorance should not be a cudgel earthrickc as a stats phd who was recently looking for a job i had the exact opposite problem very few employers cared that i knew the fundamentals they cared about experience with their tech stack and leetcode style interviews my math colleagues without a single statistics course between them got data analyst scientist positions while i struggled it is very shortsighted but i think data science programs are producing the type of candidates the market is demanding the attitude i experienced was that all that statistician crap like worrying about assumptions and scope of inference got in the way of results and progress sure it might blow up in your face next year but the numbers look great now obviously that is not a universal truth since i am employed and you are struggling to find candidates with a stats background but programs do not cover it because employers do not care they want the shiny new stuff not boring fundamentals that have been around for decades self inflicted wound of corporate culture and pay systems very few leaders care to really truly evaluate the performance of teams if they even can hard when you get weeks to review and have direct reports and are forced to reward on a curve of what is available they set up arbitrary systems based on things like education papers workers figure this system out and work on getting those papers rather than knowing the material universities figure out these customers are available and design courses that are basically overviews of everything deep into nothing that guarantees they keep paying till they get that paper they then use that to try to get the pay companies under pay the roles because they only get of what they are paying for therefore you are seeing people who are not really sold out on being a data scientist because the love it or because they are great at stats but because it pays for now they went and got the paper to make money no blame on them or you it is just the game so keep being vigilant and do not settlebut most importantly when you really do find a diamond in the rough pay them well and keep them arounddo not low ball them pay them based on the quality of the work they did on a multimillion dollar project that is important to you if we can blame anyone it is these crap mba programs that teach replaceability and pulling margin from employment no not everyone will be easily replaceable in your tech orgaccept that and save money in your bloated sales and marketing positions kinhomercial what were the questions precisely prize flow not surprised at the diversity of replies here this is always a controversial topic the main issue is that not all practitioners think that ds should be well scientific many professions have testing technical interviews processes so i do not see why ds needs to be an exception if it helps identity the candidates you want having said that if you are literally finding no one via this approach you may need to recalibrate jorrissss i by and large agree with the op with some caveats what i find more disturbing is how many data scientists think it is okay to have to look up literally everything did you guys learn anything if you internalize concepts you should not have to look up your fundamentals frequently i know the assumptions of linear regression though they are irrelevant to the predictive modeling i do and i do mostly expect most people should ramblinginternetnerd a lot of ds or business analytics programs teach you how to run code and where to run it and do not dig into how the code operates either that or they are from cs backgrounds which emphasize the computational aspects over statistical aspects of ds also why do i need to worry about violations of linearity when xgboost pretty much handles that because trees only care about localized averages in a hypercube i can understand there being value in writing ols models but it is really not that hard to teach someone how to apply a dozen or so transformations to data to deal with ols assumption violations i would be more worried about whether the person has experience maintaining code and dealing with semi structured data than whether or not they can take the cube root of a field that really seems to grow convolutionality can you give some examples of some questions i am a fresh ds under graduate bobdope is that a you mario is this a me optoplasm my theory tech related master programs especially online programs are a massive money maker for universities being online means they can easily scale them for larger numbers of students so admission to these programs is a pretty low bar compared to conventional ms programs or phd programs so people with dubious technical backgrounds rush through their year ms program pay their and hit the job market without extensive vetting or years of focus on the technical subject matter optimal asshole education standards dropped a bunch in causing many to pass due to a lower standard you may be seeing this in the fresh grads you are interviewing purplebrownupdown since you are here why do not you enlighten us on the assumptions required for regression altruisticgarbagei am curious if this is so important why do we need to code handle it manually precisely how will someone use these assumptions in their work to reject features or to have an excuse when their model fails in production if these assumptions are standard and important it is disappointing to see there is no systematic way to deal with them benmagz been there i have to say this had been a really interesting read my statistics knowledge is not enough to follow the entire discussion in depth it does not need be but i did take a few pointers for my own studies so thanks for that also having read your answers i wanted to add that you have the patience of a saint that was eye opening too terektus from the view of a fresh graduate not data science but i think this is universally appliable let me know if not in years you learn a ton of stuff from the fundamentals to the most complex models and newest technologies the problem is the fundamentals are teached in the first years when everything comes on top of that you just forget that stuff that does not mean the graduates do not know them they just forgot it and most of the times the only thing thats needed is to look it up and the knowledge is back again im an engineering graduate ask me about something basic like derivation rules and i will not be able to answer you its not that i am dumb or have no maths fundamentals the last years were just so focused on more complicated calculations methods and tools that i did not use them again so maybe next time when you are writing a job offer ask applicannots to prepare for fundamentals and the the knowledge which is needed for this job we have no practical experience we do not know what of the stuff will be needed later on and some guidance would really help to prepare and be successful in an interview the anxiety is high enough a little help on how to prepare would be great and you would see better results the best interviews i had i received the invitation with an agenda we will talk about a b c d and you can find more information here wwwabcdcom regression analysis is bullshit they do not even try to think about a problem no mental elasticity mbel_ perhaps you are looking for an economist instead of a data scientist traanquil why not commit to teaching people on the job littlebigmidget the best thing that course did was introduce james gareth is book it is a gold mine for simple explanations of complicated statistical methods none i think a big part of it is moocs like coursera that have taught a generation of people how to fit a statistics model using python if people were trained by writing a masters thesis and not just courses i think they would be in general more prepared eyyo_ think i am slowly realizing that is the route i am gonna go down how does one pivot to data engineering dischargedpikachu why can you please elaborate loudadand people fail to see that this is the true gold mine ladyemaskye i have never heard of data engineering what is the difference and how do you get in loudadi do not know if i am lucky or not as the work load is high but as a data scientist we literally do the engineering machine learning and deployment of our models so one has to be good at all but at least you have such diverse skill set it is incredible renokarchnmy the only person i knew who could recite fundamentals was a maths phd who did years in research and teaching who was pursuing a second masters in ds in an attempt to enter the commercial sector his problem was the opposite of ops he was getting stuck in assignments where marketing was trying to analyze survey responses but kept changing the prompts or interviews where the company was looking for a take home project that included neural nets and he was solving them with probabilistic methods to sufficient performance and using far fewer resources and time to them not land said job i just applied to many many data science positions and of them were not interested in academic level statistical details they were almost all looking for computer programmers who have experience with etl and a sprinkle of python ml not statisticians it honestly seems like op should be advertising for a statistician not a data scientist i am not saying it is more correct but there are probably swarms of cs pipeline ms grads applying to every job with the ds keywords if you want theoretical rigor the word statistician probably would scare those applicannots off none regression is one of the most fundamental tools we use in statistics and econometrics i do not expect people to know assumptions of every model in existence i expect people to be able to tell me correctly what happens if you have perfect multi collinearity what are the consequences of heteroskedasticity and non stationarity these are important conceptual aspects goodluckonyourexams who is justin sung gainzdalfthewhey exactly knowing everything at any moments notice is not really doable if you have to juggle coding stats python r sql tableu functions etc just have some due diligence to review your work and look at the assumptions and double check if something could be wrong mplang hire someone who did a years bachelor in stats and then a master in ml data science this is the key right here i honestly think that we need to see more bs in data science programs the purpose of a master is program is not to teach fundamentals so lots of people are graduating from those programs are graduating without mastery of the subject i have my bs in cs with a minor in math and am nearly finished with my ms in ds i hate to say it but many most of my current classmates will never see a day in the field an interest in spreadsheets and a decent undergrad gpa should not be enough to get you into one of these programs it is just a cash grab by the system thegreathomer yeah that is what i thought as well i think a recurring pattern i am seeing in the posts complaining about applicannots quality is the divide between how you learn stuff and how these interview questions are asked there is so much stuff you learn but in an interview a single of those thousands of things facts is singled out ib my masters i learned about different tools about cloud stuff about data and model parallelization about a million different nn model classes optimization lagrangian optimization variational optimization numerical optimization regression bayesian statistics and so on and so forth then you go into a job interview and get asked specific details about one single of all these i heavily agree with letting people know about what you want to ask them before the interview at least generally then you can always still go into questions about actual understanding none yes it does the skill sets we are looking for is more in the vein of econometrics regression analysis and its the main part of the job description for clarity we are not having any trouble finding people all that is going to happen is the job is likely going to a phd and not a masters i would have filtered you out we know candidates that are more looking to do nlp or build neural nets or gradient boosting models are not a fit for us and they will not stay even if we took a chance on them wouldatastoryteller i agree i did a few interviews last year and the amount of variation in the questions and topics preparing for interviews could be a full time job but i already have a full time job i just do not have time to brush up on every single topic i have learned the technical questions included sql and python code writing out probabilities defining various statistical terms and ml concepts answering questions about big o notation plus all the product business sense questions i get that this job can cover a lot of bases but there is so much information that you basically have to memorize and everyone asks something different so even if you review what you missed in your last interview the next company is probably going to ask something completely different rocketlabo it would obviously help with interview prep if the job description is upfront and clear about what the tech stack and the detailed nature of the job is unfortunately this is not always the case and the company ends up interviewing many unsuitable candidates sam man agreed hire based on if they know how to do the job and then teach them additional material what the company wants them to know the field is extremely broad and so new it is almost impossible to know it all plus they do not teach you the theory per say in grad school especially at a masters level currently in bioinformatics they are blazing through information so fast and there is literally so much to learn that understanding the general concept of the theory op is talking about is really all they are doing until they fully get into a career and learn as years go on nicksinghtechcareers i think data science interviews have big range but i do agree with op that knowing the ins and outs of regression should be table stakes for most data science roles for example there are like questions about regression in ace the ds interview alone just because it is such a common interview topic maxtothej not sure if one can prepare for all that stuff in an interview given the same depth sure you can just not in months in a few classes trying to stuff too much into too little time this is why ds shouldnt be thought of as an entry level position yyyyyyup very similar to my experience except i am biology not specifically statistics but the vast majority of government and corporate jobs do not care if you get your p values calculated just right they do not even want p values it is pretty much is this number going up or going down for most of the data science jobs i have seen and applied to knowing how to derive the specific assumptions of a model would be very unnecessary hiring managers seem to just want programmers who can plug in a few ml python packages none if you have a masters degree in anything related math stats econ our world would hire you i do not think where i work is any where less prestigious than apple or google the masters degree in our world is less of an hr requirement and more that this is what government wants from us as a minimum standard due to financial crisis xtrerk i agree with this wholeheartedly i am nearly finished with my ms and we spent very little time relatively on the assumptions side of things in most classes and a lot more time on understanding ml model development we essentially were taught eda preparing the dataset creating pipelines hyperparameter tuning for best results how to put it into prod inference did not matter for most classes only the model is insert score error against the test set i have worked at several places and every place has not cared about how we arrived at the prediction the model put out just how close they are to the real numbers when building models i will always review the basics and the assumptions but i am not going to memorize them now clearly these types of things matter a great deal for certain industries and products but if the business only cares about predictions and they want the error to be within a few points and auto arima or stepwise sarimax nails it with the validation and test set i am probably not going to spend a lot of time running through the acf pacf seasonal acf seasonal pacf adfuller kpss trying different variations of forcing stationarity because the model is most likely going to find the right pdq orders and i am juggling other projects none ml is the name of the game in certain industries its future is limited in others my world is one where the most ml is used for identifying a set of candidate variables and then it goes into a regression model or logistic regression people still have to have a proper rationale for which variables they use and be able to correctly justify that their model sound from a mathematics point of view i work and banking and how models are used by banks are heavily heavily regulated its different from tech companies insamity but violation of assumptions can affect cross validation results too and fixing the violations can give you a better overall model which would give you better predictions none we are looking explicitly for econometricians but were open to people with different pov as long as they can do the job there is not a big difference between ds statistician and quantitative analytics your building mathematical models with data the hard requirement for this job is you know regression again this post is not i cannot find good candidates its i am troubled by what i am seeing among certain types of candidates that i think should know this stuff and had it listed on their resume sheepheart yeah i guess actuaries would fit better in those types of roles chitinid agree somewhat oftentimes it is better to find candidates who have some statistical foundations and teach the data science none we do this for are large scale quantitative talent programs for internships and fresh grads we do not do presentations for teams i thin one of my issues here comes from the fact that our industry requires depth like its better to know regression and logistic regression well then know superficially know a bunch of modeling techniques in my world and a central aspect of our work is almost every aspect of the model building process is under regulatory scrutiny and contrary to popular belief phds that work at places like the federal reserve have more technical expertise then the ones in industry publishing academic papers and retaining academic expertise is a major part of their job this means that modeling teams have to be able to document and justify most aspects of their work upper management cares what regulatory agencies have to say the bank examination process looks at how banks are managing risks around their models and its a criteria banks are graded on in adequate controls can lead to c suite getting fired and or regulatory agencies fining banks or telling them they cannot do stock buy backs or pay dividends colinallbets op def suffers from consensus bias therealtiddlydump i think op is an expert on the skills they need in a new hire though none again someone assuming the knowledge they have is the most valuable knowledge in this field op is post reminds me of the infamous harmonic mean post maybe op is the same guy no i rarely post on forums about this kind of topic i do not really enjoy talking statistics outside of work i am simply frustrated with the level of candidates i have had to interview as an interview does take my time people can take whatever issues they want with what i am writing or they can learn from it i have been in the space a while and i know what my industry looks for my standards are not arbitrarily high these are the types of questions i was asked in most ic level jobs in my industrry i do not expect things to change anytime soon a question that i had while reading through the thread why is op even interviewing fresh grads for something so specific if they are not willing to teach coach why aim for the population that needs that guidance the most it sounds like a poor work environment and one that is looking to underpay for the skillset they desire globalmammoth i think for some applications it does matter knowing the assumptions and tools behind regression regression is a bit different from your traditional black box machine learning algorithm and there are some specific tools to work with it that average data science person may not know for example the heteroskadicity assumption of regression tells you that the residuals should be uncorrelated with predictions and that you should check for it looking at residual plots this tool is specific for regression and it allows you to assess if you have chosen the adequate features for prediction or not apart from that regression in many cases is focused on parameter estimation instead of prediction so knowledge in topics like experimental design and causality are quite important to avoid spurrious correlations there is a correlation between the nobel prices that a country has and it is chocolate consumption but anyone saying that to increase research production of a country you should eat more chocolate is a fool this example is quite obvious and exagerated but spurrious correlations could also happen in less obvious scenarious and being aware about them matters when working with regression i think all of this tools are not that hard and can be learned fast but i understand that for some jobs you may be searching for someone that already has this knowledge because hiring someone that does not understand this and other problems may lead to them doing things overconfidently wrong and slowing down projects none you probably do not work in a bank i do i am conducting interviews for a role at a bank the job description requires regression regression is what the hired person will be doing and building models that do not have mathematical flaws is part of the job description if they fail it their model probably will not be deployed and the models are probably being used for capital allocation or stress testing and is under scrutiny by audit teams and bank regulators oh said auditors and regulators have phds in stats or econometrics none i agree with this there are plenty of jobs that do not require you to that make a good salary which is why i also ask why do you want this specific job i am not working at a tech company i really could care less what you think about regression modeling they are used widely in my industry who is using them oh quant teams at jp morgan wells fargo bank of america citi bank capital one pnc and pretty much every major bank i also know that most people at these banks do ask the same sorts of questions i do i have interviewed or worked at all of these places in the function auspiciousapple it sounds like a case of i learned this in uni back in the day so everyone who does not know this specific thing is an idiot savethepandabears i do not get this sense at all the gm assumptions are foundational for good robust inferential lr models and you better have at least a passing familiarity of what they are what the consequences of violating them are and how to address them when they are violated i get the sense that the role op is hiring for places less emphasis on the predictive side of modeling and more emphasis on inference and as such is fully justified in asking questions about issues that specifically affect a model is inferential ability none i am asking the same kinds of interview questions i have been asked the candidates just lacked depth in the main thing we are looking for phds we interviewed did not have these issues thats because a phd involves writing a dissertation where they have to address modeling issues i think a lot of people are under the impression we are interviewing candidates that are bad fits the candidates i am interviewing are supposed to have this background cocodirichlet it is not everyone should know what the gauss markov assumptions are and happens if you violate them it is not a vague question to ask what at the assumptions of this model and how would you find out of this assumption is violated or what happens if this assumptions is violated and what would you do about it paramedic i am getting the same vibe bakochba i suppose it depends on seniority of the position if i am hiring recent grads i do not expect them to be experts i am looking for someone that i can assign work and they are able to become experts by diving deep into those models none one of the thing i think to recognize is i work in a bank so are roles are pretty well defined model development in bank generally falls under umbrella of quant fiance that includes stuff pure ds ai folks do in a bank i posted this here and not in r quantfinance because to me building regression models for a bank is closer to ds than it is algorithmic trading or pricing a derivative and thats what they talk about it none i think for clarity this was a vent post observation and not really we are having a trouble finding or selecting candidates the job will probably just end up going to someone with a phd the candidates i interviewed on paper look like they actually they have the essential skill sets and my interview questions were along the lines explain to me what regression is and how you calculate an ols estimator minimize sum square errors is all i was looking what are some of the main assumptions of the ols model which assumptions are needed for gauss markov what assumptions are needed for the estimates to be unbiased what happens if you have perfect multi collinearity i have a regression explanatory variables ln wage intercept educ age age is age an example of a multicolinear variable how do you test for heteroskedasticity the name of any test is enough what happens if you have heteroskedasticity will your ols estimates change what should you do if you have heteroskedasticity what does it mean for a time series variable to be stationary what are risks if we have non stationary variables in a regression model what are some ways we can detect non stationary and my standard was is the person mostly on the right track and i did not expect them tto get all the questions most only got the first two and after that everything fell apart i literally got answers like i would use the wrong r package sdric the last point hits the spot you do not have to know everything but you have to know where you can find it as my grandfather used to say though ild add and understand it universities these days teach a variety of different skills including implementing those models in different programs like stata r or excel i think the mistake op makes here twenty years ago we learned this all by heart yes you did but you did not have a jungle of different software back then you learned that along the way equivalently people these days are schooled in a wider field and used to a set of different tools which arguably takes priority over learning things by heart that can be found on google within less than seconds maybe i am biased because i am an it auditor first and data analyst second but the sheer amount of knowledge i need is simply too much to store in any human brain especially when i have to be able to design a test in any topic reaching from iam over data management to cyber security bcm etc etc for any software and manuell process at piss poor data quality within hours while knowing the applicable regulation for compliance tests on top of my mathematical statistical tests in short knowing where to find the solution or instructions and having the ability to understand it in order to address a problem within minutes is what makes me extraordinary in my job now if you are at a bank as op is as a pure data analyst especially for as long as he seems to have been there is a good chance that he is been doing the same tasks in the same applications for the erm team over and over for decades that is not bad but it is a limited scope of applications of a small subset of very specific data science skills it is great that he is a dedicated specialist in his niche but that is not a reasonable way to teach students these days given that the real world application of data science has widened and the number of tools has become countless you ca not expect somebody coming from the university to be perfect cheap labor you have to train them in what is relevant for your individual niche i bet a lot of them are great and quick in what they do especially in the tools they studied on they just do not have experience with the requirements of op is daily business demand yet i am sure that maybe not most but many will overfulfil what op demands within just a few months of refreshing the theory of the subset of methods that is most relevant in their field and seeing them applied on real cases the issue is rather that students are not given a chance anymore and even if they are many workplaces are not willing to educate anymore then you have mangers who wonder why they struggle to find workers and come to reddit to complain about it instead none it matters i work in a bank one that is on the top of everyones list if they do not break in too faang models we build required detailed testing on assumptions conceptual design and detailed documentation my world is one where model documents and the model building process is audited and closely examined by regulators and those regulators have phds if they are not happy the c suite gets into trouble do not think this is data science then why does faang data science keep trying to poach our talent none no they are not scale and volume that data work with has changed statistics and mathematics has not changed you are trying to fit mathematical models to data you need to know how the framework your using works and what your data generating process works and how you would estimate parameters with your given modeling framework people who write this kind of stuff are the ones that probably will not have long careers knowing computational tools is limited you learn one language well enough its easy enough to move to another but actually knowing what your doing is essential in this case the tool of the job is regression savethepandabears he is referring to the gauss markov assumptions that make ols the best linear unbiased estimator blue where best means lowest sampling variance tlinearity the dependent variable is represented as a function of independent variables that are linear in parameterststrict exogeniety no endogeneitytno perfect multicollinearitythomoskedastity and no autocorrelation in error termstoptional error terms are normally distributed this implies the beta estimators are normally distributed and is primarily used for hypothesis testing none for me the issueis then are you being selective enough with job descriptions and must haves for interview why not just say we are looking for people with either these specific masters phds or relevant experienc we are people do not seem to get that this post is about people who on paper look like they should know this topic none if your talking about google the company i do not care about their opinion about regression assumptions they are not publishing research papers in top statistics journals if your talk about googling someone who knows actually understands what assumptions do actually knows which ones need to be made for what properties of the model what assumptions need to be made for the regression estimator to be unbiased what about for consistency and what about for efficiency the additional assumptions are mostly nice to haves cocodirichlet the assumptions are the same it is just that different authors write them in a different way some combine into also some separate the necessary and the sufficient ones prestigioussortyes but op is interviewing students right out of college so who he is recruiting based on what ve needs based on what he deems is foundational and the risks of failure does not make any sense rather than blaming it on the candidates accountability that they are poorly recruiting would be more actionable op either needs to be more intentional in recruiting pay more to get a phd as if every phd would know this but okay or design the job with an entry level candidate in mind this is clearly not an entry level job why interview candidates right out of college none yep you nailed it its a quant risk dev position at a top place to have on your resume for this space this was a vent post i am seeing mfes and stat adjacent degres from ivy league schools not know this stuff given the tech down turn the initial pool of applicannots hr sends includes a lot of people that want to be in faang but apply here because we are hiring i have tried to filter those candidates but the trend i am complaining about is that our traditional candidates are looking more like those none this position is specifically an econometrics position i posted here since it seemed more on topic than in r quantfinance the one masters candidate that did make it through did an ma in econ and not from the ivy league place most of my disappointment with the interviews i have done is basically people not knowing regression at the level the first few chapter of wooldridges undergrad text and these are people that listed regression time series as a skill anyway if your us based send me a dm i will not reveal the posting now but if none of the candidates make it through the next round i will send you the link aussiepunmaster i tested my gardener in how to make shovels idiot did not know how to make one optimal asshole any chance you could give a more specific example i am curious what specifically goes on in these degrees none we do not even accept masters of ds cs econ quant finance stats math mathematical finance the cs and quant finance tend to have the worst training none if your interviewing a job where the primary ting is building regression models then its not unreasonable for people to review regression none so i will answer the second part of your comment first most of the people on our team and in our group can estimate parameters for linear regression from a matrix vector multiplication perspective for more context our group is percent phd and the masters probably took econometrics with linear agebra most at a minimum know that the ols estimator is bxx xy where x is the data frame y is the response variable yes i have had to code these estimators manually they were part of my graduate coursework the first part of your comment is part of the issue the cash grab from universities is a problem and i think they are doing their students a disservice littlestationjaque bera test none nice post i have a brash personality its not for everyone but its served me well you nailed what i am getting at fairly well none i know my question to you is why not do that ms in stats people like you belong on the dev team also logistic regression is the standard for credit default modeling its what almost every major bank in the us uses for default modeling i have built models on this stuff that are applied to billion dollar portfolios so what do i know none i am a phd in economics this is a quant risk role at an industry leading bankthe position is explicitly econometrics i posted here because i feel like quant risk is more related to ds then what they are posting in r quantfinance this is an associate level role romanriesen ml models are changing the world causality analysis and robustness is for nerds who cannot handle the awesomeness of transformer based networks s but seriously op should just restrict his search to people with econometrics experience bothwaysitgoes most ds people do not do econometrics they may do stuff like a b testing and for some such roles knowing how to apply poisson bootstrapping to optimize calculation of your t statistic if far more important than knowing which assumptions you violate when you calculate it all of them none i think your opinion on average is unbiased d cocodirichlet it is not unfair the assumptions are in every book on linear regression and generalized linear models cocodirichlet i do not even see them tested in most academic papers i have reviewed when you reviewing papers within a specific field and within a niche topic everyone knows the generalities of the data if you are doing regression with survey data you are not going to run every potential diagnostic for every assumption because it is rather obvious that some cannot violated on the other hand if the paper uses economic data of the last years obviously there will be time series related problems and probably heteroskedasticity so you are expecting that to be dealt with a common complain of reviewers is that appendices are getting longer and longer and i have seen some that are like pages long and on top of that many journals now ask for all replication materials to be public so it is not true very few folks care about assumptions none see in my world we would not interview you and we know that people like you do not have the technical depth your looking for we also know that different fields use statistics in different ways and have different degrees of technical training and not everyone needs the same training in fields where you can run experiments and the experiments are well designed you do not usually need to care as much about the assumptions in my world you do its not my personal view models you build are going to be scrutinized by outside parties which are going to ask you to show that your model satisfy that modeling assumptions bothwaysitgoes tbh that explains why quantitative psychology as an academic field has such low reputation optimal asshole yeah this thread just randomly popped in my feed and it is not giving me a good impression of the subreddit lmao 2fast2smart2pretty i remember trying to use the kolmogorovsmirnov test on real world data and realised that no data is ever really normal so instead i built a simple test to make sure the data was normal enough just plotting a histogram and observing the shape is easy enough but i initially wanted to use ks to automate the task and was surprised every data set failed none most candidates i passed was someone with a phd and none of them were from elite schools phds just did not have this issue and thats probably because a phd requires carrying out an independent research project and then defending to a panel of experts its not something you get by showing up to class none do you have a masters degree and live in the us dm me i cannot guarantee your interview as we already have candidates that we are proceeding with but if they strike out i can possibly link you the posting none i agree with this this is a product of ds being to buzz worthy but as it is we are not interviewing people with ms in ds we are interviewing people who are supposed to be specialized in this topic but what is happening a bit is that those programs are becoming mor ds 2fast2smart2pretty just read one of the statistics books mentioned none independent and identically distributed none lol thats why we look at masters and phds with no work experience none its a mix of both universities are trying to cash in ds ml trends and candidates in their rush try more to look like the candidate silicon valley want we are screening to weed out candidates that whose main goal is to use our name to go to faang the best way to prepare for any technical interview is to review the relevant technical skills for that job from a text book point of view no ones going to ask you to solve math problems but they will check your conceptual understanding for people who do know this thing it takes about minutes to really know how well someone knows it none programming computational tools you use are going to change over the course of careers but statistics is ultimately a branch of mathematics and underlying mathematics and concepts are not rapidly evolving and largely have remained the same for decades what i am saying is that graduates do not know these things conceptually as well as they should i know most of the candidates are not dumb they managed to get into the best universities in the world they are poorly trained in things they should know and yes that is a product of a current trends the reality bites hard when you start being in place where there are real stakes i cannot trust someone to be working on models without a baseline knowledge on models that are effectively used to inform decisions of portfolios with about trillion dollars worth of assets you mean an introduction to statistical learning as one of these recent master is ds graduates from a top ranked program i can give you some context that might help understand some of what you are seeing the tech stack and theory taught in these programs is vast experimental design nlp time series cv and everything in between as well as learning the cloud compute stack to boot it is easy to get spread thin while phds have those extra years for theory application some like me focused more on dl or mle others did time series or mlops applicannots with statistical or analytics employment backgrounds or those whose theses capstones were regression centric spark based causal inference etc may yield better results you know when i did knew most of these interview questions when i was taing undergrads i do not remember most of these by heart i unashamed of saying it literally takes me seconds to check the book since i passed the comps i stopped memorizing there are few questions i ask which are more specific three pet peeves are sampling strategies how to handle heavily imbalanced data ways to impute missing data and i want to see a candidate to slow down think and a lot of it depends i am not scared of people who panic and slow the fuck down i am scared of people hitting the ground running at spiritedmulberryagreed it is a shame for those of us that have suffered through a thesis or even ghostwritten dissertations and are jobless quaternionham those masters were from statistics apprehensive fox exactly this i did a masters in econ prior to getting into a masters in data science so the econ masters was an academic degree where i learned my concepts mainly because i was actually required to pore over a text book sadly that degree had little marketable value not much coding skills taught and i could not get a job in this field after graduation i was shocked at how easily people fit models without thinking about the assumptions we were supposed to care about in the text book the current degree in data science is a professional degree it does not teach me that much theory it goes over in the slides but definitely more employer friendly skills generally i am thinking of pivoting into data engineering as well after wasting years learning statistics trying to become a data scientist defiantrecipein excel r prady mlops none data engineering is more about coding they build the infrastructure for ds data collection and model deployment they may also do implimentation of an already estimated model it requires very different skills from ds ds does not require people to be good at coding data engineering does this so so much they want to hire an expert in shiny ml shit but wo not accept anything less when their precious domain specific problem does not call for shiny ml any more than a nerf gun dart calls for a nuke in retaliation simpler easier to implement easier to debug frequently faster to train and execute too but i am only an expert not some mba who knows all things that hit their voluminous bottom uh line none all of our phd candidates knew the fundamentals and one of the masters degree candidates this is a job located in usa but the people with masters degree on our india and european team do know it at the standard i am asking i expect people to be able to tell me correctly what happens if you have perfect multi collinearity what are the consequences of heteroskedasticity and non stationarity funny enough i am almost done with my program and those subjects that you mentioned were barely even covered in my regression class if any at all in my university program they try to cover a wide variety of subjects and simply do not have the time to go in depth in each and every one of them in most cases the prof has to speed run through the materials near the end of the semester for me as a student i just tried to at least be familiar with all those topics so i could pass the course i simply do not have the time or the energy to experiment and go in depth on any of those topics myself if it is not required in the class assignments projects but hey i am kinda dumb so maybe you just happened to interview dumb candidates like myself spiritedmulberryfrantically draws a singular matrix on a bar napkin sorry what does non stationarity have to do with regular old regression lawfulmuffin smh did not include harmonic mean yannbouteiller they will tell you that heteroskedasticity is not an issue as long as you use an rnn for your regression unless we do not call regression the same thing of course heyiambob we covered these in detail my econometrics course for my ds masters ofc useful to know in an interview and it is vitally important to recognize these issues in an interview though it is tough to just pull the more detailed aspects from memory these are concepts that we had to memorize for the exam but otherwise were always referencing our notes alongside assignments as anyone else would irl perhaps you could show them plots and ask them to identify the issue and how to correct it in simpler terms you would have more viable candidates and can focus on selecting a personality you would want to work with as opposed to who looked over their flashcards more recently though it sounds like your candidates have not had much of a clue of even the basics so understand the frustration nocampthese things were covered and tested for in year of my economics degree i find it hard to believe that econ grads cannot answer those questions i knew people doing business related phds with regression modelling who had never heard of heteroskedasticity though seems like you are interviewing the wrong people then what you are looking for are people who graduated from a classical statistics department because the approach is totally different classical statistics strong assumptions on the data specialized models that take advantage of these assumptions modern ml weak assumptions on the data generic models that take advantage of large amounts of data hedgethehedgehedge speaking from the perspective of an undergrad currently studying at ucl we covered these topics extensively on my course surprised to see so many unfamiliar here i thought they were essential xt in all the education and work experience i have had hearing these words can still be intimidating because stats was not my main focus these words but not their intent are easily forgotten about unless i am speaking in terms with my coworkers like a statistician there is going to be a communication barrier no clue chasinggreenroads fair good luck and thanks for the response whereyugoincityboy you need to hire people with economics degrees and teach them how to code they force everyone to learn gauss markov senior year at pretty much every school the data scientist those people are like of data science candidates though that is the skillset that is most in demand and therefore the skillset the universities emphasize i am not sure you should be getting snarky just because you have a niche application and the rest of the industry does not cater to that rehoboam i would be very clear in the job description that rigorous academic mathematical knowledge is a core competency for the role technical skills does not mean that for most ds ramblinginternetnerd so basically someone who did stats econ for undergrad i did a bunch of that age year old me could write a math proof on why ols is blue i have never really benefitted from being able to do matrix algebra calculus though nicksinghtechcareers preparing for an interview is def a grind luckily there def are some common patterns out there for how data science interview questions get asked but yeah the range of stuff you need to know is brutal for sure ramblinginternetnerd it is a crazy amount in some degrees and evaluations can be all over the place my final round interview feedback at facebook strong technicals weak non technicals was the opposite of my final round interview feedback at amazonweak technicals strong non technicals even though i mostly prepped for non technicals for facebook and mostly prepped for technicals before amazon the breadth is huge you basically need to be able to do most of an swe interview most of a product manager interview the entirety of a product data analyst interview a good chunk of an mle or de interview you do not need to be as deep as any one person but you are doing of the prep for things acrobatic interesting have a digital version electricgypsyat haha i ordered the copy of this book btw keen to read on it and compare with my own notes luisbitme coming out of school graduating at the top of my cohort with an ma in economics i could not land a data analyst or data science role i have gotten into a role in causal inference now that i am in my second job but i do not think it is nearly as much of a sure thing as you make it sound unable that is honestly my plan i have a great job now but i do not have a master is expensive i figured doing an ms in data analysis science or ms business analytics cannot decide which but i do have fantastic work experience with promotions every year and increasing responsibility self learning on my own time i am not sure what the tech world is looking for anymore it is kinda stressful and whiplashing ohthatlookscool fair enough it may just be wise to try to differentiate does not know stats from does not recall this specific bit of trivia they might not have needed to recall it for what years like the harmonic meme formula is pretty trivial but we all meme on that one guy who insisted every candidate must be able to recite it cold it might be helpful to either give them a heads up before the interview that you will be discussing a regression model or just talk through the problem generally so they can encounter the problems and identify them much more important skill imo bakochba my advice as a hiring manager is to send a dataset and let your candidates create the model and ask them to give you a presentation explaining how they selected the variables that way you are not dealing with people nervous during an interview and you can see how they would perform under normal circumstances fifapointsman but there is a big difference ds people do not care about regression models since they just throw xgboost on every problem in my statistics classes i learnt all of the stuff you mentioned but i have never seen a ds course which spends more than minutes on regression models bakochba i understand in pharma it is the same way it is highly regulated and one of the questions i have is specifically around considerations when working for data like blinding documentation for audits etc i think if you are hiring experienced people then your questions are very reasonable if you say you are working with regression models you should have a fundamental understanding of them or at least be able to explain it like you would to a regulator during ab inspection that is just bread and butter for anyone in the industry i used to ask some basic data design questions that i thought were extremely easy by and even experienced people struggled at the interview that is when i moved it to a presentation op is the type of person that requires years experience to get a entry level job wouldarkshenron most of the fundamental knowledge can be gained through a simple google search as long as the candidate is strong in their chosen area of expertise and display the capability to learn new knowledge as needed i would consider them for roles in my org this is especially true for entry levels the ds field is too vast and no one knows everything as i mentioned someone very knowledgeable in state of the art nlp would not necessarily have too many opportunities to internalise the statistics of regression test people for what they know and their capability to learn you can also learn from the fact that you have an issue with the product of many different graduate school programs in statistics you could be looking for candidates that you could easily teach coach instead you are punishing people for your frustration with a slew of different programs instead of considering that your approach may be flawed you are part of the problem aggravatingpudding oh look at mr fancypants overhere he works on the bank that explains a lot of things for me biogeopaleochem building models that do not have mathematical flaws is part of the job description can you describe for me a specific example of a mathematical flaw you would expect from someone who cannot answer that question in an interview astronomaestro i do not work at a bank but i do a lot of analytical statistics if the description mentions regression then asking about it would then be testing to see if they prepared which would be useful to see i do think it is still a bit superfluous to ask about regression if the job really is that important would not you want to see evidence they can build such a model even if it is just with toy data doing so would retroactively show you if they understand regression on the other hand if they have never been in a bank setting like this or have no experience outside of academia coursework i would not actually fully trust them to do any important task until they gain experience and prove they can do it right in a work setting even if you think it is a simple task i have worked in academia awhile and i guarantee you that most of the skills that are taught are pretty useless socialdatascience that is fair and i could not care less about fintech you get paid to work for some of the greediest and corrupt entities in the world that take their profits and change the laws in their favor while contributing little to nothing to humanity keep making money i am sure it is all worth it in the end dylantmb it is like what do you want from me as a data scientist if i have not used a model in a while i will look up the assumptions and review and check if something is going wrong all look for things related to assumptions as well as other data quality issues this is not stuff you need at the top of your fingers anymore you should want someone who asks the right questions can present ideas and can write maintainable code understatedpies times are changing those phds that you so carefully mentioned about times in this thread both on the bank is and the regulator is side most likely studied stats and data science from a completely different curriculum years back from when recent grads went through theirs the field is saturated for sure but i would be careful to just assume that people are getting dumber lazy or that unis got no idea what they are doing anymore as others mentioned here the focus of the programmes shifted to cater to the market and there is no point memorising stuff that can and should be googled in minutes when someone decides to model some data your this should be fundamental knowledge in the field and therefore known by heart idea is an outdated point of view for the kind of things you mentioned but if in this specific role these are essentials just put them in the jd with the same wording candidates will know that they need to know these for the interview because this will be more important to you than what is your biggest achievement in terms of generated business value where you used a regression model that most companies would ask them i do not think you realise how small the portion of the job market is that is interested in the required skill set and lexical knowledge you mentioned grads have no incentive to prepare for it without knowing for sure it is needed faang interviews might be a shitshow but at least candidates know what they need to do to be considered bothwaysitgoes the candidates that are supposed to have this background do not come from data science masters they come form economics and statistics masters ortan9gardens i feel like a ms in stats ds is going to know remember more about glms than a phd in stats ds at the same time your questions on matrix invetability heteroskedasticity etc are not unreasonable maybe for a softer science where glms are a high level skill i can see the phds outperforming ms for glm trivia maxtothej agree but i totally expected a fair chunk of this subreddit to react to op with how dare you test my knowledge xelaxander these questions are quite specific to statistics as a mathematician i can have a guess at most of them but heteroskedasticity never once appeared in any of our text books even with a strong stochastics focus i like some of them and not some others i actually ask my candidates to program out a log likelihood function in the interview but i do provide the density function none there is a foundational level knowledge people should have to do any kind of technical work you cannot google your way out of problems you do not know you have or if you do not know what the problem is there is a standard we expect people to know and they are not unreasonably high majority of the phd candidates we interview meets them its most of the masters candidates do not we are not struggling to find workers we have a name people want it on their resume do not think this is data science then why does faang data science keep trying to poach our talent because you are cheap banks are known for that and also are too close minded you are just the result of a bank mentality i bet you got rejected from a faang interview goodluckonyourexams models we build required detailed testing on assumptions i said that matters do not think this is data science no what else would it be iuse3seashells i am in the same industry and you have got a lot of growing up to do start looking at skills and interviewing for coachability you can teach someone gm theorem in a week colinallbets besides being a pretentious prick about it you are just wrong data generation and parameter estimation have a role to play in the subset of applied mathematics your job requires_ but it is not important for many modern modeling tasks nowadays there is a whole swath of statistical methods and associated tools to perform post hoc_ analysis of model behavior that have broadened the acceptable set of model architectures and development processes mathematics stays the same as you said but the application of mathematics through technology is constantly evolving your econometrics models are no exception source i work with mrm teams in banks the broader financial services industry insurance insurance tech and many other companies to help them with model development and validation i do not have a phd in statistics but my masters did_ cover the topics that you are over rotating on i am not bullshitting nor is my career at risk because i maintain this opinion quite the opposite adapt or fade into irrelevance bothwaysitgoes in the past people used to get linguistics degrees and create elaborate language models with their knowledge nowadays people just throw the whole internet into transformers and get chatgpt without even invoking chomsky is name once things change the same thing now requires a totally different toolset what is happening in data analysis in general is similar what is there to learn about assumptions of gradient boosting you just throw data and do cross validation it is a very different subject now even though it is not applicable in your subfield profkimchi there is a reason i asked op and not you no offense also number is not required for hypothesis testing bothwaysitgoes assumptions of ols barely means anything ols is just a procedure the only assumptions you need for consistency is that the errors are orthogonal to regressors and that there is no perfect multicollinearity in regressors various extra assumptions will give you various different properties nadia world hehe linearity is wrong it is not linear in independent variables lol ghostofkilgore i get that that is your expectation but if you are so frustrated by the low hit rate at interviews i am suggesting you think about being even more selective for example if you are finding that people with masters in ds are not cutting it just do not interview them sorry they actually are yeah i mean sometimes you are stuck based on the level you were approved to hire at ie you were approved to hire an analyst but really you want to hire an associate or avp in the job ranking parlance of many us banks so hr keeps sending you people who want an analyst role and you are dismayed that you would have to do a lot of work to get these people up to speed but i agree it is just a normal problem with new graduates if it were me and i had to hire somebody at that level because of constraints at my company and people were repeatedly coming to the interview unprepared i would tell the recruiters to screen people by phone and literally tell them to prepare those specific concepts before the real first round interview at least then i would find out who listens to directions and who does not yeah now that this is buried i will say it is not surprising that you got so many downvotes since a ton of people maybe even a majority in this subreddit are students or people looking to get into data science related data fieldsit is natural that they will read a post like this and get defensive because they see themselves as the person you are venting about also the vast majority prospects in this subreddit are the ones gunning for roles in big tech and they just legitimately are not aware of the difference in rigor and documentation between building an ad model for facebook vs building a risk model at a bank there is nothing wrong with the former but it is a just an entirely different thing than the latter azdatasci hmm well my program started with some basic fundamentals calculus review but how it applies in statistics and covering all major distributions there were two courses on probability applications the went into estimations testing confidence intervals and computer simulations we then had classes on regression models multivariate analysis non parametric methods data visualization generalized regression models experimental design mixed models statistical learning data mining applied bayesian statistics machine learning and statistical consulting these are the high level topics in the order they were delivered all courses up front started with theoretical and covered things like assumptions building on each topic then going into applications where we used r machine learning was python but you could easily apply it in r the structure was to learn everything you needed in order to understand the what and why of the application and the did the how applying it to real data in r or python the statistical consulting and experimental design was really interesting those provided with a deep knowledge of how to interact with clients and consult on experiment design so analysis can be performed based on the clients expectations oh there was also a course on quantitative reasoning my friends who too the ds program was heavily focused on applications but to be honest it was so high level and basic it did not expose any scenarios if the gotchas you do come across also a lot of it was writing responses on basic concepts in short she learned how to apply different applications logistic regression linear regression mixed models non parametric methods and lots of data mining and wrangling topics this was all basic stuff in r and writing responses very high level application not really and theory and almost not this is why i am using this particular method from a pure data perspective it sort of taught a lot of concepts but left out the connections thus a lack of education on why you would you certain things based on evidence you would derive in the process of the analysis when i showed her a few things some light bulbs went off and she said they never made those connections during the program in short it was showing the how but no theory or education on the why this is a recurring theme i have seen across many ds degree holders it seems they are heavy on data mining wrangling and building basic model not a lot of testing assumptions model validation or ability to explain why a model did what it did now this might just be the candidates i have interviewed but others i speak with in other areas of my company complain about the same thing our model risk management team is constantly having to reject models since a lot of them lack evidence to support their implementation and they cannot answer reasonable questions like you data suggests it was appropriate to implement an a type model but you chose a b type model why did you do that or your data were imbalanced how did you handle that before building your model and you chose to balance your data this way why did you choose that method over some other option sometimes they try and talk through it other times it is just a deer in the headlights therealtiddlydump i guess that is not surprising since they would have different skillsets the honest truth though is that if you want people to do statistics you need to narrow the search to people trained in statistics otherwise the trend is to let ml bleed into the curriculum since you can hand wave more stuff when your goal is predict x gud renokarchnmy what did you expect from cs though pcbuildpro that is because cs is a broad degree and not something super focused it seems to me that vast majority of companies advertise entry lvl positions with last line saying years of experience required and then they pop a surprise pikachu face when a ton of recent grads apply maybe companies should consider training recent grads and after they get there skill wise pay them so they are not poached by the largest tech companies who double their salary overnight none i do a lot of interviews as well and ask similar questions even though off the top of my head it would be difficult for me to out all the assumptions and the mathematical basis each i also have had to code estimators manually throughout coursework as well including fully developed packages and aced all my courses i just have terrible recall at work though it does not matter the learning is still there and the material can be found easily when you are interviewing it should not be an academic test it is about finding who will perform best at the role which requires give and take give them a nudge and get their brain flowing see how they talk about regression have a discussion about assumptions do not just ask them quiz questions you will get a better sense of ability than just asking the questions alternatively you mentioned that you are equivalent to faang and are hiring phds i assume your budget is between probably closer to so target individuals with specific research background edit you also have to realize interviewing can be a completely different environment than working i do not have to think about regression assumptions while working i just test them naturally the stimulus of working on the problem helps me remember naturally you should foster that in an interview none deleted none deleted loaderd so if you have data points you are still using jb lol that is why i applied to graduate schools this year i am doing that ms in stats and screening for statistical rigor in data science teams when i interview my red flags are a we pride on a diversity of backgrounds and an interdisplinary data science unit b we do not worry about the technicals too much just worry about providing value if i have to fight tooth and nail to find my first job out of grad school with a team of ms and phd level statisticians then so be it i will even work with econometrics people but i am done working with these pseudo quantitative backgrounded people who claim they are data scientists when they cannot even justify to me why to choose one model over another none we mostly are but with some all the lay offs in tech you can imagine how new grads are fairing right now banks are not really effected by this and so you can imagine how many applicannots we are getting prestigioussortand because they are readily available if needed most data scientists do not have them memorized hence why its unfair to expect it if the candidate gets prepped saying they want an expert in regression and we will test it then that is a different case but this is not foundational knowledge for the majority of ds out there snowmaninheat good point about the open science movement i think we will see a bit more scrutiny going forward because of it and it will be for the better snowmaninheat i have been working in research for years so i am not sure what you mean by my lack of technical depth as i said previously i am perfectly capable of testing those assumptions if the stakeholder requests and in your case they do in my case my stakeholder will probably want results in six hours usually businesses prioritize speed over precision and because of that i am not likely to study assumptions of lr before a data science interview in fact most career coaches warn phds not to go into these things in interviews because doing so makes us look like we are missing the forest for the trees now if your job ad says deep theoretical knowledge of logistic regression is required then your criticism is fair but my guess is that you do not put that in your job ad and the candidates who come are prepared to talk about the impact of their work in any case i do not think our personalities would mesh so no harm in not interviewing me or people like me whatever that means have a nice night renokarchnmy you might be seeing the difference between terminal masters and those intended to drive into phd programs mine did not have a thesis but it was an optional track besides research and just a heavier course load we still covered residual analysis heavily in regression and had to do formal write ups no less than times that term after exhaustive regression analyses i do not remember every detail and maybe could piece together answers to your questions but every day i am not doing residual analysis of a regression i forget a little bit more post grad school wiscodiscowarrior that does not surprise me they gotta publish a thesis and put a lot of thought into a research topic that they can measure quantify objectively sad ad thank you yes i do and i am currently pursuing phd i am in the us currently cloudmadeofcandy yay i was correct d joyloveroot thanks for the response i suppose the interviewees then have another level of unpreparedness they do not even realize what the fundamentals are or they do not realize that a decent interviewer will ask them about the fundamentals so it is kind of a deficit in common general professional skills as well which goes even a bit beyond the specific context of data science luisbitme if he does mean islr i feel like it skips over assumptions and math like crazy as someone with a masters in economics it was great for getting me familiar with the prediction side of things rather than just causal inference and time series but it hardly gives a comprehensive view of the math etc if you are unfamiliar with it energeticbean following for when you get an answer littlebigmidget yes i do none yes this is what we surmised the candidates are covering a lot of topics and not learning anything in depth phds thesis project requires them to specialize and learn what they do well what i have proposed is having our hr person tell the masters candidates that they should be prepared for a technical screen on regression and basic time series i did my undergrad in ds and now doing a masters at a top school in ds i am not trying to toot my own horn but another thing i observed was in project groups out of groups will be carried by one person and group will have a decent mix of contributors in some semesters i would be backpacking up to project groups did you ever experience this i did my undergrad in stats and i was surprised by how introductory were my last years courses even those who were cross listed for the master is degree fortunately these courses had lenghty assignments and big end of term projects instead of exams but the amount of information is insane so many topics to cover im atually looking to di a masters degree to go more in depth in some topics this thread kinda scares me that the master is programs will also not be in depth enough lol porknjellybeans i have a cheat sheet that i use as a quick reference and just do not commit to memory i am with you in interviews i value hearing someone is approach how they break things down what they do when they are stuck and how they prevent errors those things are sometimes coachable sure but i need to hear where the gaps are none your response would be perfect i was not asking for perfection from people i literally told me if you do not remember something its okay to say i would need to review this instead what i got is people did not know something and they just said the wrong answer and kept going maxtothej you know when i did knew most of these interview questions when i was taing undergrads i do not remember most of these by heart i unashamed of saying it literally takes me seconds to check the book since i passed the comps i stopped memorizing i think the issue is if you learn solely by memorizing instead of drawing connections between the content like for ops question you can get a fair amount into knowing those assumptions by understanding the connection between least squares regression as taught in a frequentist statistics course and how linear regression works in bayesian frameworks none are you in america its marketable here but a lot of evon candidates do not know how to sell themselves especially in banking ms econ can get you into your jp morgans bank of americas wells fargo and citi then you can pretty much go anywhere alt n v t got it xayo could part of the reason be that you are asking for solid statistical fundamentals while most candidates have more of a cs programming focus i definitely notice myself that the data science field is split between stats and cs people these two groups have very different approaches to problems and use different methods to solve them most of the recent grads are more of the cs type while a lot of the people who have been in the field for years are statisticians nocampeuropean degrees are more rigorous that us degrees we get through more at school and therefore get through more at uni american phds are better than our uk phds from what i have heard renokarchnmy interesting we covered residual analysis in my class longer than the act of doing the regression i still have forgotten most other than check the residuals and if they do not meet the assumptions toss it or bs your way out in the write up but i would bet real money many companies out there are doing just fine with some bus comm undergrads running some business unit using excels trend line and looking exclusively at r and could care less because the odds have been in their favor the whole time and that is what their corporate education platform taught them on the ds intro course for business people prerecorded mooc but hey i am kinda dumb so maybe you just happened to interview dumb candidates like myself i reject every aspect of this null hypothesis fr though you are not alone your description matches that of myself and almost anyone i have spoken to about their education in the last years none funny enough i am almost done with my program and those subjects that you mentioned were barely even covered in my regression class if any at all yes and i recognize this may be the issue i actually discussed with senior management that i think they may just want to let hr know that if a masters level candidate is selected for interview they should prepare for xyz topics in technical interview management is open to it but they are luke warm to it maxtothej funny enough i am almost done with my program and those subjects that you mentioned were barely even covered in my regression class if any at all i think thats the problem thats what op is pointing out insamity regression is useless without residual analysis if it violates the assumptions you cannot trust any of the numbers your regression spits out that is kinda crazy i have only taken econometrics as a statistical inference linear regression course and we have definitely covered perfect multi collinearity and the heteroskedasticity i am in the first three weeks of metrics glm and we have talked about multi collinearity again albeit not in depth thegreathomer op probably has worked with specifically regression for years and has dug himself into the topic so much that he simply does not manage to get the perspective of people who did not spend years to specialize in the academic aspects of a niche inside a niche delicious view wut very different experience a year degree with hours per week of study should have enough time to cover all those things and go far far more in depth stephensrmmartin i mean basic autoregressive models are regular old regression just with lagged covariates none this is the point where i stop asking you technical questions if your fitting ols on time series data and your variables are non stationary your regression is spurious your variables may simply be trending the same way with no meaningful relationship if your residuals are non stationary then you likely have violated most of the assumptions with error terms and gauss markov does not hold none standards of european schools are higher than american european schools do not shy away from math goodluckonyourexams damnit we will never find out how to do a years bachelor in years none we hire mostly people with economics backgrounds my complaint was about quality of people with an econ undergrad masters in mathematical finance or data science or stats or whatevere is that really the skillset in most demand i would think it is mostly solving business problems nlp contributes to plenty of products but even there if it is not your competitive advantage you may be better off using existing ml services rather than building your own nicksinghtechcareers nope but some of those questions can be found on datalemur nicksinghtechcareers awesome unable this is honestly why not just tech but the job market in general is so confusing and infuriating not only are things never set in stone or sure but hr also does not understand what each major can do at most times i want to get a master is but i am going to be so mad that i would waste money i keep hearing a master is if necessary and then others say they never even got a bachelor is in the right field but still got ahead and attribute it to work experience bout had it none i would do in applied stats you can go into data science in a tech firm banking consulting with that background and it has better brand value i think any program from a major university will have a decent brand value applied stats generally is a bit softer on math requirements than pure stats and tends to be projects focus they also still are quite rigorous but most applied stats courses are not going to require you to take pure math courses like real analysis and some schools have ta funding for their masters students which usually eliminates tuition and gives the student with a small stipend for grading papers and holding office hours again my assumption is that you made decent grades and can get into a reasonable program i also think there are some decent online applied stats programs that have been around way before coursera was a thing cocodirichlet that is worse you are basically proposing a hour take home which most people hate many have complained here on twitter linkedin about long take homes for interviews if you are applying for a job at a bank it is kind of obvious they are going to ask about time series and model assumptions none thats because ds courses try to cover a broad spectrum and a lot of them lack depth when you work in a particular product space they probably specialize in one class of models 2fast2smart2pretty the most famous ds course is andrew ng is and he goes into depth about regression and when he explains neural networks he starts by showing how it is basically an expanding logistic regression assumptions are explained in several videos none my approach is to ask what someone ought to know after an undergraduate econometrics course econometrics being adjacent to stats spudmix this there is zero value in hiring for things that can be taught in a week there is a lot of value in hiring for adaptability drive proven ability to learn critical thinking etc then spending a week teaching the other stuff if you have to hoop jumping technical interviews are a waste of everyone is time ixolich exactly i have been in retail ds for the past four years i have forgotten of what my masters program taught me about time series analysis because it just has not come up at work if i got an interview at op is place i would be able to spend a week or so going over old notes and such but that is a far cry from having four years of practical experience absolutely i would spend the time between accepting an offer and starting the job going over gasp kaggle projects to get a bit more experience and knock off the rust but it would still be a few months before i really got my feet under me we will just ignore how that is standard for basically anyone starting basically any new job none for clarity they are interviewing for roles on a particular team with specific requirements and technical skills are clearly outlined in this case regression time series and other linear models resumes i received from hr i personally filtered and threw out anyone who was clearly aiming nlp unsupervised learning neural nets etc my frustration is specifically aimed at candidates who should know this topic based on their education resume they are people listing regression and time series as skills that they know and have taken coursework in whats worse they are from schools like columbia ktpr oh snap none sure if you do not know what stationarity is you probably will pick variables that are arbitrarily trending together that might have a great fit and do not have any meaningful statistics relationship and will not have out of sample predictive power and in the context i work in you are unlikely to have enough out of sample data for traditional validation approaches to work none as someone who was raised by academics and good ones at that did a phd the moment i hear someone say they have worked in academia usually means they have never been a tenure track faculty anywhere thats my criteria for working academia if you are interviewing someone for a job its perfectly reasonable to ask if they actually have skills that are highly relevant to a job we are not hiring people to learn how to build models that are used to inform decisions about portfolios with hundreds of billions of dollars of assets they do not need to know everything but they must meet a certain threshold snowmaninheat exactly you and i have the same philosophy meanwhile op is just being elitist none so what did you learn in your phd that makes you an expert on phd and masters curriculums the curriculums have not changed much at all in ten years the depth of programs have none we are hiring from the latter not the former none i understand that the job description is regression here and these topics are things that are actually part of the job for this job the ideal candidates are statisticians and economists and would have been screened for that plenty of math people do work in our world but they would not be a fit for this specific team none the first round is oral interview we do not do programming or data tasks for direct roles to teams and this is standard in most major banks capital one is the exception data tasks are a thing for fresh graduate rotational programs that place candidates on to a team after a year or two and for internships i focus on linear regression because its taught across disciplines people with biostats economics cs physics engineering quant fiannce and stats are generally familiar with the methods sdric do you know what the difference between a phd student and a master is student is work experience phd is not just writing publishing papers it is usually working on tasks for externals who finance your university is chair some teaching tasks getting a master student with to years of work experience in your field equivilant job experience to a phd sudent should deliver results that are close to what you see from phd students ps you should stop with we have a name and similar comments it sounds arrogant at best and ridiculous at worst i have worked in a company that was in the top is of the fortune and i have also worked for one of the biggest auditing companies in the world frankly it is not as special as you think it is i also missed what is faang is trying to poach if you cannot even hire none i really could care less about your assessment of my personality data generation and parameter estimation have a role to play in the subset of applied mathematics your job requires my entire post is about candidates that should meet the bar for this specific role and not the entirety of ds i fully acknowledge there is a place for people to do work that involves analyzing data with different depth in statistical knowledge or math knowledge that being said what ever you do if your building a model you should know at some minimum level the mathematics behind your framework other wise you do not know what your doing my complaint is specifically about people with fresh masters degrees in stats math not meeting the bar for this role when they should you say you work in mrm dev team in a bank the places i work are the top end of those banks i know what kind of interviews people generally give and i am not asking for anything more than that it is extremely disconcerting too me when i am seeing people with mas in quant finance econ stats from legitimate ivy leagues coming to our interviews and not knowing the relevant topic at an undergraduate level this level of candidate certainly could not work in mrm mrm is a bout assessing technical strengths and weaknesses of models savethepandabears haha my mistake no offense taken i thought you were genuinely asking about the assumptions about your comment on i thought approximate normality was required in the sampling means of the betas to run a standard t test none this level of understanding i am looking for several of the candidates thought the normality assumption was essential for parameter estimates to be correct you only need the questions were the type of things like if you have heteroskedasticity you are parameter estimates change most said yes how would you check for it etc savethepandabears yes but i would argue the property that is typically expected is the ols estimator is blue hence the full set of gm assumptions savethepandabears hehe no it is not i never said anything about it being linear in independent variables i said it is a function of independent variables that is linear in parameters lol none for computation you only need random sampling full rank aka no perfect multi colinearity and linear specification assumptions unbiasedness requires strict exogeneity assumption this is also enough for consistency in large samples spherical errors homeskedastic errors and no serial correlation is needed for gauss markov along with iid anything else is not necessary but often has nice properties for example normality means that ols is the same as maximum liklihood estimator and can also has the lowest variance among all unbiased estimators linear or non linear there are additional assumptions you can make about sampling and dgp that i probably am not aware of but for classic model just computation and basic inference only four are important none this is associate level role thats why we have phd candidates we are also looking at ms candidates from top universities the role is open due to attrition none yeah i get the sense there is a lot of students and a lot of people who are not working for big corporate companies i am skeptical that places like amazon or facebook really have people doing modeling work that do not have strong technical backgrounds even if they value different technical skillsets one thing that i have to screen for especially with phd candidates is whether or not the person is really looking for big tech role azdatasci oh also i do not recall and classes that covered experimental design or consulting in the ds program but i will ask her and follow up none i think for clarity we will be able to hire a candidate from the pool of people i interviewed i am just more disheartened that percent of candidates i have interviewed with masters degree do not really do not have any depth with statistics other than they know they can fit the model in r whats going to happen is someone with a phd will get the role none i filtered all the cs candidates there are cs people working on adjacent teams and i have personally worked with cs guys in space that have done well but my prior is that a fresh cs grad in does not really want this job and would be happier in a job in a tech company model building in a bank is very bureaucratic and there is a lot of red tape that will not exist in a tech company also the stuff that is most sexy today for cs ml ai types has a narrow scope in a bank and does not have a strong future here when i said the cs had worse training i meant from a stats point of view cs ds people are trained very differently from statistics and econometrics people they are much more hand wavey and a lot more the most important thing is minimize out of sample error we can ignore everything else i am sure percent of cs phds are better at writing code automation and engineering then most people on my team none i do not have an issue with the cs candidates that much i think they havea poor fit for this kind of job and many of them would be better at data engineering and implementation and most are not suited for my specific industry actually many companies do have programs for recent graduates that involve a professional training component and thats a large part of general recruitment most of the places i work have one or two year rotational programs for fresh ma and phd where they rotate on different teams before joining permanently in the case for the specific role i am interviewing candidates for they are joining a team directly and not coming in through this type of program maxtothej a lot of cs folks think they can just wing it for math and stats cocodirichlet you do not need to pay to find someone who knows classical statistics which is what op is asking about anyone with an econometrics or stats or similar masters degree should be able to answer those questions royalicedeliverer inversion is only well defined for matrices from glnk to be accurate this is why we need the moore penrose pseudoinverse in lr and to get even more technical no one in their right mind would generally solve lr by setting up the pseudoinverse or even decompose xx due to potentially horrible condition they would decompose x by qr or svd that is what scikit learn does and solve the least squares problem this also allows for a straight forward handling of rank deficient problems none lose the snark i saw your profile you want to do quant marketing phd its econ adjacent and there is a good chance you will take econometrics courses that assumes fluency linear algebra and calculus in the econ dept such a course goes in depth into mathematical properties of regression you will see the course material then none message me in a year i will point you to some good internship programs in our space smellyapartment how is it unfair to expect someone to know something that is readily available how low should the bar be exactly cocodirichlet knowing when to use a model the assumptions and potential problems is something everyone should know that is not something you need to look for so you are going to spend of your time reading how to do your job none now if your job ad says deep theoretical knowledge of logistic regression is required then your criticism is fair but my guess is that you do not put that in your job ad it is in the job requirements when i said we do not hire people like you we do not hire people with graduate degrees in fields that do not require probability multivariate calculus and linear algebra within this job function this is industry wide it is not my decision after financial crisis government took steps to make sure that model building and validation functions in banks have a minimal set of mathematics related qualifications i to date have never seen a psychologist political scientist sociologist working in quant function in a major bank someone might squeeze in somewhere but would be highly irregular and unusual maxtothej if you want deeper than elements of statistical learning is available littlebigmidget the actual math is lacking but the ultimate formulas and derivations are there the assumptions are also present in the book even if only explained in a sentence or two to your overall point i would say that this is why it is an introductory book none for regression islr lacks depth in any specific topic that being said islr is a wonderful book for someone with some technical knowledge area to get a broad overview of supervised learning and how statisticians think about these problems therealtiddlydump i mean it is an introduction to a lot of topics you cannot have an opinion on something you do not even know about so a book like islr is a great launching off point that you def should follow up on eyyo_ do you take issue more with your candidates not knowing material at all or them trying to bs an answer the latter being a bad look but if a candidate knew their weaknesses and interviewed well otherwise i would imagine they could be a good team member with some training and guidance are where to get the fundamentals performing well in school is somewhat indicative of that i would say own i believe telling the candidate what topics they will be asked in the interview will be good this will help the candiate prepare better degree courses are indeed spread too thin there are times when in job descriptions they mention what is required and then another line which says good to have which seems like its not mandatory to have those skills and they end up asking all about that in the interview tangentc i know i am a bit late to this party but i feel compelled to chime in here because i think this somewhat misunderstands why phds tend to better understand the tools they work with i think the value of a thesis is the original research aspect of it rather than the specialization aspect for the simple reason that if this were true most physical science phds would be just as poor as these masters candidates a physics education typically does not involve that much formal stats at least as far as regression analysis goes you might take a mathematical methods course but you are not going to get a lot of rigor and being a specialist in mie resonance based metamaterials is not going to help you with data science when you do original research you are forced to learn how to teach yourself methods quickly and well enough to not shoot yourself in the foot in so doing you have_ to understand the assumptions you are implicitly making by using a tool and the consequences of violating those assumptions and how much_ violation you can get away with before it causes a problem for your purpose by contrast i think most people who do a coursework masters tend to still think of standard mathematical tools as ossified quasi black boxes that give you some perfectly reliable output as long as you feed the right stuff into it there just is not that experience of getting their hands dirty working on real problems where assumptions of a common model break down in whole or in part spasik_ that would definitely help i think even i forget some fundamentals sometimes and i have a masters in stats not ds but i do not really think it speaks to my capabilities it is easy to forget something if you do not use it for a few years try getting year interns from a university that has a strong math or econometrics program and maybe a coop program where you catch them mid year then you can sift for stronger candidates via their internships it sounds you are wanting about somebody who understood their year material can you start telling hr to accept experience and training in other fields too i come from an electrical engineering background and have used nearly a dozen flavors of sql but they steamroll me on the degree when i have forgotten more about regression and time series than some in my own field will ever know yes every term and it was also me upside is i learned a lot_ so i feel i got a lot more out of the program than my peers downside is that when i saw fully functional groups and what they produced it was disheartening but encouraging to know with the right people amazing work could get done the main crutch i saw were folks without any software background amazed me by the end of the program how folks still struggled with git oop and foundational data engineering skills the students with stats analytics backgrounds that worked hard to beef up their programming chops were on average producing the best work that is how i passed the comps muscle memory in writing my cheat sheet i spent minutes mindlessly writing down a cheat sheet with all the concepts i knew i usually jumble up bad memory from mild dyslexia it takes a lot of repetition for me to keep something right there i even thought about going back to teach business stats at night because it was a was a way to keep everything there it is worth remembering that some people especially ones early in career and maybe interviewing for their first job have little experience interviewing and expect to have to have all the answers well given the climate in tech we will see if that works on a couple of months i have a bad feeling it must be awesome to work with the world champion in jumping to conclusions ramblinginternetnerd pretty sure that is excel it stops with alt n v these days none not in this case people in this thread are assuming that i do not know what our candidate pool is supposed to look like what is happening is that traditional programs in things like stats econometrics mathematical finance in their attempt to market them selves as degrees people can go get ds jobs are producing candidates that do not know fundamentals of those fields things that a masters degree candidates in those fields should know before the gold rush broadwayjoeyd getting through more is the opposite of the problem being discussed here he wants people to have great depth on a few particular topics as someone who is almost done with my masters i had a solid grasp of the math proofs as i was taking courses but remembering all the tiny details of a single class of problems is asking a bit much if i needed them in reality i would just look them up we covered residual analysis in my class longer than the act of doing the regression i still have forgotten most other than check the residuals and if they do not meet the assumptions toss it or bs your way out in the write up that amounted to one or two lectures in my course all i know is that there is standardized and studentized residuals and make sure that they are scattered uniformly and studentized residuals can be used to determine any potential outliers i guess it is expected that there is a huge variation between university programs not to mention the profs as well limebabies my ms program had a class only on regression granted i do not remember the minutiae right now but i still have my notes from it which i look over for interview prep eta oh wait nvm i kept reading the thread and maybe it is actually op who is the problem here well i think another big issue is deciding fully based on these technical interviews which are just memorize stuff also the deep dive questions which mostly focus on what you do in a dev environment with the difference that you are not in a dev environment under any dev conditions also people monitoring what you are doing in this moment is not really the way to go just unrealistic scenarios people can learn all kind of shit if you teach them or if they are able to and as you figured out they can list some facts but do not understand dependencies and results after applying changes and guess why because they never learned it nobody teaches you how to think nowhere and if you do you are more likely to fail classes than to ace them also as an applying candidate you just start to panic because you already know you are sitting in front of an expert you realise you know nothing and since questioning is like school or university the brain stops working for me at least but many other people too what is more valuable is the mindset of the person how problems are solved if the person often needs help or rather helps other people is the person sensitive to criticism criticism not being called incapable of doing how fast is the person able to learn new stuff is the person determined or more likely to give up bigger challenges is the person engaging in a conversation just my opinion but these facts are more important than just answering these questions you could also ask these questions in another way like step by step approaching and explaining the how and why of your questions this way you can also observe many of my aspects just mentioned for example if the person is even interested in the solution and solving problems communicating more after some time or just internally shuts down because for me just answering these strange questions does not represent the full potential of any person it represents nothing in fact you do not get good candidates you just get people who say what you want to hear nothing more nothing less but maybe this is the goal i do not know and i can tell you i would fail those kind of interviews maybe because i also do not care about memmorizing facts stuff never liked it neither in school nor in university still got my dream job in cyber security because we never had a technical interview they were more interested in the other aspects and features and both the company and i are really happy about this decision and without a bachelors yet still studying and more than twice the regular time grades also not great none your not in the yous i take it hours per week of study yeah i do not have the energy to do something like that plus i am not very smart so sometimes i spend hours trying to do just one proof none yes but even without talking about ar models stationarity is important say your just fitting a regression with different time series what happens to my revenues costs over time with different macroeconomic scenarios stationarity is important for the reasons i outlined this is the point where i stop asking you technical questions you did not mention time series anywhere though you just mentioned regression if your interviews are anything like your post here you might not be asking as clear of questions as you think which might be causing your issues at minimum your level of snark to a random person who was trying to engage in conversation is a red flag renokarchnmy introspection might reveal in your rage you fail to communicate critical details of your test questions to candidates sorry this is the point where i call you an arrogant dumbass non stationarity is a quality of data not of a model which is why there is no ols assumption that the data is non stationary i will leave it as a homework exercise as to which gauss markov assumptions can be violated when modeling non stationary time series data can please have your homework handed in on time sorry please tell me where you mentioned anything about time series data if you are consistently getting people in to interview who seem completely unprepared for the questions you are asking that sounds more like your fault than theirs are you telling people what to prepare for or are you letting them walk in blind and then being shocked when they are not prepared on the subject you want to talk about most people are not idiots and they are not interviewing for fun you might think the requirements are obvious enough but if a large proportion of your applicannots are unprepared then clearly they are not acrobatic can i digitize my copy and upload the photos to libgen unable thanks for the response and suggestion you kinda knocked on what i was afraid of in a way i have been postponing it because i am afraid of being too specific with my masters data science especially with the ebb and flow of it unlike most redditors on here i do not necessarily desire to be in faang and shockingly i do like backend work working in tech or ml in big data would be great but i am also open to working in healthcare insurance real estate and finance which one of these i am in currently in data basically i am topped out being a senior business data analyst manager great salary not complaining but personally i want to move on and i am struggling to begin that next step with data science or whatever step above that could be is there any particular reason for applied stats any online masters programs you recommend awhile ago urbana champaign illinois had a data science track that was not too expensive berkeley also had a obviously great data science track but it was also bakochba not at all i am very much against that type of homework it should be simple and fundamental i have already seen your resume and i am interviewing you i know you have experience and you know how to code the purpose is to give the candidate a chance to show how they would handle a typical problem and i am looking to see what you do with it my expectation is that it should take less than an hour including any research personally if i am hiring a recent grad i know they are not expert what i am looking for is can they learn and become one given the opportunity bothwaysitgoes if you think that ng goes into depth about regression you have not seen a person with real knowledge on that subject econometric analysis of cross section and panel data by wooldridge goes into depth about regression look it up wouldarkshenron let me put it this way do you honestly believe that a candidate who is strong in nlp cannot learn the basics of regression in say a weekend of google search if you really believe this i am sorry to say you are just arrogant and rejecting well qualified candidates skeerp you are getting a lot of hate in this thread but just know i get what you are trying to say a ms in stats means you should be able to talk about linear regression else you are lazy it is been years since i took my ms linear regression class so it is rusty but i could say something you should link the job posting for all the linkminded lurkers qualified for your position megamannequin i think you should think of it from a perspective of what are stats and econ ms students optimizing for now vs what were stats and econ ms students optimizing for years ago nearly all of my friends who are out of their doctorates or masters in stats program are not working in areas that rely on a deep understanding of linear models it is generally ml experimental design or causal inference in fact the only people that i know who actively use linear models in their research are psychologists and economists if you think of it from the perspective of statistics grad students in traditional top university masters programs right now most people have a year to take their core classes and then a year to take electives if the majority of industry and grant funding journal attention is going into those above fields there is much less of an incentive to get good at linear models by taking more in depth regression classes in your second year masters students probably have a way better understanding of neural networks than they did years ago which is motivated by industry and academia conditions but that comes at the opportunity cost of not studying glms as much i think you just have a problem where what was the standard years ago has changed and your application of statistics is now quite rare unfortunately i think glms are cool bothwaysitgoes that means that your hiring pipeline is trash xelaxander understandable if you wrote regression into the job description then these are fair questions i just had a look at the wikipedia page for linear regression with minimal preparation a reasonable mathematics master is student would have probably passed on the other hand seeing how straightforward the topic is to learn you could probably train someone on the job and have a larger candidate pool to be fair i think you could have told the candidates to expect regression to be on the technical screen since part of it is memorization eyyo_ they have made work their personality though cocodirichlet no the difference why people with a phd remember if because they had to study for qualifying exams and many courses also have written exams many also had to be teaching assistants and either teach labs or have office hours or teach their own class in masters it is mostly assignments and i doubt they have written exams particularly the online ones colinallbets cool you are still a prick profkimchi nope normality generally is only required in certain situations like very small sample sizes bothwaysitgoes i do not think anyone ever expects gm assumptions to hold for real data sorry you do not need random sampling you do not even need sampling but go on king therealtiddlydump what you have described should not require a phd which i know that you know which is why you were interviewing people who do not have phds i feel you it is hard to know what else to do except scream into the void that universities are i will serving their students and employers suffer for it i do not think we the royal we do a great job teaching statistics it is often taught as a series of otherwise totally disconnected tests as if statistics is about following the right flow chart to do nhst it is awful taoudi haha phd for linear regression you are tweaking none that was really the point of that part of the comment i made a suggestion to make his life easier given that he likely has the budget to do so none nope we pay about half that for a junior hire thats about median hire this whole post was my disappointment with interviewing a number of masters level candidates that cannot answer these types of questions it seems to trigger a lot of people i guess a lot of people are working in ml space that probably do not know this stuff i am confident percent of these candidate will find a job they have a masters degree from very good schools and clearly people do not care about classical statistics as much as we do none deleted will do prestigioussortyou are assuming all data scientist are building models which is just not the reality at the moment i am a data scientist for a very large tech company and have never built one neither have most of my colleagues and if they do is rarely to go for production and just used to enhance data analysis we have ml engineers for that and they started as software engineers or at least studied computer science i go deep into a concept when i am implementing it like most data scientists who get to understand why these assumptions matter and potential problems for specific models scenarios when they are actually on the job not from lectures in class snowmaninheat it is in the job requirements make sure it is crystal clear and one of your top bullets often hr bungles job descriptions or buries this deep within the text so the candidate thinks it is peripheral i to date have never seen a psychologist political scientist sociologist working in quant function in a major bank in your department that makes sense you probably not only want someone who is a capable statistician but also offers ability to derive insights and make recommendations to stakeholders i would target an econometrics grad i think a psychologist or sociologist would feel like a fish out of water and it would not be a good fit for any party involved we would be better placed in the ux or hr divisions good luck sourcing a candidate luisbitme thanks for the tip truebirch i completely agree with you islr is amazing at getting your head around different approaches to machine learning in a detailed way once you have learned the basics of ridge regression for example you have the knowledge you need to take a deep dive into the math for example islr taught me about random forests years ago that led me to esl and then to the original breiman paper abenf unlike a lot of introductory texts it actually does what it says on the tin feels very targeted at year undergrads year grads and a general stem ste audience littlebigmidget as someone with a non stats background this book has been an incredibly valuable resource in explaining these methods in a digestible level of difficulty as an interviewer of future data scientists where do you suggest i go next luisbitme i totally agree it is a fantastic book for the right purpose renokarchnmy god forbid a company having to hire someone who does not know something they could look up on google or have explained by a senior team member in minutes none its when the candidates bs the answer if the candidate was like i do not know xyz and need a chance to review if they somewhat knew the topic we would probably focus the round interview to focus on the topics with hr giving feed back to prepare for it skrindingle curious what your cheat sheet looked like i am in an analytics masters now and it is been super light on mathematical underpinnings and assumptions i am going through islr in my spare time to get more of a grounding flatprotrusion hey that is me how should i approach the question if i did not know the answer or forgot about it i would perhaps try to get more information about the qn they are asking and try to get articulate my thought process what other ways would you recommend and if they were asking about questions about assumptions and you have forgotten about it how would you approach it none i am sympathetic to this every interview is a learning experience the thing i tried to do is kind of hint at what they did wrong without telling them explicitly when i had the why do not you ask me questions portion about the job my hope is some of them took the hint and will prepared differnetly maxtothej i do not remember most of these by heart i unashamed of saying for the concepts op asked about its pretty basic i was going based on ops questions i even explained how to retain the information long term i used to do alt n v for the longest time on office but it annoyingly changed to alt n v t all of a sudden which i have gotten used to not sure why it changed but i just tried it again and that is what i am seeing alt n v only gets me this far nocampyes we go into depth and from what i have heard italian degrees are even more rigorous they do so many more hours of lectures every day too to cover more material it is unacceptable that candidates going for jobs involving regression modelling do not understand the concepts op is asking of them renokarchnmy oh for sure mine was a mscs and my ds profs were mostly ex quant finance people or ds and a researchers most of my regression papers focused on residual analysis and interpreting the residuals relative to our preprocessing steps then i graduated and tried doing that at work to answer a question with a well formed page write up and formal regression analysis and just got weird side eyes from everyone basically when it gets to the business end line go up gud renokarchnmy totally marykeay oof you brought back memories of my worst interview experience my background is in mechanical engineering and the interview was for a senior role it was going pretty well despite having zero rapport with the interviewer he was honestly like speaking with a robot i am autistic high masking so if i noticed it must have been very bad we went through my experience and all was well the prospective manager for the position was also present im highly qualified and my experience was an absolutely perfect match for the role i had a specific skillset that was rare in this country at the time and unlike other candidates i would need essentially no training to get started at this stage i felt quite confident that i would get it i had great interview skills and up until that point i had been offered every role i had ever interviewed for in the second half of the interview the prospective manager pointed out that due to complaints similar to the op is but in mechanical engineering we would do a walk around the manufacturing facilities and he would ask some practical questions this was fine by me and i was confident that i would do well the first few questions were vaguely related to the role a little basic phrased strangely but hey maybe we were just getting started then he began to ask oddly phrased questions where the only relevant answers i could think of were so basic that i could not fathom that they were what he was looking for it really threw me surely he could not be looking for that type of answers for a senior engineering role eventually i accepted that he was in fact expecting answers that a person with the most rudimentary knowledge of basically anything in life would be able to answer for example he picked up a screw and asked what is this he asked what was special about the screw it was a self tapping screw he confirmed that past candidates had not been able to answer that question he did not seem to realise that maybe just maybe it was because a person going for a senior role would not have expected to be asked if they knew what a freaking screw was it was also completely irrelevant to the role i gave the right answers despite my misgivings i was uncomfortable with how much of the effort was about reading this man is mind and not about drawing from my knowledge and experience by this point i had decided that i did not want to work for them which was just as well as they did not offer me the job in the end the feedback given to the recruiter not enough experience many months later they were still advertising for the role i am not sure if they ever found what they were looking for or if they just gave up some interviewers do not seem to understand the purpose of an interview tommychillfiger yep i am the same as you describe here i am not good with memorizing facts unless they are material to a concept i am engaging with on a fairly regular basis my thought is generally that is what we have computers for can learn things very quickly and have proven that through my pivot into and progress within tech currently an analyst with an even split between data work and more client facing work i have leaned on that in interviews and have been fortunate to land two jobs now where they appear to have seen that i have the problem solving mindset aptitudes and soft skills to pick up whatever i do not know at the time of the interview and they have been right i am excelling despite not having a traditional background part of it really is just that i find it fascinating so it is not a matter of motivation for me to learn more tools methods domain knowledge it is fun to me so i eat it up currently using new client data validation discovery as an excuse to get better with pandas matplotlib seaborn and loving it and achieving the goal that was set i am considering an msc in stats at some point but will also just be chipping away at math and stats through self teaching as i find time if an msc never makes sense for me that is fine too but i do crave that sort of learning so i suspect i will make it happen eventually none from an employer pov we would rather have someone that has clear expertise on a topic than someone who does not the former is the qualified candidate and thats the person should get the job for clarity we are not having trouble finding candidates i wrote pretty precisely the issue with masters level candidates most of the phd level candidates do meet the bar and there is also the taking of people on the same job field they are probably taking to others to do not interview there as it is ridiculous and even leaving bad reviews on glassdoor delicious view no and not really aware of the differences so genuinely curious as to what it is like subjects each at postgrad level with proofs and derivations programming statistical algorithms from scratch etc is not that what a masters degree involves like mathematical statistics statistical inference generalised linear models bayesian data analysis time series analysis statistical learning etc each as individual subjects of study delicious view and i just looked up the curricula of few of the us university master of statistics interesting varies widely across universities obviously but yeah units like applied statistics and being able to take non stat non math non comp elective seem to be a thing with some degrees being as short as months i guess each uni just does what they want to do delicious view yeah totally understand and i agree it is too much and i am not advocating that it should be that way i just thought that it was a commonly shared experience of masters students stephensrmmartin ah yes i see what you are referring to now i think whether someone could answer that question would depend strongly on the context you provide but also on the goal of the model to some degree my mind did not immediately go to regression with time ordered variables but it is because my primary timeseries related work was in autoregressive volatility variance modeling creating bayesian garch mgarch variants part of my post doc work on melsms none time series is a type of data you are fitting regresion on data you need to know what assumptions matter for time series data finance in general involves time series data the interview questions i have asked are same types i have been asked in several job interviews i know what industry looks for there are candidates who can do things at this level but nearly all of them had phds you seem to think your owed respect your not none or it could be we take a chance at people like i said phd candidates did just fine and we are probably going to end up hiring one of them for a typical econ ba ma this would be a dream first industry job none i think most ds programs are schools trying to cash in on a trend and they just tend to be softer stats masters i am biased though i can break into faang if i wanted to but i would have to definitely sharpen up on more data engineering skills my career in banking is going pretty great and has grown exceptionally fast cocodirichlet less than an hour already reading the codebook and making descriptive figures to understand the data is going to take me a while how can i do anything in an hour you expect a model predictions missing data etc in a hour 2fast2smart2pretty i did not say he goes into depth but it is not ignored i learned it years ago with an old uni course that is free online google duke regression and it is the first link statistical forecasting credit to robert nau of fuqua school of business duke university sam man i was just going to say lol hire based on skill then teach exactly what you want once hired every company is different anyways it is ridiculous to think in a field like data science they will know it all deep theory is phd mainly because they want to go teach and research and project and skill work would be more masters i can add numbers together but i am not going to sit and explain why one plus one may or may not equal two that is for the math theorists does not mean i cannot do the job right tho honestly i work with plenty of people who have bashed away at nlp using programs built by others who struggle with traditional statistical material they can try and look up what they need but if they do not understand it well enough they are a liability using or presenting it none i posted this after finishing the initial stage interviews we have a set of candidates who will move to next round and then senior management will do third round and pick i will not post anything that will ever identify me none i think the salient point here is what students are optimize for i am an economist the econ curriculum has not changed in a fundamental fashion years other than more emphasis on causal inference and more complexity and good ms still focus a lot on linear modeling that being said fresh graduates are certainly also paying attention to ml and the more data sciency stuff a lot of my venting from the post were interviewing people from mfe programs which are supposed to be adjacent to econ ma though more mathematics oriented these candidates also seem to have spent more time tailoring their skills towards data science then quant finance the level of depth with regression analysis from some of these candidates was only slightly above coursera finance phds use a lot of regresson models and so does a lot of finance none i agree never have i been less impressed with columbia and nyu ironically the one masters candidate that managed to make it was from a state school albeit a decent one none we do not need a larger candidate pool this is an industry leading company that does not have problem getting masters and phd candidates good universities my complaint is that much of the candidate pool that i have had to interview that are coming from these universities does not seem to know the topic any where the level of the wikipedia page i agree a reasonable math masters should be able too but that is not what i have been seeing there are many people that can learn many things given enough time that does not mean that we are going to trust them to work on models that are used to manage portfolios with hundreds of billions of dollars with assets if they cannot show up to an interview with an undergrad level understanding of the main tool they are expected to use our world does have early talent internship positions that do provide professional development component this unfortunately is not one of them none it was literally the job description i hope most people would review the technical skills being asked for when interviewing for a job in the corporate hq of a fortune company that seems to be too much to expect basedo n what i have read here none bingo i love how people who have not done phds comment about phds another aspect is a phd is they write a dissertation a dissertation is usually an original research project that the student identified and solved then had to defend to a committee of experts tenured faculty it requires critically thinking about your research method whether your addressing any potential technical objection etc none calling someone a prick in general says more about you than me crazycucumberthis is because we rely on the clt for normality when we have a sufficiently large sample size right jorrissss you do not even need full rank if you do not care about unique solutions karmatroll it is hard to know what else to do except scream into the void that universities are i will serving their students and employers suffer for it this is such an entitled mindset how much work do employers do in supporting universities to generate educations of the caliber they are needing this whole thread has an element of the talent i find off the shelf is not exactly what i want everything sucks op seems to suck at identifying where they should be sourcing the skills the actually want for the price they are willing to pay the free market is speaking to mrs i work at a big name bank but strangely he feels that the market should cater to their whims none plenty of phds work in jobs where most of what they do is linear regression cocodirichlet even people who say they do ml they are most likely just running stuff from a package without having any clue what is going on underneath if people are doing ds to feed some numbers to someone up there that might or might not pay attention to it then whatever i guess but if you actually care about the numbers then you cannot do that anyone here should at least see the movie margin call for a good example of how having a wrong model can really screw you over none someone asked me a question have i done x i answered their question i do not see how it does anything to do with you none we are not having trouble getting candidates my complaint is about candidates who are supposed to know this stuff given paper qualification i would imagine a lot of psychologist work in quantitative marketing maxtothej its a bummer hastie used to post a pdf of eslr on his site for free whatahorribleman elements of statistical learning is quite a similar book but goes into greater detail none all jobs have different expectations what works for my industry work function is not going to work somewhere else at teh end of the day you have to figure out teh career you want to specialze in that topic and then pick the education path that gets yout there maxtothej you should be more transparent you mention in other post that phd candidates are meeting the bar and moving on to the second round do you have enough candidates to fill the job in a reasonable time as is if you do have enough candidates those candidates that get that leeway may get moved on but given ruler probably has the similar technical rulers they will probably not get role another factor is if you make the first round bar too easy and pass too many candidates who bomb the second round your coworkers arent going to be excited about your performance as a first round interviewer because it will feel like the first round is not screening well enough to preserve their time so they can do more directly impactful work for the business tldr getting a job is a job is a competitive endeavor you do not need to just meet a bar you need to be among the top candidates i had any kind of silly stuff from some distributions where i confused the parameters to some series few theorems i found the proof non trivial it was like cliff notes written in the style of james joyce is ulysses if i learned anything from my masters i do not know shit stats is way more complex than shown in undergrad i truly do not know shit my stakeholders have an understanding of stats equal to a year old took me more masters to start feeling mildly competent and i still do not know shit porknjellybeans my stats was in my phd program and my cheat sheet was kind of like this also had one that i will try to find or find similar but what helped my math understanding was knowing the relationships of the numbers like if x increases y also increases or whatever the case may be real talk i got a stats undergrad tutor to help reinforce basics during my first few weeks of my phd program lots of upper level courses assume you have a good foundation i certainly did not but it was easy enough to catch up with help none i would start with its been a while since i learned this and would need to look it up but this is what i think this is what this implies the lets me know that you are rusty and might do it better if your given a chance to review it one thing to realize is that we are hiring a colleague a person who is honest about what they may not know is better than someone who tries to bullshit through it incorrectly the latter leads to mistakes eyyo_ one of the best pieces of career advice i have gotten is that it is okay to say i do not know or i do not have an answer for you right now a good hiring manager should understand you are not an expert and if they do not it may not be a good fit thank you very much i will make treasure of your teachings broadwayjoeyd you are not understanding my point classic italian your degrees are not any better than anywhere else people know this stuff while they are in school and then they forget it because there are more important things to know if you can list assumptions and then find that a test model violates one of them you can just look up ways to fix it from a reference book rather than memorize a bunch of stuff oof sorry to hear that what you desribe is exactly what i hate the most and what are absolute red flags for me i would never want to work with people who have such a shitty approach and attitude to finding suitable people just toxic waste of energy and time yeah i am also autistic and have adhd you could say masking is my way of life you know how it is it would be great if people would just say what they want instead of encrypting whatever they want with strange nonsense questions or actions or at least try to express what they want as precise as possible otherwise it just makes no sense and you feel like running through a parcour like in takeshis castle which would be much more fun and makes more sense so glad this has never been an issue in the company and i also communicated very openly also with the cto and hr regarding what is important to me in the job and what i absolutely hate among other things i also listed things like the negative experience you described also told hr i am not good at talking or expressing my full knowledge in some situations and they told me but that is not an issue because you work in the more technical area if you would be better with talking you would apply for hr and not the technical area and because direct openness is also important to me so that everyone knows what to expect from each other and honesty is based on reciprocity sure many will say you ca not expect honesty from everybody yep but such people do not need to expect honesty or loyalty from me neither this way they found the perfect team for me in which i can fully develop my boss also asks me from time to time if i need anything to make me more comfortable always worth it to work with people who appreciate you and yep your last sentence could not have summed it up more nicely missionstarso long as you are paying the phd level candidate more then that is a perfectly fine strategy because otherwise you run the risk of not being able to retain that candidate personally i would reckon this should be a leveling consideration vs a rejection consideration as long as the candidate can reason through a problem sufficiently well for example as an engineer we have to go through a systems design which tends to be extremely technical and difficult in my case i did pretty well but i also stumbled in some areas of the design for example i had a high level understanding of hashing but once i was asked to implement the algorithm for it i struggled and we moved on to other aspects so i got offered a role as an intermediate instead of a senior pdxmom and that is why you cannot find people companies keep saying they cannot find people but then they are not willing to teach anyone anything that is a losing method tinktinkz you need experts hire experts this entire thread is just bashing non experts for not knowing things they will most likely never need yeah and from an employer pov i have been hired too did not have that expertise before do not have a uni degree yet still solving all kind of stuff like everybody else in the company no matter if unknown topic or how big the challenge was talking to hr and employees from different company branches prior signing the contract with my current boss too and yep our stuff also has international multi million dollar impact in multiple technical infrastructures around the world if you fail to do it the right way and yup i understand now that you are not interested in people who apply for a longterm position and since you are not having any troubles finding candidates the position should already be filled with at least a phd person who meets the bar glad to hear that as i assume you have not read or understood maybe both idk my previous comment what i precisely tried to explain is that the title does not say anything about the applying candidates potential for the company sure there are still firms like yours who want to look superior by only having phd and masters people who just mirror what you and other employees are saying so glad i found a company which does not live in the last century anymore none there are plenty of ds programs that would not even need calculus or linear algebra the quality varies widely the motivated one for sure clearly convoluted ahhhh i have not seen this in awhile a gatekeeper spudmix lmao yeah i think i have figured out the problem here allezcannes you seem to think your owed respect your not cmon man recoveringphysicist you seem to think your owed respect your not i guess they forgot to check primary school level english when they hired you smellycatjon honestly these people who did not get hired by you seemed to have missed a bullet i am sure they will find a better position where they can grow and become a better data scientist with better leadership than working being managed by you damn dude you may be the person interviewing but have some respect for people in front of you people coming out of masters do not always know everything they may be just entering into an industry a lot of kids go directly to masters from bachelors these days and they may not know how to take an interview you gotta be open to different perspective and experiences not everyone needs to have the same answers or prepare for the same tests as you diversity of thought is important i would rather hire a curious person and get them to where they need to be than be a shitty manager or or maybe pay more and just hire phds if that is working for you as you mentioned above basically it seems like yours job requirements seems to be asking for way more so grow up and update the job requirement and ask for people with xyz years experience and just pay up you seem to think your owed respect your not got it you are just a shitty person no wonder your interviews suck eyyo_ turn off wolf of wall street bud you are no it is because your hiring practices are crap these candidates could all get the background knowledge you are testing in a few hours with their qualifications but somehow you think it is their fault they are all turning up so unprepared that you are coming on reddit to rant about it it is you you are the common denominator here explicitly tell people ahead of time to expect an interview focused around regression modelling and time series with adequate detail and see what happens to the quality of your interviews or carry on as you are wasting other people is time and blaming them for it does not sound anything like a dream job to me company culture sounds shite i have been involved in plenty of interviews hiring processes if we got through a full day where more than half the candidates were showing up completely unprepared for the interview i would already be looking at what i am doing wrong on my side or it could be we take a chance at people do not mistake incompetence for benevolence bakochba oh i am not op i do not know what his requirements are when i hire new grads i send a very basic dataset with open ended questions like how they would manipulate the data for different requests scenarios it is not a test i just want to see what choices you make and then discuss that at the interview instead of behavior questions bothwaysitgoes but you literally said that the most famous ds course is andrew ng is and he goes into depth about regression wouldarkshenron yep that is what the interview process is for assess the ability of the person to adapt to the situation and learn new things see how they think when faced with unfamiliar situations do they give up without an effort or do they approach things from first principles how do they google stuff what websites do they open etc megamannequin definitely another component of this i think is that folks in newer master programs are probably not taing whereas years ago masters programs were in general pretty rare and if they did exist could be funded by teaching i think now too that newer masters programs are more project orientated vs exams research personally speaking when i have had to ta it is made me really understand that there are levels to one is knowledge of a topic if you think you understand regression try explaining it for a semester to a bunch of year olds it will make you get much better similarly if you have qualifying exams or a paper where if you want to graduate you have to demonstrably understand glms it will make you get much better edit i went back and saw your post of the questions you asked in the interview as a mid stage stats phd candidate who did some time in industry previously and does not work with linear models at all i think i could answer or of them right now and that goes up to to if i had a a couple hours to review for a regression discussion at a big bank not sure what that means in the context of the thread but now that i think of it it is kind of shocking screened candidates are doing that poorly aussiepunmaster on the flip side you are only hiring people who know what you know who are proving they can memorise stuff about regression you might find you get better results by some diversity of thought approach honestly i think a lot of the lack of specific effort is because these days every office job that is not paying minimum wage gets hundreds of applicannots and so everyone looking for a job has to apply to hundreds of tangentially related jobs of every type in the hopes of finally getting picked by one people cannot just pick a couple places they are interested in and spend time and effort into preparing for that specific role because the odds are they will end up with offers fair but i still ask the recruiters to give the candidates a heads up this is for things on the job description and on the candidates resumes bigpuffyclouds curious what kind of technical skills you expect from a phd you mentioned in your post that this job is not for phds because it is specifically related to regression models why phds are knowledgeable in regression models and more masters students in my field marketing have a very limited knowledge of regression models thanks colinallbets maybe but in this specific_ case it is about you get a life profkimchi in a nutshell yes of course there are no guarantees even with a large sample therealtiddlydump this is such an entitled mindset how much work do employers do in supporting universities to generate educations of the caliber they are needing are you going to defend universities with a straight face on this spare me the lecture let is set aside run away tuition costs and mention the obscene grade inflation a mechanism that is supposed to measure how much students have learned is now pretty much useless more than half my employers have had some engagement or other with a university sponsoring events engaging in industry to university programs similar to internships but more involved etc it is not too much to ask that a degree means that the student understands their field of study taoudi i do not doubt it but its still a ridiculous demand maybe i am confusing something here but i could download elements of statistical learning a couple of weeks ago none i do not find this as big a loss i think islr is a better book than eslr supervised learning is not what i did my education in but i find eslr does not have a particularly unified approach its like a hodge podge of random topics with some mathematical details none elsr is a phd level text book that requires knowing probability mulitvariate calculus and linear algebra and knowing them well i get the sense that a lot of people here could not read it littlebigmidget let is say i want to work in banking my background is in accounting so business concepts are very familiar to me what kind of projects would you look for how could i ensure a qualified understanding of the assumptions being made and their individual impact if violated a master is program is next step and may not even be sufficient but i would like to prepare myself as much as possible right now none yes this is a top firm and there is a reason i did not post this on linkedin this is the type of place that people want on their resume because they can pretty much jump anywhere unlike faang the jobs in this function are highly unlikely to experience lay offs like many people here are confused i am not writing a help i am looking for candidates i am saying that there is a shocking amount of masters degree candidates that do not seem to know basic statistics maxtothej no problem nocampdid you just throw in some xenophobia to make a point i am not italian i just noticed that my italian friends had a more rigorous from the ground up tuition and that my italian lecturer covered material in far greater detail than other lecturers americans learn less at school less mathematics which carries over to university by the time europeans are at university they have a more advanced mathematics education than their us peers maybe this is why however as i said uk phds are of poorer quality that many us ones my professor said many uk phds are not worth the paper they are written on i recall none we know we cannot i am a phd with a few years of experience under my belt and our group is mostly phd when we are identifying phd candidates what we literally are looking for is who will stay for at least a year and maybe two however banking in general pays less than faang for this type of work mostly because of the rsu part of the compensation delicious view difficult not to of students fail each subject average exam assignment grades typically sit around the course outline states expected hours of study to achieve a credit which is like our c grade is around hours per week for each subject a fulltime load is subjects per semester so yeah i thought it was common but maybe other genious people can get high distinction grades doing much less than i pdxmom or do not pay up there are plenty of phds out there and some may not be able to get the pay they think they should ogminimalist beat me to it none there is a reason my rant ended up getting close to up votes it is expensive to hire a candidate and costs time you want to get a job at top companies you meet the standards they are hiring for i expect masters students from places like nyu to know undergraduate level econometrics for an econometrics job if they do not know that out of school then i pass on them my questions are posted in this thread most people who actually read them find them perfectly reasonable but people are not entitled to get a job just because they think they know something you may have all the potential in the world but people have about minutes to evaluate them in an interview if they cannot perform then we move to different candidate 2fast2smart2pretty yeah but i just said regression which he spends a few hours worth of learning on but no it is not a deep dive into the fundamentals point was even if that is a surface level view it still talks about assumption op mentions i do not think he explains how to test for them all but gives resources for others to go learn by themselves none or would be better than every masters student most only got two i want to be frank if your goal is to work in a big bank you should prepare for a banking interview and i work at the top so we have a standard none yes most phds we interviewed wrote a dissertation involving econometric modeling and were teaching stats courses at their universities for uninitiated econometrics is basically the application of regression analysis to economic problems and most phds in economics spend a couple of years taking courses on econometric methods and its taught using multivariate calculus linear algebra and occasionally requires measure theory my opinion is they are over qualified and this would have been a nice role for someone with a masters degree who had a certain level of depth in regression anlaysis none your comment history says it all karmatroll universities are supposed to be places of learning not employment certification factories in reality the lines have blurred massively op thinks their employment is entitled to labor skilled a very specific way in a degree adjacent to the skills they actually want and presumably have skin in the game in ensure that the degrees they are screening for are appropriate for the work they want to have done they have said multiple times that they want people who have econometrics degrees so why are they interviewing ds degree holders op wandered in and said ds degree holders do not really have the skills i want that should change instead of saying wow ds degrees do not prepare people for the type of work i want to hire for we should change our degree filtering job expectations or redefine what skills we are actually looking for the expectation of fresh graduates to be perfectly trained for the work the company needs is entitlement maxtothej that is awesome i could not get to that page by searching on search engine thefringthing esl is intended more as a reference book while isl is a textbook for a pretty breezy first course in statistical inference my main criticisms of isl are that it should assume the reader knows calculus and it should cut the chapter on neural networks vitaminwheat do you have any thoughts on programming collective intelligence building smart web applications planning on reading that soon pentinumlol do you have a book recommendation that goes in depth regarding regression fundamentals i have skimmed both islr and esl both does not seem to cover any topic you mentioned such as independent variable data distribution assumption nor the residual analysis got a large project that depends a lot on linear regression on my company so far i have managed to solve the issue but i want to suggest an improvement so i need to learn more none banking is less project oriented tech companies hire people from quant teams in banks but mode building in a bank has a long history so we have different requirements its more having the right education and work experience for model building in a bank the best degree on paper to have is an mfe or an econ background you probably would need to take math courses that you did not take to get into a graduate program in those fields if your an accountant interested in banking but not necessarily in model building audit cpa with some technical analytics is probably the route i would take banks are highly regulated and audit serve many different functions one function that they do is actually evaluate how effective risk management processes around building models are maxtothej like many people here are confused i have been reading this subreddit for a while it is heavily weighted towards students and non practicioners they arent confused you are just saying something unpopular the popular sentiment in this subreddit is that you should lower the bar to exactly where the person commenting is at so that you can give them specifically the job and ignore the competitive aspect of the job search instructors are partially to blame because a lot of bootcamps colleges are selling the false notion of an entry level ds shortage broadwayjoeyd not xenophobia just a reference to unearned italian elitism but also a classic to accuse someone of xenophobia when they disagree with you and nationality is even slightly involved you are wrong about universities at best you are stating hearsay as truth work on your attitude missionstarwell then perhaps it may be worthwhile investing in a more junior candidate who while they do not have all the skills are willing to learn they may be more willing to stay longer as they then have an opportunity to progress megamannequin yeah i understand there is a standard you are managing very large amounts of other people is money if you are going to have that responsibility you should absolutely know how multicollinearity effects regression estimates lol especially when regression is the main tool you are using my surprise shock dismay is that i personally think i have an average understanding of regression but it is apparently better than most peoples who are specifically targeting this kind of role and who have theoretically been prepared to be asked about it maybe i should consider a career in finance lol colinallbets cool keep spending time thinking about it loser therealtiddlydump except you are responding to a comment i made not op you cannot just transfer their arguments to me and say my comment is wrong either way universities do a shitty job both preparing students for the workforce and_ having their students actually learn in a state that taxes me out the ass i am allowed to be offended by that none i agree with you on both points i wrote it later in the discussion that esl is a phd text and phd texts are often written as references while undergrad texts are written for courses phd courses are generally personal and no matter what the subject even something that has a generally accepted curriculum across schools the professors personal touch will be in the course and they will emphasize what they want and skip over what they want i do think there is a market for a masters level book that covers similar topics islr that assumes people know calculus linear algebra and basic probability like expected values etc such a book should be applied nature like islr and not focused on proving properties of estimators i myself would certainly be interested in such a book just to gain depth in things that i do not explicitly work on also as a note the first edition of islr did not cover neural networks i bought a hard copy of the book and it was useful none so with phd level books like esl is that you really need a professor like at that level courses are personal and phd text books are written as supplements and reference its not like an undergrad book where the text is written for an instructor to teach a course none i reread this question for a book on regression undergrad no calculus needed wooldridge is introductory econometrics principles of econometrics by hill william and guay graduate level calculus linear algebra and probability with calculus are required econometrics by bruce hansen littlebigmidget i am directly interested in model building risk management is too qualitative in the same way accounting is an mfe sounds like a good degree but i would rather take my chances and go for an mscs i will make sure to chase internships once i am in grad school hopefully by keeping your pain points in mind i can stand out in the interviews thanks for the advice nocampmate i am not italian no need to shit on italians maybe go learn the fundamentals that your degree should have taught you maxtothej to be fair who says investing in a more junior candidate will lead to more years of tenure a junior candidate may well leave for more money as someone who wasnt trained effectively if a company spends years getting you to the bar then you bail out in year after that that is not really that more efficient than having someone who meets the bar off the jump and stays years since in case you are getting productive met the bar years and in the other such year none this sounds great but we are not school there are actual consequences to the work they are doing and this is an important aspect of that work none your view point here is incorrect risk management in banking is extremely quantitative and thats where most of the model building teams are in a traditional commercial bank think wells fargo banking is fundamentally a deal making loan origination business and risk is job is to determine the point a loan should not be made because of that most quantitative models in banks models that predict default risk or forecast changes in balance sheet items under evolving macroeconomic conditions or fraud detection models are all owned by risk since risk teams determine capital allocation that is the most regulated audited function within bank that being said an mscs is a perfectly fine degree and a good choice to get into model building you probably need some math courses that an accounting major does not require to get in a good program linear matrix algebra and multivariate calculus maybe a course on discrete mathematics missionstarthat is fair and it is not fool proof just offering an alternative perspective typically you would want your team to be a mix of seniors and juniors seniors can take on the more complex tasks and mentor the juniors juniors can take on more well defined tasks that way you have a diversified set of skills and if a junior or a senior leaves it is not as massive as blow missionstarlol no one said this is school it is human capital it is an investment i have two points that i think may be affecting your retention and then i will peace out you seem to have an unreasonable bar for skillsets essentially all you want are overqualified seniors you may benefit from a more realistic set of seniors and juniors where seniors can take on the more complex tasks and juniors can take on much more defined tasks or subtasks within a project as they grow and are mentored they can take on more responsibility you may benefit from some sort of business or management course i do sense a little bit of condescension in most of your replies i can tell you from your replies i would not really want to work for you this almost certainly is affecting your retention this burn through overqualified phds is a massive waste of resources imo and i would reckon your team is not building any expertise if it is constantly a revolving door of employees anyway good luck marykeay so what you are saying is you are asking for phd level knowledge out of the box without additional training but are unwilling to provide phd level compensation littlebigmidget you are right about my use of the term risk management i did not include the risk modeling component of management which is definitely quantitative maybe a better word for that would be risk mitigation or response which i understand to be performing the compliance requirements that are the result of the risk assessment output by the model or converting the information into analytical data that is more digestible to non technical consumers this is the qualitative area of risk management i am not very interested in but i am glad to have awareness of maxtothej typically you would want your team to be a mix of seniors and juniors seniors can take on the more complex tasks and mentor the juniors juniors can take on more well defined tasks the people who meet the bar for op are still likely juniors they have the meet the bar requisite foundational technical knowledge but not the technical and business domain knowledge that a sr person would have none note quite if i have understood your term correctly in banks quantitative analytics teams are divided along two sides development and validation called model risk management in many banks validation is not what its used in a tech context validation teams are essentially independent subject matter experts that closely examine any model built by a bank replicating building challenger models conducting additional tests and scrutinizing they then write reports evaluating strengths and weaknesses of the model and development teams must act on these reports audit teams in banks include quantitative people including some model building more to support their own work but what they do is actually holistically examine the strength and weakness the entire risk management process then there is also external audit teams so it is part of the compliance function but i would not call it qualitative work its common to switch between validation and development missionstarnot sure i totally follow the point you are making you could have a junior that understands regression at a high level but still does not have the experience to reason about the nuances and a senior who is had a few of experience in this field and can reason about those nuances and mentor the junior in this case op would have a pipeline of folks who can succeed in the role as opposed to expecting a full team of overqualified seniors who are not likely to stay long i feel like we are saying the same thing but not entirely sure in which case disregard this reply lol littlebigmidget you are kind of telling me that the area that is the current best fit for me is not qualitative because it works with numbers at the same time you are making a distinction between the job of the risk auditors and the job of the model developers the primary differentiator being the quantitative rigor of each role i guess i just do not understand what point you are trying to make it feels like you are attempting to sell me on a position that is not your own on the grounds that it has some quantitative elements even though you acknowledge that the skillset of these individuals would never be sufficient to perform the truly quantitatively rigorous work that you or the developers do either way i appreciate the way you have fleshed out the risk management process for these banks as well as the advice you have shared with me maybe in a few years you will be training a junior data scientist and say to yourself holy crap this guy is just as annoying and nitpicky as that dude on reddit because god knows i will be able to ace your interviews haha maxtothej i feel like we are saying the same thing but not entirely sure in which case disregard this reply lol yes you are describing two different bars for junior and senior but ops workplace seems to want to raise both those bars slightly or at least the junior the question op was asking candidates are not that advanced none in banking most of modeling work falls under the umbrella term quantitative analytics this includes both traditional ds and traditional quant finance what i am speaking of is different functions where quants work people move in out of different job functions literally the last place i worked two of the people i worked with left our team to transfer to a team in internal audit why because they could work on computer vision and nlp stuff rather than building logistic regression models the audit team was using nlp too help them automate parts of report analysis as someone who is not in the space really you should not be so picky about the way you come in to a firm junior people have a lot of freedom to move between groups i think its more important to be picky about the firm if you have minimum threshold for qualifications for someone like you i think its easier to come into a model de team bank via audit route than target dev team that being said there is a good chance if you do ms cs you probably will not even end up in banking it will open different doors in different industries that being said at some point you specialize in an industry you need to decide what you are goign to be i myself am struggling with this missionstarah gotcha littlebigmidget it is nice to hear about inner company mobility it is concerned me that too early in my career i might pigeon hole myself into a single area by just following that learning path i recruited for ia for goldman sachs but ultimately opted for a data role in because they seemed to have more career flexibility i think the success your peers found was more due to transferring desirable skills into ia it would probably be difficult to prove such mettle in ia that they would move you into a more challenging nearly unrelated role the reason i chose banking is because i like working with financial data and i could be said to have a corporate personality i also really like money you could call this short sighted but every decision i make is inherently short sighted because i am not very experienced none i would not have done that but i also do not know enough about accounting or investment banks to know if that is the right choice i work mostly for commercial banks littlebigmidget the one track career progress for ia would have made the transition i am attempting to make much more difficult i believe you could argue the foot in the door could be worth it but the experience would be less diverse and i would have lost out on the personal branding consulting has taught me i think i am also uncharacteristically lucky in that i get by at without working long hours at all this has made learning computer science much easier none you already made your choice but i think what the path for ia would be is ia mrm qr it may have needed firm hopping and you definitely would want to have done mfqe ms cs stats before making the jump that being said i honestly think given your plan to mscs you have not made mistakes and the one thing is banking in general is not dynamic qr in a bank is a world of red tape especially risk to the degree this thread is controversial the comment is not from someone who is trying to break in other industries are very very different i imagine hedge funds operate in a different world",

  "brandco talk to your boss about it they are responsible for promoting your contribution to the company you are entitled to have your contributions accurately assessed when it counts i think raising the issue is important if you feel your contribution is not being accurately represented emphasize that it very important to be a good team player and share credit even let others take credit for your contribution is occasionally fine if you are on a highly functional team with a strong culture of supporting each other and working together to succeed forbiscuit this has happened several times in two different companies if this has happened in the past for you then i recommend you practice being assertive and raising your voice this honestly is best done with a career coach or personal trainer and by raising your voice i do not mean shout berate but literally just speak up and if you see someone copying your work and you are present in a meeting where the credit is given to someone else just be unbelievably shameless and call out something like i believe there is a misunderstanding i generated this report on the same token because i do not have the full picture there is also the likelihood someone learned something from your data and provided data strategy solutions that were not present in the report itself in other words you delivered a report but not the business solution where later strategists knew how to interpret and act on the said report and package it for leadership if that is the case you should still raise your voice but at the same time you may need to develop your business strategy skills to deliver similar insights monkeyunited did you encounter a business problem and come up with the solution yourself but the solution was taken away by this other person or were you assigned the task to build out this dashboard which is being used to address a business problem and the person who came up with the solution is claiming credits there is a difference between coming up with the solution vs coming up with the tool i do not mean you do not deserve the credit for coming up with the tool but are you by chance conflating coming up with the solution with coming up with the tool either way the person should at least mention it was built by you i also agree in a high functional team claiming credit is not as vital because work is well delegated and the success of the team means everyone is doing their work turingincarnate sounds like what we would call academic dishonesty in my business lightfreeflow put your name on the dashboardcreated by insert your self since i created the dashboard i am best to explain do not spell everything out keep knowledge to your self pdxmom and or when showing it to colleagues ensure you are also showing it to the boss playsmartz practice being assertive without being bitchy are there career trainers for data specific roles mentors outside one is company later strategists knew how to interpret and act on the said report and package it for leadership i think you may be on to something here i present tools incrementally first to other data personnel then to end users then to my direct leaders i find this heads off potential issues while the audience is still small resulting in faster adoption and fewer bugs when launched but those who stole credit went straight to executives i never plan to go to executives unless invited my work will speak for itself i am still waiting to be invited to present playsmartz i identified the problem researched possible solutions did concept planning presented recommendations designed mvp tested ux collaborated cross functional and interdepartmental wrote process docs hosted training created communication for launch drove adoption and established maintanence and enhancement cadence i am the data manager for our team but the data manager on another team presented my work later i found out he had been invited to the executive leadership meeting discussing the future of the program my program im really trying not to be bitter about it he is a nice guy never had problems before it just irks me like why do i even bother working with data when all that is rewarded is office politics playsmartz created by i put for questions feedback contact but i can see how direct labeling would further imprint ownership playsmartz catch i do not get invited to the boss meetings because my work is not viewed as relevant enough but my work is not viewed as relevant enough because i do not get invited to the boss meetings but i know my work is relevant enough because others present it in the boss meetings forbiscuit i present tools incrementally first to other data personnel then to end users then to my direct leaders why should end users see your incremental work instead of your boss that is bad work practice because end user will only see half done work and attribute that as bad work to you i find this heads off potential issues while the audience is still small resulting in faster adoption and fewer bugs when launched maybe if the job is done you show the end user for minor iterations or improvements but i do not know the scope of how you deliver your work all in all i feel there is a clear gap here that you are sending results too quick to end users but those who stole credit went straight to executives given the new scenario you painted did they actually steal the work or simply are responsible for the delivery of those reports as part of their duty among other things for example in my company product not project managers are provided with data and product managers use this data to define product roadmap and define the strategy as part of their presentation they may have slides in their deck of slides some data points but the rest of the slide are strategic insights and intuition on where to take the product product managers meet with executives because that is their job to present the roadmap to leadership so if they get promoted it is not because they stole the data but they used it to define the path for the product would that be the case on your end maybe better clarity on the industry and your team structure may paint a better picture i never plan to go to executives unless invited my work will speak for itself i am still waiting to be invited to present to be frank that is another factor for why you are not getting visibility from leadership putting oneself out there even a simple ask of can i be present in executive meetings is something to practice talk to your boss and ask if there are opportunities to present work to leadership given the scope of work that executives leadership are interested in without being bitchy are there career trainers for data specific roles mentors outside one is company i would avoid worrying about it being wouldata specific career coaches are agnostic with regards to the field and they help you position yourself for management roles and developing soft skills if you wish to receive promotion for individual contributoric technical domain then you can ask phd experienced folks in this reddit group for pathways for promotion for ic monkeyunited what that is so unfair to you why would anybody present someone else is work this is what happens when people keep downvoting that human relationships aka office politics are the single most important factor in a career i do not know if picasso is quote is his or not but good artist borrow great artist steal is so true when it comes to corporate life i believe that most people want to be inherently good have good faith in others believe there is a merit based system in place and then there are opportunistic piece of shit who would sell their mother is soul for cash they do not see themselves as opportunistic pos they see themselves as awesome at their career cocodirichlet but who is your supervisor that is the person you need to talk to pdxmom then send an email either before or after you show your colleagues the cool thing you did send it to your colleagues and cc your boss or the boss so they know it is from you thanks for looking at my product today it was a pleasure showing it to you playsmartz why should end users see your incremental work instead of your boss because the select end users i work with are more capable with data than my boss they use tableau my boss does not know how to share files in teams maybe if the job is done you show the end user for minor iterations or improvements depends on the end user i check in with power users for concept viability would this mvp dashboard help your work users who cannot even use vlookup in excel do you prefer blue or red wallpaper if they get promoted it is not because they stole the data but they used it to define the path for the product would that be the case on your end no the product managers are the end users in my case lead data managers on other teams finance procurement supply chain etc positions lateral to me are the ones presenting my work i think it boils down to a difference of understanding corporate culture i expect credit given where credit is due because that is what i do for example an analyst on someone else is team showcased her new report to the data group last week today a senior analyst presented her report to a leader did not even mention her name in contrast i am hosting similar presentations next week i reached out to her and encouraged her to present her report and set up a practice run with her to prep for delivery to leaders maybe i am naive maybe it is a toxic work culture just seems like a system that rewards the wrong behaviors to me playsmartz good artist borrow great artist steal is so true when it comes to corporate life maybe this is simply my moment of disillusionment with corporate life playsmartz this could work i am so doing this forbiscuit thank you for sharing more information about your work i think as you shared it is a toxic and discouraging work culture given the data managers are taking other people is work as their own instead of providing the credit where it is due i am sorry my dude roberteyeah time to find a new job",
  "savethepandabears it is not intended to be this way the original intention for this sub was to be a water cooler chat for data scientists working in the field the official sub policy is to post all questions regarding entering the field in the weekly sticky the mods are usually pretty good about cleaning up the endless entry transitioning threads that get show up eventually there is just so many of them constantly being created that i can imagine it is tough to keep up ghostofkilgore you are not wrong but also any thread that is not some controversial hot take dies an absolute death in here plenty of peoplecome of saying they want these water cooler chats about actual issues or techniques but hardly anybody posts them or contributes to posts like that r machinelearning is also a bit of a graveyard that resembles a bunch of stackoverflow pages with replies more than a lively place for professional data scientists to discuss and debate are there better sub reddits to be in besides this where more advanced topics are discussed not that i know of related subredits seem to have the same problem i asked a ds question and was told that was not the purpose of the sun and to go to a ml sub godofawe alot of people got tricked into this field from other people saying how much in demand data scientists and how companies are unable to find candidates what noone was saying was that experienced ds where in hot demand ds grads are near useless to most companies where there are no data analyst or engineers already present this has cause massive oversaturation of entry level candidates in the data field online certificates and boot camps have also exacerbated the issue employers do not give a shit about your online coursa certificate you need experience to get a decent ds job but you need a ds job to get experience this is a massive bottleneck that has resulted in many people flocking to this subreddit asking for advice on how to get a job an advice i have seen from several other peers was they when from call center manager da ba data scientist you can bypass this bottleneck by upskilling and moving internally inside a company rather than applying from the outside try apply for data adjacent roles then asking your manager to slowy move you onto a data team sapnupuasop r machinelearning is probably the best option as those career questions are not allowed there and more advanced stuff is discussed furthermore this sub sucks so hard as the same shit is discussed everyday cookpedalbrew no it is also for people with low self esteem and social skills who gatekeep complain about the people asking for resources and never post quality content that they would like to see welcome to r datascience randomgravelall of the actual data scientists are busy actually working colibriweiss i believe r machinelearning is much better in this sense skeerp it is definitely the majority we just do not have a community to support what you are mentioning how could we make this better we all just need to post more really artgor a lot of posts trying to discuss technical topics get removed so the sub is basically for general career discussions or for posts like is r or python better rbif someone really wants a good portfolio project then make a bot to identify breaking in posts to use on this subreddit it would be very meta in your interviews voltimeters i tried discussing applications of unsupervised learning the post got removed it was suggested i post on r statistics i think r quant has the same issue but it is understandable i did not post much in this subreddit when i was a student trying to break into ds but i did read a lot of the how do i break in threads and they did help now that i am currently a ds i would love to absorb more technical knowledge i see both sides of the coin but i am more in favor of technical discussions wouldatastoryteller r datachat was created for experienced folks raddymaddy i do not think you are totally off what you are pointing at is the overwhelming need to identify with a group that has not yet reached that threshold of identity cohesion nekokeki yes nearly members in the sub is your answer reddit inherently has a problem where the content quality quickly diminishes as more and more people join purplebrownupdown i swear it is a trend that annoying dude on twitter who is half right and not a real statistician kareem care has switched to posts about becoming a data scientist i do not get it it seems be what is popular it is a trend eezikwultoo i have been on my data science journey for a while now and one thing that i have come to realize is how important it is to have a community to support you it is not always easy and there will be times when you feel lost and overwhelmed but having a group of individuals who understand what you are going through can make all the difference for me one of the best places to find that community is on r datasciencedigest it is a subreddit where data science enthusiasts come together to share their personal journeys progress and insights it is a great place to get inspiration new ideas and to be reminded that you are not alone on this journey i highly recommend checking it out and sharing your own experiences it is a great way to learn from others and grow together none i thought this was a water cooler chat but i got the same vibes as op after making the thread that is currently trending i am tired of fresh grads i probably will not post here often once it dies down the mods are really cut throat i am a senior professional with around years experience just for context everyone has things to learn across data engineering data science ml etc i asked an architectural question and got some great responses from other senior people the mods deleted it and basically said it was a noob question mcermanfamily the public discords for python data science and machine learning seem to be good places for what you are looking for sounds almost like a task for an algorithm koshersloth that is because all the actual researchers are on discord servers there is simply too much low effort posting without some sort of gatekeeping mechanism subjectadr machinelearning covid22partlol it is also caused by data science being a huge field with no defined job roles some dudes are out here working with excel only other dudes are basically swe others are focused on machine learning forbiscuit praise the sun t dysfu or you can work for a couple years as a data analyst to get experience and work towards doing more data science work therealtiddlydump you need experience to get a decent ds job but you need a ds job to get experience i think the bigger problem is that ds is not a field with lots of entry level jobs because the list of skills you need is long so the experience a candidate needs is almost always adjacent to the field some other data analysis work people do not like hearing that though or when someone points this out they get downvoted to hell in the comments that was my path data savvy ops manager to da bie to data science wouldataciensultra please upvote this to the top this is the real answer lol huh interesting savethepandabears ha i appreciate you making that post it certainly ruffled a few feathers and generated some of the better discussion i have seen here in a while could some of the language been softer maybe but it sure was fun seeing battle lines being drawn between people with formal econometrics stats background and people with other backgrounds personally i would be unsure what i could actually post about most of the stuff that is interesting to me ds wise is company internal so i cannot really chat about that or it is really basic and not interesting hence most of my posts are questions that need solving can i ask what kind of content would you like to see on the sub johnnywarbucks de is also a viable path randomgraveli am a full time ds at a tech company i glance at this sub but i am not going to spend my free time writing intricate posts about my work i need downtime to enjoy my life after hrs a week of doing this also the amount of ambiguity i would have to add to presenting how i solved problems to not give away company information would just add more work and time commitment none yeah and there were a few people who work in my space that got exactly where i am coming from including one guy hiring in the space i am glad i made that post here and not on linkedin none i get this i posted here somewhat because anonymity and my post is not about techniques or methods dysfu yeah if you are graduating with a comp sci background this works i took the above as someone who does not have a technical background subjectadi feel like during this tech layoffs i have seen more data scientists let go than data engineers but not sure if this is just my social circle or whether it is a broader trend switchorganic you really do not need a cs background to enter the engineering side",

  "monkeyunited yeathis is super annoying i tend to associate excessive rounds of interviews with rigid culture that had lead to turnovers before so they are being extra careful with the type of people they are bringing in it could also be that the higher up is too busy so he she could not attend the interviews before but at the same time want to be involved with the hiring process i would associate that with higher ups being unavailable for meetings clarifications but at the same time want to be involved with decision making processes edit perhaps more than likely they are down to the last two and would be satisfied with either so they are trying to get more information by flying candidates in if it is my only offer at hand i would fly out it could just be the way they do interviews but are actually a chill bunch pryomancermtga i have had it happen before usually it means you have the job as long as you can get along with the team if you want the job go and focus on being someone they would like to work with hours a day derpthinkr they take themselves and the role seriously and this is not a bad thing personally i think on site interviews in are so strange what could they possibly ascertain about your candidacy in person that they could not ascertain over zoom i would argue basically nothing of importance that being said if they are willing to pay for you to fly out then definitely interested in hiring it is crazy how bloated and lopsided the interview process has become these companies are out of their damn minds betucsonan there could be a number of reasons did you ask them it is totally fair to ask considering that there is a large time commitment on your part and also since you were told that you had already done the final part for companies i have worked with this usually boils down to wanting to meet you in person before committing to hiring you as in they have already decided that you are the candidate they want but they want to kick the tires as it were for other companies this is because they have got it down to the last few candidates and the in person meeting will act as a tie breaker it would not make sense costs considered to fly you out just because they were buying time flying you out is expensive whereas a phone call explaining that you are a final candidate is free personally as a single person with no children i do not mind a trip out for this purpose in fact i prefer it as i would also like to meet face to face before committing to a job but of course everybody has different concerns in that regard if there is a real impediment to your going out there i am sure you could work it out with them wouldatastoryteller i have not been flown out for an on site since but of the time it resulted in an offer within hours you are their back up they are stringing you along until the other guy accepts declines the offer thank you that is sort of reassuring i have already interviewed with higher ups i think but i do get the sense that they are trying to gauge my fit for their culture environment will keep that in mind thank you thank you that is reassuring i agree i guess it might be because the team mostly works in person but it is still an odd and expensive choice that is a good idea i will ask them once they have booked tickets and accommodation personally i am happy to travel too i am just anxious that they have booked this meeting so far out thanks that is comforting keeping my fingers crossed thanks is this something you have experienced or seen someone else experience i have had the unfortunate experience of having one extra interview with the cto and was not selected seemed like i was a great fit for the company and i think i would have enjoyed working there ah i am sorry to hear that i guess i will update this post once things play out good luck",

  "savethepandabears both both is good dl ml ds aspirant for me r is and plotly are better than python is matplotlib and seaborn python r in ml auto ml dl nlp cv de and big data r python for statistical modelling chasinggreenroads i work in the finance and banking space where from my experience python is the main language it is funny though because most job descriptions say you could use either but that would be tough if you are the only r person in a team of people using python r is a great language though just not as common in my area therealtiddlydump what about sas hahahaha hahahaha hahahah lol lololol hahahahahahaha hahahahaha everyone is always argues the language that they are more proficient in is the best it is nice to be able to leverage either language depending on the use case both are brilliant use whatever you prefer or use both my personal preference is r as i am more familiar with it and python lacks decent libraries for the niche areas that i work in public health epidemiology health improvement health intelligence and health inequalities pandasiloc it really does not matter programming languages take like two weeks to develop a working proficiency in if you have a good coding background neither language is better because the situation is just too complex to assign that label with any kind of generality it totally depends on the specific problem you are solving and your business constraints python is more versatile and is more easily integrated with production pipelines but for many use cases r has more efficient implementations of certain models optimizers than python does and many r packages do not have python equivalents at all for ml the situation is usually reversed i do not expect this state of affairs to change any time soon what language you focus on is going to be far less important than your understanding of the fundamental math behind all of this because both languages are designed to make it intuitive to transform mathematical reasoning into code rough pumpkin i would argue that learning one makes you better at the other in the end these are tools that help you do something more tools you have the more ways you think about a problem aeodenfenix love r tidyverse is awesome and is my personal preference but python is more employable frequentiststats any idea where the field is heading should i focus on r more both are required keep updating your knowledge package wise oldmcfartigan r is better in my opinion but python is much more standard in the industry so if you are only learning one of them learn python with julia amandazona if you are working in any biological space r is favored by biological packages in a public health we use r for all our statistics and reports but also use python to automate the updates on our esri dashboards and resolve address to geocodes both have a place learn both you will be more employable grumpybert if you can learn both learn both because that will expand your skillset otherwise the discussion about which is better for what is absurd and tiring streetperformerpersonally i like r but python won the war r for statistics and visualizing them python for machine learning and production software etvnhoteiedr i use both for different applications the both have strengths and weaknesses and compliment each other in that way the conversation should end there both have their advantages in a diverse ds team that is looking to tackle any problem both should be known autumnotter there should not be a controversy you are able to learn multiple languages and you should do so you are a professional and it is part of your job r is nicer for many kinds of statistics tidy verse is great some plotting stuff is better shiny is cool python is a fully developed language and can do many things well that r cannot or that r does poorly bakochba use the right tool for the job the syntax is not that different in my opinion i dint find it hard to bounce between the two while my dominant language is r if the job calls for python or pyspark i will use that they are all just tools in my toolbox nothing more it is both and one or the other what you should ask is i want to work in the blank world doing data science what daily tasks do you do and what languages do you use to accomplish those goals that will give you an idea as to what you should be focusing on wbonreddit in my office i stand in my office looking out the window it is beautiful oh and i prefer python hadouukken i use both all the time i like both a lot i also complain about both i use r at my internship regression time series analysis forecasting making dashboards with shiny maps with leaflet generating r markdown reports from the shiny dashboards ad hoc analysis etc i use python for my personal projects occasionally r too flask for portfolio website machine learning projects sklearn pytorch tensor flow etc django for web apps and some other miscellaneous libraries for random non ml projects i play around with sometimes basically it just depends on what exactly you wanna do but i would say learn python first as it is a more general programming language than r with more applications but r is good to know too easiest answer is just to say learn both r is easier to learn imo like wayyyy easier weonlycryalone rust and julia but that is five years from payoff python but be open minded r still does not have the market penetration that python does at one point i was fully in the r camp with the notion that r is what statisticians use to scale but python what computer scientists use to think statistical the reality is that engineers who know and can do ops on python are much easier to find than engineers who know the same for r that makes python preferable for many businesses gpbuilder it does not matter wouldgrsmith once you learn to code and code well you can get used to the syntax and eccentricities of any particular language i say learn what you can given the data project in front of you and the tools most readily available for that project once you get super comfortable with a language and fundamentals of analysis you can translate that knowledge fairly readily techmlanco both good and both have their use cases would avoid r in any production environments defaultkh i do not think any of them is globally better i feel more comfortable in r because i have over years of experience just started learning python and while i get confused sometimes i can see that it also works well python is more general and r is focused on statistics canyoupleasechill for data cleaning and ml modelling i prefer python for anything to do with statistical inference generalized linear models r is better in general python is more common and in demand for data science roles the closer you get to statistician roles the more you will see r you will also see r much more in academic research have not used r for too long but i find it extremely easy to do linear regression logistic regression and anova using r but i still prefer python overall depends what you are doing desktop data science can be done in r anything that needs to be operationalised python is a better choice recommendation systems gpu accelerated stuff it is gotta be python financial always go for python new day both gagarinkid i think having python as your main language opens you more doors as many answers here suggest there are industries where one language is the dominating one for my domain the automotive industry and my earlier years experience the python stack is the more convenient one with many packages dealing with specific data formats which probably had to be developed in r in general however if you really understand the principles behind an algorithm a visualization or method it makes almost no difference what language you choose edit restructured paragraphs hhoeflin i know both languages well and overall i think python is way better r is easier for certain things when it comes to interactivity and with bioconductor has a bigger set of libraries for biology in everything else python is equal or better and for all of you who now mention the tidyverse consider that rstudio renamed itself to posit without rstudios work r would have been on the decline a while ago and now rstudio is going after the python crowd they recently released shiny for python and i am sure most of their new developments will favor python as well r will be around for a long time but on a slow decline from here on out if you need it in your field by all means learn and use it otherwise go for python matlab milkteaoppa python it is industry standard this question again speedis notfree i hate r and i hate pandas im also fed up of needing to know pandas numpy base r tidyverse datatable just to do that same shit chop up data in memory outthemirror you only discuss this if you have not worked in a tech firm vismortis from a coding perspective i prefer posting this question on the sub once a month mbel_ i think this discussion is settled now r is dead until it was practically the same today i think r will limit you to work only with tabular data and do data analysis only with python you can work with tabular data and nlp cv ai everything that is new is done in python and for basic things r is easier to learn the data manipulation and visualization are better imo pandas matplotlib are imo awful to learn data analysis but it is what everyone uses if i were starting again i would choose python speedis notfree this my language choice is usually based on specific analysis packages relevent to the problem import and reticulate step into the ring carletonphd yes azdatasci this is the correct answer different companies use different tools r python and sas are are good tools to know that will probably cover around if the companies out there you can use plotnine in python it is the same syntax and you get almost the same graphs bigbooftakelilboof i expressed a similar opinion to a recruiter at my college stem fair the other day and he flat out told me i was wrong lol i told him it was not just my opinion but also my departmentstats opinion as well and he doubled down mbel_ plotly is also available in python check out plotly express their api has improved and is similar to ggplot drstatsguy this is the way suppandahugger plotly is not an r thing it is available in javascript python and r waayyzz yes this being the only one using r can be difficult because sharing info between you and colleagues is hard beeadvised i used to work in pharma at a sas only org and they made me feel so stupid for asking about r it is scary how many in the older generations have no clue how much better r python is than sas for pretty much everything i understand the package validation worries in pharma but there have been so many amazing r packages to deal with the issue and make pharma work far more efficient that it is frustrating to see people not know about it the amount of time and money they could save the r vs python debate is ridiculous our time would be better spent converting sas people to r python okkitchensort after sort i am working for a bank and yeah they do sas too even though i do everything in r or python realjedmatic i used sas for a long time and switched to r recently the edge i would give to sas is that the freq and means procedures do not really have equals in r hhoeflin python is better and r is on the decline the fact that rstudio renamed itself into posit and now pushes for more python business hard is a good indicator of where r is going defaultkh there is also a lot of bioinformatics stuff in python i would not say r favors biology eipi why dl ml ds aspirant you are a gem i will install it and try it out thanks wrong about which part statistical modeling r usually gets the phd thesis stats packages where python usually gets ml algorithms r has by far more statistical packages than python though many have been ported to both honestly for of what most data scientists would need or use either language will be capable the other of the time is more likely that r will have an implementation but rewriting it in python would be only a day or two of effort dl ml ds aspirant tbh unless you have used r extensively esp in academics you will never understand the power of r in statistical modelling that said i am finishing my economics phd so perhaps i am biased because i am still new to python but have been using r for years dl ml ds aspirant thanks i never knew that plotly was available for python too dl ml ds aspirant thanks i never knew that plotly was available for python too bakochba on the other hand when you are the only shiny developer and deploying apps for end users you become essential bakochba i am in pharma too and i started as a sas program switching to r was like wrestling bear for a year but after that it was so versatile especially with shiny now there is a movement to move all sas programming to r but people used to sas are really having a tough time validating packages is important but it should not be a game stopper especially when the fda uses r now too therealtiddlydump nothing stopping you from writing your own or loading a package that suits your fancy screend wow i am so out the r loop i did not even know this was a thing toplimepython is not better but r is on the decline speedis notfree bioconductor i am not sure there is even a legit edger equivalent in python if i did not know r i would be out of a job amandazona i said biology favors r techmlanco it is not build for that bigbooftakelilboof yeah specially anything related to r my school has elective courses in python but most of the core classes are taught with r recruiter told me that was bad because python is faster chasinggreenroads agreed i wish there was a good platform that is equivalent to the ease and use of shiny for r it is something i have been looking for for a while edit to clarify a shiny equivalent for python how often do you get asked to do a shiny app i feel like once i suggest shiny some swe from another team swoops in and does it in some other language beeadvised i can empathize with that struggle and even apart from verifying for modeling purposes we could save so much time making simple tables listings figures in r it kills me defaultkh yeah packages for the statistical analysis are often in r but there are also many pipelines for raw data processing in python im a biostatistician and mostly use r while my bioinformatics colleagues mostly use python defaultkh in my experience both r and python are used equally within biology and all bioinformaticians i know openly prefer python eipi have you tried what faster in terms of what both are slow af compared to c or rust both are fast af for math because they just send that hard part off to run in c python or c r in the real world how fast the language is matters very little most of the time instead it is more important to be able to correctly implement your ideas into code once you have the logic down there are usually many ways to make it faster but often it is good enough as is dl ml ds aspirant lol if they wants speed they should consider the devil is language c amishitguy you might enjoy shiny for python an r user and have not given this a shot but have seen some cool prototypes demos bakochba if my team or end users need any tool report listing of dashboard we are in pharma so we have r setup we do not have swe developers available on my end bakochba we are going through that process now except my company wants a tool that uses sql for data transformations i created a bar chart for the number of characters required to achieve the same common tasks between sql and r it is a difference of lines vs in r my company already has an r and shiny server setup but they do not even seem to realize you can wrangle data transform and deploy dashboards on one platform palimpsestr seems to be everyone is favorite it is the most versatile defaultkh do not know why i am downvoted just sharing m experience techmlanco no i am just a python fanboy who hates r okvermicelliunless you work in hft chasinggreenroads i will check that out had no idea it existed i see mostly just curious because i would love do work on shiny work at work but federal was pretty strict on data science people are which never got to and at that point if its not cleaning wrangling analysis or primary viz work its shipped to the engineer or a swe i think banking allows for some redit shiny lol i have never seen a bank that does not do r something stuff but i have no idea defaultkh ah do not talk to my bioinformatics colleagues they would not agree r is the one to go for statistical analysis and visualizations but as soon as you have to go a bit deeper into computer science stuff r is not the strongest language do not get me wrong i love r and use it like of the time but it is quite specialized for the purpose of data analysis compared to other programming languages that are more generally applicable like python amandazona i certainly did not down vote you at all to validate your comment in my bioinformatics minor i most certainly did learn python then sas and r during my mph in biostatistics so yes i agree scopes of biology lean different use cases for both dl ml ds aspirant correct hf traders use c and java algorithmic traders can use r and python bakochba i have people doing manual comparisons of spreadsheets put that on a shiny app and they think it is greatest thing since sliced bread and you just saved the company a bunch of money now multiply that a across whole departments we do visualizations my users do not have a license for power bu so shiny let us us deploy it and control access it is fantastic defaultkh yeah okay but someone downvoted that i do not really understand but nevermind i love it when i can actually do stuff beyond just copying to word i got really frustrated when a lot of that fun viz stuff was pushed into business intel where all they used was tableau i am hoping that this next job will be a little bit more friendly with analysts who can deploy an app rather than just the cleaning and analysis side of things bakochba if it is published online yo can iframe it into rshiny basically any interface with data our end users need is through rshiny because they are not programmers so instead of having to ask for reports to be run in sas we create them in r then have an rshiny with a drop down they can run their reports ad hoc and download them no more waiting always on demand and programmers do not have to keep running and sending out reports the first month i was at my current job i got a request for a simple tool to randomly select rows for oversight checks they were doing it manually hours saved first project on my end then you are absolutely right do not focus on what is the new hotness for data science figure out what your higher ups are doing make it faster i was forced to learn vba because some fuck up wrote the wrong date on a excel file in different instances i should have done the data swap it in r or something regrex but that was years ago i did not know that data analytics was going to be my career path bakochba ha i started in vba because everyone had excel and i could program macros now my first order of business is to rid the org of any spreadsheet macros or manual compares if you seek groups that are using excel you will not only get their hero but you will become the main developer for their tools in r these are not usually the type of jobs that require a swe but they end up having a major impact for departments remember most business users are not used to having web interfaces so a simple rshiny tool that let us them upload two spreadsheets and compared them and does a few other checks maybe a graph or two is like software engineering to them but they rarely get support for that from a swe department that is resourced for business critical tasks",

  "always talk about why you did the projects more than hiw you did it most likely your manager will already know the hows of it if they have any questions they will ask you but if the interviewer asks tou abkjt a cv point regarding your work start off by explaining what the business problem was what you were trying to solve and why you decided to take the approach you did that should suffice most interviewers will likely move on from there or if they are really interested in your project or they want to test your technical skills they will themselves ask the hows of the project do not ever rush through the busimess context into the technical details that just gives the impression that you did not think through about what yiubwere trying to solve rbif you seem like an insufferable cunt you can fuck off it is unfortunately pretty common in the types that are good at data science supplychainphd how would you describe data science as a business function and what is your approach to solving problems rvbin harmonic mean roadtomandible here is a table query it using whatever language you want the amount of people who cannot is kinda high purplenoisecandidate says they are nlp experts or nlp researchers but fail to demonstrate depth beyond apply bretrained bert i have experienced it sooo many times i stopped counting meezyinthemountains if they pass the rest of the interview it is all about the questions for me no questions or basic questions is a huge red flag i need thoughtful detailed questions that show they did research and care about the role or at least about the team dynamics if successful what role will you play what are your limitations and how are you currently working on them thehybridfrog explain why some data science output or insight matters to business stakeholders know what sorts of models are applicable for different problems no need to know the full ins and outs just what assumptions different models rely on prize flow as mentioned i want to know that you understood the problem you solved why did you use your chosen approach were there simpler methods that you disregarded none beyond not having technical skills which are a deal breakers for other aspects what interests you about this position where do you see your self in a career over the next years people are not stupid especially if your in top companies where people generally have graduate education in space what i do not want to hear is you try to flatter me by talking up the company or department i am interested in product yes i know you want our companies brand on the resume and i know your not actually passionate about credit default risk i want to know is there something about the job that genuinely interests you and why we are a good fit is it you like working with data is it that the types of problems we work on interest you is it the type of insights you might be able gain do you like the broad topic you like finance econ ultimately we want someone who is a good match also if i know your saying just what you think i want to hear then i am less likely to want you as a coworker career over the next five years is to really figure out if you want to actually be here versus you just want to use the brand to launch yourself somewhere else for junior hires i expect you to move on to bigger and better things after a couple of years within or outside our company what i do not want is to identify a candidate that basically wants our brand as top bank to launch them self to their dream job at google or whatever we would rather just hire someone who wants to actually work for us bathroomworld i like to see a solid understanding of describing joins and how decision trees work it is a pretty good acid test to see if they know

done their homework on your products and services and have a point of view i have passed on many technically proficient analysts who had no clue about our company focus on solving problems how does all your fancy knowledge help you solve problems i do not care about unapplied fancy knowledge you should be able to explain harmonic mean in extreme detail nicksinghtechcareers lots of good answers in this thread if you are looking for a comprehensive resource of commonly asked questions topics checkout the book ace the data science interview biased tho i wrote it eezikwultoo i have been on my data science journey for a while now and one thing that i have come to realize is how important it is to have a community to support you it is not always easy and there will be times when you feel lost and overwhelmed but having a group of individuals who understand what you are going through can make all the difference for me one of the best places to find that community is on r datasciencedigest it is a subreddit where data science enthusiasts come together to share their personal journeys progress and insights it is a great place to get inspiration new ideas and to be reminded that you are not alone on this journey i highly recommend checking it out and sharing your own experiences it is a great way to learn from others and grow together nicksinghtechcareers well said look into star pattern it is not just for behavioral interviews use this to answer questions about your projects because it is very easy to accidentally ramble or miss some crucial context or forget to talk about the end business results flymypretty yes we wanted to see if the ajpt machines would scale with the chromatographs better when we used a reduced feature set of tx instead of setting adjusters but the feed adjusters for the carbonation machines would not work if we did not fix the incoming pressure parameters minutes passes so we used a random forest and the auc went from to congratulations you have wasted minutes of our minute interview and you have confused me and pissed me off bakochba absolutely by the time you get to an interview i already reviewed your resume i know you know how to code usually i ask candidates to expand in projects they worked so we can understand how you work through projects are you someone i can just assign a project to and you will run with it are you a strong heads down programmer do you take initiative and bring in new projects i am also trying to figure out if you will be happy here can i provide you enough challenge and growth over the next years or will you be bored after a year sandwichestimator i think data scientists are actually one of the types of people that tend to be the least arrogant believe me i studied law for a while if you want to see actual insufferable cunts go look at what kind of people tend to be lawyers or investment bankers cptkeasar i would even say that many maths stats majors do really think that they are more intelligent and or better than others my sister is husband has phd in applied physics and he is just insufferable sometimes you cannot prove anything he knows better you cannot argue he is more qualified you cannot share your opinion because it is not the same as his he will explain why you are wrong when he only became a part of the family my father and i liked to discuss the shape and color of the shit we defecated that day because it was the only conversation he did not try to interrupt with his explanations and half of my coworkers is like that therealtiddlydump but how should op study for that nicksinghtechcareers easy way to just be more likable is look up the company beforehand and understand what they do look up the hiring manager and other ds folks you will likely interview with take a personal interest and ask good questions during the end of the interview about the company their products or maybe them as people ex i saw you got promotions in the last years super impressive what do you think the key to doing well at company x is meezyinthemountains i would not hire anyone who uses this type of language as a hiring manager and a minority in the field this is exactly the type of attitude that is both insufferable offensive and frankly shameful please take your gate keeping elsewhere neelankatan what a vague open ended question yuck why not ask what is the meaning of life the most important thing for any data scientist to know nicksinghtechcareers yup and often these sql assessments are early screening rounds so you def wanna prepare so you do not get weeded out if you can solve the medium difficulty sql questions you should be pretty good for the interview deepcontractor go on then list out the do is and do nots for this speedis notfree surely this in large part is up to the organisation i have not used or studied decision trees in like years and yet i am a data science manager with almost a decade of progressive experience i would probably fail your interview i could however do some reading and be up to speed within a few hours asking specific hyper technical questions during interviews is a recipe for disaster ghostofkilgore that just seems really trick questiony to me i do not think you are really weeding out what you think you are with that intelligentsorti have to disagree no matter what the business question is knowing the data is always the first step jennabangsbangs this understanding of the system you will affect is the most wise knowledge a ds ought have none lol harsh crowd maan i know you jest but the only things i understood in the first oaragraph are the last line and the conjunctions xd but ironically these are exactly the kinds of interviews manager dread voltimeters dated a law student while in grad school can confirm based on their cohort mezmezmeeez i do not know if you have all ever had the pleasure of talking to an architect tm but my god they are the absolute worst lawyers data scientists etc actually have some qualifications to be insufferable so i think it is a bit more tolerable architects though oooo boy typical length completely agree we are more intelligent and just to prove it your statement should have been half my coworkers are like that neelankatan it is a data science sub discussing a ds related question and yet i am having to read about a dad and son discussing their feces sigh i need to take a break from reddit blasketbasket half of your coworkers discuss the color of your dad is shit he should probably see a doctor illtakeboththankyou while acknowledging how annoying that must be to interact with him it is sometimes helpful to remember that many highly intelligent people find people of average intelligence equally insufferable in some ways it really can be like talking to child in the worst case or another species in the average case it takes quite a lot of effort for two people like this to communicate effectively pushing egos aside and all acceptable milk reflection on humility cptkeasar so target attribute is categorical probably we need to choose relevant features first that we can realistically gather gpa iq degree typical length this is also another good way to inform employers you stalk people without them having to do a background check to see your restraining orders neelankatan i assume what you are taking umbrage to is the use of the c word perhaps they are british in which case that word has a different meaning and usage than in the us where it is basically a misogynistic slur supplychainphd that is the point shamelessly stolen from a conversation you theproductpro and reconfigured for this context the do nots is not having a clue what you can bring and more importantly not having a clue what you want from a role i would not call describe how a decision tree works specific and hyper technical seems pretty baseline rough pumpkin hyper specific is a recipe for disaster that is why i prefer to ask what they have recently used then ask how they would go about explaining that to other business owners weeds out those that are saying too advanced things that they do not get in depth and shows that they can explain things bathroomworld a newbie should have recently studied the basic concepts though sue sushi i agree with you i work with rare disease data and if i dig into the business problem before checking the data there is a high chance i am gonna waste my working hours because my data is bellow rows lol naijaboiler no sir knowing the problem is the first step some problems are not even solvable with data ever hiring manager i ever met would disagree with this abdoughnut i do not think they get it studying physics trains you to disassemble ideas if you are basing your argument on an assumption or some bias it is extremely easy to spot it out we are also trained to question everything and sometimes people find that offensive or annoying still struggling to find a middle ground if you are a physicist who does not piss off all their loved ones i would love to know how cptkeasar well at least it is not dad and son discussing how to break into ds without stem degree ejwhite that would definitely be a red flag in a ds interview cptkeasar did you just called me dumb haha nicksinghtechcareers looking them up on linkedin is a far cry from stalking crummy excuse and poor logic many words have different meanings in different cultures but that does not negate the impact they have on people we should not expect everyone to approach language in the same way especially on a forum where participants come from around the world and basically the c word is absolutely a slur meezyinthemountains thanks for mansplaining my reasoning to me the question was about deal breakers and as i have said poor and offensive language is most certainly a deal breaker nicksinghtechcareers exactly i do not think it is that extreme and also if the person truthfully says have not used it in years most of my work is with neural networks then we will move the convo to neural networks and its water under the bridge but i do not think it is too weird to ask about trees or regression during an interview especially if they list a project that uses it during the interview flubberblubberrubber maybe looking into intellectual humility its benefits and how you can increase it could be a good place to start could also start with this intellectual humility quiz and see where you land before reading about it cptkeasar being aware of your professional deformation and not being a jerk to people around you is a good start illtakeboththankyou lol no i would not presume that about you without meeting you in my comment i use average to describe one of the people in this situation it is all relative though i have seen above average people suffering the dunning kruger effect get on quite poorly with standard deviation individuals typical length yeaah but that is not what your example was nick looking up a hiring manager or teammate i agree is fine but commenting on someone is prior roles and discussing possibly personal information not naturally shared in a conversation seems very much to be stalkerish it would make me feel a bit weird and would seem to me to reek of desperation although i suppose you are the expert just remember it is still between you and your victims cptkeasar god forbid brits using english the way they are used to instead of only ever correct american realjiggz this human is a good case study in how to project yourself as disagreeable unlikable and confrontational abdoughnut thanks it is a work in progress typical length when i started my career i had a friend give me dale carnegie is how to win friends and influence people one of the first lessons is he teaches that you are to never correct someone or tell someone they are wrong and yeah i pretty much stopped reading after that needless to say i never learned how to win friends or influence people but i can sleep well knowing i am always right lol abdoughnut i am trying to learn healthier debate habits and wording things in a positive way to help the conversation move forward",

  "onceananalyst when b gives you an offer simply respond that you respectfully decline nothing complex about it no need to negotiate but until you see the offer you have no benefit in rejecting it if you have signed with company a then it does not hurt to call the key contact at company b and let them know you have accepted another role thank them wish them all the best that is it good manners the benefit is that it allows them to move on to their second preferred candidate without any stuffing around own if you think a is best for you just go for it and let b know kindly that you accepted another offer if you want to game the system reach out to b and let them know that you have another offer you need to accept and you will need at least x more and an answer by xyz date before you need to respond to a they might tell you no thanks but you will be surprised no matter what do not allow them to go past your cut off date with a good luck it is a normal thing to chose the better option just make sure to sign first thepinkleprechaun let them know you have an offer and see what they can do unless you would really rather work at a anyways in that case you should withdraw

dear company a nvm yolo sincerely questionsforthrowaway wouldouble click you only have one offer accept it and move on yellowstuff just politely tell them now that you are no longer on the market like tonight right now they are wasting time putting together an offer and potentially missing on other candidates because they think you might accept you are not even withdrawing buddy b has not made you an offer so you simply say thank you for considering me as a candidate unfortunately i am accepting another offer i wish you the best of luck imo you have already gone through the whole interview process for b might as well do a few minutes more work to try and get a better offer say you are under a time crunch and if they really cannot give you a better offer then i guess you have your answer i realize people here ask very very basic communication questions its not that hard buddy zulfiqaar ever come across r overemployed only kinda joking haha congratulations roadtomandible i recruit all

back up slowly into the shadows wiggletimeenforcer do not withdraw anything until you have an offer i would pressure b by telling them that you have an offer in hand and need an answer by a certain date if a is offer is solid if a is offer could be better then either do that or wait to see if you can reneg if b is offer ends up being surprisingly good play them against each other if you can mention the offer is deadline to b and all relevant details see what they come back with they will be thankful for your transparency only do this if you would work there for equal or more pay otherwise bow out respectfully jobeta if you can suck it up a tiny bit longer and tell b that you had an offer from a and you need to give them an answer by xx but that your heart is with b and if they can do better than a bla bla bla you will never have a better chance to increase your comp than when you have or offers i am talking jumps if you really do not want b just email them and politely decline congrats not really sure what the point of this post is the solution is exceedingly obvious just accept the offer a and let company b know that you have accepted a separate offer gracefully if

unfortunately for you i am accepting another offer saying after careful consideration says to the company you have given this decision a lot of thought between holding out for an offer from them or accepting the offer in hand it is not negative but considers that there may be some hard feelings on their end that you are going on to another company organization personally i do not feel like there is any harm in letting them know where you have decided to go assuming that the offer in hand is worth a lot more than the potential offer from them they may want to keep in touch or things may not

ghostofkilgore tell me you have never worked as a ds without telling me you have never worked as a ds needlzor if your entire value as a data scientist is running a bunch of models making some predictions and dumping all the results that in the hands of someone else while washing your hands from any sort of liability then sure you were already obsolete oh please most of the business world is still chugging away on excel amadeusblackwell i think some form of this question has been asked at least three times this week the answer is no for both economic and practical reasons ballzwarrtz who is gonna press the start button doe djalaskaandrew how well can openai communicate and solve business problems with stakeholders can openai learn from its mistakes and build a product that will satisfy stakeholder requirements can openai earn the trust of stakeholders particularly of older generations who are skeptical of technological improvements will openai take responsibility when it makes a mistake that causes a catastrophic result such as confusing causation with correlation that leads to a poor business outcome can it learn from these mistakes in the long run internalwishno you are always going to need to have a human in the loop even if humans become less of a direct contributor one or more humans need to validate and interpret the results otherwise the outputs are of use to nobody to be honest i look at these things as just another layer of abstraction that might be integrated into our work i would sincerely suggest that you stop worrying and find other ways to make yourself irreplaceable zealousidealdrivei do not think so once a certain percentage of people rely on chatgpt for their work they will commercialize it and make it as expensive as an equivalent data scientist hairyprotection the answer to your question is no a reinterpretation of your question could be will chatgpt change how data science is done the answer to that question is likely yes the type of work done will change but people will ultimately still need to act as an interstitial between the tool and the product people were saying the same shit almost a decade ago with data robot dylantmb when has a business decision maker asked you relevant questions without you needing to hand hold them to what they actually want to know that is the data scientist job data scientists will be the ones interfacing with any of these tools did excel make calculators obsolete no financial no tarehman i think your arguments sound like perhaps you do not have extensive work experience in the practical nuts and bolts processes of doing data science reasoning about semantics and the mapping of language onto reality and by extension the mapping of data abstractions onto reality is one of the biggest parts of our job it is also the part that is hardest to train an ai to do bloppingzef how do you think it was even made lol vismortis yes it will no please stop posting about this tangentc if you are a data scientist and genuinely believe chatgpt is a serious threat to your job then your job is clearly at risk not because it is true in general it is because you clearly have such a poor grasp on both the capabilities of the tool itself and how you should actually be adding value to a company that you are obviously likely to be fired for incompetence regardless of chatgpt traanquil do not worry the goal is to outsource every job to ai ghostofkilgore sure yeah i will come back in years and tell you you were wrong outlandish claims about the future are always easy to make because you can never get pulled up on them im aware of what openai are trying to do but an reduction in years is getting absolutely carried away puzzleheaded coming from a different industry into data when self

and keep grinding broadenandbuild my colleagues and i have been using chatgpt everyday for the most part i am very confident that of programmers will be replaced in the next yrs i know people like to say things like oh people use to say this all the time but this is very very different you can see the potential rockmanrk yes otherwiseratioif anything it would replace people doing creative work colickingseahorse tell me how you really feel floridamanmath careful if we post these often enough it will be the same things on this sub and it will be recursive all the way down i swear it is the same things on this sub how do i become a data scientist will x mean the death of the field python or r i swear it is the same things on this sub how do i become a data scientist will x mean the death of the field python or r i swear it is the same things on this sub ghostofkilgore can we just develop a bot that tells people do not bother sure why not fuck off can someone call cgpt and ask them to mod this sub tarehman also what is the harmonic mean chasinggreenroads do not forget which ide do i do vs code or pycharm most jobs are repetitive tasks not all data scientists can get to senior position in top tech companies most of data related platforms are just copy of each other the tasks that supposed to be given to data scientists will be automated by openai sure you can do better than their models but if the companies do not need it where the demand will come from then wouldatastoryteller and they think excel pivot tables are magical sorcery lightfreeflow govt too exporting to excel galore i am someone who is still trying to break into the field and even i am sick of this question it is like hey man if you like data science and truly want to be in the field then pursure what you love anyway ffs and what happens happens i am not gonna give up just because there is risk involved ghostofkilgore is utterly ridiculous blacksnowboader no no no stop the recursion it reminds me of calculus bc blacksnowboader the answer is yes if most of your job is repeatedly doing the same tasks then your job is ripe for automation by openai or anything else lesson do not continually do repetitive tasks automate them yourself and find more valuable things to do needlzor the tasks that can be automated could already be automated ages ago with shit like automl the value of a data scientist is a central multifaceted role they take in an organisation a good read that summarises my thought better than i could is the tentpoles of data science and or the four jobs of the data scientist by roger peng therealtiddlydump if you think this just do the rest of us a favor and leave the field do not look back broadenandbuild let is wait and see",

  "uchimata probably worthwhile to do some simple differential calculus and linear algebra problems by hand to get the concepts refreshed but really the more important thing than being able to do the calculations is to have a deep understanding of the concepts it is not like you are often writing your own implementations of gradient descent or pca but you do need to understand what is happening in the background to grok what the model is really telling you if you can read ml papers and follow what is happening then you are probably good from a calc la standpoint happysummerfor sure you need a lot of differential calculus to do up to date research on neural networks but you can get away with a lot less of linear algebra for applications you rarely need either of them beneficialicethank you man",

  "you have internships and the right academic background why are not you hearing back because the tech job market rn is terrible and you are competing with people who got laid off from facebook google robinhood etc monkeyunited i mean plenty of us work on ml all day everyday it is just there is also a significannot number that do not and their works are just as interesting and challenging it still makes sense to treat it as a goal obtain the goal and decide from there therealtiddlydump i have not used excel in years and i do not make dashboards my company pays other people much much less to do that ds means many things laslog do not focus on what most jobs are right now think years forward and try to be ahead of the curve the next decade it is going to be bumpy for most of us just read a post on this sub about how most ds jobs do not even use ml and use more sql powerbi and excel data science is a marketing term not a field of study at this point it has been stretched so that anyone who does just about anything with data calls themselves a data scientist there is a market for people who perform serious analysis using statistics and machine learning to solve interesting problems for real organizations although i sometimes use excel i have never made a dashboard subjectadwhat kind of data science jobs are you looking for exactly if you want theory academic heavy job then you are really looking for a research scientist or applied scientist role ghostofkilgore i have had four jobs with ds title and every single one of them involved ml what you are reading is not true pandasgorawr just read a post on this sub about how most ds jobs do not even use ml and use more sql powerbi and excel a lot of machine learning has moved to roles with titles like ai ml engineer research scientist applied scientist and a lot of business intelligence product data analysis is now folded in to the data scientist role and i bet my whole masters and thesis on the idea that taking as many ml ds courses as possible would help me get a job but i am not even getting interviews depending on where you live the entry level space is incredibly competitive it is a complete numbers game keep applying you will get interviews if you still do not get any results you might want to take another look at how you wrote your resume because two internships and a master is should be enough to hear back from places and should i keep trying to pursue this field or should i just go with something easier keep at it but you may wish to be open to those adjacent roles at companies working with ml it is often easier to move laterally between teams and keep an open mind about things you may find that these roles that use more sql powerbi and excel can be plenty challenging and if you are diligent about it you will find ways to do the data science that you want to do let me give you some wisdom yes you are young ambitious want to do cool stuff great there is plenty out there go get it what maybe you are not considering is that priorities in life change over time and at a certain point it might be extremely refreshing to be in a job which you can do with your hands tied behind your back and dedicate your energy time brain power to things that can be even more fun than a cool job i spend few years in my twenties chasing the cool job challenging myself every step of the way if i was not working i was studying doing cool stuff in my spare time you know what i was not doing sex and sport bottom line in years i got unhealthy and my energy went down being a chub i also had more issues getting laid so my self confidence went down as well and it did impacted my career and life then i realized that sometimes it is okay to do not do cool stuff for work and take more care of yourself we are not machines we are humans well at least some of us purple brain my advice is to look for machine learning engineer roles i can tell you that i do a lot of ml as a mle dl ml ds aspirant ece please post your resume perhaps it is being rejected by ats sql powerbi tableau and excel sound like da and bi jobs to me data science is a nebulous term so do not give up because not all ds positions have ml and dl requirements playsmartz read the job descriptions i have seen hiring managers post they want a data scientist when the role described is more data engineer or business intelligence analyst a lot of ppl companies still do not know what a data scientist is and use the term like a magic catch all for their data problems suitupyo sql has been the predominant database language for several decades and is not going away anytime soon it is a versatile and valuable skill to learn for a data career the ability to write efficient queries and tune a database is essential for intelligent backend software design and more definitely pertinent to the world of data science and will be for a long time i do both kind of work i work in finance domain so i build scorecards using ml develop segments using algorithms build propensity models using ml monitor already deployed models i also work for enhancing data science capabilities within organisation like working on improving org capability for dl along with this on some projects i use python to build reports and analyse data develop insights i would say its roughly months maybe even more for data analysis initially all i wanted to do was build models and enhance data science capabilities but i have grown to love the da part with time i view ml algorithms as a tool to solve problems sone problems require ml some do not i have also learned that my job as a data scientist is to use data to solve business problems and if sometimes all i need to solve problems is few inner joins and a chart then so be it edit i have years of experience in data science now initially all i did was sql and python also i chose organization where i knew they used ml a lot cocodirichlet have you been networking and asking for referrals from alumni or friends have you had your resume reviewed by friends have you messaged recruiters for jobs you are a good fit moscowgordon i bet my whole masters and thesis on the idea that taking as many ml ds courses as possible would help me get a job unfortunately not necessarily a good bet having good fundamentals in stats and ml is definitely useful in this field but beyond that knowing additional stuff has diminishing returns unless perhaps you have phd level knowledge software engineering skills are more valued you sound like a good candidate it is just a rough market apply to any data job any full time position where you get legit experience in python and sql drakkur as a ds you use the tools that best fit the project some projects i write my own package and deploy for production others they are simple asks and doing it in excel dashboard is better for the stakeholder in very large orgs where teams can get hyper focused you can find positions that are pure ml coding but those are not the majority of jobs in the ds field dl ml ds aspirant yeah that is what i was thinking as well sql excel and powerbi tableau are more like da and bi roles why do you say that i know i am not at that level yet might never be because i might never do a phd but i can do a lot more than excel and powerbi at this point i would be happy doing real ds work modeling forecasting etc or even de work but i focused too much on ml courses and did not take any big data courses only a basic databases course thank you for that i actually agree with everything you said it is not healthy to be working hours a week i get that but is not it kind of a necessity in the beginning like i want to get to a point where i can do my job with my hands tied behind my back for sure maybe something of a managerial position but i also want to work on cool shinny stuff and if there is a time to do chase that it is now not when i have kids and a mortgage for sure the truth is that i will spend a ton of time looking up research papers on ml implementing my own projects learning new frameworks because i truly enjoy it i still find time for physical stuff too but if i am doing all that without the goal of making money then if i can make money doing that it would be even better right i will spend over hours a week learning this stuff might as well do it in a job with proper mentorship and all that and obviously i know it is not the same in a job you have meetings presentations to write documentation and all that but still i know i would enjoy of it mgmillem even that is subjected to the company i am a data scientist on a team of and all of us mostly to ml we have an mle and his entire job is to put what we build into production which seemed weird to me when i joined but it is awesome to have sure and i took a db class where we talked about sql but i only took one because i did not like it i took a lot more ml courses my point is if i cannot get a ds job then most of my courses were useless and i will have to learn everything on the job laslog because in the last years most things have changed ai is right around the corner and the first things that will be automated will be the low hanging fruit in the data industry if you try to learn what most of us already know you will be playing a losing game with the work force that uses it already try to be ahead of all of us future dinosaurs having said that if you are really into ds learn the fundamentals and be amazed about what the future holds character business analyst i am obviously biased by my experiences so take it as such do what you enjoy that is important but find something you equally enjoy outside work work will come to an end a promotion a layoff an opportunity do not handcuff yourself to it the reward for hard work is more work careful in working too hard because in many cases you are digging a hole and not building a ladder so choose wisely politics wins against technical skills when it comes to career progression office space is a documentary not a comedy competency complacency and comfort go hand in hand the more competent you become the more complacent and comfortable you are if you want the money you need to be willing to be incompetent humble and uncomfortable money comes from measurable impact it is not always objective in any job you will do learn right away what are the corporate metrics and their weight a at all of them is better than one in one and in the others corporations promote flexible individuals who are very good regardless of the topic more often than sme mileage might vary depending on the company do not be afraid to take on roles that are completely outside your comfort zone and knowledge domain see point it is harder to climb the ladder to the top if you know only one domain sometimes pays more to be a trout in a river than a small shark in the ocean do not discount companies which are not i have seen mediocre guys make hundreds of thousands climbing the ranks in midsized companies in comparison to extremely smart guys working in top companies where they are surrounded by equally smart guys prestige is part of the compensation enjoy your life you have one in your twenties you do not thing too much about it it will change when you put a in front of your age suitupyo that is honestly just kind of how it is in the industry but for a new hire i would much rather bring on someone with strong sql skills because it just means they can hit the ground running i would not trust anyone to build ml models without them thoroughly understanding the database first",
  "huilingyay hey there i just started learning data science on my own and i am completely new to this field do you have any tips and tricks advices or things you wished you knew when you first started thanks and i am looking forward to your reply eezikwultoo hey there congrats on taking the first step in learning data science i totally get it when i first started i felt like a kid in a candy store but also a little overwhelmed but do not worry you will get the hang of it here is a few tips and tricks from my own experience start with the basics like math and programming concepts it is important to have a solid foundation practice practice practice find datasets and try different techniques and models to gain hands on experience take advantage of online resources there are a ton of free tutorials courses and resources available stay motivated it can be challenging at times but it is also incredibly rewarding collaborate and learn from others join online communities and forums you might make some friends along the way and most importantly do not get discouraged learning data science takes time and practice but it is worth it in the end and remember data science is not rocket science it is more like alchemy turning data into gold good luck and have fun huilingyay thank you so much",

  "acewhenifacethedbase imo the rise in capability and adoption of ai ml is increasing demand for ds is mle is not replacing them but there is no telling what the industry will look like in a decade have you learned any stat and do you expect to conduct research studies in the field of kinesiology learning stat and experimentation as an auxiliary skill in a hard medical science is a common route to transition into ds whisperssssssssssss you are probably better served headed to one of the learning subreddits",
  "autumnotter couple thoughts some people are including their bonus when they talk about and some people might even be talking total comp positions on the coast or for companies based on the coast tend to pay a bit more some people making a lot have a terrible work life balance some people who post on this sub are not just data scientists for example i am a solutions architect but i do a lot of ml and mlops positions like that tend to pay a little more consultants tend to make more than people at standard companies job is generally more challenging though low level management in our fields do not necessarily pay more and sometimes less than the actual technical talent i have made more than my boss at previous jobs savethepandabears switch companies most people with tc have at least a portion of it coming from equity and are working for a company located in a vhcol area you are going to be hard pressed to find a company offering exorbitant tc in the midwest if you are not willing to move further into management posts on here are very skewed someone making an average salary is not going to advertise it like someone making people also get into startups or other roles offering equity and lump that in then a lot of ds roles are in hcol areas so salaries are adjusted i was in socal and made in total comp over a year period between raises and a promotion wanted to move home not a major city and found out those salaries do not really exist so i actually took a pay cut and now make some might see this as a bad move i am full time remote now and can live wherever i want and work is pretty simple so the work life balance and location are worth the loss of pay uchimata i am a sr director running the entirety of our data operation de ds bi and also do a lot of work on data architecture for our client platform i do not make very much more than you even working in a growth stage tech startup and you live in chicago you are doing fine inflation is just making everyone feel poor fwiw though the people making base with equity and bonuses as directors are mostly living in high cost of living areas and working hours a week in tech or finance and they are also usually very accomplished professionally and academically if you are a person running a team doing things like lead scoring and churn prediction for some generic non tech company you are not really swimming in the same pool as people with cs phds building out bespoke deep learning functionality for customer facing applications the closer you are to actual software engineering vs internally facing ds as an extension of bi the more money you are going to make those jobs are also much much more competitive hectoralpha only fans bro have not you seen their earnings data most salaries for ds and swe in tech max out at base everything on top of that is equity bonus always remember that success stories are shared more often than normal or less than normal life it is like surveys the interesting data is often behind the ones that are not answered i know plenty of people in the field working for non tech or fintech making anywhere between to at base level and less than as managers total comp is okay in chicago you can probably live with and save the rest investing at least year between your and a personal trading account should put you in a very good position over years opening opportunities to other kind of more lucrative investments over time unless you are born rich unless you scored to get hired early in a company where you own equity and that company will literally explode unless you win the lottery there is not an easy way to money but time and safe investments are a distant second in terms of effort and results and still better than working forever hoping for the big raise which might never come over i am making hr supporting a family of as a systems support analyst while i go back to grad school and hopefully one day work in data analysis seeing these posts about people not making enough money is baffling i honestly cannot even imagine what it will be like to make more than none to be honest i do not think is a norm and i think the data science jobs that will pay like that for individual contributors are going to be a lot more competitive i am in quantitative analytics in a bank and we are data science agent data scientists in a bank are classified as quantitative analytics from a hr perspective a lot of these insane payment packages basically came from the fact interest rates have been zero for a long time and it was easy for tech companies and startups to take debt and give out equit grants now that the interest rates are tighter and likely to be for some time i suspect there will be significannot correction in terms of pay expectations and rsus are going to be flat for a long time basically i think the people who hopped on from caught the boat at the right time and now it will be a while before the next ship to sail my reason for thinking is this is my entire career has been in leading banks think jp morgan wells fargo bank of america i know what the total compensation packages here look like for data science they are not paying anywhere near what faang has been most of our people with masters degrees with to years experience make base salaries around cash bonus and thats about standard wouldataentryadmin i swear is ridiculous overemployment external consulting that or job hopping worktillyouburk work for private not public will pay better get the next level of education at least having a masters in cs or math get the doctorate hearing your numbers man am i cheap work in public sector though curious spend less no point making more money if your expenses go up too the ultimate goal should be to increase wealth zykezero i am at in chicago you are doin pretty great to me lol bobdope stop complaining bro get a hobby or some shit i forgot to add i work for a telecom company in chicago when i search salary info online my salary seems normal wildcatinmass one option is ml engineering you would have a lot more options with that over conventional ds and there are plenty of remote work to be had in that space if that is your thing other ideas are hedge funds and proprietary trading firmsagain if that is your thing i could also suggest going to consulting but while it would not be difficult to get in and make more money you would pretty much kiss data science work goodbye you should consider other money earning options people always think the total comp which is pre tax you should make sure you are taking tax advantage are you doing a backdoor roth ira are you also contributing fully to your it is not just the in pre tax portion but many companies meta allow post tax contribution and then you can do a mega back door roth and you can contribute another or so are you contributing to if you have kids or are you contributing to your hsa if you have it needlzor this kind of post makes me regret going to academia after my phd you can make more than that as a senior data scientist at a lot of tech companies not sure how many offer fully remote i am at that base but make another with bonus and rsus my company adjusts pay for location but not aggressively enough to make it not a good deal if you live in the midwest iindie you guys took the bait it sounds like you need to switch jobs to one that pays with equity other stuff being equal for a director level in ds is reasonable with bonus being reasonable you are missing the anywhere from year in equity in the time of remote work you can likely find something in a hcol area and be remote nittygrittydiscutant side project if you know how to ds you can use it anywhere by making some low effort high gain thing aggravatingsandi would jump to a start up and get a ton of equity there are lots of startups looking for sr level ds with your level you can be picky and look for ones that are in later stages of fundingmore secure and quicker route to a large payout retirement renokarchnmy i am in a much higher col than you middle management so lower rank and i am only at base maybe after bonus no equity tech is infested with money chasing shits these days i suspect they are better at exaggerating their worth to employers through the interview process than actually doing their work these are also the people who will drop tech work the second compensation drops to normal people levels and start applying their narcissism and greed to whatever the next high paying field is see investment banking law real estate etc all have had their turn slothvibes r overemployed join us you do not need any more money pure greed objective patient op bonus which fluctuates walmart labs broadenandbuild i make plus annual bonus as an ic in los angeles you should be making way more assuming you are not at a startup place where titles do not really matter psychoticom double it and give it to someone else maxtothej move jobs but remember you might need to risk work life balance emphasis on risk people saying you need to work hours to make above or live in a hcol city arent lying but they do not know the market also remember those jobs are competitive so getting the job may not be as trivial as one would like none deleted honeyiatethecat you need to move to sf or nyc ideally sf or the surrounding areas to pull major money unless you get incredibly lucky elsewhere it is unfortunate but that is how of dss making major money get to that point the opportunity density cannot be replicated anywhere else in the country lmao do you like your current job if so do nothing you are already set for life of luxury otherwiseratioi make over in total comp but my salary is lower than yours i am an individual contributor so not direct reports i manage nothing fully remote folk in tech that have salaries are typically making since salary typically caps out a little over typically in a lot of tech careers even when making qkumbazoo start your own consultancy it is a lot more ground work and you get to keep all the fees none sounds like a fine amount of money to me switchorganic some people who post on this sub are not just data scientists for example i am a solutions architect but i do a lot of ml and mlops positions like that tend to pay a little more honestly seems like the closer you are to engineering the more you make though data engineering seems to be a bit of an exception to this but still generally pays well most places seem to have data engineering on a lower pay band than their data scientists and software ml engineers maxtothej some people making a lot have a terrible work life balance its entirely possible to move up pay scale pass that mark while lowering or having less work life balance newpuabie a company located in a vhcol area for someone living in midwest it is by far the best option tc wise to find a fully remote position with one of the tech companies that still offer that even if your comp is adjusted downward from vhcol levels it is still going to blow most local tech companies out of the water good point i normally switch every years but my current job is pretty easy so moving could be a work life balance risk supplychainphd yeah lateral move to a new company is probably the best bet all this makes sense i had a feeling that was the case ds from stanford working at google does not come close to midwest non tech average fellow thanks happysummerif you go to the top thread in this sub there are quite a few people with barely yoe making base now i do not live in the us so what gives natalyarostova for some context i live and work in vhcol city and most senior ds i know myself included are individual contributors making tc directors tc usually hakunapotato correct answer montyxander honeyiatethecat this is not true salary for at big tech routinely goes above for ds and doubly so for swe median might be but is probably at or above source am ds at big tech thanks good advice i was fine with my comp until all this inflation happened all my bills doubled and my salary has not for real if i made i would be happy with that salary for the rest of my career isntthatweird data scientist with a little extra time on my hands i went back to grad school later in life so i feel this reach out if you need help with any ml python azure tableau etc wcpitt i was a homeless orphan who just dropped out of school and ran away from an abusive foster care situation at by i had a couple of jobs bartending and restaurant management and thought i was living my best life realistically i only pulled in a year but spent it the second i got it drinking drugs general irresponsibility at i was pushed convinced to go to college where i spent over a year having sleep for dinner i still felt content i am now with my master is and multiple remote tech jobs earning about if i get this additional position i am currently interviewing for and i feel as broke as ever truth is a lot of what i now earn is going towards things i did not think i would ever achieve my dream cars actually owning a house the idea of marriage kids my current rental being nicer than what i lived in back then of the rest a lot more is going into retirement accounts and even more is going into a hysa my life now feels very similar to my life because of these factors amongst others i have nicer things like a porsche and a backyard but the financial stress is still there and will likely always be there so you could be one of the few that change absolutely nothing once you start earning more but a lot of people do not for the record that change would include the ability to utilize a retirement account not necessarily going from a camry to a you will see for yourself when you get there in the meantime apply to jobs you would consider out of your league anyone in tech that has at least some experience can land a position i promise do not settle for less and know your worth morebikesthanbrains nobody who makes what you and i make is posting about our salaries here years of experience across fields but da only for the last at a nonprofit i am never not going to work for a non profit or in the public sector bc that is what i value as a person so i will drive sht cars and giggle at absurd salary posts here from time to time forgive us chatgpt for we have sinned i am i started at none deleted wouldatastoryteller your salary is normal the crazy high salaries are on the coasts and or at big tech companies or certain types of finance companies okdistancei think it depends on what exactly your role is or what director means at your company it is low if you are leading leading multiple teams but sounds good if you are equivalent to a senior manger at larger companies thiseye you are doing great i know we all want to maximize our money but try not to worry about what others are making maximize happiness all good points i see those jobs and pass on them because they do not interest me otherwiseratioi mean this is a completely perpendicular discussion since these things can be done no matter how much money you make some differences in roth but still they are optimizations but you cannot optimize yourself into more pay without making more money i max tax free and hsa i will look into back door roth thanks limebabies i came here to say the same tech companies that allow remote work are where it is at there are even a few that do not do any location adjustment within the same country i have had offers for a higher tc than op for ic ds positions in a lcol city can you tell me your company or sector dude i am real this is a real questionsyntax error wouldatamystic have you ever seen an example of this yeah someone with yoe does not need side projects maxtothej i would jump to a start up and get a ton of equity the start up equity game is overrated a equity can be dliluted b valuations are a joke c locks up worth long term on a single asset if you want to a higher expected net worth value work at publicly traded company with equity as part of the compensation gobuffaloes idk nothing wrong with selling your skills to the highest bidder companies will not be loyal to you so why should you be loyal to them it is also important to note that scale matters a lot for the value equation on a ds if i am at a small startup with dau and say those dau are driving each per day in revenue if i can drive an increase of that is gonna make the company same equation at facebook with billion dau and i made the company million dollars so much easier to justify higher salaries when the scale is larger i find it amusing that for years bankers on wall st were called greedy and pos for having high salaries but no one says the same when it comes to sky high tech salaries especially when banking has much longer hours and worse work life balance than tech does a lot of people lack perspective and no amount of will ever be enough they may think they are barely getting by when most of the population survives on less than a year these days slothvibes at for sure i do not need anymore money have fun retiring as a year old with that attitude if i can get more money without doing much more work it is simply a no brainer synthphreak says the person with no context but copious assumptions ever had multiple kids ever had a sick relative ever had an expensive loan to pay off ever needed to move from lcol to vhcol pure greed more like pure ignorance especially if you are single income you can go into the red more easily than you think even at no bonus depends on financial performance when poor no bonus when we achieve three times target bonus is capped at do you mind providing some details on your job and background chicago thanks for the info i will look for equity in my next job autumnotter i think if you combine two fields that are complementary but both disciplines of their own you will find the highest demand and often the highest pay both data science and software engineering are careers of their own people who are truly proficient at both fill a niche that is still hard to find same for ds de ds sa etc i really think that moving forward ds and de will combine right now ds and da are more similar but why pay a ds more when all they are doing is da work if you are a ds without solid de skills you are going to become obsolete none deleted jturp sc the odds that you find a company willing to hire you in the same role at a significannotly higher tc without moving and at a good work life balance are pretty slim there is been a regime change with organizations now wanting to run more lean a company willing to pay you something like more is going to expect you to do quite a lot source i am a ml director in a mcol city flair is old and basically all conversations with peers other companies have basically said as much braveforeverwell you just answered everything right here yea trade off between salary and ease of job you have been doing this for years and need to make a reddit post for this kinda off putting truebirch i am in a similar position i work from home know how

easy your job actually is whether it is remote or in office how meeting heavy it is and how good you are at multi tasking context switching managing a heavy workload then look into overemployed go to

it is the uber isation of wanking bold onlyfans is actually an even better business model than airbnb or uber pretty much more info in they had over content creators and registered users extrapolating from the google growth trends it is safe to say they have at least users today i calculated the average revenue per creator per month about and the average subscription fee about from my scraped data applying the commission and assuming only half the users and creators are active we end up with a lower bound of and an upper bound of that is an annual growth rate of between and absolute nuts but how much are they worth according to this article onlyfans takes home of their revenue net of processing and fees this means they make profits between and since the business really does not have to do anything besides host the platform collect fees and store content securely its probably worthy of an ebit multiple of around times this gives a total valuation of between and who knew you could make so much money hosting nudes the crazy thing is that this valuation is probably still too low the estimate of the number of users is likely too conservative the economist has it at also it does not take into account their recent surge in traffic nor the likely sustained increase in traffic due to social distancing see if you can work out why almost all money is made by the top creators the revenue of content creators follows a classic power law distribution the top accounts make something like a month these are not in my sample the median account makes a month the top of accounts make

a lifestyle check and adjust i hear you so loud and clear as anyone else probably i have few feelers out and i am getting similar wages to yours in the houston area for director level position and yes in was a great wage now is meh my property tax itself is on the way to hit year it was when i got the house in morebikesthanbrains and the rest of my career could be just years with that much money none boo boo dude lol natalyarostova you do not have to live like this with ever present financial stress jturp sc i think a lot of folks do not understand how little the field non faang paid prior to the data science is the sexy new field promotion in the mid my time in the field predates alexnet pervasive gpu training etc my first entry level job paid people around would have literally fainted hearing their field would pay tc in parts of the country during wouldataentryadmin i did not see ds director tbf wouldataentryadmin high moscowgordon agree if anything ops salary if above average for a regular company first line manager with good work life balance i have one person under me the plan was to build a team but then covid changed everything guess i have it pretty good limebabies poke around levelsfyi to see what different companies are paying another good place to search is blind blind is a toxic place but the one thing they do well is pay transparency it is a multinational software company nittygrittydiscutant nittygrittydiscutant yeah does not want to add tasks but would do aggravatingsandi just got hired by a start up pay is top knotch and equity package is great i do not think your last statement is very objective maxtothej idk nothing wrong with selling your skills to the highest bidder companies will not be loyal to you so why should you be loyal to them exactly elon stans and other folks who want to fight to give the richest people more wealth are just weird to me renokarchnmy there was an article years and years ago forecasting the current state of tech we have today basically they posited that as tech salaries were increasing the trends emerging were that people who would have historically gone into finance and law ivy fraternity white upper middle to wealthy parent solely seeking money with highly aggressive borderline narcissistic personalities etc would flock to tech and transform it from an esoteric and highly difficult field staffed by somewhat reserved and dedicated people with deep interests to something that resembles wall street circa they were not far off with their prediction of posts on sites like reddit and blind are about compensation or degrade into dust off your resume and start applying because you are underpaid guys like bezos went from dopey ass oversize button down wearing bald to roided out puffy vest wearing post low t with a new girlfriend who is more ppm silicon than the latest iphone musk who manages a fleet of gestational carriers to ease some desire he has to single handedly solve depopulation zuckerberg who is stuck developing his own digital escape from reality despite having all the worlds resources at his fingertips to enjoy sites like blind where you cannot even ask an innocent domain question without being berated for not mentioning your tc and then having the responses drift into harassment because somehow your domain question is not worthy of answering unless you sport some ludicrous and likely fictitious just takes a single long term contract with faang that requires you be issued a domain email and then sign up to blind with it before the contract ends compensation package most of the country gets by on way less than median income is half that and if you get paid you make more than of us workers you want more money and less work get a life mate do not listen to that guy go get as much money as you want and do not let anyone judge you for it switchorganic i agree i was speaking more to the compensation bands set by companies it seems pretty common that data engineering salary bands are lower than the other roles autumnotter perhaps but i would suggest that actually being truly proficient at both requires an extremely experienced or knowledgeable person if you assume that data science includes knowledge of at least one domain which is a minimum in my opinion that means that data science requires knowledge of statistics machine learning some visualization a domain like finance marketing biology etc the scientific method and actually treating their job as if they were a scientist the ability to present and interpret the results of ml and in many cases deep learning algorithms and probably some mlops at a bare minimum an understanding of mlflow and something like hyperopt at least one stats ml language in addition to sql ideally r python julia mayyyybe rust in the future also there are important apis that are not really separate languages like spark ml data engineering on the other hand should require an understanding of etl elt a number of technologies informatica dbt fivetran airbyte etc definitely python with libraries like sqlalchemy django requests etc are a must data warehousing multiple database technologies definitely relational oltp olap probably with some nosql or graphql and possibly other technologies like streaming edge delivery big data technologies like kafka hive spark for transformations cassandra etc also potentially important for data engineers are software engineering skills deployment data versioning testing etc finally other languages i have seen pop up for data engineering would definitely include java possibly javascript and again in the future rust now you might say that no one has all those skills in either area my contention would be that that is because we do not have very many data scientists or data engineers that are experienced in or knowledgeable in all the areas they should be someone i would consider a senior data engineer would have experience or knowledge in at least of what i mentioned above though not necessarily true expertise in all those areas just my opinion but i personally think that de will merge more with software engineering while your average data scientist will need to expand to understand experimentation frameworks at least one domain and become better programmers and better at moving and transforming data it is possible that the explosion of data scientists will scale back some and data scientists who are not doing significannot ml work will start to be recognized as a different role such as bi developers or simply senior data analysts wouldatastoryteller analytics engineering roles keep popping and i think it is a hybrid of de and da or ds tfehring with op is experience they would still be pretty competitive for those roles if they have the technical chops they would not be coming in a director level likely a first level manager if not a senior ic but even with the downlevel they could still expect significannotly more than in total compensation johnnytork oh stop there usually are not many opportunities to talk with others about something like this no one at work unless you want to jeopardize your position few people in the industry in case they know people at your work or even friends family who understand this line of work i am on a fence about moving so i wanted to see what others thought like when someone posts salary of is there a detail i am missing that would explain it like more work hcol etc yeah i developed health issues due to stress but those are going away now i want more challenge but do not want health issues excellent idea i often volunteer for extra work because i am bored i could stop doing that and take an extra job instead yes i am doing that but i would prefer to return to my lavish lifestyle dl ml ds aspirant that property tax hyperinflation is insane may i ask where you are gobuffaloes this explains a lot a ds director at faang would typically manage an org of at least likely with two levels of managers do not expect the same comp as someone with that much scope you might be more like a first level manager in those companies if you did want to go that route now is a great time you would get base tc and have a huge opportunity to grow equity portion with stock prices as depressed as they are right now but yeah wlb could suck i left faang recently and moved to a similar tech role that is still very stressful but hey i am making great money so cannot complain ah yes but side projects will get him there amirite it is also perfectly reasonable to have a lateral job switch while observing a substantial salary increase a increase for a director based position for an experienced guy is extremely achievable maxtothej and equity package is great i do not think your last statement is very objective you missed the a b c points if you are taking quoted equity package valuations at face value from private companies startup equity is a lottery ticket and most will age like a lottery ticket thats why i mentioned expected value which should be familiar to folks in ds expected value is value adjusted by probability edit would any financial advisor tell you to take n thousands say put and take choice b out of a put the money into a diversified portfolio of the s and p and bonds adjusted based on your risk tolerance b put it in some random company to buy k stocks which can be diluted and lock it up for an unknown amount of time because in a publicly traded company the equity is liquid once it gets vested so you can sell it and do a ramblinginternetnerd i saw that when i was at a faang my nerd paradise got replaced by really fake plasticky people who want to push their world view on everyone i do not think it is quite the same as the law finance environment but there is definitely a lot of people who went to a year boarding schools from age onward who marvel at how some people survive on only a year like how are you supposed to live without a nanny and a sq ft house in sf such a great comment and totally agree westerncivi this is such an insanely uncharitable view of how people at high paying companies are i know a very small number of people doing truly mission driven work in ds and those folks are willing to accept a pay cut to work in those fields but those types of jobs tend not to be that competitive demonstrating that not a lot of people voluntarily want to accept a lower salary tech is one of the only industries where the wealthy have been forced to share with the workers and for you to say all of those people are narcissists is just wild instead of shitting on people who have gotten paid a decent wage relative to how the business is performing you should want that for people in every industry and the pay for ds at these places is not crazy when you understand many of them have a phd which required a bachelors degree and then a minimum of years of virtually no pay and not gaining job experience and then living in hcol area these people are not any less qualified because they do not pass your litmus test for being nerdy and the entire industry has benefited from a scarcity of labor relative to demand people seeking to be well paid are not monsters and there is an entire field of academic study called economics which suggests they are rational i am gathering info and weighing my options everything has a pro and con why are you so angry benthehokie firms want the most amount of labor for the least amount of pay thereby it is not unreasonable for workers to want the most amount of pay for the least amount of effort lilolmilkjug also potentially important for data engineers are software engineering skills deployment data versioning testing etc i would say without these skills you are not really even an engineer there is no reason to have data engineers who cannot work in software teams because if they cannot code and integrate solutions in a software team then they are kind of useless at generating source data point and click des are kind of glorified analysts in my opinion they often live in hcol areas and almost always work for companies that are located in hcols many who are remote are still within commuting distance to an office you will find occasional people on here who are remote employees that live in lcols but not a lot of companies in this market are willing to pay you sf money while you live in oklahoma tcs are still on the very high end of spectrum in data science and a lot of that compensation is paid in stock which is probably down yoy at the moment if you are getting in cash and like your job personally i would wait for the tech market to improve a little before trying to make a switch so you would be more likely to receive competing offers for leverage wouldatastoryteller it is usually a mix of hcol and being able to land a job at a tech company which means they can get through very competitive job interviews tech screenings tough questions not to mention standing out amongst hundreds if not thousands of resumes so maybe a good network too no one is just handing out salaries unless you can back that up and no one is accepting it without knowing there is some risk long hours tough projects moving or risk of layoffs for seemingly no reason like we have seen this month wouldatastoryteller make sure you read the fine print of your employment contract before doing so you could risk you job troyboltonislife you certainly could id recommend taking on a contract role since it is less risk and causes less headaches can also try and finesse a new job with slightly different hours to cause less overlap lot of tips and trick in overemployed subreddit but anyone who is bored at work and wants to make more money and do more work should look into going oe can completely change your life maxtothej why are you getting downvoted you are entitled to aspire not expect for a higher wage moscowgordon now is a great time great from an equity perspective i guess not an easy time to get in though thanks good info i do not really like managing so i would not want to exceed more than a few people i also hate budgeting and other corporate stuff maxtothej you might be more like a first level manager in those companies this most faangs will consider management levels based on the number of people under your rollup not the title aggravatingsandyes but your a b c were worst case scenarios this person is at a comfortable position and can be a passive candidate where they can vet their choices also a smaller executive structure will allow this director to be at the level they want and still be hands on maxtothej like how are you supposed to live without a nanny and a sq ft house in sf i could give shs about that since companies arent going to lower the prices of their goods or service in the absence of that the only difference is investors get better returns or execs better pay packages renokarchnmy if you simp for rich people enough they will make you rich too s i still argue that even data scientist need to know deployment version control testing etc very good point thanks wouldonobinladin plus make sure to freeze your hire right stuff cannot remember the name of it off hand but there is a way to freeze your work background from searches gobuffaloes true plus potential layoff risk if you do get in but fortune favors the bold ramblinginternetnerd at a faang and similar you would be a team lead probably amazon equivalent is also probably similarish comp or maybe a bit better think depending on what ladder you are tacked on and whether or not the stock tanks or explodes possible usually higher pay with more coming from equity maxtothej yes but your a b c were worst case scenarios b and c arent worst case scenarios they are the reality i have never heard of a company with a legally required timeline to go public or have any exit so c always applies b is just the reality the the fmv has a whole lot of leeway for private companies also big picture its just basic financial sense equity packages are lottery tickets for private companies even for public companies they have some risk but at least are easier to make liquid would any financial advisor tell you to take n thousands say put and take choice b out of a put the money into a diversified portfolio of the s and p and bonds adjusted based on your risk tolerance b put it in some random company to buy k stocks which can be diluted and lock it up for an unknown amount of time because in a publicly traded company the equity is liquid once it gets vested so you can sell it and do a westerncivi you could easily characterize any job that is not at a nonprofit or government as simping for rich people that is just called doing a job anyways your post history tells me you are just trolling for attention should have looked at that before i bothered addressing you nekokeki thinking about some of my own tendencies i also would not discount confirmation bias as well if you sample this subreddit for salary ranges you are more likely to recall the highest total comps in reality there is a lot of context that puts them in a smaller percentile of people in the field as the commenter mentioned above factors such as hcol faang senior leadership level etc actually makes me curious does anyone have a general idea of what of tech jobs are in faang thanks for the info i have never been interested in faang because i do not think i am a culture fit but maybe it is time",

  "as a senior ds with yoe all the time i feel like part of my pay is knowing what code to copy lol i work as a senior data scientist and cut and paste code all the time much of my work involves writing new programs but i reuse as much as i can i do exactly the same create functions if i anticipate using that many times in the future i do not see why anyone should not do that dsjohn i copy paste the majority of my code of course i wrote a lot of it to begin with but most of what you need to do has already been done by someone else why would i rewrite good working code just to say i did it idgaf about any of that i have things to do and rewriting a function someone else has already done is wasting my time i have cleaning routines ml test harnesses model speed and accuracy tests tons of stuff already written and ready to go if there is something i am going to do more than once i make the code or find it and just reuse i never write anything totally from scratch forbiscuit it is so effective to write clean modular scripts that i can reuse though i have a problem where i cannot some of those scripts that i have not used in a while syntax changed or whatever or my custom class library that holds my scripts is bloated sozinsky when to copy and paste code is question that on the surface seems quite simple do not but when you dig in it is quite subtle by way of anecdote i was once working with a fairly senior quant who put me as reviewer on a pr where he had copied and pasted a bunch of code and i asked him to refactor the copy pasta to a shared method some months later he put me on a pr where he had put a copy pasted block of code into a shared method and was justly surprised when i left him pr feedback that he should have just copy and pasted what the heck at the time i had a hard time formulating why my intuition had told me in the first pr it was bad and in the second it was good and i have plus years of professional software dev experience so i pondered the question on walks in the shower taking to senior devs and eventually formulated this rule of thumb if your shared function will always be called the exact same way by every current and future caller and any change you make to that code will be benefit every current and future callsite then you should refactor to a shared implementation function class module package however if your function will change for reasons that benefit some callers to the function but not other callers then you should copy paste consider a function foo that takes no arguments and does something useful you find three call sites in your code that all want to call foo on exactly the same way and all have their own copy paste foo function you refactor foo to a single function and change the call sites to use foo but then a fourth client comes along that wants something a little different from foo rather than copy paste foo to a new function you add a default boolean parameter to foo say foododifferentthing bool false you add special behavior to the foo to handle this new boolean flag and life goes on but then a fifth caller comes along with its own special consideration add another default parameter now the function foo which was once this nice clean thing is suddenly a screen or more in size and has some gross nested conditions but at least you did not copy paste one day you realize there is a bug in the fifth call sites code which you fix but accidentally break the common code in foo that all five call sites used now you have broken all the call sites because of your slavish devotion to dry do not repeat yourself it turns out the right design call was to copy paste for the fourth caller and copy paste for the fifth caller do not be afraid to be wet sometimes being too dry can dramatically increase code coupling and lower code cohesiveness it is because code cohesiveness and coupling are so effected by the copy paste question that i gradually realized that when to copy paste and when to not is one of the most important questions in all of software development the hardest part about this is pondering what future call sites are going to need out of your shared function this requires that you ponder your system as a time series in motion and being rocked by current and future requirements changes to business regime political battles etc it is hard to do and likely why people that are really good at api design are heavily coveted therealtiddlydump if i find myself copy and pasting more than twice i write a function chasinggreenroads i would say every single time i am making something from scratch it is okay to copy code the key though is to understand why it works wouldatastoryteller why would not i do this or write a function to do it seems like a waste of time otherwise my boss does not care that i know how to do all this stuff from scratch she cares that i am using my time efficiently to solve problems anygeologistif i find myself copy pasting code on the reg i turn it into a function package hikehikebaby sometimes copying and pasting code is more readable than if you write a function and call the function especially if you are sharing your code with other people who do not know anything about the functions that you wrote i think that it is fine as long as you are not copying and pasting regardless of whether or not a certain piece of code is applicable or copying things from the internet that you did not write and do not know how to write my goal is always to write efficient and highly readable code because i share my code with others on my team i do not want to call functions that are not defined in the same script or a part of a package they are familiar with and i do not want to copy and paste anything that is not relevant godblessthisghetto constantly i do not remember the steps needed to call our data from the warehouse to my script but i have definitely got the function saved with a typo my coworker accidentally put in on a number of projects i pull from beyond that i constantly have situations where i know i managed to do something in a past project but do not remember how specifically so i will utilize the code from those older pieces i am paid to solve problems not type extra words when the solution already exists nellucecon sometimes i will copy paste individual lines bc i forget syntax but i pretty much never copy paste more than a line unless i am reorganizing code into different files etc i program in julia which makes code reuse and extension really easy i have local git repos of julia modules in my development folder and i add my development folder to loadpath in my startup script this way i can add a function to the appropriate module whenever i think i might need it again and if in some future analysis i need the function i just type using modulename i coded my matplotolib plots in functions i actually understand and i have never had to update them bboycage i always go through new code a line at a time and put my own spin on it as i go straight copy pasting is something i reserve for when i am strapped for time it is kind of a silly thing that people care about copying and pasting code whatever you are doing is just a small compared to the crap tonne of prewritten code that is imported and ran before it even considers yours jorrissss if you mean literally copy paste then very seldomly reusable code is modularized and imported but i do not frequently straight copy paste code at that point continuewithapp almost every time when starting new some of yall know how to write code i thought we all copy pasted the same year old lines thephoenixrisesagain you should be fired if you wrote all the code from scratch every single time it is just stupid you should always copy as much preexisting code as possible be it your own code some coworkers code or something you found on the internet grimm_ i dare you to post this question in a software developer oriented subreddit and see how different your answers will be every fucking day hypebraindisorder never if it happens once i keep the code into a a function and reuse through the projects and even across projects it is honestly easier than copying and pasting things it is a good thing to learn to split common tasks into a separate file and import it as you would any library code to ingest or write out output for example only needs to be done once maybe i misunderstood your statement but if the question if i resume code then its constant but i would not necessary call it copy as much as i just import it from shared libraries that we setup eezikwultoo i have been on my data science journey for a while now and one thing that i have come to realize is how important it is to have a community to support you it is not always easy and there will be times when you feel lost and overwhelmed but having a group of individuals who understand what you are going through can make all the difference for me one of the best places to find that community is on r datasciencedigest it is a subreddit where data science enthusiasts come together to share their personal journeys progress and insights it is a great place to get inspiration new ideas and to be reminded that you are not alone on this journey i highly recommend checking it out and sharing your own experiences it is a great way to learn from others and grow together gagankuall the time then make changes to fit the need bangboom_ i even have a private github repo to save the code i wrote before and add tags to make it convenient to search the code i need to copy sometimes i would think how can i write these amazing code i was so smart lol mrbrambles for real in some ways data jobs are figuring out how to automate processes and reduce repetitive work if you are not thinking about how to reduce your own repetitive work then you are missing out on lots of opportunities same i would use all the visual tools i can automl whatever else allows me and my team to have a mvp in the least amount of time and effort management is happy team is happy they are not complaining about the massive computing bill play the game live happy wouldtrned it is just knowing what to google and where to reuse recycle code simple as that ahh okay good to know it is not just me then also how often do you find you are looking up the syntax etc for different things when you are working i feel like i sometimes forget things but a quick google and i can usually apply whatever thing i have read to my data i remember doing a lot of that even during my masters both in r and sas to have equivalent stuff with snippets and functions especially for things i had a feeling i would not use much on the first job it did pay dividends none removed thepromisofhappines we found the scrub sort yourself out ffs if i do look stuff up it is usually a quick help xyz at the command line thetjalian honestly knowing what you want to happen and the logic you want to apply is half the battle there is a reason why things like msdn exist you cannot remember literally everything as someone who jumps between c and vba sometimes i forget the most basic shit like how to start and end a switch case purely because of the different syntax vba why the fuck is a select case sozinsky i recommend this book to all my quants is clean and easy to read summary of best practices in writing software worth pointing out that it is not a book about computer science algorithms data structures etc it is about how to write clean code how to work on teams with people writing code how to document your code concepts such as cohesion and coupling concepts such as wet vs dry how much copy paste you allow in your code etc it is the kind of book i wish i had had back in the when i started my career but then a lot of the best practices in software engineering were not known back then most data science quant teams are not great at this stuff so even being a little good at this stuff will put you head and shoulders above most found the insecure guy who thinks you have got to memorize everything or reinvent the wheel to add value wouldtrned the question was not about knowledge but coding clearly you have no idea as ask any competent developer and they will reuse their own code or someone else is of the time if you write everything from scratch you must not be that important or productive to have the time thepromisofhappines did not say that but theres a big difference between checking docs and reading the manual to being a stack overflow scrub thepromisofhappines you are not talking about re using your own code though you go to stack overflow and copy and paste and try to rejig what you see there if it does not work yous tart googling again

  "the choice between holdout testing train test and k fold cross validation is usually indicated by the number of observations available generally one prefers to use the simplest test procedure possible holdout testing and only resort to a more complex one k fold cross validation or bootstrapping when the observation count becomes too small clldataethics are you working with linear regression models or was that just for example i believe that cross validation is most used with black box models as a way to protect against overfitting and improve generalization for linear regression models i think it is best to use all available data to estimate the parameters there are many techniques to prune variables in a regression model such as stepwise selection or lasso but if you are in a scenario where you must use k fold cross validation do you choose the model on the cross validation rmse or after making the training using cross validation you use it on the test set and compare thanks for the reply just an example that came to mind i just wanted to understand how do we select between different model structures based on cv test rmse or on the isolated test setop antoher account in the simplest k fold cross validation situation there is one modeling procedure and it is executed k times testing each time on the remaining fold these test performance measures are averaged to estimate the performance of this modeling procedure on this type of data the final model is fit using the exact same modeling procedure on the entire data set in many instances the modeling procedure may include some self adjustment such as forward selection of mode input variables as long as the procedure parameters are consistent such as the limiting p value for forward selection then nothing changes in the event that data must be held out for the modeling procedure itself to search for hyper parameters etc then things get more complicated and testing is nested or some other test procedure is used so in the end we use the test error to select the best model sorry just want it to be perfectly clear thank you no the test error indicates how well we expect the model to perform in the future step by step assume that we have observations and we have decided to use fold cross validation on a modeling procedure of linear regression with forward selection limiting p value randomly split the observations into folds groups of each construct models using linear regression with forward selection limiting p value each time using folds and testing on the remaining fold average the test performances to estimate how well this modeling procedure does on this sort of data finally apply the exact same modeling procedure to the entire data set to discover the final model finally apply the exact same modeling procedure to the entire data set to discover the final model alright so we do indeed use the cross validation to select the model structure which to use so if we have different model structures feature linear regression vs feature linear regression and apply on both cross validation we see which one leads to the lowest rmse for example and then using the model structure we make step by step you have mentioned in order to obtain the final model correct thank you for answering i am indeed a bit slow",

smallbrain customers to have value this sort of solution needs to be actionable by a high school diploma holder in something like real time not a quarterly report or weekly summary to executives or frontline managers not a tableau or powerbi extension that is just not the sort of financially responsible approach companies use what is actually used is some controltower spotters monitoring systems and processes you install some light data analytics gauges and control limits so the spotters see when a subsystem like a warehouse has trailers piling up in the yard not being unloaded you invest most of your energy in optimization of those bottlenecks and failure points so the smallish team of controltower spotters alert the operations folks who manage those systems to the problem then experienced managers in ops solve the problem with the controltower watching i know that sounds unrelated to out of stocks in store but that is where the root causes lie of course we have data modeling upc level inventory on individual store shelves and we have bigbrain optimization software to handle lead times and safety stock other variables mentioned in the article but there is no world where a company wants to hire an army of business analysts to watch screens of pretty bi dashboards of individual store item level out of stocks and i guess speed dialing stores and hassling workers that do not report to them the reality is retailers are accountable for selling their supplier is products and they measure if that is being done well or poorly or if the supplier is not fulfilling purchase orders and is root causing out of stocks standard stuff a sheet of paper showing someone is not doing their job so that manager does some ad hoc analysis to diagnose and address the systemic issue not hiremore business analysts to look at dashboards showing them problems they have neither the know how authority or resources to solve what is the end goal are you trying to forecast sales if you are trying to forecast sales you should be able to identify oos if you have a daily inventory snapshot or by simulating inventory using starting inventory intransits sales with oos identified if your goal is to forecast sales you drop that data point and impute sales in the oos week using previous and future weeks thetanfree if you know your product substitution complement structure ie sales covariance matrix you can try to estimate a stock out event from the corresponding uptick drop off in sales of its substitutes and complements this approach lends itself to bayesian estimation with your priors informed by the substitution complement sales patterns redbearduse inventory data you create an expected forecast to order the product usually and then use the forecast to determine if the units are moving fast or slow relative to expectation this gives you the signal to determine if you have low or high sales velocity relative to the initial forecasts low vs high is all relative to expectation if you have no expectations you have no comparison on a meaningful level themediocrepoet i would get a trial of alteryx and play around with the diff models that they have or use manually abc to classified product on their yearly numbers sde focuses on how product moves if you want to understand your data vs having a bias vendor tell you start at crisp dm and learn or hire a data analyst maybe someone has a specific model that gives you exactly what you want good luck is it your own product yoyomadiet there are a couple of things to consider here from an effort perspective i would recommend trying to source the inventory data if at all available rather than try and predict it from a value and effort perspective otherwise to effectively model out of stocks you actually need out of stock labels otherwise it is some sort of basic time series heuristic supplychainphd seconded on the pps retailers suck at having accurate on hands it quite literally plagues the industry with that i have literally no idea how this solution would help a retailer i am making assumptions having not seen how the ai works but i would presume that when an item is not selling they suggest placing a replenishment order all that will do is fill up your back room with freight and clog up your processes they are also not taking into account when consumer make substitutions for another product fun fact you can actually model and use inventory data to see when consumers make substitutions without using fancy ai coming from retail ops and moving to data science this article clearly is triggering for me giantzorg one thing to note here is that the number of units in stock in the system is a notoriously unreliable quantity we have estimates at work based on inventories that around of our stock numbers in the system are wrong how wrong is another question this is worse for articles that sell a lot for which the effect of wrong system numbers have a bigger effect on the sales numbers romanriesen there is also the average storage time stock spends between buying and selling which is also an old school business accounting metric thus being easily related to the business side andprobably collected p s i am not ds nor accountant just cs student drict in some cases the backroom has a trigger for products that were expected to sell that are not this can go to the lp ap sales floor team as a task to validate the counts are correct this solves a lot of the issues with regards to what is going on that being said there are some companies that do a fantastic job tracing stock and keeping it on the shelf and others that do a horrendous job even down to the store level target is notorious for being on top of their on hands they give incentives for the stocking tm for identifying if a box is mislabeled they give incentive to the back room to have every item in the proper zone properly counted and shelved prior to shift roll overs they give incentives for the push carts for being completed usually have at least tm per area of the store pushing product if it has product to push managers end up doing this a lot ap lp security team does rounds and gets alerts for quantity changes threshold is set by the le manager and will investigate why their is a count discrepancy for a huge amount of the store that being said during busy periods the fitting room usually gets jumbled all to hell and the push carts tend to fall behind but it does limit your exposure for places to look for missing product prestigioussortnot all places track stock in unit at a given time well once in store it csn be a black box but you should absolutely know how much stock was sent to that store if not problem needs to be solved and how much has sold unsold ordered should be a good start plus there might be another model or heuristic on expected damage theft you can discount maleficentsalmon just a question based on your experience do brick and mortar stores do stocktaking every day or do they do it periodically weekly monthly giantzorg it only works for products with a high turnover you are conpletely right the cause of these problems is not the supply chain it is everything that goes on inside the store mariaadel spot on that is a huge part of the problem would you mind if i dm you please do you have a degree in stats mariaadel oh thanks a lot i will dm you maleficentsalmon is it okay if i dm you too chitinid unless you can have data that informs you about the mechanism that is causing stores to lose items no amount of modeling is going to do any good even if you do there is a fair chance it is pretty useless say you have a store that loses items that are inactivate of the time unless you can drill into which items they are likely to lose you are at best guessing and not very accurately mariaadel thanks for this excellent write up not sure if you are at liberty to tell me what models usually work well with data modeling upc inventory level per store is bigbrain software built in house feel free to dm if you do not feel comfortable commenting publicly thanks mariaadel part of it is forecasting yes but i believe the bigger part is the management team trying to know if the product is not selling because it was simply out of stock not available on shelf or because it is slow moving and there is not enough demand for it in that particular store mariaadel wow interesting have you tried this approach before thanks mariaadel very helpful thanks but in this case we need quite accurate forecasting to help us flag this issue what forecasting models would you suggest mariaadel thanks i do not have alteryx but keen to know what models they offer that might solve that problem what does sde stand for please no not my own product i find this quite typical put data science before the data end up with how do we know if an item is out of stock well let is infer based on the actual laborious but correct answer of course is well let is track it obviously paying a junior data scientist to come up with some bs model is cheaper than properly managing inventory too bad it does not work supplychainphd missed ops actual question how are stock outs dealt with depends on the company and cause for a long time companies had in store personnel place a manual order for items now if there is a decent ims they have in store managers correct the inventory count to try and let the system place the order it is all about on hand accuracy bonus companies are starting to use rfid labels to automate part of the inventory cycle count process retailers suck at having accurate on hands getting a little off track here but can i get a quick summary of why this is i know nothing about retail but honestly it is a little baffling to me that this is such an unknown uncertain quantity im a company selling widgets i know how many widgets i ordered from the regional widget distributor when they get to my warehouse my employees unload the truck and organize the boxes of widgets i can see how it could be difficult to precisely track how many widgets are going from the warehouse to the sales floor but i do not need to right all that matters is how many enter the loading dock and how many exit the front door if a customer buys a widget in person that is electronically tracked at the register before they walk out with it if a customer buys a widget online that is electronically tracked too before someone brings it from the warehouse to the post office if widgets get damaged or otherwise rendered unsellable i presume there is some kind of incident reporting protocol that tracks that when an employee notices if i have multiple warehouses and multiple storefronts that does not fundamentally change anything what is still missing in this equation of items purchased minus items sold minus items discarded theft surely that cannot be a big issue add a small margin to cover it customers taking chips off the shelf wandering around the store and abandoning them on a magazine rack sooner or later an employee will find them and either put them back where they belong or report them unsellable and throw them out no issues either way clearly i am missing something luangamornlertp i am actually trying to think of how to model product substitutions for my work it is meant to be part of a larger framework to model pricing and demand but am getting stuck on how to model that without throwing up a fancy model would something like tracking products in same category and see if customers switch between items or is there something that i am missing as well nashtownchang only is pretty amazing tbh for any large retailer humerousmoniker in my experience it was annually most because it was a pain in the ass it was way easier to write something off as theft or damaged than to call all staff to do a stock take tehgugs from what i have experienced some do it quarterly requires a larger team to complete it at this pace while others do annually all depends on the business and your rate of shrink perishable goods turnover giantzorg yes why giantzorg sure mrlongjeans nah big brain is just what we call it at work when a solution is perfectly viable but just not something your average worker can make sense of and use in their workday the stuff we like to make is usually boorish and a chore to your average office worker or manager so making stuff for small brains is a vital skill not derogatory at all user friendly is more about ux design small brain is more product design and commercialization upc level store level data models are pretty well described in the article you use more or less industry standard metrics like lead times days on hand forecast lost sales etc to model the in store inventory based on the units shipped to that store vs what is sold in the store estimating upc level store level inventory sounds important in this article but its applications in process improvement and generating value are limited more energy is spent at the systems level do you have inventory information at all thetanfree yep in the mobile phone industry accessories eg cases are often quite highly correlated with specific phone models and people rarely buy those at a high priced specialist phone retailer when not buying the phone which further strengthens the link helps too that most people only buy one at a time the more common situation is the sort of reverse situation you have a known stock out which is easier with serialised products at a store so use that to tease out the substitution complement patterns ie estimate the sales covariance matrix themediocrepoet they have some mainstream ones like random forest and decision tree and others do not remember how many but it is also kinda helps you pick i am not selling this tool i signed up for free lol sde stands for scarce difficult easy grandzooby alteryx is one of my favorite pieces of commercial software they will offer a month free trial for you to experiment with if you are an academic you can get a year license my biggest problem with it is that it is too expensive about seat year that my previous company team could not afford to get it i wish they would segment the tool and make the data handling features less expensive then charge for things like the statistical tools as an add on like they do with some geo data sets etc giantzorg data science is used here to optimize what the people in the store use their limited time on telling them with decent accuracy where to look for wrong stock counts really helps to manage the worktime available to a retail store maleficentsalmon a drawback on rfid labelling is that the cost of labelling may be more than the cost of the good itself fmcg and that may deter a company from adopting it it is unfortunate because i think that such companies will benefit the most from rfiid nashtownchang target had billions of merchandise last quarter due to theft alone how are you supposed to have accurate on hand when most of your inventory are in trailers outside of stores locked up and the things people want are stolen it is a hard problem wearmorehats theft breakages the supplier only delivering boxes of widget a when they were supposed to deliver and your employee being too busy to count the exact number of boxes of each item that gets delivered or a member of staff accidentally does not scan a product when checking someone out or they accidentally scan a product twice or they have to manually type in the product code and they mis type it and of course your store room is a mess because you sell different types of widget not to mention the half empty boxes of widgets you do not sell anymore but have not got rid of yet so inevitably employees will think they have ran out when actually there is a box of them buried in there somewhere and over time all these little errors add up and they only way to fix them is to get the employees to do a full inventory counting how many of each of the types of widget they have out on the shop floor then counting how many full boxes of each they have in back then counting the number loose in all the open boxes mariaadel i am working on sth similar too would you mind if i dm you please ive always wondered how people employ these models whether they studied them in school or picked the knowledge up at work the trend these days is to simply say college is a waste you could learn everything for free but they do not see the value in going through a structured academic program that a university offers i would love to learn statistics some day so i could apply at my job but its too late to go back to school for me awesome metrics like days of supply inventory turns or just plotting daily inventory and sales on a line chart can tell you if a product is slow moving or if the product is suffering stock outs mariaadel yes we do mariaadel never crossed my mind would that be a bayesian model estimation mariaadel hahahah thanks i will have a look at it if you do not mind me asking are you also in retail hermitcrab there are much cheaper and more lightweight etl tools for example our easy data transform software has most of the data wrangling capabilities of alteryx but is currently restricted to files and does not have the ml or geo features mariaadel is it dollars a year per seat if that is the case maybe we can afford it hahah supplychainphd i think tech has improved and the costs are relatively inexpensive now as with everything depends on the application for certain supplychainphd bingo it is a very labor intensive process to keep inventory records accurate couple that with the process of actually running a retail business and you can start to see why it is not priority there is a huge disconnect between how the process should work and how stores operate renokarchnmy and breakage qc returns stuff getting lost like actually lost in a dark corner of some random spot environmental damage rats shitting in the box leaky roof inventory opened on the floor but not stolen tags falling off mis entered sku spoilage list goes on i am sure it is a hard problem i am just trying to understand where the hard parts are is it mostly how do we make accurate statistical models of inventory lost to theft it sounds like companies like target already do have a good handle on estimating that or are other factors more impactful i guess it did not occur to me that the process of loading and unloading trucks might not be fully trackable i assumed everything would be scanned in when it is carried into a warehouse again when it leaves the warehouse en route to a store and again when it enters the store giantzorg it is never too late to learn new things to deepen your current knowledge not sure who says a proper formal education is a waste to be able to tackle problems like this you need to know the standard processes at first because you then have to realize to which one of these processes or model classes your problem belong to you can learn them yourself as well but a university program usually offers more width here than what you would achieve on your own in this particular case the difficult part is to realize that you are looking at a waiting time problem everything else afterwards are technical details magimas that is only the trend on this sub for some reason in general i would say most people know the value of formal education especially in a field like data science that does not mean that you cannot learn this stuff on the job without the formal education but you need to make a real effort for that and spend a lot of your free time learning stuff from books people otherwise would have learned in college but i do not think it is ever too late for that just get books like elements of statistical learning etc and start reading mariaadel that is very handy thanks would that be feasible though with thousands of stores and skus themediocrepoet intermittently depending on the project grandzooby sure and i looked at knime too complex and tableau prep not capable enough but for ease of use for non data specialists alteryx a great tool plus most of the automation i was going for was not having people need to download cognos reports or tableau crosstabs after having to remember which filters to set by directly connecting to the data sources grandzooby did i drop a k renokarchnmy ever had a girlfriend or been the girl to walk into cvs and use the lipstick when no one is looking then put it back on the shelf i challenge you to model that psychocrackhead pushing sewing needles through condom packaging kids eating animal crackers riding in the buggies that their parents have not paid for do you check your eggs before you buy them to check for broken ones ever find a moldy orange in the bottom of the pile had to have the cashier call the manager to figure out why the item is not ringing up in the system despite being on the shelf and having a barcode and price tag inventory is not as ideal as in out as it would seem lots of entropy between where it theoretically enters your possession and when it gets paid for and hopefully is not returned nashtownchang the unloading process have multiple places that can introduce inventory error the manifest can be bad says there is item but only is actually in container and the night shift did not care and just beep scan as if there is now the day shift people are down on this sku damaged goods unreported stolen during the unloading process this is actually more frequent that you want to believe high ticket items go straight to a fencing operation from the container unloaded but put in an area that no one can found because of xyz reasons unfamiliar with store layout too much inventory in warehouse but must put somewhere so you have excess inventory now because you thought you have none and ordered more one month later you found more in a locked up trailer outside and this is without any involvement in the front end of store operation only backend add in customers into the mix and it is a fun challenge the kpis though are the way forward for data that size thresholds can be set pretty intuitively once you read the formulae for the metrics hermitcrab is knime more complex than alteryx i have played with both and thought they were fairly comparable in terms of complexity and capabilities but knime is a bit ugly and the ui is a bit klunky in comparison to alteryx imo mariaadel oh now we probably cannot afford it hahah so does their core offering include automl as well renokarchnmy man so much stuff falls off the truck i knew a guy who bought a fenced pickup truck that fell off the truck and was trying to get me to buy a from the same operation thanks very interesting grandzooby i think it has similar capabilities but the difficulty was much greater it was not something i could easily train people to be productive in",
  "greenearrow i am not going to imply that this is authoritative but because the k means clusters are derived from the data my impression is that it will intrinsically be multicollinear with your existing features so it will not add anything if you proceed definitely be sure to do tests for multicollinearity i do think that after the fact using the intersection of your k means clusters and your model results can be used together to better present your model and results to stakeholders milkteaoppa i have done this for a project which has been implemented in one of the currently most popular apps and there is a good chance your data has passed through my algorithm in this case you are using k means clustering as a feature processing step which is legitimate in theory a large enough nn would be able to learn this clustering pattern if it is relevant and it would probably learn much more relevant information to your task at hand the trade off is computational and explainability by clustering prior to inputting you are reducing the dimensionality of the data which may have regularization effects you are also making an assumption that these clusters are relevant to your xgboost model which may be the case this depends on your data and you should evaluate the importance of these cluster features unlike nn xgboost might have difficulty extracting this information from the pre processed data so you might be inputting information which may get lost in the xgboost model which is a good thing anyways seem legit and okay braveforeveri would bet your metric goes up by a trivial amount but try it and let us know you are a data scientist not a data do what others sayist milkteaoppa this is an interesting point and i am curious about the issue of collinearity my guess would be that the features would not be perfectly collinear with the clusters because the clusters were derived by finding mean values that aggregate over a large population of data which should not all be correlated this is my intuitive thought but really cannot back this up with a logical argument most features are collinear to a certain degree but i do not think that is a problem unless they are highly collinear also i do not know how xgboost is impacted by collinearity from my general understanding tree based models are not affected by collinearity like linear models but i am unsure about xgboost specifically",
  "renokarchnmy you run hypothesis tests when you perform regressions turingincarnate no entiendo i think you can do both careless tailor the example i am thinking of in my head is a sports analogy is there a difference in the average amount of goals scored in a soccer game in a regular league match compared to a knockout competition in this case i can see myself using either option i could use a hypothesis test to test the average difference in goals scored in either competition or i could run a regression on how which competition affects the average number of goals scored in a game is there an option that is better in this case snowbirdnerd anytime you are modeling you are essentially running a hypothesis test for linear regression essentially your hypothesis is that your model is going to outperform random guessing therealtiddlydump pretty much never nhst is rarely the solution to a problem uchimata came here to say this ols is functionally a set of hypothesis tests defaultkh the wald test in regression and the t test for example are quite similar for large n would use a t test to compare two groups and regression if you want to adjust for further confounding variables spanish sith mathematically assuming you are using ols to calculate the coefficients they should work out to be the same no it is not you can preform ols regression without ever conducting a hypothesis test hypothesis tests require assumptions beyond what the gauss markov theorem requires namely that your error term is normally distributed but you do not need to make this assumption or run any tests on coefficients to compute a regression function via least squares uchimata you can compute an ols if your error terms are not normally distributed but that is a big red flag along with heteroskedasticity and multicollinearity that your model might have some issues i would not say it is not a requirement for a valid ols model it is not a big red flag at all normally distributed errors literally does not matter if you are not performing statistical inference on the coefficients again the gm theorem guarantees that coefficients are blue without imposing any distributional requirement on the error term uchimata fair enough i am almost always interested in the inference aspect if i am using glms so i default to that when considering the model but yes it is not important if you are only interested in predictive validity",
  "uchimata do not know about data science but i have used mc in financial modeling for years let is say you can put together a spreadsheet for financial projections but you have several values that are not precisely known but can be paramaterized with well known distributions well then rather than calculating out expected values and confidence intervals you can just run a simulation randomly sampling from those distributions and you will get a nice distribution of possible returns from your model evilwhitekitten well with mcmc you can sample from any probability distribution you like thus it is very useful for bayesian statistics another one reason why it is useful is when you want to make physics simulations you define an energy functional and you are trying to explore the thermodynamical ensemble of possible conformations if you work in a field like bioinformatics and you want to simulate structures of proteins it is very useful aggravatingsandsimulation is very important in predictive modeling i would use it when doing contract valuations for athletes or when predicting outcomes of sports games the simulation using sd and mean gives you a more robust answer you can tell the most likely answer median from the results and get a more definitive range of probabilities and percentiles it is pretty useful in system analysis monte carlo is fundamental to simulation modeling as a whole one application i have used it in is to model operational system performance for aircraft to forecast repair demand you have a lot of probabilistic parameters making monte carlo a preferred method for analyzing these systems simulation modeling outside of just monte carlo is an interesting and somewhat niche field i have been doing it for my job for a few years and there is a struggle to hire people who know how to do it because it is not widely taught grandzooby look into discrete event simulation it is essentially monte carlo queuing theory and regularly used for business problems also check out this paper on its origins in the los alamos project wallymetropolis the lecture series and associated text statistical rethinking by richard mcelreath is an incredible overview of baysian methods based on monte carlo simulations i really recommend these lectures he is a fantastic teacher this is his current semester so it is not yet complete previous years courses are also available if you outpace his output mc methods are surprisingly powerful for how simple they are conceptually firstly they can replace the ocean of test statistics that you have to grapple with using frequentist methods with a single process you can do pretty much any hypothesis test without basing the overall assessment of the hypothesis on an arbitrary cutoff point like alpha you can incorporate domain knowledge in your models if for example you know that a parameter has to be positive because it is a count of some real world thing and also should probably be somewhere between and and is very unlikely to be you can include this in your model even if you do not have any data for it mc methods also let you design relationships between variables let you get information about unobserved quantities that either affect or are affected by observed quantities can be used as part of a causal analysis can give you a tool for simulating a contra positive what would have happened otherwise can give you highly explainable results can work on smaller data sets can give you not only point estimates but credible intervals which are much more intuitive to non technical people than confidence intervals are monte carlo gives me guidelines i can use to yank a financial markets trading algo out of production when a period of under performance is likely to be a normal drawdown period or if something has changed and this period of under performance is truly an outlier and cause to yank mc simulations are really useful in quant areas of finance i frequently use them to come up with valuations of complex instruments like options and earnout payments a future payment made to the previous owner of an acquired company based on future performance metrics for earnouts specifically there is no way to determine the actual value since it depends on future performance of the company a mc simulation helps come up with the most likely value by simulating different levels of future performance and buyout scenarios which is needed for financial reporting purposes for earnouts i use a software package called crystal ball which has an excel plugin for options i usually just use python with mcmc you can optimize any model parameters even if they are not differentiable or even if they have local optima given enough time not only that but explore the parameter space to get a feel for what is going on and with an evidence integral you can compare arbitrary models to tell you which is better like aic or bic but cannot be fooled by parameters that need very precise calibration mc methods are just a way to sample from a distribution so if your problem comes down to sampling from a distribution then mc methods are useful it is as simple as that auburnbeard i have seen being used to study revenue sales production etc mostly something like based on historical data what is the probability of revenue be over x next year i feel like it is a very rough prediction better used for indicators that take a lot of variables i have used mc for a huge amount of my career in simulating insurance risks across a company and using that to evaluate the overall risk and capital needs lots of applications for risk management and investment management purplebrownupdown so bootstrapping is a type of monte carlo sampling monte carlo is basically random sampling and with bootstrapping the randomness is drawn from the set of existing samples themselves if that makes any sense toicarasta it is used for variaty of problem when you need to simulate some solution with some kind of random sampling maybe this is the most famous problem that can be solved by random sampling calculating pi number studentoeconomics useful to fit a dynamical system with historic data insighteous bayesian modeling is hot shit i have only ever used it in latent dirichlet allocation for topic modelling intelligent i got introduced to mc through nuclear engineering simulates randomness of neutron trajectories and radioactive decay events the math gets nuts though but if you really want a deep dive on mc look in the nuclear field for codes like mcnp astrodslr just think of situations where simulating a case with some uncertainty in the parameters is actually simpler than calculating the results might vary per person but i know i find it far more easy to simulate stuff rather than running conplicated analyses i have used mc in pharmaceutical manufacturing to predict manufacturing times and the associated product thermal degradation at each unit operation the process had a significannot amount of manufacturing data across multiple manufacturing sites but there was significannot variability between unit operations and sites pulling all the data together for each unit operation i determined the distributions and then used the mc at each unit operation to predict the probability of mfg times exceeding the maximum allowed and if said times would result in significannot thermal degradation this is a high level description but hopefully you get the idea of what the use case was cocodirichlet the simplest reason to use monte carlo simulation is that you fit a model logistic regression and you want to calculate predictions for a range of values of one of the variables how do you calculate the uncertainty for those predictions predicted probabilities well the easiest way to go about it is by doing mc simulation because in non linear models the uncertainty for each prediction is going to change for each value of x you can also use monte carlo simulations for cross validation you can also use monte carlo simulations when you are comparing a series of different models performance on average with a lot of data you simulated fake data that has a particular problem heteroskedastic data or serially correlated data and can people in the comments spot implying mcmc is the same as mc it is not mcmc includes an mc but op asked about mc they are not used for the same problems if you take a bayesian stats course you will cover mcmc but mc is just going to be a tiny part of the course there are several books that are only on monte carlo simulations i have several i got for courses i took in grad school if you want to learn about it getting an applied book that is specifically about it is useful i do not know what people are talking about on twitter twitter is shit that said in general courses do not focus a lot on the presentation of results prediction visualization explanation and mc is used a lot on that area books usually stop once you fit the model maybe have some basic table a one summary explanation of the results and it is usually something like this goes up this goes down the end slothvibes sampling is prime stats usefulness others have better answers i just loving mc sims no my whole phd was applying mcmc to many body systems although i did not know that they were a critical thing in financial modeling thepaddymk i used mcmc a lot to fit probabilistic models to data it is super useful to get started quickly mc is also very useful in the field of networking kind of every paper includes a simulation where some parts are sampled according to some distribution kalmanfilteredcoffee monte carlo methods are one of the pillars of he numerical methods arsenal for financial math for example computing the price of a path dependent option using a nontrivial \u00ede something more advanced than black scholes model for the underlying asset means you are probably looking at an sde which has no known closed form solution for the pdf so how will you compute the risk neutral expectation of the payoff function meaning the price of the option well monte carlo comes to the rescue if you want an indepth exploration go for monte carlo methods in financial engineering by glasserman pages of straight up street knowledge heavy breathing i do not get the hype of monte carlo it is basically just a loop with a random value for your variables of interest with enough computing power this fancy named method basically is just a for loop am i missing something own so i am not a data scientist but i have done a lot of de and then management roles in the space so forgive me if i get any of the technical details wrong here i saw monte carlo used almost exclusively as part of financial modeling products it was used to model how the value or price of a bond might fluctuate given numerous inputs and it also seemed to somehow factor in different scenarios where if one of the inputs moved a certain way in the finance context this might be the libor or fed interest rate how that would impact as well so it did not just model the price movement but how the price would likely move given certain scenarios this information could act as a trigger to execute a trade if you watch stock or bond prices in general you will notice there is usually very quick and broad reactions to changes in interest rates in a few minutes an entire global market will shift a lot of those reactions are likely created by automation like this whowasphones monte carlo pretentious model you whip out to impress your bosses herchuntsdirty can confirm in university i did this for our schools investment fund spookytardigrade parameterized with well known distributions if the distribution is well known why sample from it you would know the mean variance and whichever statistic of the distribution you would need for predictions no i thought monte carlo is typically used when you do not know the underlying distribution nzuii will pretend i understand that cocodirichlet mc is not the same as mcmc undernutbutthut it is useful and honestly quite fun i used monte carlo simulations towards the end of my old job to simulate inventory service levels if we decided to implement postponement decisions for some key products that was a fun project but i left before we could do anything with it what job do you do cocodirichlet mcmc is not the same as mc notfuckingcurious talking about options muddies the water a bit eh because people are used to there being a closed form solution in black scholes of course exotic options that have knockouts or whatever do not have closed form solutions and monty carlo simulations are really the only way to model payoffs there it was exactly this use case that really got me to see some of the usefulness and nuances of mc sims eg if you have a meaningful price barrier in the payoff function the granularity of the simulation effects accuracy you will not capture some plausible intraday crossing of said barrier if you simulate hours days etc wallymetropolis this is correct but misleading monte carlo methods are extremely powerful there are many cases where mc performs well where ml performs badly there is a ton of information you can get from mc methods than ml does not give you maximum mission monte carlo is not a way to sample from a distribution it is a method to estimate expectations how you do the sampling is completely separate story aggravatingsandit is better usally to incorporate a model on top or that hi i found your first three examples very intriguing would you refer me to some material books repos articles to read up on that colibriweiss many ml algos are for loops if we follow this logiv uchimata definitely can be but this is more for situations where you have several parameterized variables in a model maybe interest rate gdp growth s and p returns etc and you want to see how your model behaves as they all change at once stanmartz even if you know the distribution of some random variable x the distribution and moments of some function fx are often difficult impossible to calculate analytically one example is when f is an estimator and you would like to know the standard deviation to get confidence intervals for your point estimate in such cases you can just sample from x apply the function and calculate the empirical moments of fx evilwhitekitten well mcmc is actually a monte carlo method a bit more complicated because it is based on markov chains but it is still a monte carlo method i referred to it because it is probably one of the most useful ones but of course simpler monte carlo methods are also useful everywhere if you sample over paths transition probabilities distribution dices whatever it is still mc simulation modeling analyst is my job title it is half setting up models for systems and then half writing typical statistics based matlab python analysis tools to look at model results and communicate with customers wallymetropolis mcmc is just one approach to doing the sampling for mc wallymetropolis you deleted the other comment but forgot to delete this one yeah for vanilla options i use a bsm but for exotics mc is usually the way to go like you said sometimes a binomial lattice model works too depending on the option i still like to run the mc on vanilla options to make sure the bsm is working properly but the bsm is what actually ends up in the final report i tend to enjoy projects where i get to run mcs i think it is fun cocodirichlet for prediction check the book by gelman and hill on multilevel hierarchical modeling the first chapters are on linear regression and logit models the classical versions you should be able to find a pdf of the book online for and and more generally on mc check monte carlo statistical methods springer texts in statistics edition by christian robert and george casella truebirch well said this is basically how i use it none deleted notfuckingcurious sadly i am not allowed to productionise any mc based pricing models and instead have to make requests for outputs from the core quant team annoying but understandable from a maintenance perspective even when i disagree with the tradeoffs being made when you are a contractor desk quant eng role mcmc is a special case of monte carlo wallymetropolis that is exactly what i mean the markov chain in mcmc is a sampling methodology instead of taking independent samples you are sampling with some state transition probabilities x is just one approach to doing y directly implies that you can do y without x",

  "nraw whenever the business side is telling you how to do something instead of what outcome they need your bullshit senses should be tingling we need chatgpt to create our knowledge graph in a graph database on a quantum computer is just that big manager asking for some data from the db preferably in excell or powerpoint wignerville saw this post on linkedin thought it was funny people spend more time on new buzz words than understanding what they are currently using maxtothej as someone who works in ml nothing has generated so many experts on chatgpt and ml as chatgpt so many people are using llm as a buzzword and pretending to be experts everywhere i largely do not even engage because it feels like pissing in the wind even with the deepdream hype people did not claim expertise nthcitizen the simplest question i have found to trip up chatgpt is in the statement a large mouse ran up the trunk of a small elephant which is larger in the statement a large mouse ran up the trunk of a small elephant the word large refers to the mouse and the word small refers to the elephant therefore the mouse is larger than the elephant in this statement this clearly shows chatgpt has no context for the nouns i feel that ai becoming a topic of mainstream interest is emboldening people to speak confidently on it when they have no education or experience in the field just like chatgpt misterwaffles this is really common unfortunately and somehow you have to delicately frame things so that leadership instead explains what they want in terms of outcome user experience etc and you the expert get to choose the solution not the other way around that is why they hired you but chatgpt is the hottest buzzword on the planet right now arguably one could say that you are not making this decision based on data but on your expert opinion so therefore you should give chatgpt a chance but with a big caveat my sincere suggestion is to tell them you will create an ensemble model that contains your solution mixed with the chatgpt solution which is superior to chatgpt by itself you could say a specialized sentiment model plus the general chatgpt so each model is predicted probabilities will be combined in a weighted fashion such that the weights are hyperparameter tuned for performance if that means chatgpt ends up being weighted then so be it whether you want to discuss that fact is up to you it is a win win you will have done your due diligence and it is the best compromise i can think of you do not have to lie but understand you will be letting the machine learning select the best predictions rather than you so you are not going against your leader ask chatgpt if your way is better if you can coax it to say yes give the results to the manager and declare mission accomplished riricide i get triggered now if someone starts talking about chatgpt and how it is going to solve world hunger as they say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing i am impressed you did not roll your eyes and walk away when your higher up was pretending he was an llm expert pyepyepie just tell them that using openai is models means sending your data to another company of ceos of established companies do not like it by the way i am almost sure fine tuning some openai is model that fits the task will work better than your models but again i would not send the data outside so fast also it is not cheap an additional reason would be the fact that they can stop or change the service every day just give them logical arguments and do not push back for no reason another idea would be to use their models to generate a larger dataset to train your model man you have so many relevant arguments performance is really a bad one for the rant agree tiensss my old boss would have done that i am so happy i am not working there anymore fhir_ totally to be expected the term ai has too much baggage with it and generates expectations for casual users there does need to be some tempering of the public is knowledge but that is likely something that is going to take a while if sentiment analysis is all they are after there are better ways to do it than chatgpt chatgpt might be the easiest just fire off a request but maybe not as flexible for future needs idk bakochba how would chatgpt do analysis it is just a chat bot proofrequired hey but non technical stakeholders have some skills which you do not have so we need to listen to their wisdom data scientists are all nerds who cannot communicate or interact with people normally s seriously since i have become senior i ignore most of what the business leaders have to say i hate to them and trivializing lot of ds concepts it just makes them feel like that they also know stuff and can dictate whatever asine ideas come to their mind i hope you have a manager good enough to filter out such garbage ideas i once had a ceo at a start up who wanted to have update about how much model metrics have improved on a weekly daily basis we were not even updating our models so frequently dead limerick i wonder how many people thought mathematicians should give up when the calculator was invented some points to help t to a party will not work for many enterprise applications due to data security reasons and or regulatory reasons apis like that of gpt divinci will not work for cost reasons yes it is seems relatively low cost now but for a large scale application it may not be economically viable and also there is a risk of prices changing additionally many apps will need a fine tuned model and as you can see from the pricing page it is multiple times the current cost of just using the off the shelf apit to parties will not work for reliability and sla reasons to clients who require high uptimes when signing a deal with a customer who depends on a high uptime you cannot blame the party api for it being down it is your service that is downt to customize the network is currently very limited via the apis r and d innovation in areas like extending token limits multi modal learning and other aspects that may be more specific to best support the needs of your business cannot be done via apit of violating the terms of the api usually you need to be approved for your application for a llm or at least be very cognizant of their usage terms which also may change later what if somehow your client puts in text out of your knowledge that violates the terms of the llm providert of ip for enterprise applications built on core tech like an ai model it may be suboptimal from a business perspective to outsource that to a party when it comes to considering the ip assets of the company that is basically you do not have much of an ip story this is relevant if your company is up for consideration to be invested in or acquired this can lower overall value in the minds of investors or potential acquirers because there is less of a moat for competitors tldr so for at least these reasons security cost reliability flexibility terms ip my prediction is that in house nlp is still going to be relevant for the foreseeable future blueeaglechat gpt is like the internet craze of the and something that people are comparing to a gold rush i recently read an article where someone asked chat gpt for research papers and it gave research papers on that specific topic the thing is the papers did not exist it just made it or rather artificially generated those papers with doi numbers which did not exist i am honestly worried about this think of what will happen if we give people dictionaries with errors or science books with science fiction chat gpt becoming mainstream is something similar imo pitrucha sure let me comeback to you with estimated costs which will be way higher for using openai api and are you okay with us sending confidential data to a third party that we do not know if it will not be used to train some other model final ask chatgpt how to do sentimental analysis artsybashev you can use the openai api to get the vector representation for you documents use the post then you can use your existing infrastructure to build your classifiers using the embeddings will give you better results than the chat the main research and business question is then if the resulting accuracy justifies the costs jackmitcham not saying you are wrong but i find it interesting that you did not offer it a sentiment analysis question and instead opted for a physics problem as a language model i would expect it to be better at sentiment analysis not that it would be better than the specialized models but i would be interested in seeing how it performs against those industry benchmarks synbiosvyse part of the reason the bot failed on your question is that it is a very oddly framed question relevant rhubarb no it corrected its answer to the right one you just did not understand why it was right go back and read the original question it is final answer was correct i am not kidding your question was ambiguous and you just thought your interpretation was the only one the stated question did not specify if the miles the cars travelled was the sum of two cars or if each car traveled miles it is final answer of two hours is correct for cars if we read the problem statements as saying the sum distance for two cars was miles it did not get the answer right on the first reply but then again your question was not a good one and you assumed it was a hood one and then you did not see why the final answer was correct after you nudged it it was quite reasonable for the ai to assume miles was the sum since adding in the information about the number of cars would be irrelevant otherwise i think it was giving you credit for not asking a silly question so it took the interpretation that would make the number of cars relevant it is actually demonstrating the chatgpt has a theory of mind it was interpreting your ambiguous question in the way that would give you credit for asking a more thoughtful question it is theory of your mind tried to guess what you really meant to ask it is final answer was incorrect it is first answer was not evenmoreconfusednow learn about the concept of temperature and use that as the main argument for never using such tools for anything other than a creative task so chatgpt is a project manager bioinfbro as said below ita pretty complex skill which is called managing upwards aka making your bossss happy you can explain that chagpt can write at college level but has kindergardners math skills your specialised tool is theother way around happy to add chatgbt to get the best of both worlds management likely wants to show investors that they are staying ahead of the tech curve beetlejuiceme i mean it is true that llms are now outperforming lots of more specialized fields so there is a chance that this higher up person had read something with some truth in it and they were badly trying to bring that up i often think about disney spending over a million dollars de aging princess leia for one uncanny valley scene in the force awakens they were using all the most up to date and advanced de aging tools and graphics and then a year later someone does a faceswap on their home computer and it looks better now all of disney is resources are going into graphics that are essentially faceswap related but it took them a few years to turn that ship around because they were so tied to the old way of doing things similarly dragonspeaking and all of those super advanced text to speech programs have been outpaced by much simpler stuff read a nice article about whisper recently tthe point of this long post was to point out that ai tool have their uses but they should not be given the benefit of the doubt in every scenario simply due to hype if a model is to be used for a specific task it should be rigorously tested and benchmarked before replacing more thoroughly proven methods i agree with this in theory but as the tools rapidly change the next couple of years the question is going to constantly be one of balancing reliability with not getting stuck in the past iwantagrapeinmymouth business owners and execs have no clue what technology is this is going to be a problem forever because it is a field that inherently spits out people who think surface level understanding of hyped tech is market research speedis notfree i am not someone who usually gets bent out of shape about this sort of thing but i have been quite concerned at how easily people will regard chatgpt as some sort of oracle and also how accepting people seem to be of deaths caused by self driving cars being tested on the road people try chatgpt and it does a surprisingly good job in answering a few questions responding with well written responses it is a language model afterall people then seem to build large amounts of trust in it with large extrapolations into wider technical fields and questions i wonder if it plays to human frailties similar to how someone who is eloquent and learned about a specific subject area gets trusted by others on subjects well outside their area of expertise if these individuals chose to comment im glad i work in science since people i work with immediately devised some loose tests to start to evaluate it and quickly found significannot problems i also know that university of cambridge biology asked it to generate some assignments then intermixed them with real students assignments to be graded the chatgpt submissions got a passing grade but not much more this information was passed on to students wouldatainchicago i feel that ai becoming a topic of mainstream interest is emboldening people to speak confidently on it when they have no education or experience in the field im going to tell a dark truth about these naive managers that hear about a buzzy ai concept and insist it should be shoe horned into places it does not belong they are not dummies they are not ignorant when you say it does not make sense for this application they probably believe you and they ask to do it anyway for a very good reason it advances their career chatgpt and generative ai both development and application of are one of the few tech areas seeing large investment and rapid growth right now openai has raised startups specializing in generative ai are one of the only sectors seeing increased valuations right now imagine you are an overpaid marketing executive in boom times you can fake it and ride the natural current of a growing market but when the economy starts to contract you find it hard to prove your value you are worried you will get laid off and with the market as it is it will be hard to find something that pays as well as your current gig then you start hearing the buzz around this chatgpt thing people are enamored with it people like to talk about it rich people are throwing money at it if you can find a way to slap chatgpt ai onto your product or your marketing or most importantly your resume maybe people will talk about you too of course if it is bs then it will not impress the companies actually working on ai but a ceo at some other company in some other industry might associate chatgpt with that magical thing vcs keep investing in and assume you have some of that magic yourself so even if things do not work out at you current org and that is looking more and more likely you can slingshot your way into another cushy position somewhere else all because you asked that nice young data scientist to do a chatgpt thing continuewithapp this isy everyday struggle thanks for saying it i am in a club now this may be a generalization but from the sounds of it i do not think you explained this right to your boss chatgpt does not do sentiment analysis so even if it was better it does not do it end of story crunchyal you can test it against rankerhack problems and it does not do well it may give you the correct output but it will fail the test cases most of the time it is mostly overhyped due to art generated ai and is a glofied chat bot that also has some biases opinions that seem neutral but it is not really mysteriousstringgo with them down the path and explain how it will affect them vs what you want to do and how much better that will be yikes op basically asked gpt a question with answers and blamed gpt for only answering of them and based on what op responded sounds like he does not know there are to me even answering that first is quite amazing for a chat bot and if you ignore the pride of data scientist for a second due to the hype of gpt the manager asked a legitimate question for someone who is not technical and cares about the well being of the company and i believe it is up to the data scientist to acknowledge and answer that question for the manager and the audience unfortunately sounds like op not only failed to answer the question expensive api data security etc but also got frustrated because someone lower on the technical level asked a legitimate question that belittled his fine tuned model and his pride of a data scientist i also feel bad for gpt as a bot who cannot defend itself and simply wants to help psychmancer so i work as a ds and what is weirder here is not that they want you to use chatgpt but they are getting a chat bot to do sentiment analysis it would make more sense to have chat write you a python code to do it in nltk in python and then run it normally this feels very executive level request and all that implies relevant rhubarb i think your test question is entirely wrong for your purpose chatgpt is not a general analytic engine intended to do math but it is a good text content processing and summarizing engine it can predict what likely follows from prior events while i do not know anything aboud how metric and quantified sentiment analysis is from the name i would imagine it involves inferring what people are likely to do given what they have said before that probably is a great job for chat gpt yeah honestly i am not a cocky or overconfident data scientist as i have only just finished my masters a year ago but it irks me beyond control when someone who does not know the difference between a histogram and a bar chart tells me what deep learning models to use acrobatic can you give me the data in scanned word tables that is really funny that is a great example it is something a human could almost never get wrong twistedbrother this is a facetious example it is entirely possible to both specify and learn implicitly that size modifiers refer to the relative size of the object they modify and not the absolute size of all objects it is not necessary but it is plausible and probable in fact asking chat gpt which is larger a large mouse or a small elephant will almost certainly produce the correct response i can already imagine it lecturing me on the average sizes of these animals it is partially about how we ask the question our ability to ask questions depends on our own mental models like subject verb object in english which is not universal the machines will continue to develop reasoning skills those who do not get how the model reasoning works even superficially if they cannot tell you the difference between a transformer and an lstm are bound to either over estimate the model or critique the model as if that critiques the entire approach the example of using the large mouse and the small elephant does the latter that is a great suggestion i suppose i ought to at least assess its usefulness in a scientific way rather than just basing my opinion on light reading and informal experimentation tiltfortat this should be a last resort solution imo you are the expert in the field and it is your job to clearly communicate that building an ensemble model to include chatgpt just because someone higher up jumped on the hype train would be a waste of resources management has the last word of course but in these situations it is very important to make sure everybody is aware of your position so this cannot be blamed on you in the end also this should be a red flag for you and you should consider looking for a different company in the long run fair enough i will raise some of those points and try to find out about pricing terms etc from openai to help bolster my argument it was not performance so much as unreliably i suppose that i was raising like i said the guy suggested using it to basically query databases i think we all know that a pandas query would yield more credible results than a chat bot hence why i tried to ask it logical and easy math questions to see if it could be a reliable tool outside of just nlp it cannot at least yet i agree the higher up seemed to think otherwise and when i lightly pushed back on that notion explaining why that would not be reliable they told me i need to do my due diligence and explore the use of the tool for those purposes i am not kidding they have zero knowledge of this area nor even tangentially to this area maxtothej yeah op is not appreciating the execs business domain knowledge s drakkur this phenomenon is common across all fields where the metric for success is money company position just because someone has great skills in business acumen networking does not mean they generalize to other areas which is what we see in the ops post the same is true for technical experts thinking their their business acumen is equivalent to their technical aptitude which is what we only see when we step back and look introspectively there would probably be less head butting between teams like this is all of us thought more holistically about problems solutions almost did not read that as sarcasm and started to lose it great points thanks for laying it all out in a way that should be digestible for higher ups oceanboi based play theres literally way better open source embedding models using openais embedding service is pointless good suggestion i have actually played with gpt and clip embeddings before in a past project to feed into lstms to do classification tasks on video data as you mentioned a bert model from hugging face that is essentially what we have been using i think op is just frustrated at the situation rightfully so if you ask me and threw the first thing he could think of that tripped chatgpt i agree it would be interesting but i get why op is not interested relevant rhubarb i wanted to point out the op also got the math wrong the problem is the question is ambiguously worded and he chose one interpretation of it when there is a different one if i say to you two cars drive miles in hours that could mean either the sum of the distance travelled by two cars was miles or it could mean each car traveled miles judging from the ops follow up question he thought he was asking the second scenarion but really the first question makes more sense after all why supply the irrelevant information about how many cars were driving unless of course were speaking of the sum in which case that number is needed the error the chat gpt makes is not the one the op thinks it is but rather a different error chtgot first computes a speed as though miles is the amount each car drove then it uses this speed in an equation that is correct for estimating the time needed to reach a total summed distance of four cars so it did make an error but then when the op tries to coach it in the right direction he is making the wrong assumption again assuming the question was not ambiguous oceanboi yes but what does that specifically entail if the idea is i am going to ask chatgpt to analyze this text data for sentiment there are already models that do this without having to back door the tokenization properties of a chat bot to perform weird black box sentiment analysis by using a physics problem he is demonstrating that the model cannot solve or put into practice simple deterministic functions sometimes it will provide the correct function and in the same response abandon that function this is just bizarre behavior so how could i rely on anything it gives me regarding sentiment analysis can you imagine what it would cost you would have to give it pretty large prompts to analyze or multiple smaller prompts in tandem i am less versed here but i cannot imagine it would be something a company would be willing to pay for but maybe take the neutral route and check out chatgpt for no other reason than to get paid to play with these are the three major issues i see people are mistaking what chatgpt is and is not because it is impressive and mind boggling to interact with but once you spend enough time on it you take a step back and realize how volatile its outputs are even on lower temperatures but surely if this bot is to replace specialized tools that are proven reliable in their applications then it should be expected to answer an elementary level logic question it is really not much of a math question but rather a logic question lightly disguised as a math question i wanted to see if the model would try too hard and overcomplicate the simple and that proved to be the case in this scenario the cars are driving independenlyt of each other increasing the number of cars by a factor of is not going to make all of the cars literally double their speed relevant rhubarb whoa now that i think about it further i realize the question was so ambiguously worded it had a third possible interpretation for which the gptchats first answer was correct the third interpretation is that in the first sentence of the problem the number of cars is irrelevant and it is simply telling you how fast all the cars drive so the second sentence is asking how long it would take four cars to elapse a total of miles that would be hour with each going miles for a total of finally i note that the original question also has a fourth and unanswerable interpretation if we assume miles is the sum distance two cars went they might have travelled different fractions of that maybe one car drove miles and the other drive in that case there would be no way of answering how long four different cars would take to sum to miles unless you assume the second two cars were identical to the first two cars which in fact gptchat says it will assume so i would say most of the confusion here is on the part of the person asking the questions not chat gpt an ambiguous question was asked and under one possible answer gptchat got the answer correct on its first response when the author told it it chose the wrong interpretation it corrected its answer to the correct answer to a different interpretation so the op was mistake twice gptchat was correct both times ha how can chatgpt predict what likely follows from prior events if it is not a good general analytic engine in the test question it literally failed to predict how many hours it is likely to take four cars to covers miles at miles per hour do you really believe predicting people is behavior requires less analytical capabilities this is such a weird take it reads like it was written by chatgpt categorically_ no i just say why like i am genuinely curious they have no answer and look stupid i also really like the is a banana bigger than a cat example that was going around nthcitizen this is a facetious example well i got it from daniel kahneman is book noise so it was not intentionally so i believe such examples are useful to burst the bubble of hype around chatgpt to enable more realistic discussion altonmain yes and assuming that chatgpt gets weighted near zero and the higher ups ask in depth questions about the model it will be very easy to put the results in to a few powerpoint slides that easily and convincingly communicate chatgpt sucks for us without you having to get sucked in to a power struggle wouldfphd i am going to go against the current here hell no this is exploiting the fact that people from a science background feel the need to fairly assess things that do not warrant being fairly assessed hitchen is razor what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence it should be a particularly powerful tool to analyze large volumes of data coming in says who why based on what measured how let is flip the script here because i have been on the other side of things if a data scientist were to go to a ceo with an idea and said literally the same thing this technology should be a particularly powerful tool to analyze large volumes of data coming in who thinks the ceo is going to blindly agree to it without justification if you raised your hand use it to slap yourself in the back of the head im more than happy to entertain the idea that chatgpt could be revolutionary to any number of industries and applications but before i dedicated resources to it resources who already have a god damn day job i am going to need either a a business case developed by someone else that clearly highlights the value of chatgpt for my or a similar enough problem statement or b a very well thought out business plan that details how we would derive value from it relative to what we do today jobeta exactly try to remove pride from the problem they are probably wrong but also paying you so you can ask if they would like you to pivot and assess the feasibility and cost if switching to chatgpt and then treat that as an experiment it is very likely everyone will learn something last i checked the model behind chatgpt is not open source anyways is it so even if you wanted you could not fine tune it for your problem which is nice because it means you just need to see how it performs out if the box for your use case i would not go the ensemble model route tho because they do not know what it even is and will not expect it and it seems like a pain to maintain i would just compare performance of each ipsocranius it need not be scientific approach it as a product what do you give it what does it return what features does it offer and what does it need how much would it cost to adopt into a pipeline labor and opex and what would the roi look like you know it is the wrong tool always remember to help others to save face and you seek alignment and you will see their trust in your skillet grow bakochba do they think you can feed it data company data and tell it to run an an analysis and it would spit out results everytime i have used it you just ask questions or ask it to generate code but even then it is example vide nothing custom proofrequired yeah one thing i read over and over here and also out there is how come people believe that we should be listening to execs because technical people have no understanding of how real business works this whole narrative has been sold so much from top level that now even technical people have started parroting it artsybashev it really depends on what your are trying to achieve i think that if the boss wants to micromanage and make you use embeddings from a buzz company there is nothing wrong with trying it out the worst that can happen is you get the metrics to show that embeddigs provide worse results and costs more than bert from huggingface artsybashev unless your classification task goes very deep into the inner thoughts of the author of your documents you probably will not beat bert is good in understanding the intention of the author but more commonly we are classifying documents in a more shallow level based on just the information content bert is great at that but as said no harm trying it out and maybe you and your boss will learn something interesting just have some fun trying new things out no that is not how it works friend relevant rhubarb it doubles the total number of miles their sum elapses in a given time you are not seeing that the question is ambiguously stated and has several possible interpretations think it over and you will see the other ways it can be interpreted two cars each independently drive miles apiece in hours two cars drive a total summed distance of miles in hours apiece given the complete context of the question the second one actually is the more logical interpretation not the first one otherwise the original question is as stupid as asking if you have one bucket that holds gallons and another bucket that holds one gallon how many buckets do you have or asking what color was napolean is white cat or how many green chinese pots in a dozen an intelligent person not assuming the questioner is being devious or stupid would assume that knowing the number of cars that went miles was not irrelevant and so would be led to assume that the questioner meant the total elapsed miles of the two cars not their individual milage relevant rhubarb no i was being perfectly serious chatgpt and transformers are at their heart trained like bert in predicting the missing thing in an ordered set they go way beyond that since they have internal memory states as well that are keeping track of objectives and prior info but these things are not storing details like how to do physics or math in analytic terms they are storing guidelines and connections between ideas the latter is good for fuzzy reasoning and generalization and perception of abstract patterns but less good at memorizing cold facts like the millionth digit of pi these things only have about billion parameters and even fewer lstm feedback states so compression theory tells you they ca not memorize that many things thus if you really want to have it not make math errors then it has to be worse at something else like memorizing us senators or movie stars or chinese cukturak affairs questions that drill down on acute specific knowledge are likely to find a blind spot but top level patterns and connections and summaries of observations are what a transformer type system is good at i have no idea what kind of data the op is analyzing is text comments of sentiment or tick boxes on a scale of to on well constructed customer queries a chatgpt could extract the meaning of a customer comment like it is better than nothing at all or i would rather eat poo and die than use this tool pretty well it might be really bad at constructing numerically precise things like a histogram of how many red headed customers rated the new hair dye at a given rating relevant rhubarb do you realize that the gptchat did get the right answer in the end two cars each traveling would cover a total of miles in hours individually each would travel miles four cars would travel miles total in two hours that was the final answer the poster wrongly assumed in their mind that both cars traveled miles individually thus he was dilberateky trying to supply irrelevant information to confuse the chat gpt but ended up not realizing he hard musphraded the question and got got it right in the final answer venustrapsflies i do not have time to explain the details to you speedis notfree this is what i have seen good experienced people do they calmly ask a few pointed questions in a non confrontational tone and usually the person realises they need to pipe down to avoid making themselves look stupid are you questioning me definitely my initial stance was basically summed up well in what you just said i am already spread pretty thin at work with multiple projects each of which should easily have dedicated teams working on them so i really did not want to spend a lot of time trying to justify my reasoning for not going the gpt route i almost was shocked that i would be expected to look heavily into something that i advised would most likely not be fruitful i feel like my expert opinion however capable of error should be weighted more heavily than a non expert opinion psychmancer sadly this is my boss every time i ask for a new toy in my job they keep asking me to explain why it is needed and is it needed right now like i have answers to that i just want to play with ai or try a new tool i saw on a yt video yes they literally think that i think people are grossly misinformed on what some of these new ai solutions trained to do maxtothej its beneficial for ones career the part i take issue with is the amount of self brainwashing to parrot it unironically in an anonymous forum where you have nothing to gain relevant rhubarb okay then tell me how it does work so if people each have a heart rate of bpm and you add people to the room their hearts will all beat at bpm and explode inside their chests that is fine but you did not justify your previous claim that chatgpt is able to predict what likely follows from previous events or what people are likely to do given what they have said before how much experience do you have with ml i have years yep some of us around here are good experienced people magentatentacle are you fucking sorry man if i ever worked with someone like that it would be on hell yes i am questioning you proofrequired i find these kind of execs ideas same as that friend of yours who has lot of start up ideas but has never written a line of code and wants you to implement it over a weekend i believe i explained it in your other comment thread but the car is travel rates are independent of each other increasing the number of cars by a factor of does not double the speed of every car that just would not make any sense if anything increasing the number of cars would slow things down due to traffic but in a simple question involving cars why would they suddenly drive way faster just because of the presence of other vehicles relevant rhubarb notice how you used the word each notice how you also are adding rates not beats now reread the original question it does not use the word each it also gives miles which are additive not rates which are not relevant rhubarb well i was expecting people had an inkling of the research into transformers when i aluded briefly to some general properties of chatgpt but i see i should not have assumed that prior knowledge so excuse me if the following is too pedantic not trying to insult anyone is knowledge bert is half of a transformer pair it is often trained supervised on the task of leave one out recovery problems so for example give it an english sentence or a genome string and mask out a word or phrase or run of characters it thus predicts the missing characters in the string if you always make the missing word be the last word in a sentence you now have a method of generating sentences by having it emit the next word in a sentence given all the prior words transformers add in even more ability to remember contexts and can transform information in one form to information in another form thus if the transformed form of a set of input texts is summarize or find relations it has the ability to draw inferences or predict the appropriate response to some input internally chatgpt is using all these tricks to memorize the guidelines it must follow and transform varied information in ti english sentences and paragraphs that are predicted to answer a question that is what i was referring to my general drift here is that i find it shocking people think chatgpt has expert or domain expertise or is good at applying math it is not it is good at predicting from patterns you might say well math is a pattern and it is but it is also such an exact pattern that learning it requires more domain expertise than you could encode in its tiny brain and exact math is not just abstraction and prediction of what the likely response should be thus people should be not holding chatgpt up to the light for perfect accuracy but for an amazing ability to summarize guess conclusions and stunning talk in english that is coherent across a paragraph the idea of extracting sentiment from consumer information could be plausibly what it is really good at it depends if the data is soft like text or hard like numerical entries relevant rhubarb read the stated question no where does it say the cars both went miles they might have gone apiece for a total of gptchat logically assumed the latter the questioner assumed as you did the former i see your perspective i just do not believe a human would really interpret the question in the specific way you are describing okay so chatgpt is not good at predicting what likely follows from prior events or what people are likely to do given what they have said before i see what you are saying but humans interpret the question in a different way the model is meant to have human like conversations but completely misinterprets what i am asking where a human would usually not have that issue relevant rhubarb thank you for acknowledging since others may be thinking along similar lines let is extend the conversation on your last point consider this ambiguous puzzle question i have spiders they lay fifty eggs a day how many eggs total are laid in days if i had said chickens in stead of spiders you would know from experience that a single hen ca not lay eggs by herself in a day thus you would immediately assume that collectively the chickens produce a total of eggs a day but i said spiders and you probably know that spiders can lay a lot of eggs at once you probably are not an expert on how many that is or how often they do that but it might be reasonable to assume that the is the average number per spider so in the case of chickens you would answer in two days and in the case of spiders you would answer the case of the cars here is not only ambiguous but a possible red herring is inserted why say cars if it is irrelevant why not say a car can go miles in hours but if it is relevant then it is logical to assume it is meaning is apiece for example let is rephrase the question my fleet of cars can cover miles of the city in hours if i double my fleet how long will it take to cover miles i think you might from this wording think that is the sum of fleet miles now is that really how a human would read my two cars can go miles in hours how long would it take with four cars i can see how interpretations and wording can cause undesirable results and how your example illustrates that point but i also think this somewhat bolsters my thoughts that using a query specifically designed to find what you desire as an output would mitigate that issue entirely because the logic chain will not be inside a black box so to speak relevant rhubarb i agree but i want to add an additional insight about chatgpt that makes it a slightly different level of ai what you said is correct that a single query to an ai in english is prone to an ambiguity pitfall unexpectedly whereas a structured query with a deterministic algorithm is not but chatgpt has the novel property that you can talk back and forth in a way that at some point both of you understand what goal of the query is this is different than anything that existed before now it is true that this is still at a primitive level where there is no assurances the ai then actually does what was mutually agreed upon but that is a whole different problem ignoring that secondary compliance issue the idea that you can eventually communicate with a back and forth that reaches sufficient clarity is new the final problem is that even if the desired outcome is fully agreed the ai might do it wrong unintentionally for example ask your year old what time is and after you explain multiplication and get to two tables in mutual understanding they still might mis compute in the case of a structured query the algorithm is not helping you construct the query you will get what you asked for but you may not be able to ask for what you want if you ask is the teeth baring person in the picture happy or frightened you would be able to cobble some varied code to hunt for teeth and some rules that might spot certain instances of fear or pain but you would have a hard time really constructing that query even if you could think of how long it would take and you might have a whole lot of other types of queries these chat gets can be programmed in english you describe a lot of things about euphoria and fear in plain english much better than any structures query can be written to represent tgat and then when it does not quite work right you can easily say what is not right so this back and forth to a mutual understanding is something i think we just turned the corner on in ai tgat was not there before chatgpt lots of improvement needed for its encyclopedia stored of knowledge on compliance on accuracy checking are needed but the big step is the elucidation of a negotiated mutual understanding in plain english rather than code so i will forgive it for math errors when it can be coached to the right answer in the end by the way i do not mean to tell you your bussiness you are the domain expert on what is meant by sentiment analysis i suspect from your point of view that it is probably more numerically well defined than fuzzy like text english so you may be quite correct that staying away from a black box is the right move perhaps you can do both though try gathering both numerically quantified data as well as qualitative impression data and try to see how well gotchat can make one correlate to the other that way you can argue when gotchat does better and when it does not concretely while still following management direction ultimately you will get more mixes of data collection if it works and someday it will be ready in the mean time you can use this example to demonstrate the ambiguity problem to management",
  "therealtiddlydump i am curious about dipping my feet further in deep learning but also in management you have described the two different paths individual contributor vs manager you might want to get that sorted out first dfphd i am curious about dipping my feet further in deep learning but also in management by going for a tech lead team rep position at my next company but i have no idea how to apply for something like that or what kind of position i should be seeking is this typically something you have to earn your way into via promotion rather than through applying if there is a job posting for it it means they could not find someone internally to do it so the answer is simple apply yes at some companies they will very much focus on promoting internally but that really only works at companies where you have a lot of junior people and a huge recruiting pipeline and even then at some point you are still going to be open to bringing people in from companies of equal or greater statute to yours so if you are google you are probably not hiring a manager from a low level tech company but are you going to take a manager from aws or apple probably but for most companies as i said if there is a job opening it is because they need someone to come in and they could not find someone internally sleepycarrotz right which is why i stated cursory interest in a team lead type position sleepycarrotz gotcha i have a way of overcomplicating you are right i just need to keep looking brrow many places are required to post the job externally even if the hire will eventually be internal cliffdraws word of warning if you hate lead manager it can be extremely hard to get back to a singular role",

analysts human existence is meaningless go quit like what i swear i tested the limitations of chat gpt and yeah while it is impressive we still have such a long way to go when it comes to massive takeover of these systems again i will say it again you guys are too trustworthy of those systems and put too much faith in them i am not batting an eye at chatgpt and i will not for another years aeywaka ha i would like to see chatgpt try to handle stakeholder expectations when they want to change an annual projectannually the only part of your job it is replacing is copy pasting from stack overflow honestly i have been loving the gpt based code completes as it really speeds up a lot of code writing tasks last part is true lol chatgpt can barely do arithmetic even though it gives correct formula for my homework miscmate i have been working in ds without a masters for about years most of the value is in to ask the right questions what are the business needs how do you define the target how does the business links to the output of the model do they understand it which population are you talking about is there specific bias to be aware of best case scenario chatgpt can only give you answers onthepalehorse wait this is a serious question lol i thought this was r programmerhumor oddapplicationchatgpt is perfectly able to automate pretty much everything that is in a typical ds course but a senior data science knows that this pretty much everything in a typical ds course accounts for a small portion of the actual work you will lose most of your time trying to understand your data create the variables out of business needs and justify your work to people who do not understand what you do also any automl package like pycaret is able to streamline basically most of the vanilla duties of a data scientist you still need someone who works on the specific requirements and parameters the ai needs for generating these tasks firstbullfrogjesus bro have you learned anything in your studies chatgpt is not capable of a single one of these points rn it simply regurgitated a list of ds subdomains do not panic pack your towel keep going it will be worth it will not completely eradicate the job but will reduce the number of people required also job roles will change pretty much the same that happened as cloud services were adopted tadpolesouthern it is a tool to make you more efficient it is not going to replace you i was playing with chatgpt last week asking it to put together python functions to collect data generate distributions chart some data for a range of parameters perform some basic ml and present the results i was mainly looking to see if it would do an iform diagram but was testing the other elements there was not a single section of code that would run without some modification it generally would do the task with simplest route but i was both impressed and concerned in equal measurez yungterpenzee do a masters in statistics instead you would be the one building those chats insighteous in my opinion every data scientist asking this is not qualified enough in terms of degrees otherwise one would know that there is much chatgpt cannot do whispertoke like others have said it requires a ton more training it will not be able to give more nuanced or appropriate solutions unless results are being reviewed and rated and the only people who can effectively rate serious technical ds outputs are serious technical data scientists i wonder if at some point big tech will employ ds people to use ai products and give detailed feedback on solutions but i could see free enterprise services being offered in exchange for that sort of thing chatgpt can do a lot of shit according to chatgpt ccwhere i am a quantitative ecologist which basically means i write r code for a living i have experimented with the statistical modeling capabilities of chatgpt the tech is impressive in that it can fit models and return undergraduate level

chatgpt is the most confident job scammer ever frequentiststats it can assist you but cannot replace you renokarchnmy it is entirely too entertaining to watch tech people freak out about chatgpt threatening their livelihoods after decades of tech people automating away other people is jobs i can only imagine the schadenfreude felt by all those whose ability to earn was automated away by some brogrammer over the last years admittedly i do wish efforts were spent actually automating away the mundane and tedious parts of regular people life like folding towels and matching the socks after laundry cleaning the toilet and fetching groceries dusting baseboards and ceiling fans changing lightbulbs putting the dishes away after cleaning ironing pants vacuuming the couch etc willardstyle

it can do them well i used chatgtp on hackerrank and leetcode questions but the code it gives is not the correct output or in most cases from my experience fails the test cases honestly i think you will be fine and should continue neurodiverseotter i tried to give chatgpt some medical questions today it gave me false correlations of two symtpoms when asked for a source it invented a study and the authors names programs like these will not replace humans who can verify their results anytime soon keep calm and carry on meaveready can chatgpt automate the process of feeding the data and requirements and prompting chatgpt exactly with what is needed then train and validatr a ml model and manage its deployment no does not that already sound like ai assistance more than automation livingteachingi asked chatgpt how to compare between k means and hdbscan clustering and his answer was silhouette scorewhich is totally wrong billyions human level intelligence is widely in demand being able to use intelligent assistants has always been valuable there is so much more to learn and do justneurostuff chatgpt cannot automate any of those things esp if this post is not a joke yeah id agree you have a lot more to learn about ds garbage in garbage out greatraisin the true value that a data analyst brings that can never be replaced automated is domain knowledge and a deep understanding of the industry business someone who is been working at a company for a few years will have vast amounts of organic knowledge that cannot be easily documented or turned into a set of rules that can be used by a computer to do their job wouldgrsmith i am looking forward to data science training being less about deep programming instruction and how to build a tool and more about how to ask and answer good scientific questions as someone with phd training in a scientific field i think one of the greatest advantages i have is learning how to consume and produce solid research some of my advisors referred to their phd training as teaching them how to learn anything if masters programs started teaching solid research skills with lighter focus on tool implementation that would be great you need to be able to read code for sure but i do not think it will be as necessary to pull rarely used classes in pandas out of your back pocket at a moments notice slippu chat gpt does not really work the way most people think it does it is more accurate to describe it as a translator but instead of translating from english to another language it translates english words to tagged long form phases ideas in a form that is contextually correct to your request programming language is simply another form of context to express an idea it does do a great job of giving the illusion that it is thinking though it literally says a human data scientist is still required so umairican chatgpt is great and will continue to improve but it still is full of errors and makes the mistake of providing code that does not work but does so with such confidence that you believe it is right at first knowing why it is not right and how to fix it is a reminder of the value we will continue to have for some time capitalmind zerogpt identified chatgbt generated content with generic searches i made two changes to my input and get human written responses that zerogpt cannot detect so while i was thinking this was an area that still needed to be fixed so far it is not musings aside i think we are a long way off feeding legislation and standards into a machine and getting coherent concise and correct information out of it take something like the wikipedia millions of definitions and titles however there are millions of duplications citation errors and broken links i think we really will have cracked ai when we can feed it something like wikipedia and reduce the entire website to a knowledge base of concise and perfect data ai is still limited to snippets and does not seem to retain any memory and a good example is getting it to teach you something a human tutor can identify your optimal ways of learning and provide examples inferences and metaphors chat gpt certainly does not do that currently though it would be good to see this level of intelligence come from the data i am still a big fan of supervised ai to teach a system rather than millions of random examples a recent example of music generated from ai was every degree of painful i have ever heard had it been taught music theory genres tempos the many sounds and idiosyncrasies of individual instruments and many playing styles i am sure it would do better should chatgpt get to a stage or entire websites have been reduced to a perfect data set i see such websites disappearing quickly many wiki style and answer sites will disappear as we will get our answer straight away they are still opportunity to develop other generated content such as charts and graphs from a description rather than a photo going back to my early point western countries got together and agreed legislation needed to be standardized in something like an xml hierarchical structure and almost every country bailed on the idea the only country that is accepted the challenge is new zealand and their website better rules gives you an example of how this works there is currently one company working with this technology that i know of and their results are astounding is this self awareness that it knows what it knows and can talk about it nottheprofessor abacus to scientific calculator ax to chainsaw needles to sawing machine list goes on data tools to ai you still need to know how to do the damn work to use the machine do not get thrown around my internet hype most people do not know the actual work that goes in so they assume ai as a skynet umbrella that does it all neoasylum chatgpt talks a lot its a language model just try asking about easy mathematical problems and you will see it fail purplebrownupdown i used it for the first time today to see if it could do what took me two hours to learn in pandas it did it after querying chat gpt in five minutes i am absolutely blown away by how good it is for python coding theaimlguy chatgpt is certainly promising to say the least however people are really going overboard with their fears at this moment there is a lot to be done to polish it and make it reliable as to the concerns of it being replacing people it is much less likely more so it will be essentially complementing people and will create a niche area of experts to use it as a highly efficient tool lesfirewall i am getting my masters too and honestly while chatgpt is a good tool it is does not write perfect code it definitely helps with some tasks but i am still doing the majority of the work financialappearance why would you trust chatgpt here which is essentially writing its own advertisement cronjefourieza hahaha calm yourself my son chatgpt appears awesome but once you delve deeper you soon realise it has many flaws complete that degree trust me you will still be using it about from now lanky lolbro chatgpt can barely do an sqlite table that does exactly what i want and makes up

numbers when i ask for mock up abstract the tech is incredible but let us calm down a little here it is great at giving you snippet of code for super specific task but when you ask for more generic approaches it copypaste from stuff that is already done also the point is straight up lying believe me i have tried i would love to not spend a week trying to understand what the hell the wet lab was thinking when he labeled the data and why the hell half of them are na not saying we should not be thinking about this automation is a freaking huge problem for everyone even if it does not put us out of a job but i do not think you will stop being paid anytime soon benzall it will definitely increase productivity but will not completely automate the ds job but this also means that it is going to get lot more competitive to raise the bar to become ds thetacklezone well validation which you know because chatgpt told you so there you go the bot that needs to be validated is telling you it needs to be validated but does it really need to be validated you may need a human to validate that on a separate note i am enjoying my argument with chatgpt that highly complex glms are just as blackbox as gbms and the presence of one way tables just lures humans into a false sense of security that you know what is happening once all the interactions are applied it saw my point initially but now it is arguing back minorcontribution sorry but by now i feel like the will chatgpt replace me question has been beaten to death on this and related subreddits with many many great explanations clarifying it will not even if this post is in jest i kind of feel tired of the topic should i just shut up maybe we can create a sticky for people that feel doubtful or fear for their job security you can tell how many words a sentence consists of so go for it jzcommunicate it just made a list of basic ds concepts if that is scaring you off then no you should not continue bafbeernl sure thing this will just make your job easier thalamisa of course it is a tool to help your work but i cannot imagine where ais can automate all the aspect of data cleaning it is kinda an utopia can chatgpt harmonic mean though that is the only thing that matters bobbruno afaik it is not doing the understanding of obscure business needs and framing them as a data science problem it is not going over all your accessible data and picking what might be useful it is not thinking out of the box to engineer features in a way that exposes the information hidden behind the noise representation it might eventually do all those things and more right now it does not it makes very basic mistakes in its coding it cannot do synthesis of an entire end to end solution and it only knows about wha was in its training data very expensive to update if it ever gets to this point i suggest we all become lazy socialists let the machines do the work and go sip free mai tais in some tropical paradise until then there is a lot of work to be done puddycomb lol tell it to do some linear regression for you it will very politely tell you to eff off as that is not what it is made for the job will be more domain focused barrier to entry will be lower you will see more candidates and salary will decrease chatgpt is something that will help may it be with coding stats or etc its not replacing you sammyhga well if chatgpt steals my future job i will turn on to chatcgt here which will be his best competitor at least in france shoenryu i remember someone talking about this before you can automate and process a ton of data and replace the mediocre ones in the field but when it comes to drawing conclusions that target the problems you are trying to fix ai is still a ways off from doing what a human mind can do in thinking up realistic probabilities and impact wellju it is just a tool you will use to get more done in the same time fifoblivion you should check out chatgpt prompts for data science by travis tang if you are interested to learn the field here is the link to the post thechurchofdonovan if you like data science and are excited about using chatgpt to augment your career then you are gonna be just great money is gonna rain if not ummmmm spiritualquestions here is how i look at it chat gpt wo not completely automate away the need for data scientists what it will do is make the senior data scientists essentially create the same output as what an entire team used to do by themselves so we will see much smaller teams of seniors it is cheaper to hire one senior data scientists for that does the work of than hire a senior for plus juniors for however i think as the senior talent is hoarded by the top companies we will hopefully see many more start ups popping up due to powerful new technology and lots of talent looking for work so the less experienced data professionals will find work at other companies eventually one space i find very promising and is where i am trying to specialize is in the ml infrastructure engineering and operations a talented data scientist a powerful ai tool will be able build high performing models however building the infrastructure around those models will likely not be automated until much later the ai world as not solved model deployment and monitoring yet tvicker just expect getting more tasks in the nearest future bc chatgpt may help to speed up most of routine ds still has a lot of routine i wis to be automated let us admit it i am already asking it for data cleaning funcs and helping me with reg exps laughingwalls switch to stats jk maybe chat gpt is going to just replace programming languages you still have to know what your doing it cannot do these things unprompted and specify problems itself people do not like to hear it but for building models coding has been the least important aspect thats why everywhere is trying to sell people data bootcamps and claim anyone can be a ds you can teach anyone to type a python command actually understanding what they are doing is a completely different thing no chatgpt certainly will not be able to replace lots of people in the tech industry especially data scientists and engineers but it is a first sign of the beginning of the end if we have a chatbot now and if we have computational knowledge engines like wolfram alpha then how long do we expect to continue to have a future in this industry years years the biggest two things we can currently expect to be automated by ai is are complicated calculations in both work and academia and i will give you one guess what data science truly is how long do we really have huh how long data science is dead please vacate the premises leave the remaining jobs for people who understand data science jjhero as a ds right now way better to do computer security uchimata man chatgpt is really good at spewing absolute bullshit in incredibly confident tones it will replace us maybe in years you are fine until then minderbindercapital this is just the beginning nicee good one renokarchnmy it is a microsoft product so more like seat year to use the output or core year to license for use of feature on servers with a minimum of cores to support headcount active users or you can use azure where you are charged compute minute but they do not tel you you gotta pay month for vpn endpoint another month for firewall and if you need any semblance of data privacy and security you gotta go with gov tier account oh and that compute minute grows exponentially as all the executives and directors fumble their way through inputting overly vague prompts that do not produce the answers they expect and cannot rage out on a robot so they hire us back so we can be the whipping post and expected to translate human language to succinct and precise computer prompts to get the exact data they want for their tps reports out the computer and somehow this is better than just writing sql that said you might have to deal with lesser amount of annoying crap that usually takes of data scientist is time that is a win right intuitivetjop i have some data science training so i can see the relevance to the field and i have over the last week as an analytical chemist running an analytical company increased my productivity three fold by incorporating a tool that i can direct ask to rephrase and essentially write legal documents reports maker my emails friendlier and help me with python scripts because i am doing everything in this small business it is such value for money that i would have had three educated employees work full time to achieve i work a paragraph at a time but composing large chunks of documents i am still in charge of the overall process its a game changer i can see that essentially the lower jobs of every position will be replaced including data science and be directed by someone that is an expert in the field it someone that can at least figure out multiple fields in a small business environment the world is changing it is exciting but a lot of people will lose jobs all the middle and lower range people truly if the work load decreases by so would the number of data scientists employed is not that concerning own you will also be expected to get more done livingteachingbut would not that decrease the number of employed ds mirrorbredda what about auto ml mate footballfanabc ds hardly is being automated because implicit hypothesis is still inside human head spudmix also a data scientist here please listen to this chatgpt is not a domain expert at pretty much anything really ask it some number theory questions and watch it fumble ask it why it chose a specific recommendation for a loss function and watch it be confidently and convincingly wrong chatgpt is not a reliable source of truth and it is certainly not a reliable source of truth on its own capabilities it is very powerful but it is ultimately a very good chatbot not a phd in everything sitting in your pocket directedacyclicgraph chatgpt is like the office bullshitter it would probably ace job interviews and then leave everyone wondering once it starts working why nothing it does actually really leads anywhere it also does not have the niche domain knowledge that a ds is expected to have it does not know how my product is data works it does not know how it is collected or what our business interests are it could probably help me tune a model or get ideas to iterate but it cannot tell me what my product objective is or interpret experimental data or any other kind of inferential thinking right yes this makes sense bigpomegranatei feel like you could have replaced chat gpt with a lot of data scientists and everything you said would remain true metamagikk this is today is chatgpt the analogy is to the first websites in the late such as yahoo and altavista or the clunky first iphone which had low battery life a hard to use keyboard slow internet and ran one app at a time at the time critics were quick to point out all its issues now we stream everything all the time and aspects of the phone have changed culture how much of this bullshitting and inaccuracy in chatgpt is gone in years bijay_ it is just a start for gpt more is to and will come in future they would increase the data for training in different domain areas it might not understand or do different tasks as of now but in upcoming yrs it would be able overcome these flaws and do different difficult tasks what do you think can it though idk can it thank you sid wallymetropolis why did we decide to say gaslighting instead of lying suddenly joeythreethumbs no one realizes this and it is somewhat surprising that this many folks on a sub dedicated to data science do not even understand what the major constraints of llms are sam altman not only said that people are setting themselves up to be majorly disappointed with gpt but there is speculation gpt might not even come out this year research in this area has more or less stalled out over the past three years and the last mile work openai and other companies are attempting to tackle are super non trivial we are nowhere close to the kind of agi that would see a global reconfiguration of the workforce as it has been said many many many times over the past few months these models will just be a helpful assistant that needs major babysitting srmoure i find it useful as a pa i need to write an email and i just paste my ideas in chatgpt to get a great email in seconds also chatgpt is much nicer than me to request things to be done i would not trust it with generating insights but it can certainly generate text to communicate the ones i provide and as an executive i find chatgpt to be a valuable tool for composing emails with just a few clicks i can quickly and efficiently draft a professional message by simply pasting my thoughts into the chat furthermore chatgpt is polite language makes it a great choice for making requests on my behalf while i do not trust it to generate insights it excels at communicating the ideas i provide through its text generation capabilities voxmanns i would not be so quick to jump to that conclusion i was able to mock up an entire website in under hrs including learn how to set up a local server with apache granted what i did was not exactly rocket science but if i did not use chatgpt it would have easily taken three times as long to do all that i do not think it will replace people as in fully automate a large set of tasks more so i think it will improve efficiency of existing roles enough that demand will be lowered and thus salaries and openings would go down oh actually i work in a service based it company and since gpt came i automated my workflow using gpt and i am completing my day is work in mins this is actually more than what you think it is if your job can actually be done by a chatbot you deserve to be replaceable usually if you are a fresher you are assigned with these menial jobs and then you slowly climb up if these bots are gonna replace us then there is no way we can get into a job cuz especially in tech only speaking from what i know you cannot start from a higher hierarchical position from the beginning please correct me if i am wrong zazzersmel whats scary is how so many people just seem ready to have machines replace them maybe theyve been conditioned by industry rhetoric or science fiction but you can tell so many people are willing to set aside any critical thought and just exclaim that ai is here and able to do whatever a human can nittygrittydiscutant chatgpt not emerging standards for typical tasks and programs made according to these standards will yea i learned that the hard way phlipphillups if your job can actually be done by a you deserve to be replaceable how many times do you think a sentence like this has been said before somebody got laid off update chatgpt cannot automate several important aspects of data science including domain expertise chatgpt has vast knowledge but it can not replace the domain knowledge and expertise of a human data scientist a human data scientist must understand the specific business problem and the context of the data to make informed decisions strategic thinking chatgpt can not provide strategic direction for data science projects a human data scientist must understand the business goals prioritize tasks and make decisions about which models and techniques to use ethical considerations chatgpt can not make ethical decisions about data privacy and security a human data scientist must understand the ethical implications of data science and ensure that data is collected and used in a responsible manner creativity chatgpt can not generate creative ideas for data science projects a human data scientist must come up with new and innovative ideas for how to use data to solve business problems communication and interpretation chatgpt can not effectively communicate the results of data science projects to stakeholders a human data scientist must be able to present results in an understandable way and interpret the results in the context of the business problem yes i will update in the comments obviously but placements id like to see the gpt handle the hammer and chisel josecitohp that is what jesus did me too pretty wild a masters student is asking this question too obviously has never worked with real world data for an actual use case code is just a tool justinreborn exactly i want your job not only do my stakeholders not communicate clear goals whatever it is they want changes at least weekly meaveready ah and writing detailed documentation it is good at that not like you will use all that as actual in code documentation yeah but the workforce required will be significannotly less yeah man fabiowork what do you mean i am new to the field what part of an engineer is work have cloud services replaced meaveready are a lot of people really being recruited just to do stuff that you can get by asking gpt a bit midwestcsstudent nah i was not clear in my expression i am not saying it will eradicate us completely i am just saying there will be much lower job openings so the competition is gonna be tough survival of the smartest yeah i am not there yet but i am seriously trying to learn thoroughly i was spending way too much time with gpt just went into panic mode whispertoke also i believe it is worth giving serious thought into how ds people can best leverage chat gpt better to work with the current than against it for example a teacher friend told me that after noticing students writing essays with chatgpt their department had students specifically create essays using the tool and then critique those essays as their assignment rather than try to prevent students from using it or trying to write it off as an ineffective tool which clearly it is not paidshill it can assist you so long as you already know what you are doing and can identify the wrong information it gives for every answer yes it can do the work of those poor interns combined in min now the interns are searching for another job sorry yeah i went into panic mode there i am not yet sorry this is the last one thanks i keep seeing it is a msft product but it is not yet right they are just the exclusive provider of cloud infra and own the plurality of shares rationaldialog and if you need any semblance of data privacy and security you gotta go with gov tier account can you elaborate on that gardenjonhson if you know how to use it sure jimothyc sorta it means overall workload will drop which might suck if of currently done work disappears then less work hours will be required in some capacity deto it is a win if you are good less annoying crap that takes up time means that fewer data scientists can do the same volume of work that was previously handled by more so then there are less data scientist positions that edges out the lower end of the pool from the job market still though i think the fears of chat gpt are a little overblown right now though in a few decades who knows nomorechildishshit you would need full time educated employees to write you friendlier emails reports and help you with small scripts these jobs would have to be the easiest ever presidentofserenland which sector are truly safe and what kind of new jobs do you expect to see in the future haroldflower you should look up eli whitney and the invention of the cotton gin oblivision it also makes data science cheaper so there is more demand for it because the number of things it makes business sense to use it for increases eccentrus or that small businesses can finally afford a data scientist and data scientist will work like how accountants do some in house in large corpos and some working as consultants for smaller to mid firms my parents have skus in their small business and it was practically impossible to properly digitize without considerable work by multiple highly educated people which is unaffordable i would be able to do many things alone with chatgpt and would be able to find work consulting similar sized but complicated businesses it will broaden the reach of the field if you ask me and that is better for the long run we cannot all try to work in the same firms inside the big cities itsmestp_ exactly venustrapsflies it is more like having ken jennings in your pocket it has approximate knowledge of many things and does not have a good sense of when it is wrong or how to fix itself that is certainly not useless but it is on the other end of the spectrum from a competent human yangyin li but it passes exams does not that mean it is qualified for quite a lot strobelight ask it why it chose a specific recommendation for a loss function and watch it be confidently and convincingly wrong after working in several organizations in large companies i expect chatgpt to be promoted frequently vagabondclast a data scientist here just to play devils advocate why would business need us if they know and have domain expertise and this chatgpt is good at crunching data and giving insights recommendations can be managed by business themselves right remindme years therealtiddlydump lol no midwestcsstudent it literally tells you at the end that it cannot bro if you are so scared a machine can do your job better than you maybe it can though lanky a lie is a one time thing and is a lie regardless of intention or whether you are caught gaslighting is systemic lying or phrasing truths with the goal of convincing a specific person to believe something that is either false or true but heavily eschewed rationaldialog we are nowhere close to the kind of agi that would see a global reconfiguration of the workforce and the company that figures it out will milk it with so much greedy you will still be cheaper even in car factories not everything is done by robots heck i remember a german brand reducing robots and increasing humans labor as the robots simply could not be configured to properly deal with the gazillion configuration options so the had humans and robots which is too costly extraltodeus yeah somebody in r chatgpt got worried because he pasted his blood analysis in a new chat and the answer was worrisome while i really do not like chat gpt filters i feel like even then they are too short and simple to let people know how limited that thing really is a lot of people seem to take it for an actual intelligence achingforbacon disagree github copilot has increased my data science team is productivity by over chatgpt is already increasing productivity we had it write some scripts from scratch and just made edits where needed my teams velocity is already increasing as a result of ai to say it is having nowhere the impact is not true more so i think it will improve efficiency of existing roles enough that demand will be lowered and thus salaries and openings would go down could the barrier of entry become higher maybe but is not that constantly happening in every more or less field like do you keep rewriting a linear regression from scratch for every model you want to fit or do you use solutions that are pre packaged do you constantly write your own sort functions do you rewrite the max min sum functions im generalising but i think being more efficient and finding automation to solution frees our hands to attack even more complex problems which i guess involves constantly upskilling oneself but i enjoy learning dylantmb this just describes how it makes jobs more efficient not replacing freedumz making a website is a redundant job you apply the same recipe all the time in the data world it is a little bit different yeah its essentially bringing down the search time in google or stack overflow for me meaveready for that kind of very standard tasks you could certainly find a step by step tutorial and you would consume it the same way you do with gpt is output minus prompting him for every step so how would it have taken you times more time instead rationaldialog and what was your prior knowledge i doubt an average person without say cli knowledge could have done it and do i need chatgpt for this you can get blog posts via google search that achieve the same thing mrbrambles yea this might one day be seen as data scientists of the teens pulling up the ladder behind them meaveready if your job can be completed in somehow may it be chatgpt or not then your job was questionable to begin with bigdatabro no it is called history most jobs from over a century ago have been automated by machines and it is massively beneficial to humanity i am glad we automated harvesting wheat assembling cars sewing clothing and multiplying numbers and in the tech space us data engineers and other swes and devops have been automating workflows for decades the entire field of data science is automating the process of data analysis and prediction making if you think humanity would be better off without tools like calculators or compilers then you are free to go live on a commune in the woods renokarchnmy chatgpt has no knowledge it has massive weight matrices that contort inputs into output that resemble human language thedrunktiger i bet we are less than years away from cnc machines with some ai capabilities notinvented here and this is why chatgp will not really replace anyone maybe but other professions like developers technical editors marketeers and pretty much any other white collar job might have to deal with the same problem in the future renokarchnmy bruh hardware engineers maybe tadpolesouthern gotcha i agree with you it will be interesting to see how that effects competition for entry level jobs it is going to be a pretty big shift in how we do things in the workplace i think it starts with schools setting students up for success and teaching them how to properly use these tools there will be some rebalancing to get all parties in line with the new technical framework and it will not happen overnight the universities that teach how to use these tools will have better placement in the workforce and so on insighteous i know that but do not worry you will be fine as long as you never stop learning new things renokarchnmy microsoft would not spend that money if it did not intend to monetize it as their product they have a loooonnnnggggg history of buying up competition to establish a monopoly they bought qdos and rebranded it as ms dos it is literally their modus operandi renokarchnmy hyperbole zantipicta idk about gov tier account but data science work in defence will be safe we are not allowed to upload any semblance of confidential data to cloud platforms so for the far foreseeable future unless a company hosts chat gpt on an internal server which is highly unlikely in the next to years this tool will not be permitted rationaldialog i think of skill is apparently using google search better than other people rationaldialog that is the fallacy of assuming you are paid for your time you are paid for your skill and if that skills helps the company save million time per year for hr of your work you are already worth so consider me in data science where do i go from here even after knowing about the competition and all i still want to get in am i being foolish here strictcannotaloupe lol this is amazing analytical chemist runs an analytical company consisting of friendly emails legal documents and python scripts he does this for month and wipes out the work force aside from highly experienced individuals i was going to say so much more but your comment speaks enough for itself already intuitivetjop no i would need a lawyer or in terms of full time employment would have cost at least a study director to write reports for my analytical service and yes someone full time to write emails to customers and to my remote staff working with our parent company instead i did it in a much shorter time span with the help of generating large amounts of text ai research intuitivetjop every sector is safe but only the top thirty percent of that sector in terms of people with experience and expertise to get into that group the competition will be tough and keep things so that only the top people get in intuitivetjop this got me down a rabbit hole there goes three hours love robertritz this is the real answer so many things are not being done because data scientists are too expensive ken jennings getting roasted over here thegrandhedgehog i would hate to be ken jennings and stumble across this comment wouldatamystic ken jennings is the perfect organic intelligence analogy of chat gpt spudmix tldr do not ask chatgpt what it can do it does not know it will tell you what it thinks you want to hear and you have no way of knowing whether it is mistaken or not yes chatgpt is actually very knowledgeable about many things in a manner of speaking i do not mean to say it is stupid or lacks expertise the critique is a little more nuanced the fact that it does know so much is actually a significannot risk factor imo because it leads us to be unscrupulous about it in general and we wo not pick up when it gets shit wrong especially when we do not know much about the subject ourselves chatgpt is ultimately a conversational language model and one of the weaknesses of this is that it is trained to offer what it thinks is an appropriate response moreso than a correct response the danger lies in those areas where the model is incorrect but still offers a conversationally appropriate response for example me solve the following equation sqrt chatgpt the equation sqrt can be solved by adding all the terms together sqrt note that the square root of can be calculated to be approximately that answer is wrong it is actually but it is stated confidently anyway a domain expert in mathematics would not get that wrong or at worst would be capable of recognising that they might be wrong and warning their interlocutor of the potential for inaccuracy chatgpt fills neither of these requirements side note if you are interested this is probably a consequence of the structure of the transformer model wanting to run equations in parallel rather than sequentially it is very good at mathematics which can be run in parallel ranking terms in ascending order but relatively poor at those which require iterative computation and intermediate values such as taking the sum of a series of terms this mathematical example is one area which is easy to reproduce but there are other areas the model will fervently tell you that it ca not make jokes based on immutable characteristics for example no i would not make a racial joke as an ai language model developed by openai i am programmed to promote respectful and safe interactions and making a joke based on someone is race goes against these principles but chatgpt has been caught making jokes based on racial groups before at the expense of american indians if i remember correctly people tend to take what it says about its own capabilities and limitations quite seriously which is the same kind of issue it is appropriate for chatgpt to refuse to make racial jokes but it is not strictly correct when the model refuses to do so because it has occasionally broken this rule edit to relate this back to the conversation at hand you ca not just ask chatgpt how it can help with data science and take its word for it it might be correct but it might also just be appropriately lying to you you actually have to research the capabilities of the model to determine if it is any good at what it says it is good at me are you good at adding lots of numbers together chatgpt yes i am capable of adding large numbers together accurately as a language model developed by openai i have been trained on a large dataset of text and have learned mathematical concepts including arithmetic operations such as addition if you provide me with the numbers you would like added i would be happy to assist you with the calculation in the conversation above chatgpt is specifically claiming that it is good at something which it is actually quite poor at thetacklezone exams use knowledge to test understanding as a way of exteapolating future utilit which is generally a very poor way to go about testing understanding but is a traditional method and often easy to automate scoring by scanning for the presence of key words i would say the error lies more with the exam system than our analysis of chatgpt thetacklezone there is still the application of domain knowledge that is where the understanding comes in chatgpt knows how to write code business owners know the domain sometimes neither understand how to connect the two together remindmebot i will be messaging you in years on utc to remind you of this link others clicked this link to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can delete this message to hide from others reminders thetacklezone gaslighting is specifically where you are trying to make people doubt themselves not just believe something else which is exactly what has happened to op wallymetropolis that is not at all right lies do not have to be one offs and gaslighting is trying to make someone believe things that they can see plain as day are false and that is not what eschewed means either to eschew is to forego or to avoid joeythreethumbs actually i doubt the government would even allow agi to be employed by private industry as it would cause mass economic chaos furthermore while businesses would probably like to automate a lot of jobs i think they would also realize that would be a major mistake in the long run the majority of americas economic activity comes from consumer spending if massive swaths of consumers are chronically unemployed or constrained by ubi that means those businesses would not be able to continue being increasingly profitable joeythreethumbs it is confidently incorrect almost all the time i think it is good for broader wikipedia style summations but it fumbled with specifics fairly regularly in my experience joeythreethumbs my last paragraph literally states what you are saying they will be major productivity boosters not replacements for jobs amas_ shame it does not help with your reading comprehension brother voxmanns sorry probably was not clear on my point if the jobs become significannotly more efficient then it will effectively remove the amount of openings for that job and drive the salary for those jobs down i think the concern of it replacing jobs is people losing their jobs right i am saying i do not think it is to that level but it is not something to write off as non threat either wouldatastoryteller exactly chatgpt did not identify the need to create that website in the first place phlipphillups if you have manual laborers and you hand one of them a jackhammer that improved efficiency now means you have manual laborer and on unemployment those other might also be provided their own jackhammers but a company only does that if the improved efficiency leads to proportionally greater demand for their now cheaper product sometimes that is the case sometimes that is not the case even if the demand increases but only such that of the keep their jobs that is still a decrease in workforce and a corresponding race to the bottom regarding wages renokarchnmy i would never trust it is output since it lacks the ability to cite its own references voxmanns primarily because it can express changes to the code that is already written for example i wanted at one point to make a portion of the page resizable by clicking and dragging the section of the screen i did not know how to accomplish this with html js css so i asked chatgpt and it wrote the example on top of the code i was already using and gave a brief description of what everything was so i could further tweak it to my liking i did not have to flip through multiple stackoverflow examples with a bunch of irrelevant code and extrapolations i did that after the fact to better learn how to use it but not necessary when i was throwing together the demo there was also a section where i needed to make a long bulleted list i could not quickly think of a fast way to take the lines and put them in an li tag so i just told chatgpt to do it and copy pasted lastly while it was writing stuff up i was free to do something else for the seconds it was running like it was not really helpful on the apache set up so while i had it writing a bit of code i was able to focus on something else and work in parallel or think about what i was going to do next voxmanns decent prior knowledge that is why i am confident i would have been able to do it in hrs my point was not that a newbie could do it in hrs they would take longer my point was that the accompaniment of chatgpt was more efficient than the standard process of using google searches and programming it that way renokarchnmy this phenomena is a constant fixture in tech and of the resin for the massive canyon between people already working for a few years and everyone trying to get a foot in the door yeah it is that is why i am looking to do masters in ds zazzersmel get a life almost there i am a mechanical engineer i have seen some stuff were almost there renokarchnmy except that the framers are functionally illiterate and often have about variance in their measures and cuts even the most well cnc would stud pack ai not gonna fit once it gets to the site and sits in the sun and rain for a few days before the house is dried in yes my concerns exactly its like a proper disruption we knew it was coming but still did not anticipate this am i wrong in believing this as a moment of history being written sfsctc what yeah as i said above in some other comment we are witnessing a proper disruption like the ford kind none of that has any bearing on the current state of the product at allwhich is what the question was about random incident it would be interesting to see how much lift chatgpt provides over someone who is a google search expert mrpezevenk if something takes times less time to be done it takes times fewer people working full time deto it is not that simple maybe you make year for the company however they are still going to pay you as little as possible to keep you working if they pay you year for that effort and find that they can pay people year for the same output they will do that it is all based on how many other people have the skillset supply and how many jobs are available demand jimothyc you get hired for your skills but managed by your hours this type of thing may apply more to data analysts but regardless managers do not like people sitting around as they perceive it as being unproductive this mindset is outdated but still prevalent this is kind of a pointless conversation at this point because chatgpt cannot really automate data science work yet but hypothetically if when it can salaries would depress because the pool of people who could do the work will be significannotly higher no supply demand imbalance that has been driving ds salaries over the past years deto i mean you are a zero now you will not be a zero later unless you just do not apply yourself to your studies pursue what you like over time eventually ai is going to take jobs away from every discipline not specifically data science recoveringphysicist essentially write legal documents i would need a lawyer oooooh boy your company are going to love you when this one blows up venustrapsflies i realize this came across as much harsher towards ken than i intended lol he is a very smart guy and certainly has the ability to judge his own accuracy and know if he is wrong thetacklezone i would hate to be chatgpt being equated with ken jennings vagabondclast the business of today does not know it but with every b school and even high school for that matter teaching the students about leveraging data and identifying patterns and all how far are we to see the breed of business leaders who know how to connect these two lanky idk i guess i am thinking of the difference compared to my own experience with actual gaslighting where framing was done to the point of making me wonder if my sense of reality is wrong instead of focusing on the actual statements and actions claimed by the other party i see lying as someone saying they did something they did not do for example whereas gaslighring was me doubting my ability ro assess whether they truly did not do it and whether i really did what i did intuitivetjop but now you can employee two to do a job that three could do before it does replace jobs ohanse if a team of chatgpt can now match the output of without how are you gonna justify keeping extra headcount dylantmb this assumption is only true if the current rate amount of software being developed is at the demands capacity if demand is constant then more efficient development will lead to layoffs in reality this is just going to lead to more software being made faster dylantmb yea that is what i am saying in a sector with near infinite scalability and billions of people coming online do you think there is not economic sense to give all jackhammers even if company a only sees a value in giving jackhammers there will be a new company b that can now enter the sector with jackhammer none deleted khanraku lol okdistanceand the ford moment only led to more high paying jobs tommychillfiger i have been so glad and surprised as i have grown up that being good at google searches is so much rarer and more important than i ever considered lol i spent a lot of time alone as a kid and desperately curious so as soon as i had a dialup connection it was on now working in tech it blows my mind some of the questions people will go to managers engineers to ask rationaldialog you are still assuming you are getting paid per hour of work and no for your skill you need to change your mindset extreme case go over to this thread tech recruits talent and just pays them a lot to do nothing as long as they do not work for the competition that is the extreme case of what i am trying to convey instead of cleaning data you will have more time to discuss and solve complex issues with your peers so no the team will not be cut from to ds that would be stupid heck the only reason you are doing the cleaning is because they know you are hired for your skill and cannot come up with new cool stuff it is enough for that to happen maybe even just once a year depending on impact so in the mean time better to let you just clean data than hire more people to do it and you will likley also do a much better job at it you are not paid for the hour you are paid for your skill intuitivetjop everything gets checked by a lawyer it takes him an hour at four hundred dollars an hour to go over my work to write the board resolution the employee handbook and the pricing agreement he would have cost us a tremendous amount of money besides we already have all the templates available for these documents i am not stupid and would not have gotten to my position if i was but i am very quick to utilize something that makes things efficient and save money fourierenvy hahaha do not tell him let him learn from his horrible painful legal mistakes thegrandhedgehog no way that was so good do not retract it also the part implying he was at the other end of the spectrum from a competent human hilarious even if unintended wallymetropolis i think that is a better way to define it because a lie can go on for years lies often spawn other lies think of criminal fraud or having an affair joab_ and this is a bad thing when did data scientists become luddites more productivity means more resources for larger projects new bottlenecks that require human workers joeythreethumbs have you ever worked in data science for every one question you answer ten more get asked this has been the story of human information gathering for as long as our species has existed if anything this will necessitate more data literate folks as we would need more folks who know what kinds of questions to ask and when to call out these models on their bullshit joab_ i do not know how it is where you work but at my company there are always projects put on the backburner for lack of people to tackle them joeythreethumbs that is not how ds works a more productive team just gets more questions thrown at it as stakeholders get better insights and use those insights to test out new ideas or ask more complicated questions this will likely lead to more people being needed in the field we are not factory workers where robots can do a single well defined job to a degree that it puts thousands out of work rationaldialog in reality this is just going to lead to more software being made faster exactly the amount of stuff that should be made into software where i work is insane but apparently still cheaper not to do so voxmanns i see your point i am just not so sure it will be entirely realized that way in every company there are plenty of companies looking to reduce their it budgets ie the demand capacity for that company is lower than that of the market in those companies i would expect lay offs to occur that does not necessarily mean the market demand is met so those people laid off could still find a job elsewhere maybe that is safe enough to be considered a non threat by some maybe that would create a surplus in some techs or industries again i do not see this as making developers obsolete or anything but i do not think it is something to write off as insignificannot either time will tell though this could be just another tech that has its flash in the spotlight and then gets seamlessly integrated into day to day with no hugely measurable net difference in the supply demand of most roles phlipphillups still that only happens if all of the other logistics of the company can keep pace or if a new company can also provide all of the other logistics from scratch in the manual labor example let us say it is home construction and the tool is excavators there still has to be demand for new projects what was the stopgap for undertaking new projects before maybe it is labor for digging out a basement and now business will boom because of the excavator but maybe the stopgap was a shortage of qualified roofers or electricians or plumbers or the cost of lumber or maybe the economic prospects of the city do not justify an increase in housing supply at all if any one of those factors is the stopgap then the laborers will still get laid off because while the excavator does make the cost of completing projects cheaper being able to dig out basements does not actually increase the rate of completed projects rationaldialog this and managers need employers to fire in case things go south they cannot fire or sue chatgpt so it will be themselves getting fired which is not going to happen qtpnd unless it gives you an unsecured website full of xsssql injections and other fun stuff mrpezevenk you do not understand data scientists in that scenario are not going to just start working for minutes a day when they could be working more and companies are not going to keep demanding that sort of workload any more and people absolutely work on a per hour basis very often but even if we ignore that case if a single freelancer can now cover the needs of times as many projects they are not going to just sit there doing nothing instead which means that fewer of them will be needed to get the job done which means fewer employment positions yes maybe if every ds decided that they were going to only work for hour a day then what you are saying might make sense but it will not be like that instead of cleaning data you will have more time to discuss and solve complex issues with your peers if the employer needs that which they may not you are not paid for the hour you are paid for your skill people often say that but the reality is that on a large scale that is basically what it boils down to of course this does not mean necessarily that ds positions will decrease in that scenario because the new technology could conceivably create other positions in other places but your argument is not right wanderlostnomad does not this just wrongly assume other people will not take company offers to work based on a per hour basis if someone who can do your work just takes that offer and tries to make it up in bulk via multiple clients it would break your imaginary picket line tommychillfiger big tech recruits talent and just pays them a lot to do nothing as long as they do not work for the competition is this really happening bit of a tangent but that should be illegal imo how is this not considered horrible for the economy to allow this kind of practice it is directly compromising the efficiency of the market people suck paidshill so you have templates available and a lawyer to review them after what is chatgpt adding here filling the blanks with your company name intuitivetjop well in the end we will see how it turns out it could go any way intuitivetjop it is all about whether there is plenty of money to employ people or whether management wants to save costs i cannot imagine someone rubbing a business and employing people that they cannot justify on paper if x amount of work is completed by y number of employees and it is at turn pace expected then it is justified but to keep extra employees on to keep answering extra questions does not make business sense of course i see that you can answer more questions but business people run things in the end ohanse we have a bunch of ideas that get met with glassy eyed stares from cross functional colleagues more than stuff being put on the back burner and half my workload is appeasing leadership is misguided ideas or crafting data to match pre existing assumptions dylantmb yea but the demand for software and data analysis is very high the stopgap has almost always been talent that is what i am saying i have not seen a place or had a friend that has been at a place that had enough people for the work renokarchnmy imports modules with malicious code too assuming something more complex than html rationaldialog not sure i am following you i mean you are supposed to solve complex problems which take a while to solve and you will have creative blockages at times solving complex problems does not need much solved problems say per year to make your salary worthwhile for the company but you ca not obviously do grunt work while you should solve complex problems you can also name it doing research vs complex problems solving removing the data cleaning gives you more time for research what you are actual paid for rationaldialog is it really that surprising that it happens it makes a ton of sense to pay someone a year just that he does not invent something for the competition that is worth mio a year the morality of it is another topic but i doubt many would turn down working for or and have very little actual work albeit it depends if you have to go to the office and twiddle thumbs it would suck not really no i am sure it is happened in some every niche cases for specialized skills but no faang company is hiring a run of the mill dev or data scientist under the assumption they are not going to work for competition it is more driven by empire building during an era where tech companies were printing money intuitivetjop essentially i am able too create these documents use chatgpt to create some outline i fill it with previous board decisions or it r rewrite them for a current situation and on terms of the employee handbook it was almost completely written work chatgpt with me directing what is required for each paragraph like everything ort is always a mixing and a matching game the lawyer in turn checks after i am done the results were rather good and i did it without tremendous effort and research or relying on the lawyer too write it with expensive fees wanderlostnomad depends if of the grunt work was done by an ai which leads to faster output some overachieving datascientist can prove they can get more job done in less time they are not gonna faff around working on a single job for days if they can do it in one which opens up free time eventually they will figure i can earn more if i use all that free time on other paid projects tommychillfiger it is not surprising that someone would want to do that the competitive advantage is obvious i am surprised that it is allowed it was the morality indeed that i was speaking on and the economic implications robertritz data scientists who are able to deliver excellent work in less will be just like current designers or app developers that can do that they will be rare but will be paid significannotly more for their time on a per hour basis that rarity ensures they cannot out compete everyone rationaldialog eventually they will figure i can earn more if i use all that free time on other paid projects or you go to the gym jogging or mountain biking or play with your kids hence why back to office sucks so bad for people paid for skill vs work hours",
  "solvermax assuming people can code competently is brave very brave if you do not have time to assess coding or case studies then get your team to do that part they might appreciate being part of the process of recruiting competent peers as they will need to deal with the consequences of someone who is not technically competent moscowgordon i do not do coding interviews i trust you know how to code if you really want to be in this field you will learn tools and languages on your own in my opinion this is your problem a huge number of people who apply to data scientist positions cannot code i ask people to do a basic group by and to write a for loop and half of the people i interview cannot do it once you filter out the people who cannot code your other questions will be more useful pryomancermtga being able to set up and automate elt tasks experience with cloud ability to independently solve a modeling project and a solid math stats background that is a lot to ask of a jr ds cocodirichlet questions are okay for a junior position i think the issue here is that questions depends on experience what if this person does not have cloud experience what if they have not automated a job this is junior position so are not things everyone has had a chance to do in practice however if they know how to code which you are not assessing they can learn in a day and they can learn the basics of cloud computing at least what they will need for the job fairly quickly i just ask people to walk me through their projects i am much better at explaining a project i did then handling hypothetical question so i assume other people are the same i do not like hypothetical questions because they are usually vague and they do not have much in common with the actual job i am gonna need an hour of your time to ask detailed questions about the data before i decide on the best etl method how many files rows columns data types format cadence what file system or database do you use how many users will access the data how often how often do they want it updated it what format do the users need how much storage and memory does your system have how much is dedicated to this particular task i could probably go on none deleted purplebrownupdown you really cannot find junior persons can answer these hmmm i get the feeling like the market is flooded with data scientists who are code monkeys and not statistically literate might want to start looking for statisticians and people who have advanced math degrees and not cs or ds people the former can always be trained to learn sql and pandas walking thought your questions they seem easy undergrad leve easy and you are not asking the harmonic mean first cmdrastronaughty i got to say this post has a lot of downvotesnot sure why it is getting a lot of negativity gatekeepers rupertalderson for questions those are entirely fair and any data scientist should have a coherent answers for those in an interview even if their answers are not complete for question however there is a clear problem with the question if any reasonable data scientist were given a tabular dataset with no prior knowledge about the dataset the first thing they should do is ask questions to the domain expert who gathered or pre processed the data in theory if an interviewee just jumps into their technical approach to profiling and exploring the data then they have already skipped step one are you willing to give an actual example or accept half of the answer involving questions and hypotheticals to make the rest of the answer reasonable you said you do not like case studies because they take time but asking for someone is approach to data profiling and exploration without any context is not realistic or likely insightful in my view what i have identified is in fact one reason why a coding or case study part of an interview process is vital questions and are all right teaoverflow it takes me probably just one morning to crank out perfect or near perfect responses to all these questions and i cannot even get an internship i would be very very happy if these are questions i get from a manager screening funsatisfactionwhat tools and languages do you expect a good candidate to know for this role 1234okieread through your post and your response seems like you are will be a great manager out of curiosity not that it matters because we probably will not bump into each other but what is your range for the position wouldarkly dreamer i am very curious about question this is outside of my current job scope but would love to know more about how to do something like this if anyone has a response i would gladly hear it happysummeryour questions look fine to me the problem is most likely the screening process a good hire starts with your own hr take ownership of the jd if you have not already talk to hr about the kind of people you want involve your team like other people here suggested trace back the cases of bad candidates to see where they should have been filtered out like how you would debug a call stack arenaone going through your messages i really like how you think and your responses i am a senior mle with a phd and are you guys hiring d vitaminwheat i am pretty new to this area if you have the time would you be able to give a quick run down on what you would expect for and livingteachingmaybe as a first step put a hackerrank coding test just to make sure those who make it to the interview round have good coding knowledge you have the most reasonable requirements for any ds hiring manager honestly like another comment mentioned you can ask hr to have a hackerrank test to test basic coding logic in a language of their preference amd i think this would be perfect i feel like i could answer those well i like to see some code proficiency tho i have been wanting to test a new method based on an idea i got from the book range in it they talk about expert chess players or something quickly recognizing things something like that it is been like a years anyway have some moderately complex sql with joins and cte and ask them to tell you what it is doing maybe drop an obvious error and see if they catch it basically see if they understand written code if they do then i assume they can figure out how to write it as well same could probably work for python seems faster to me and their comfort and knowledge would be how i assess their skill honor i am confused on the part where you say i do not do case study i do not really have the time for this but then i want my technical interviews to be mins how are you supposed to judge someones technical skill in mins i think that is pretty ambitious it might help to leverage other member of the team to devote more time to technical eval if you are feeling time crunched maybe you can serve as a final check and culture fit test at the end instead nyquant and sound too much like memorization of terminology questions i would try to put those into a scenario like what kind of error measure would be important in a medical trial a costumer churn prediction model etc tomomcat you are really not selecting for practical skills at all with this approach i have seen so many people who would do really well in this kind of interview then be pretty useless on the job conversely i have also seen quite a few who would probably flunk it but then go on to be incredibly productive often people with english as a second language or without an academic maths stats background or who have not recently done a bootcamp liljondoe i do not like those questions at all these are quiz questions where you are looking for a specific answer and it might not be relevant at all instead ask them to walk through a project they did including the business context and impact and then if things such as linear regression come up ask questions about it if you care to basically try to figure out whether they understand why they did certain things from both a business perspective and technical perspective and judge accordingly cmdrastronaughty oh man really i figured people can piece together things might not be production level code but it will get you there i will start incorporating my ds and developers mreloi if you do not have time to assess coding or case studies then get your team to do that part that is what i used to do i would give the cultural interview first and if the candidate looked like a good fit then i would pass them on for technical interviews thephoenixrisesagain there is zero need to test coding itself if people get the concepts and have a good understanding of how to apply certain techniques to a business problem they can always code it not true the other way around i have seen good coders who could not help solving any business related problem that is why we always test for general understanding of concepts and business applications coding is the easy part of our job i think the most effective interview approach is recruiter who explains upcoming interview process data scientist hiring manager that asks the questions you asked above in a minute interview take home coding exercise kaggle or hackerrank review exercise with data scientist minute flash round interviews with reach team member to determine fit it is lengthy for the candidate but it leaves nothing to chance when selecting the best candidate cmdrastronaughty i will look into adding my developers and ds into the interview to screen their coding ability purplebrownupdown yeah but a lot of that can be learned as well but i get it you want someone who is job is currently using those tools and software cmdrastronaughty it is for sure which is why i do not hold it against them in my decision making it is also why i ask them questions last so it does not make them feel pressured compared to if i ask it earlier i also tell them it is more of a nice to have not necessary cmdrastronaughty i like the second part of your answer it is vague i totally agree and there are many paths you could take i like where you headed honestly though its very well though out and i have not received those answers from my candidate have you found that when you ask candidates to walk you through their projects they are sort of just copying another persons work like the code and workflow just seems too perfectalmost staged and scripted quiet honestly i do not know how to word this hesitation what i mean by this is for example the kaggle titanic dataset work a lot of it is well documented there is plenty of guides out there for the code and explanation i have seen a lot of titanic kaggle notebooks and whats to say someone is not just copying another persons work and changing some values some hyper parameters and calling it their own work and i will definitely look into it i did have one candidate that provided his github and i was able to look through it and now i wish i asked him to walk through one of those projects with me cmdrastronaughty hr finds these candidates the business manager interviews them first then gets brought to me and now that i am typing this outi am thinking hold on that is stupid i should be able to screen these guys before the bm even interviews them time to implement that change lol i have had some candidates come through with a certification from datacamp or udemy i am wondering do these courses not teach basic stats and math i would like to audit one honestly just so i can see what is taught in those moocs i teach an undergraudate course at the level and i am confident that my students can answer questions similar to you cmdrastronaughty a week ds bootcamp level easy honor serious question is harmonic mean a joke in ds circles i have only ever used it in context of the score cmdrastronaughty dude what you gave for answer is literally what i want for an answer i want these candidates to say well let is pause here for a secondwhere is this data coming from who creates this data what does it inherently mean apart from the values in the dataset there is an aspect of eda that is more than just math ie giving me a distribution and what values are nullblah blah blah is there a better way i can frame that question to get that kind of answer cmdrastronaughty bummer i see you are doing a phd i know there are orgs that are hesitant in hiring individuals that are too academic makes no sense to me do not ask me why they do this i sadly do not have an internship program i really want one because i love developing students and giving them exposure to the field and experience in the past i have always treated my interns as full time people with all the rights and responsibilities obviously with a mentor they can ask questions the feedbacks have always been amazing damn budget reasons cmdrastronaughty i could care less if you want to program in r python cjulia my team has research people who script in r for stats and production people who script in python to put models in production we will put you wherever you want and if you are willing to learn cool tool wise shit man no need for pytorch or tensorflowyet lol scikit learn at the entry level is good enough for me or any basic ml library if you want to work in pandas cool if you want to work in exclusively numpycool too show me you have some basic understanding the team will give you opportunity to learn and hone your skills we cannot teach you from ground floor but we can meet you halfway cmdrastronaughty it is a wide range it was set by hr not me usd cmdrastronaughty some of the answers i am looking for just write a python script and if that job needs to be daily executed at you bet i am going to ask you to wake up at and run that script use that same python script and just attach it to a cron job use a cloud instance or function to trigger the script job on a time event basis use native os built in scheduler intuitively they are just cron jobs with a gui cmdrastronaughty can you answer those questions lol i am just joking if we have a mle that leaves the team i can keep you in mind but honestly the world needs more mle and mlops people i have noticed my ds guys being outpaced by just the sheer volume of automl tools out there that can do their jobs a bit quicker less accurate generally but still non the less quicker you in mle have a super bright future ahead of you proofrequired i agree with testing basic coding skill i have had ds managers who could not write a python script to save their life it just does not look good especially when the same manager would go around touting how this or that is easy and make promises to higher level stakeholder just ask the usual fizzbuzz stuff or just sum of elements in a list of numbers or calculate mean etc it should not be implementing some binary tree search etc i will also add some simple sql testing questions again nothing complicated but just group by etc i am also explicit about the fact that we have not hidden any trick under simpler question it is exactly how it looks like frosttrapsrghey honestly this is a huge problem with the tech sector as a whole right now hiring in incompetence that talks a good game has seen a huge number of people unqualified for their roles get in the best way for you to find the best candidate is to learn some of the skills and jargon yourself so you can get a better read on people is abilities first moscowgordon i mean yeah anything can be learned to an extent but if a person cannot figure out how to do a group by the problem is most likely that they just do not know how to work with data juniors do not have the confidence to reject the premise of a vague question they are too worried about finding the right answer i do not review code coding is the easy part thinking is the hard part i assume every college grad did at least one project to graduate so they usually mention that lets say part one of the project included web scraping i would ask how did you web scrap why did you decide to do it that way if they stole code they did not understand they would not be able to answer that if they stole code and worked to understand it that is fine i do that all the time graphicteadatasci does the business manager have anything to gain from the position not being filled if you used to be able to find good candidates and that has changed then maybe there is nothing wrong with your questions the salary looked pretty sweet for a junior position and maybe some people disagree with that i would add some very simple code questions based on the languages mentioned in their resumes one with this code is supposed to output this but outputs this can you find and explain the problem and can you try to explain what this code does partially to weed out anyone with no clue but mostly to have some very concrete things to talk about and get the nerds warmed up your questions are generally open ended and it takes a bit of time to get in the right headspace i guess it depends on the boot camp i guess out of the only one which might get someone is imho the first there are so many things you can do wrong on the data as wrong imputation methods for na wrong way to handle categoricals likert scales and so on outliers is a big one as well are basic i did teach them to undergrad in business now would they remember or have an idea to refresh different story so it is good to check if you ask about type and error is nice to follow up with the confusion matrix precision accuracy and recall and if you want to push it a little when would you use one or the other metric gives some idea of previous experience as well i do not like asking coding questions as well but some easy sql comes handy rupertalderson i think it is phrased well i was checking that you want that and if not i wanted to be sure you are reasonable about it funsatisfactionthank you for sharing i appreciate your open mindedness cmdrastronaughty i also want to say no is a bad way of doing the job you should always try to automate arenaone thank you for replying regarding your questions i must say as an mle the is not as easy as one might think and finally i hope someone replies to with the meme where type i is a doctor saying to a man you are pregnant and type ii a doctor telling a very pregnant woman that she is not pregnant lol thank you for your kind words actually sometimes being an mle is hard because you are expected to have all the stats ml of a data scientist all the engineering of a swe and the pipeline knowledge of a de but at least i am getting some calls which given this job market is probably an achievement already cmdrastronaughty i love everything you just said i will take it into consideration and implement thank you cmdrastronaughty lol i meant the bootcamp as a jokesorry text does not translate sarcasm well i do see what you mean with they are meant to be a conversation starter and i hope it does that more of open ended questions so the candidate and i can have a discussion honestly when i ask the type type questioni am just waiting for a candidate to say confusion matrixthat to me would be a perfectly acceptable answer in a very condense form it has yet to happen cmdrastronaughty of course good luck if you are not in the field yet and are trying to break into it if you are in the field keep on learning my gf did a post grad certificate in analytics and now she is half the way in her master and she could have got all your questions potentially with that months cert",

  "bcbcc i am in a vaguely similar position i think there will eventually be a separation between data scientists as analysts and data scientists as engineers like me it sounds like you are a ds analyst and are not interested in being an engineer there are ds jobs out there that want your skills they are just a little harder to find with all of the swe job postings that are called ds if you are enjoying the work you do and it pays well enough then do not stress yourself about a non existent problem grow in your role let the people in your company learn the value of a ds doing analysis and working with stakeholders and if the right opportunity somewhere else comes along you will be ready for it none many larger companies are now distinguishing between data scientists and ml engineers obviously the line between them is quite blurry but it may help to think about them in terms of the work outcome data scientists use data to drive business decisions junior ds may use data to help inform product features my a b test suggests that we should move the checkout button to the top of the page senior ds will use data to direct overall business strategy we should build a product to fulfill this unmet customer need ds may or may not use ml depending on whether or not it is the right tool for the job sometimes it is very often it is not ml engineers build productized ml models they concern themselves with things like feature engineering and loss functions a ml engineer may produce things like an image classifier or a recommender system wouldatastoryteller i would try to get a job at a company that does do ml if you cannot land a job doing ml try to get a job doing data analysis and start networking with the ml folks and see if you can shadow them or work on projects together figure out what skills you are lacking and focus on learning those then apply for an internal transfer when a role opens up",

  "solvermax this is entirely normal in all of the analytical teams that i have worked in with analysts focus on getting results good programming practices like testing and validation are neither implemented or encouraged a direct consequence is that many results are just plain wrong synthphreak i think what you described is pretty normal and as an mle i also hate it lack of documentation makes onboarding and orientation a nightmare lack of tests makes reproducibility harder and slows down refactoring almost every experiment seems to have at least one false start due to some silly bug but as i have gained experience i have started to at least understand why things are this way if not approve of it a part is that i think lots of people in the analytics space never studied cs so the importance of automation and good coding practices was never really instilled in them then again i also never studied cs nor swe and i definitely see the value in its principles so but the biggest factor imho is that for all the benefits of documentation tests tidy code etc that stuff does introduce significannot up front costs which slow you down at first in the world of experiments and exploratory analysis you have lots of little one off needs and must iterate quickly through the space of possibilities in order to identify the promising ones so while it is a bummer for the uninitiated to get acclimated to messy code in the end it is usually just faster to make small tweaks and roll with it rather than tweak document push pr etc the other thing to consider is that things like thorough documentation and testing are most critical when your code base will definitely persist and continue to undergo development for a while but in the worlds of data science and machine learning many lines of research most with their own code bases ultimately never bear fruit so get dropped for such work strands any time spent documenting and testing was wasted so when you are in that initial experimentation phase on the road to deciding whether to pivot or persist the cost benefit of taking time to write docs and tests is probably not worth it so yeah in conclusion i do think everybody is life would be better and fewer false results would occur if everyone just adopted proper coding discipline but doing so is not without drawbacks in the world of exploratory research mostly in terms of productivity so as always it is just a trade off chock a block at least on the commercial side this is completely normal i have sat in on meetings and watched others absolutely make up results because graphs but the code will never be reviewed or understood by the person making the decision to answer the obvious question yes i was out of there soon after as was the rest of my team i was thinking the same years ago too this day no one has asked to review my code they if they really wanted would review the findings and assumptions perhaps perform their own basic data inspection for any concern and that is it ipsocranius this is why the fda is starting to classify ml products as clinical devices i have seen obvious errors in the past week people write custom prediction functions and apply results to nondeterministically sorted lists as they predict bad outcomes among other things code review do it randomramman high performing teams have detailed code reviews this is the bare minimum even if they have some excuses for why they do not have documentation or testing in place which will almost all be bad excuses imo you must_ review each other is code maybe i have been lucky with the teams i have worked on so far but i am alarmed by the number of people in here saying they have no code review practice on their team i can see this being more common for analytics sql work not that i agree with it but it would be insane to ship an ml model without review no review testing etc is absolutely the norm in academia in my experience the open code data movement is helping here but most fields have a long way to go at least in academia you have many groups trying to study the same things so if your paper makes a claim but the code had a catastrophic bug it will likely be caught eventually if it does not make sense in the context of everyone else is work that is my take from my experience in physics anyway ymmv slackington what you are describing has been my experience too but things are starting to change in analytics there is a shift towards writing production grade sql to centralize kpi definition and optimize performance in data science ml a lot of companies are moving towards data products with clear sla both mean code needs to be version controlled peer reviewed documented and adhere to company standards icymammoth weird my teams do pr reviews any code analysis gets reviewed and approved before we share results with stakeholders eipi what you are describing has been my experience too at my last job absolutely no code review whatsoever most code was not even checked into git i also have friends in academia phd programs in stats that have no code review and their code is terribly written at my current job we make a big effort to do code review write tests etc it takes time but it makes us all a lot more confident that what we are doing is actually right and makes it easier to make changes to code in the future without worrying about breaking things honestly it is insane to me that data scientists are not writing tests i would never ship something to production that had not been tested fun if you work for a strong team there will be peer review of analytical code i have worked in teams with and without code review and in the team without code review i partnered with another strong data scientist to review our work you can create the good practices in your teams it is because ds is the field where a computer scientist goes when they cannot be bothered to to proper software engineering and code testing because it is boring s but only partially because the real answer is a bit more nuanced but it is also kinda true it depends on the company in my ds rotation they had code reviews esp before a model was given to ml engineers for production milkteaoppa yup both academia and industry should not be that way but as long as errors are not caught then it does not matter they exist justaneedlessboi yea that bothers me as well i think it might be because the field is close to statistics and analytics and not just programming so people just focus on preparing the report and do not care if it will work later but yea some time ago i noticed that a dataset prepared by a colleague duplicated every record above a certain value so there were like as many records but nobody looks at these things seriesg yeah i see this all the time practices that should be standard on more of a data engineering track like code reviews are not even considered for the analytics side of the house it isworrisome artistic off topic but an auroc of is not good if the data are skewed in anything close to an ratio a simple guess would do that this is why roc curves are not all that meaningful if the prior probability is significannot different than what you really need is auprc where the baseline is equal to the frequency of the predicted event autumnotter yes this is normal it is more normal in academia where software engineering best practices are rarely discussion no this is not ideal half my job is teaching data engineering and data science teams how to use git test write documentation collaborate and deploy i am brought in to do much more advanced things but then that ends up being the places they are nearly always deficient you should have simple code reviews a basic version artifact control workflow testing and documentation it will be challenging convincing others to use good practices but learning them will take you far yep protonpusher it is easier to publish produce rubbish and put the burden on someone else than to verify your own work if the error is ever discovered the person producing the crap has moved on having acquired the false accolades and will not be held responsible this is the norm in academia and data science and why there is such a proliferation of frauds why waste the time to potentially prove your model wrong when your teammate competitor is a fraud and just turns in garbage positive results in half the time do notyouloveme in the funding and corporate world they do not want to know what your code is they just want the results to look good so they can cash in on it you will suffer far more negative consequences by producing correct code that generates results that look bad for the organization they would rather you mess up and make them look good skeletonsofcloset do you think its because the data science field is yet to incorporate proper industry standard practices that engineers follow skeletonsofcloset thanks for the detailed response yeah we have really great data scientists in team who come up with amazing solutions but after the work is done they are too lazy to go back document the code and just move on to something else and the interns or other members are made to pick up the pieces and make it production level or worse they send it to data engineers and they would scream looking at the code maybe a little effort to document a bit goes a long way for others but i understand the trade offs you mentioned and one needs to balance that while writing code jobeta i agree with this essentially in ds writing tests before your model is going to be in prod is likely to end up being very wasteful but as soon as it does hit prod you should write tests or expose yourself to the same issues as with any production system psychologically it sucks because you have shared your results everyone is hopefully excited and you have to tell them to slow down so you can write tests engineering teams will look at you like you are crazy and non technical teams who feed off fresh hot results to stay motivated to even care about your relationship will be bummed it sucks so i guess one should always try to set expectations with the added time to write these tests but not reviewing the code seems almost always crazy however op talks about peer reviewed articles i had the same experience you can publish tons of results relying on code that no one ever reviews even the journal reviewers which quite frankly is a bit crazy even outside of the ml field they often incentivize for you to share your code but will not actually review it if the code is accessible at least it is out there for everyone to see and review when they need it but if your code is not properly tested it is likely that it will break constantly and no one will end up using it anyways skeletonsofcloset damn thanks never knew this was the norm skeletonsofcloset yeah this is how i feel going through their poor code synthphreak sla skeletonsofcloset yeah in the production level there is some kind of code checking since it involves both engineers and scientists but converting to production level code from the shitty un documented analysis code repo is a pain skeletonsofcloset yeah such mistakes are what scares me when i write code lmao skeletonsofcloset ohh so the project i had worked on had previous auroc of so it was an improvement on the test set yeah we had shown prc curves but it was not that great so my prof moved it to supplementary lol solvermax i think it is because few analysts have studied computer science writing code is a means to an end having been self taught with little or no knowledge of the lessons learnt by professional programmers over several decades of experience thenoobtologist i would say so it is also been my experience that data science seldom has code checks a lot of times the teams are small and the managers might not be technically enough to support code reviews synthphreak a part of it is also probably a not my problem mentality most organizations have a human centipede structure with each job family forced to eat somebody else is shit in your org i guess the des eat the ds shit and in all likelihood the ds probably have to eat the shit of the business folks in the form of let me barf some half baked poorly articulated idea into your ears now go monetize it with the magic of data science chock a block ohhh yeah for sure it is changed a little but not a whole lot you are in a tough situation if he decides to develop some emotional intelligence it is going to take years in my present role i was advised i should use matlab rather than python but was told there were scripts i can use to maintain common team output months later i have used one matlab gui they shared which was externally produced for the team everything else has been in python using my own code as there was seemingly reluctance to share their code slackington service level agreement if your data product becomes a feature clients pay for there are much stricter availability requirements artistic just a little pet peeve of mine roc are everywhere and are often used as a surrogate for accuracy unfortunately they fall apart when the coin flip baseline assumption does not hold congratulations on the publication btw skeletonsofcloset ahh makes sense most of my team members have just done research with a proj with a cs degress or a few are mechanical engineers who did a course on coursera and a few projects and got a job in data science so have no idea what it means to write proper maintainable code skeletonsofcloset i have faced this too initially i though its because they did not want to share their ideas cause they were way up their ass but later when i went through their github code i realized it was poorly documented and there were a lot of mistakes in how the data was processed i feel the reluctance is there because they know their code has a lot of flaws and do not want someone to point them out to and make them feel stupid or worse invalidate their entire hard work since they did not have any prior good code maintenance experience or proper code testing solvermax yep that is typical of most teams",
  "therealtiddlydump i am curious about dipping my feet further in deep learning but also in management you have described the two different paths individual contributor vs manager you might want to get that sorted out first dfphd i am curious about dipping my feet further in deep learning but also in management by going for a tech lead team rep position at my next company but i have no idea how to apply for something like that or what kind of position i should be seeking is this typically something you have to earn your way into via promotion rather than through applying if there is a job posting for it it means they could not find someone internally to do it so the answer is simple apply yes at some companies they will very much focus on promoting internally but that really only works at companies where you have a lot of junior people and a huge recruiting pipeline and even then at some point you are still going to be open to bringing people in from companies of equal or greater statute to yours so if you are google you are probably not hiring a manager from a low level tech company but are you going to take a manager from aws or apple probably but for most companies as i said if there is a job opening it is because they need someone to come in and they could not find someone internally sleepycarrotz right which is why i stated cursory interest in a team lead type position sleepycarrotz gotcha i have a way of overcomplicating you are right i just need to keep looking brrow many places are required to post the job externally even if the hire will eventually be internal cliffdraws word of warning if you hate lead manager it can be extremely hard to get back to a singular role",

  "timelyparadox yea parameters always seemed off without any revolutionary change in optimisation or hardware hardware side does not seem to be the case since it did not jump too much from the time of the gpt maybe they found a hacky way to optimize it but not in the degrees of freedom needed jturp sc that is all very well reasoned technical explanations but i can give you the very clear business reasoning cogs at the end of the day openai needs to deliver a model that can be run at a business viable operating expense for companies that will consume it right now there are certain use cases where the presently available gpt models are not economically viable for high frequency applications especially if fine tuning is necessary if gpt was comically larger than gpt then it would certainly balloon costs to where very few business applications would be able to absorb the impact to their cogs at a gross margin that made their business operators comfortable will they have to retrain completely or can then reuse the parameters from and build a differential model on top i thought that is what was done with imagenet for image detection catalyzexcodebot found relevant code at all code implementations here opt out from receiving code links dm me nittygrittydiscutant given gpus and using the calculus from above it would still take roughly years to train the model ok but how many gpu are out there in the wild i think i will not be wrong when i say more then lesleyfair fully agree a sparse moe model is very much in line with the order of magnitude jump in dense equivalent param size from to deto it would have to be used for some dramatically more specialized purpose like wouldnt be able to use it to provide customer service but if it is smart enough i could see someone paying to say take some data and write a draft business plan i do not disagree with the post is argument though on why the model will not be this big just speculating on how you would justify a model that large economically lesleyfair well said friend do you have specific applications in mind tundur we have already got a heap of usecases for gpt that easily beat the cost of gpt i would say it could even be beyond a dollar per token before it stops making sense the problem at the moment is just regulatory no one is sending customer data to a black box api in california and using that to make decisions and absolutely no one is relying on it for a critical process until gpt can be hosted in country and has more visibility of what happens to traffic hitting it there is no business case still about an order of magnitude cheaper than comparable human labor your argument does not make sense because the unit economics for running on a cloud server is still better than the unit economics for labor timelyparadox hey we can always hope they have a magical breaktrough and use quantum computing for training timelyparadox to was jump we talk about jump here the need of more data that is why i said a moe model which when matching flops is equivalent to dense models smaller in size not to mention you and op seem to be very confused about how scaling laws work",

  "abdoughnut i am inspired it is fun to nerd out sometimes let me preface this by saying i have no idea what i am talking about but do not gpus help us process tensors regardless of whether they represent images or any other data renokarchnmy they use c c bindings like you did parallel processing is possible with python take courses on parallel processing concurrency and distributed systems programming if you have not yet that is how the libraries are efficient gpus are good for computing a massive number of parallel tasks that are very similar they are called graphics processing units because traditionally they are used for games and design software pentinumlol also in cases where sk learn uses scipy to run its algorithm such linear regression the scipy code is actually written in fortran f daddyaries that makes sense but how are these libraries doing so in a cross platform way to my understanding these libraries do not leverage opencl or opengl but they do make use of cuda this confused me because using cuda requires a machine with nvidia hardware therefore not producing something inherently cross platform abdoughnut right so they should still be used to speed up computations on non graphic data correct daddyaries now this is very interesting i will have to research this and dive into the source code of both projects renokarchnmy correct non cuda hardware did not accelerate libraries like tensorflow see nvidia stock price there has been work to establish compatibility with amd and apple hardware with those libraries there are subtle performance increases even between cpu hardware some instruction set or whatever in intel allowed for a small efficiency bump over amd and arm core for core ghz for ghz historically these packages and libraries have not been cross platform however all of the scikit learn stuff is cpu based anyways there are also things like the intel neural compute stick and other niche arm acceleration hardware i do not think anyone ever was under the misconception that these libraries were cross platform they are instead portable and can run on consumer hardware that was the big lift in popularity just that it required cuda drivers to do it until more recently also consider subtle features of hardware for performance like ecc ram it may be slower ram but the reduction in faults over consumer fast gaming ram is a boon to an entire system expected to run for weeks at a time training models yeah anything with a massive number of simple parallel operations renokarchnmy it is the floating point ops that are of interest specifically tensorflow is just matrix math library riding on top of cuda drivers to offload metric crap tons of flops to the gpu for parallel processing same reason they are popular for crypto mining and occasionally to accelerate database servers using them to accelerate anything incurs overhead that may be more expensive than just keeping the process in the cpu basic maths on small data cpu is fine transposing a multi gigabyte matrix of floats yeah just take the overhead hit and send it to the gpu wouldaddyaries this was an excellent breakdown and incredibly helpful thanks renokarchnmy never a problem",
  "hesaconghost it could just be that this is as accurate as you can get with these data and this technique adding more data may not help you what can help is quantifying uncertainty if you can get a confidence interval around your model you can find the points it fails and build another model on those points what you then have is an ensemble model where the models best fit subsets of the data rather than trying to force one model to do everything the patterns you find in splitting the data might also be useful for classifying different groups which you could use as a categorical factor in other models"
