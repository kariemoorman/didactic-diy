  "I just received an Echo Show 10 from a friend. \n\nHe was able to deregister it from his account and factory reset it. \n\nWhen I plug the device in, it boots past the Amazon and Echo screens (makes the noises), but then to a blank backlit black screen. \n\nI cannot get it past that. \n\nI am able to reset as well, but with the same result.\n\nI\u2019ve tried all the suggestions that the troubleshooting has suggested. \n\nDoes anyone have any other ideas?",
  "Last night at 3am my Alexa went off. I have a fan in the room so I couldn\u2019t hear what she said, but a white light came on and stayed one for 10 minutes or so. It spookled me so I was going through my Alexa app on my phone trying to find a routine or alarm that would make her do that. I found NOTHING. After looking through the routines for a bit I started setting up the Sunset routine that turns the lights on as the sun sets, simply out of curiosity. However it requires an address and after what Alexa had just done I wasn\u2019t sharing that. So I found random spot in a nearby town, and it made me label the spot. So I start to type \u201chere or there\u201d but on the word \u201cthere\u201d I switched to swipe text. When I did that it looked like what I had typed was \u2018cut\u2019 and \u201cget out get out get out get out\u201d was \u2018pasted\u2019 there. The last couple of get outs were jumbled together. I PANICKED and locked my phone, I wish I would\u2019ve taken a screenshot. But when I reopened my phone the label only said \u201cI\u2019m\u201d and the location had moved to over my freaking house. I have never had anything spooky happen at my house before, and I never asked for this. I genuinely don\u2019t know what to do. Do I burn the house down and move? Could someone have hacked my Alexa and my Alexa app on my iPhone??",
  "I was an early adopter - I have a first generation Echo (still works and was still in use!). But I can't take it anymore. This started as a great tool to use in the home. I could control my lights, add things to a list, play music ... everything I wanted. Until Amazon decided to change it's primary function to marketing. \n\nSo many times, I went through the settings of my devices and turned off anything that would get it to stop \"By the way!\"ing me, only to have it start up again a couple weeks later. Now the changes revert even sooner. I've tried in vain to turn off notifications to stop the yellow ring from popping up \"reminding\" me of a feature I have yet to try (and don't want).  Tired of more and more ads appearing on my Show, despite me doing everything possible to lock that down on the screen. \n\nSeriously - I paid a premium, particularly for the early generations. I'd pay a subscription cost to keep updates coming, if only some company would stop treating these things as ad platforms.\n\nOther complaints? Just scan this sub, I am sure I've experienced most everything anyone who has ever complained about their Echo. It all starts to pile up. \n\nSo goodbye Echo. All seven devices are now deregistered and unplugged, awaiting disposal. I don't really have a replacement ... going to have a single Homepod just to play music in the kitchen and maybe add to a shopping list, but that's it. I tried Mycroft - still playing with that, but no idea how long that will be viable. \n\nI guess I just don't need the voice interface as much as I thought. It definitely isn't worth the frustration and intrusion...",
  "Title says it all.  The Alexa app basically shows what's currently playing.  There's no way to browse track listings.  There's no way to browse my Apple Music library.  If I want to listen to something in Apple Music \"Listen Now,\" I have to go into the Apple Music app, find it, note the name, and then say something like \"Alexa, play Apple Music <album name> by <artist name.>\n\nOr am I missing something?  \n\nMy prior experience with the Sonos app is that, once you connect it to a music service, you can browse the music service from within the Sonos app.",

  "Hello Everyone,\n\nToday I installed Echo for my Grandma everything is working fine. The TV is already working and tomorrow I'll install the light switches.\n\nCurrently the Echo is sitting in the Kitchen. I've noticed that when saying something in the living room, the Echo sometimes has a hard time picking up what I'm saying(no background noise).\n\nI'm looking for a Device, that basically forwards the voice commands to the Echo, so I can set one up for the Living Room. (Like a WiFi Repeater but for a Microphone)\n\nI'm NOT looking for a WiFi Repeater, nor am I looking for a Voice Remote. (Wanted to make it clear because Google spits these out)\n\nUsing the Smartphone as a Voice Remote is also not an Option since she isn't very good with using the phone.\n\nI thought about getting another Echo but is that really the only way? Is there a Cheap way? How is a whole house set up? There's no way they put an Echo in every room right?\n\nThanks for reading this far. I'm very inexperienced but I'm absolutely willing to learn.",

  "One of the things that do not work well with translation is the time-out. You basically have to have a fluid conversation, or if you just want have Echo translate word or phrases perhaps, then you need to say these phrases without long gaps in between. Maybe I am reading a text and I need to translate a word here and there. \n\nThe issue with both Google Assistant Home and Amazon Echo Alexa speakers is the time-out during translation.. that is e.g. I have the device translate the word and then I continue reading and find another word I want to translate.\n\nThe speaker waits for the word to translate, once it is finished it waits for the next word. There is a time-out however, after which the device goes to sleep (that's at least the issue with the speakers without display)\n\nTime-out on Google Assistant seems to be even shorter than Alexa but both is definitively short for me. \n\nMy question:\n\nIs the time-out on the Echo Show device same? If I set the display on the Echo device to not to go to sleep, will it continue to listen to me for the next for to translate? Let's say I say a word to translate and then 30 seconds later I need another word translated. Will Echo continue handling the next word translation?\n\nOr will I have to say again \"Alexa, translate from Spanish to English\"?\n\nThis is the issue, if Echo doesn't hear anything, it times out and to start translation for the next word, I have to go through the whole process again and tell the full phrase \"Alexa, translate from Spanish to English\"?\n\nIdeally I would like to be able to set a time-out longer so Alexa continues listening to me.",
  "Someone I know passed away and their husband gave me their \"Alexa\" because they didn't know how to use it and wouldn't use it. \n\nI took it home and plugged it in, but it seems to be stuck on blue light with green circling continuously. I tried turning it on and off for various lengths of time and I have tried to reset it by holding down the mute and down volume button for 20 seconds but nothing happened. Only thing I've been able to do is toggle the mute button on and off, and while messing around with it I noticed if I turn it off then hold the action button when I turn it back on it goes to a solid green light. \n\nI also tried turning my modem on and off, and tried the auto connect thing on it when I turned the echo on too. Neither of these worked either. I tried using a different power supply from my echo sub too but it was just the same.\n\nI haven't really been able to find anything online other than how to reset it but as I mentioned that didn't work.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas I'd be grateful for the help as I'd love to get it working and pair with the sub to give my father to replace his echo dot.",

  "[Here is the article about expected upgrades from the Echo 4th Gen to the 5th. ](https://www.androidauthority.com/amazon-echo-5th-gen-3095027/)\n\n[Article about Echo Gen 4 gaining support. ](https://www.androidauthority.com/amazon-matter-over-thread-3262939/)\n>\tAt CES 2023, Amazon announced Matter-over-Thread support will be coming to Echo devices this spring, according to The Verge. Along with that support, the company will turn its Echo 4th gen smart speaker into a Matter controller and a Thread border router.\n\nMy primary purpose in getting an Echo was to help integrate smart devices - especially lights. I am particularly excited the potential this has. The 4th Gen already sounds amazing so the only thing I would really miss is the clock like the Dot 5th gen has. \n\nI found a new Echo Gen 4 for $35 on FB marketplace and a year-old used for $20 down the street. I want to pick one up and am just a bit confused by this article because the 4th Gen will have support, including for iOS, by Spring 2023 which is probably before the Echo 5th Gen. Will the 5th Gen have Matter over Thread capabilities that the Echo 4th won\u2019t have?\n\nIf not, I will get one of these 4th gens now and save a lot of money + not have to wait for the 5th to be released and go on sale. \n\nHere is the excerpt from the first link that prompted me to post this:\n\n>One thing we can say with confidence is Matter over Thread. Amazon has already delivered Matter on many devices and promised Thread for some, including the Echo 4th gen, so all that remains is for the company to offer both out-of-the-box in the next generation.\n\n>What are Matter and Thread? You can read more about them via our links, but in short, Matter is a newly-launched network protocol that lets accessories work across all major smart home platforms. You don\u2019t have to worry if products like smart bulbs are explicitly compatible with your platform of choice \u2014 in theory, they\u2019ll just work so long as they have the Matter logo. The standard also reduces the need for hubs, bridges, and internet access by enabling local mesh networks.\n\n>Matter over Thread should make the Echo 5th gen a cornerstone of many smart homes.\nMatter can operate over Ethernet and Wi-Fi, yet it\u2019s ideally meant to be used with Thread, a Zigbee-based wireless protocol. Many Thread products operate as their own low-powered \u201cborder routers\u201d to which other Thread accessories connect. The tech is already in accessories like HomePods and Micron bulbs and light panels (see the image above).\n\n>With Matter over Thread, the Echo 5th gen will likely be a cornerstone of many smart homes, pairing accessories from hundreds of brands. The real question is whether you\u2019ll eventually be able to use the speaker itself in Apple HomeKit or Google Home, not just Alexa \u2014 the option isn\u2019t in Matter 1.0, but might hypothetically come down the road.",
  "Asking for songs from Spotify Alexa seems to choose the most obscure and wrong versions of songs possible. Asking for classical music it will play a punk version from an obscure artist with listen counts in the hundred rather than a hundred different obvious choices if I look myself manually.\n\nIf I want a song by a popular band it will find some random cover instead of the original. .\n\nIf I type the same keywords onto Spotify these versions won't be listed without digging because it knows better. \nHow is a product this old so bad\n\nAfter playing the same thing wrong multiple times and telling it to stop and play a more specific version you'd think it would adapt and skip the wrong selection.",

I kept using the laptop for business and general stuff but my Bluetooth has been going bad as well, so I switched the speaker to the desktop.

Took over an hour and many attempts to set up his voice ID through the Alexa app. Once we did, all was good. A couple learning hiccups, but no problems. Until today. \n\nThis morning, Alexa broke. Every echo dot in our house stopped working for my son. We have six echo dots and all were giving him the same message every time: \"I'm having trouble, please try again in a little while\". Except Alexa still answers me with no problems.\n\nStandard troubleshooting; turn modem off and back on, then unplug dots one at a time, plug back in and let it reload. No success. She still wouldn't answer him in anything other than that one phrase. \n\nSo, we contact Amazon. Follow their instructions, delete his voice ID. Once deleted, Alexa responds to whatever he asks without problem. So suggestion was to set up his voice ID again in the Alexa app (kids account has to be done in the app according to the app). Except this time, the app won't even register that he's saying anything. At all. \n\nOur issue is being reported to the developers and we await instructions and update on a fix. In the meantime so that we have particular functions, I added an adult profile with his voice ID which works fine.\n\nAnyone elses Amazon kids voice ID broken? What country?",

  "One of my primary intended uses of echo devices is as a sleep noise machine. However, I have just never managed to get it reliable enough to actually use. Most (but not all) nights, the echo will just abruptly stop somewhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours into the night, waking me up. \n\n* Skills: I have used various free 10+ hour noise skills, a brown noise file playing over a Plex server, and a brown noise file playing from a Google drive link using the My Pod skill. I get the same problem with all of them.\n\n* Devices: I orginally used an echo show 5, and because I thought it might be a device specific problem I just got a 5th gen dot. I get the same problem.\n\n* Network: My home uses a TP-Link 2.4/5ghz ac mesh system. Network diagnostics show a lot of other networks in the neighborhood, but my channels are significantly stronger than any others and there is actually very little congestion. There are typically 16-20 devices on the network at the time, the majority of which are echos, smart plugs, doorbells, door locks, and other very low traffic devices. There is almost no active network traffic during the night besides the stupid echo I am trying to use as a sound machine.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas about other things to try, I would be grateful to hear them.

When it comes to audio devices, I have chosen to place 3 Echo's and one Echo Studio in a type of surround sound configuration. The three Echo's were purchased first and then the Studio was my latest acquisition.\n\nHonestly, I am not impressed. While the Studio certainly produces more bass than the regular Echo devices, it falls short when it comes to clarity of sound.\n\nAmazon advertised a type of immersive experience, a enveloping 360\u00b0 sound experience, which I have yet to figure out how to configure. I do understand that only certain songs have been recorded in this fashion, and I have tried listening to them, but I really can't hear what all the hype is about?\n\nNow I'm not trying to completely dis Amazon's devices, as the Echo is a phenomenal speaker for the price. However, for the amount of money that the Echo Studio costs, I anticipated a higher quality product, with MUCH better sound. \n\nMaybe I got a bad device? \n\nMy questions to the group are (if you have an echo studio, or have listened to one), do you have the same complaints, and if so are there specific settings I should try to improve the sound quality? Also, what is your opinion of this speaker, and what would you recommend Amazon change in their next version?\n\nHope Amazon doesn't blacklist me for this post! lol But I was really hoping to get something incredible when I purchased the Studio, and so far my experience has been really disappointing.\n\nThank you for commenting, and sharing any recommendations and or experiences you've had with the Echo Studio!\n\n\n\nJ.

  "I bought a FireTV on sale a while ago and it came with an Echo Show.  I did not want one, but I wasn't going to turn that down.  Just the other day I decided to give it shot.  I really only want to use it to control my TV.\n\nI have an old-school, basic S/PDIF surround sound receiver hooked up to my FireTV.  This is the only speaker I am interested in using.\n\nAfter some screwing around I was able to get my Echo to control my TV (More or less), though it is pretty terrible.\n\n\nMy main issue is that when I ask Alexa to do something it will mute my receiver part-way through responding.  I can't determine a reason.  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  It basically makes the entire thing useless because I have to unmute the receiver, and I can't really ask the Echo for any information because it just cuts itself off.\n\n\nMy Echo also does not turn on my receiver when I ask it to to turn on the TV.  This is not an IR issue, as I am aware that the receiver controls are being emitted from the FireTV remote.  It still doesn't work regardless of if the remote is pointed at the receiver or not.  I don't know if this is solvable, but it also makes it pretty useless.  No sound means no music.  I don't really see why this is the way it is.  If I ask Alexa to change the volume it controls the receiver just fine.\n\n\nA third issue is actually playing music.  I use Pandora as my default music service.  When I do already have my TV on AND ask Alexa to play music AND it doesn't mute itself, it doesn't actually open Pandora on the TV.  I don't know how to explain what it does, but it is buggy to say the least.  Sometimes it'll show a fullscreen display with the song, or something it'll show a fullscreen display of the last song and never change, or sometimes it'll just play in the background with no way to interact with it on the TV.  I also can't find any effective way to change my Pandora station to one of my custom stations.\n\n\nSorry for the wall of unformatted garbage, but I think unformatted garbage is an accurate description of my experiences with the Alexa so far.  It's a real damn shame since stand-alone, the Echo Show worked great.  Considering it came with the TV, I thought it would interact better with it.\n\n\nTLDR; My Echo keeps muting itself mid-sentence for no reason, and fails at every other task.

If I play music on the group \"unit\", then does it play in stereo, since I got both devices within 2 feet of each other?   Or does it just play mono, and exact same sounds on both devices?\n2. Is there anyway to play an audible book, so it plays on the group?    And would it be in stereo or just mono across both devices?\n3. And is there anyway, I can tell the echo dot, to use the group by default, whenever I give it any commands?   For example, whether I set an alarm, audible or music, or anything else, that by default it will use the group \"unit\" to output any sounds?\n\nSo far, I can get music to play on the group, but can not get audible books to play on the group.   And I can't tell if it is playing in stereo or just mono / same sounds on both devices in the group?",
  "Bought a couple of Echos and (gen 5 if it matters) to setup around the flat, and some smart plugs.\n\nI intended to get more smart gadgets as I went along.\n\nBut the Alexa software seems to be sorely lacking. \n\nIssues I have encountered:\n\n* A household cannot have 3 adults.\n\n* Spotify integration is patchy at best. Particularly when it comes to different users. It also announces each song before playing it, with no option to turn that off.\n\n* Voice Commands are quite stupid, for instance I can say \"Alexa thank you\" at the end of a timer and it will respond \"your welcome\" and continues the timer.\n\n* Multiple timers don't differentiate themselves in any way.\n\n* The Shopping List \"share\" function is just a fucking copy paste, not allowing me to create shared shopping lists with multiple people.\n\nSo far I am left very disappointed by the software that is supporting the Alexa service, and it doesn't sound like it's getting better.",

Assuming the Echo Dots can connect to the 5 ghz wifi network, can I start streaming Amazon Music on one of those devices and then tell those devices to stream the same media to the Echo Dots? If they can only connect to 2.4 ghz, can I still send the media from a device on the 5 ghz network to them? Does the audio match up really well across the devices, or is there a lag sometimes?

They also show notifications for deliveries from the US Amazon site.\n\nAll the other devices work with my Amazon UK account - as they all should - but they'll talk over the other (US) group and what I say to this group doesn't display in the Alexa app on my phone. They will show notifications for deliveries made from Amazon UK. \n\nThe real problem is that any new integrations \\_only\\_ work with my original Echo group as well as my Alexa app but won't work with any new Echo devices I add, so my Ring doorbell alerts the 2 old Echo 1's but won't show up on my Echo Show - which is pretty frustrating.\n\nDoes anyone know how I can fix this?",

I have some empty gangs where my light switches are, and an installing these to trigger routines. I have nothing connected to the load wire (note, it requires a neutral).\n\nYou can have it do up to two routines (one for on, one for off).  It's's not a true rocker, but rather a button, so hit it once to turn on, hit it again to turn off.\n\nSo basically, I now have a button that can do anything a routine can do, which I think makes it more flexible than any scene controller.  For example, you can have it play a specific playlist on a specific echo, or you can have it turn on the tv and change it to a specific station via logitech harmony hub, etc.",

  "When echo dot communicates to a device like e.g. a WiFi socket, does echo send the on/off command directly to the socket in the same WLAN home network, or does all communication go via the internet and I need an account at the socket manufacturer?\n\n----\n\nUpdate: Answer: It depends on which socket (smart plug) I have!\n\n_**Bad example:**_      \nE.g. a Tapo socket (P100 for example) requires you to first install the Tapo app on your smartphone and open an account in the Tapo cloud with your email. Then any switch on/off command that you invoke via Alexa speech command involves not only the Amazon cloud but also the Tapo cloud, which communicates directly with your Tapo P100 smart plug (socket).\n\n_**Good example:**_        \nSmart plugs with **Tasmota** firmware (e.g. DeLock 11826, or Currymaster) support MQTT protocol and CAN an DO communicate directly to my Amazon echo dot!\n\nOn the one hand I can switch them on/off directly via a simple local URL get command, e.g. by typing in my web browser:\n\n* http://192.168.178.99/cm?cmnd=Power%20toggle\n\n* http://192.168.178.99/cm?cmnd=Power%20on\n\n* http://192.168.178.99/cm?cmnd=Power%20off\n\n(if the local IP of my WLAN smart plug is 192.168.178.99)\n\nBut on the other hand I can also control them directly by my Amazon echo dot device (echo dot 4 in my case) after only once initiating a search for devices in my WLAN from the Alexa app (Android 10 smartphone in my case).\n\nMy WLAN router (fritz!box) is and always was configured to block ANY internet traffic for my delock sockets (delock smart plugs), so they can only communicate locally within my home network (WLAN).\n\nThis is the way it should be - no unnecessary 3rd party cloud or 3rd party account is needed.\n\n----\n\n*Statements by other users in this thread saying that a direct communication (in the WLAN) between Amazon echo dot and smart plug are \"not possible (because Alexa is not designed to work this way)\" are hence provably incorrect (probably due to incomplete knowledge of these commenters as to what Alexa Echo's different modes of operation are).*",

  "Wondering if anyone else has had this issue or maybe a solution.\n\nWife and I have had several Alexa devices in the house for years, app on our phones, etc. etc. with no problems. Main usage is music, timers, and a grocery list.\n\nOver the past few months, with nothing changing on our end, our shopping list is a mess. I believe I've narrowed it down to this: If an item is added via voice to any of our devices, our shopping list has the item added and the sync appears immediately across our phones. Any changes made *locally* however, to the list on either of our phones (typing in an item, crossing off the list as we shop) is *not* synced.\n\nI made our list today by hand since I can't talk due to throat surgery. Cleared the 90+ items that were sitting there since crossing them off as we shop doesn't sync (I don't want to say I've gotten used to that but...) and proceeded to type everything out. 40ish items later, done, wife gets to the store and asks if I've made the list yet - she had a blank slate (since she crossed off the previous shopping trips as she shopped) but nothing I had added. I ended up sending her screenshots of the list rather than type it out again. Kinda ridiculous (And first world problem, I know, but still)\n\nAgain, nothing has changed on our end, but I did the usual song and dance of signing out and in on each phone, clearing caches, un/reinstalling, and every combination thereof, and nothing. Sorry Amazon, I'm not factory resetting 2 Galaxies - That's not gonna do it at this point.\n\nAm I alone/ any possible fixes? Thanks",

On my PC I have a virtual mixer, and initially set a 2nd output to be an optical cable running to the studio. Not synced at all.\n\nNext I tried a USB soundcard, with RCA to the 3.5mm jack. Still got an audible delay.\n\nNext I tried the headphone jack on my monitor, connected to the PC via DisplayPort. Nope.\n\nFiguring the issue was with the virtual mixer not being able to sync the outputs, I tried a physical mixer, main speakers on the main mix and the Studio connected to the headphone out. STILL getting a delay on the Studio's output. It's not enough that you'd notice it as the only audio device (still synced to lips on the screen etc) but you definitely notice it with both outputs up, as speech sounds (no pun intended) Echo-y.\n\nHas anyone noticed this before on a Studio? I got it to do an update straight out of the box, so there's no issue there. My use case is probably not too common so maybe it hasn't been run into before, but I thought I'd ask.

  "Just like the title says, Echo is becoming worse and worse by the day.Our home has had at least 3 of them (a fourth we don't use as often when we want to be able to control the bathroom lights from the bath with voice) and every year we would excitedly buy one of the new models and marvel over how insanely accurate and helpful it was. When I got my 4th gen Echo two Christmas's ago I (and everyone else in my household) was absolutely blown away by the fact that even though it was setup in the livingroom, it could hear me \\*\\*whisper\\*\\* from the kitchen and still accurately deduce what I was saying 99% of the time. \n\nShe always answered questions well and was genuinely helpful, *and now that's all changed lmao.*\n\nToday, not only can the echo not pick up my voice from the kitchen unless I shout, literally at least 30% of the time she hears something completely different than what I've said *even if I'm sitting 3 feet away!* As well, half the responses are \"an Alexa contributors answer blah blah blah....\", which would be absolutely ok if she actually heard what I said in the first place. \n\nOn top of that she frequently has connection issues, babbles strange crap out of nowhere (did anyone else get that weird 'laughing' bug, where she started laughing like a maniac for no reason out of nowhere??) and I often look over while watching a show or something to see her ring turning on and staying on for minutes at a time, making me feel like she really is just there to spy on people for the corporate entity that is Scamazon.\n\nAnyhow, well there's my rant. I do get some comedy out of the whole thing and it's a great conversation-piece for how funny it is that we live in a world that is absolutely intrinsically linked with all of this amazing technology *that never really properly works all of the time* but we just keep on using it anyhow hahaha.\n\nWell, thanks for listening.

  "**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called \"Everywhere Turntable\" specifically for that purpose, that includes the Link. Now I can use the \"Everywhere\" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue. Some comments claim to confirm the issue was fixed, but it most certainly was not.",

  "After months of not asking for help and trying to figure this out on my own, I am here with a very important question that I can hopefully get answered. \n\nAfter reading raving reviews this past summer, I spent just a little over $220 on a pair of echo gen 4's.\n\nThe sound quality is excellent and I am very pleased. But ...........\n\nHowever, I just can't enjoy them. Why? In my art studio, I have limited space. One speaker is closer to me than the other. I knew this going in. In the past, this has never been an issue with other speakers / stereo amps, etc because I could always adjust the speaker furthest from my ear to make up the distance it was from me. I did this by simply increasing volume on that speaker to equalize / balance the pair for maximum stereo enjoyment between the pair.\n\nCan someone please carefully explain to me how to do this with my Amazon Echo Gen 4s? I have one dominating speaker that is over-powering the other that is a bit further away from me. No, I cannot move the furthest speaker to make it closer to me. There's a reason why it's a bit further from me than the closest speaker.\n\nI've resisted selling these and moving to a more flexible speaker system, but thought I should ask this one final question before making that decision. if I do not truly have control over my very expensive high-tech Alexa enabled speakers, they are gone. I have never truly enjoyed them in my current space as I've never had true stereo.\n\nThanks in advance.",

  "I bought an echo studio back in October 2020 and it has been an amazing purchase for the years I have had it. Recently however, I noticed a burning smell emanating from the base of the device, specifically within the crevice where sound is amplified. The smell was of burning rubber seemingly due to the overheating of whatever components are beneath it. \n\nGenerally, I have the device on at night for ambient noise (subscribed to ambient sounds). I have never had an issue up to today and am not sure how to go about resolving it. Unfortunately, my warranty expired in October 2022 and tech support was strict on keeping this policy. They were kind enough to offer a trade-in, with about a 15% discount. However, I feel this issue was not my fault as I have been running the device the same way for two years. Additionally, I feel this is a defect of the manufacturer's product, which not only may render the device useless, but also poses a critical safety hazard, with burning rubber leading to carcinogenic symptoms.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue with any of their echo studio/other devices?",

  "I'm new to owning an Echo Studio but I was running into an issue where when I was playing Amazon Music Unlimited through the device, UHD and HD songs would be significantly louder than 3D/Spatial songs. I tried looking up solutions (restarting, unplugging for 30 seconds, etc.) and none of them worked. Finally, I unplugged the aux cord I had plugged in (to play audiobooks from my cell through the Studio), and that worked.

  "Hello everybody.\n\nNew to the Alexa game so bare with me please.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have just set up my Alexa echo dot and registered it to my account, However after a bit of messing about, my daughter downloaded the alexa app onto her phone and managed to de-register the device from my name and put it into her name so the device is now registered to her and not me. I have since switched it back but is it possible that this could be stopped? This is concerning as a guest could completely de-register my device without me being able to do a thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso as this device will be registered to me, there is the question of Alexa profiles.

So i have a few questions regarding this\u2026.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently as the device is setup in my name, my notifications are coming through to the device, however if somebody else says \u201calexa, whats my notifications\u201d? It will read my notifications that are coming through, which is not good. So here are my questions\u2026. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they all have a separate voice accounts\u2026.will Alexa play there notifications and not mine? Or will it always play mine as i am the registered keeper? Or will Alexa display all notifications with the yellow circle, but just respond to each ones notifications as the right person speaks to the device?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf i ask Alexa to play music, it will play from my accounts (spotify, apple ect).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf somebody else asks to play music, will it play from there accounts or mine?

I have a few routines centered around starting this music and setting the volumes which work almost perfectly for our intentions.\n\nHere's where I need some help:\n\nIn the room shared by our 4 and 5yo boys, they have discovered that Alexa will start up an audio-only, INTERACTIVE version of Blue's Clues, in which my kids are able to actively respond.

Much later than we'd rather them be awake. \n\nHere's the real kicker about it; I can't get Blue's Clues to turn off. Since it's like the show, or like a game, the Dot (or is it Alexa during this time) thinks when I say \"Alexa, stop\" or ,\"Alexa stop Blue's Clues\", that I'm responding to Blue's Clues and giving an actual command to stop. I have to unplug it to get it to stop. \n\nDoes any here have any similar experiences to this and also offer any suggestions on how I can create a routine to turn it off at a particular time?\n\nFurthermore, is there a setting or routine where I can disable and also override the mic mute button over a particular time period?",

I got a Show 15 right away, assuming that it actually WAS a sort of reskinned FireTV and was disappointed to find out how limited it was in that regard. Was DELIGHTED when they announced the update and have been checking frequently ever since. Last week as it started to roll out, I started an obsessive compulsive update check regime, then realized that not only wasn't I getting it, I wasn't even on the same OS version as normies.\n\n\nEveryone I've sen getting the update online either had 7.5.5.5 - or didn't know and just discovered they were now on (confusingly!) 7.5.0.1 (is it normal for Amazon OS versions to regress numerically?) and magically had FireTV.\n\n\nI just got off Amazon help chat with \"Taeed\" who was actually zillions of times more on the ball than \"Matt\" who escalated for me, but also in a surprisingly nimble, helpful way. I lucked out. Here's what Taeed told me:\n\nIt's rolling out in waves, obviously.\nHe doesn't know the specific criteria, but he says it doesn't appear to be solely regional or geographical.\nThere are minor hardware variants between Show 15s, possibly just manufacturing batches with zero differences.\nThere are a couple of current OS versions, and it's possible that incremental updates got paused for this rollout - that would explain the inability to go from 7.5.5.4 to 7.5.5.5\nHe has been told that everyone with a properly working device in a region it's available should get it (hopefully) any time from now to no more than two weeks from now.\n\n\nHe caveats that he's simply telling me what he's been told, but that 7.5.5.4 people are not alone, and are probably more intelligent and attractive than 7.5.5.5 jerks. I may be editorializing a bit there.\n\nAlso, since I'm here handing out useless advice, here's some useful advice maybe....\n\nIf you don't want to spend absurd amounts on the official Amazon Show 15 table stand, just buy a tabletop picture stand. I got a pack of three for like ten bucks from Amazon and when in use, the stand itself is almost completely invisible and adjustable enough to sit at any angle from vertical back.\n\nI got my show 15 to connect with two Echo Studios and an Echo Subwoofer by first pairing them as a speaker group, then making a new DEVICES group featuring just them, then making them the default speakers using \"let Alexa choose\" option from the  iOS app (vs selecting speakers manually) -- I'm curious to know if that setup will support Atmos as it does via Fire TV 4k Max stick (and that setup now also handles eArc meaning I can use it as default Atmos for consoles etc via my receiver).",

  "Hello guys, currently I have a fire tv 4k max, two echo dots (one is 5th gen and the other is 4th or 3rd gen, I dont remember but I can check if it is needed) and a Echo sub, everything is linked as Home thatre. After a couple hours of setting everything up (I had some problems with the sub), everything worked fine or it seemed it worked fine, however today I started feeling a difference in volume between the two echos, is that possible? Could the reason be the difference of generations? Can i increase only one echo\u2019s volume?\nWith my apple watch i checked the decibels sensed in front of the echos, and it seems that one echo is 1/2 dbs louder, however this could be caused by different factors.",
  "So I'll tell my echo Show 8 to show one of my cams. That works fine, but if I ask it to do anything else while it's playing the camera feed then it immediately closes the feed.

  "This week, I noticed that the Apple Music skill no longer handles my own playlists correctly. The first song plays then playback stops.

  "I have a friend who was recently diagnosed with cancer and has started chemotherapy. I'd like Alexa to remind me to text a kind word to my friend every day, but I don't really want to send these \"every day at 11 AM\" so that they lose all sense of spontaneity, Is it possible for Alexa to set a daily reminder, but provide it to me at a random time each day?   \n\n\nIf not, I am assuming the next best option is just to ask her to set a new reminder for tomorrow when I clear the one from today?  \n\n\nThanks!",

  "I think I've asked about this before without a solution, but Im going to try again, using a different device this time. I have a litter of puppies and I'd like to pay background music in the bedroom they're in while I am not there. I have both an echo show 5 and an insignia Fire TV in the room. I've asked the Show to play Spa or Ultimate Classical and it will start, and when I go back in the room later, it's off. I. Not sure how long it stays on but definitely less than an hour,.  I've tried playing longer music videos on YouTube and those don't seem to stay on the whole time either, although tbh I have not done as much experimentation with YouTube because it's more work to find those long  videos. I suspect the Show is doing some kind of movement sensing, do Fire TV's so this too? It will stream Hallmark movies all day long from our YouTube TV account so that doesn't seem to require a person in the room. Any suggestions are welcome.  The puppies sleep a lot so I wouldn't trust they'd move enough to trigger a sensor, not to mention the risk to the device if it was in with them.",
  "This morning I woke up and saw both of my Echo 15 devices had updated and now have fire TV on them. This is a nice feature. However, since the update, the home screen, no longer displays anything but the widgets and the generic blue gradient screen. None of my photos or content I have selected auto rotate anymore. When I go into the home content setting, I do have rotate continuously selected, but I can no longer select content or advance options.

This was normal. 5 hours later I got the same notification again. Since then, every 2 minutes it's continuing to send me the same notification. I have gone into the app and deleted the notification entirely. I have unplugged the Echo and waited 30-40 minutes before plugging it back in.

I have gone into the Alexa app and completely toggled off \"Send notifications to my phone\" as well as \"Send text messages to my phone\". But nothing is working.

  "I am a tech enthusiast trying to smarten up my home. I was annoyed by switching my soundbar between its bluetooth pairing to my bedside echo show when I want music, and to the optical soundbar setting for just TV audio.\n\nSo I switched to Fire TV and bought an echo dot pair to simplify everything. This was to be used for TV audio from the Fire TV, and music when I want.\n\nHowever, it just sucks.\n\nOn Youtube TV there is a significant lip sync delay, which can't be repaired by the lip sync adjustment feature on the Fire TV.\n\nThis morning I played some music on the stereo pair and it just cut out mid song.\n\nIt seems that the system just isn't capable of streaming audio correctly from the firestick. One way or the other, something goes wrong and it is a big headache.\n\nI am returning the echo dots today and I am pretty disappointed.

Also, with the recent update, it feels like just buying alexa wasn\u2019t enough for amazon, so now they are slowly taking away all free commands. In a while you might only be able to ask for definitions. Like how recently if you\u2019re using a free membership, you can request songs, although she\u2019ll just shuffle similar songs. It\u2019s annoying because if i want to hear a song, i want to hear THAT song, not similar ones.

  "I use Alexa for my own personal home automation, with multiple computers and home automation devices hooked up with IFTTT. I set up a command classification system that looks something like this:\n\n    \"Alexa trigger terminate Dragon on Anderson\"\n    \"Alexa trigger terminate Dragon on Omaha\"\n\nAs you can see, \n\n    <preamble> <verb> <product> <*location>\n\nWhen I ask Alexa to do something, she is only processing up to the verb and ignoring the product and location. This means any command that has the verb \"**terminate\"** would go to the first terminate applet on my IFTTT account.\n\nThis was all working just fine. Actually, I originally had to do this with Google, and then when IFTTT and Google had their reset, I switched to Alexa. It's been a real nightmare keeping home automation working when these systems make draconian changes with no real debug or direct code library capabilities. SDK please.\n\nBut that being said, is anyone else having this problem or some way of fixing it? Do you think it's Alexa or IFTTT? Should I switch back to Google?\n\nThank you.",

  "I have the following setup: Echo gen4, Philips Hue hub with smart plug, my furnace is linked to the smart plug.

At midnight the heating turns off regardless the temperature.\n\nI've set the Hue plug to work between 6am and 11:59pm *as a Hue routine*. This is working as intended. However, the Alexa routine does not seem to trigger correctly. It is set to \"When Echo detects temperature above 20 degrees turn off Plug\" to run from 6:00-23:59 every day with Supress set to 5 minutes.\n\nLooking at the activity for the routine I see it trigger now and then (last time was on the 24th at 10:15am, it triggers once a day on and off, sometimes 3-4 days in a row, sometimes it doesn't trigger at all for 2-3 days. Every morning when I get up I find that the temperature is well over 20 degrees and the heating is still on.\n\nThe question is: what am I overlooking? Why isn't the routine triggering correctly?\n\nEdit for clarity: the routine that activates the smart plug runs on my Philips Hue hub; the Echo communicates with the socket correctly, I can turn it on and off through Alexa (voice and app).

  "#  Common Amazon seller mistakes include the following: \n\n1. **Incorrectly labeled products**\n\n Inaccurate or poorly worded product listings on Amazon can adversely impact your business as an Amazon seller. Incorrect product descriptions can disrupt order fulfillment and damage your reputation with customers. \n\n1. **Improper packaging** \n\n While FBA shipping allows you to bypass the responsibility of packing your products for delivery, you still need to ensure that your inventory items are\u00a0shipped to Amazon\u2019s warehouses\u00a0in good condition. \n\n1. **Not adhering to Amazon guidelines**\n\n Amazon has a list of\u00a0restrictions regarding the products\u00a0that you are allowed to sell. There are also requirements regarding inventory, including packaging and labeling. If you fail to adhere to these requirements, Amazon may cancel your listing,  \n\n1. **Not managing inventory properly** \n\n Warehouse space is a valuable resource. Inventory management includes knowing your market and what quantities to supply to Amazon to maximize your returns and minimize costs. \n\n  Amazon warehouses charge storage fees to FBA sellers, incentivizing you to sell products and ship what you know will sell promptly. The longer your inventory sits unsold in an Amazon warehouse, the more fees you incur.\n\n1. **Sending inventory to the wrong warehouse**\n\n Whether you\u2019re in charge of shipping to Amazon\u2019s fulfillment centers or you task a supplier with sending inventory items, it is critical to keep track of when and where your inventory is located to ensure that it reaches the correct fulfillment center.",

  "Hi all.  Just got off the phone with Amazon tech support for the last hour and half and I don't have much faith that my bizarre issue will be fixed so I'm asking here.  I often use Alexa reminders (I have 5 or so dots around the house and the Alexa app on my Pixel 6).  I had a non-repeating reminder set for last night about the kids back to school night and I received the text message (I have Alexa reminders send texts).  This morning I started getting the same Alexa reminder via text message from last night.  It comes from the number 58875 and it just says \"Reminder from Alexa: Back to school night\".  I've received about 100 of these same texts today at varying intervals.  Even more bizarre is that when I try to login to my Amazon account (via web, phone shopping app, alexa app) and I request a 2FA code via text, it sends the same reminder instead of the code.\n\nThings I've tried to fix it include, deleting all my Alexa reminders entirely (Alexa confirms I have none). Turning off/on Alexa text messages/notifications. Deleting the app from my phone, relogging into all amazon related applications, turning off 2FA from my Amazon account.  At this point I'm stumped.  Is there a way to reset all my dots/Alexa apps?\n\nI'd appreciate any suggestions...at this point I'm pulling my hair out with all the reminders Alexa keeps texting me.  At this point I can't even turn 2FA back on again because I can't get the code...just keep getting the back to school night reminder.\n\nThanks in advance!",

  "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently tried out the 'Show Mode' on a spare Fire HD8 tablet lying around, and was so impressed by it that I got a bunch of Echo Show devices to replace our ageing Echo Dots. However, it took me about 24 hours to get all the features up and running, which was a lot of work. I'm sharing my lessons-learnt setting up the devices below, in the hope that it might help anyone setting theirs up. (Any maybe, an Echo product manager would see this and fix them? lol).\n\n1. Do not name two devices similarly, this causes issues in the Amazon Alexa app\n2. Do not name two Amazon Photos albums the same, this breaks something in the backend and the photos won't be shown from either album...\n3. If the camera/Live-view function of the Echo Show does not work with the app, ***try reinstalling the app on your phone*** \\- I updated firmware, unplugged for a few minutes, deregistered the Echo Show, to no avail. Reinstalling the app fixed it for me instantly, and I wish I had known this at the start.\n4. The Echo Shows are much better than the Echo Show mode on the Fire tablets. The Show Mode is super buggy unfortunately (for example, the home content selections won't be respected at all. I turned of ALL except photo highlights, and am currently staring at weather forecast, stocks, Popular Questions and notification. UGH). They also don't have the ability to behave purely as a photo wall.\n5. Be VERY careful with language or location settings. Double and triple check if they are all correct. And make sure EVERY single place in your amazon account has the right country. I had Germany in an obscure setting somewhere, and it broke everything. I couldn't have access to Amazon photos, no Luna, no weather updates, nothing. When nothing works, ditch your amazon account and create a new one - trust me, it'll save you a lot of time and energy.\n6. Prime video app on Echo Show 10 does not support profiles. Unbelievable, but true. Note that the Netflix app on the same device does support profiles..\n\nAmazon should really invest a lot of time and effort into cleaning the entire user experience of Echo devices up. It currently takes up TOO much time and effort to setup correctly. That said, I'm really loving having a screen - IMO this is the way to do it, the echo dots were a bit too dumb in comparison.",
  "Calendar functionality seems to have been updated a month or so ago.\n\n**Good:**\n\n1. Visually looks better on Show 10 devices.\n2. 3rd party calendars (ICloud etc) still sync across and can be be viewed (screen devices) and heard (non-screen devices) fine.\n\n**Not-so-good:**\n\n1. Asynchronous/synchronous mode of operation messed up on Show devices, meaning:\n   1. If Follow-up mode is enabled on the device, when you ask \"What's on my calendar?\" it brings up the calendar and starts reading it out but then (most of the time) near-immediately interrupts itself listening for another command = you usually only get the first few syllables of your first calendar entry.\n   2. When \"Read my calendar\" is used as part of a routine on a Show device, again the calendar is shown on screen and starts to be read before immediately being interrupted by whatever comes next in your routine (in my case a Flash Briefing).\n2. Calendar notification announcements no longer reliably work, if at all. Seems to be getting worse (ie. was just missing some notifications, now most if not all).\n3. The setting \"Default calendar\" is ignored - all new events created using your voice go to the \"Family Calendar\" - workaround being to set the Family Calendar to the same as your personal calendar (assuming you don't need the separate Family Calendar functionality). Note this isn't related to profiles (visual or voice) as I've confirmed the Alexa device I'm speaking to correctly knows who I am.\n4. The display of certain reoccurring Reminders within the calendar - the separate Alexa Reminder function (and whether you want them there or not) - is also messed up: I have two fortnightly reminders (every other week) for a Wednesday.. yet BOTH these reminders show in the calendar EVERY Wednesday on the Show.. though it gets the announcement bit right ie. only announcing the correct one and not both.\n\nPretty basic stuff, how this gets past testing I really don't know?!?!\n\nWhere's the best place to report bugs - all I can seem to find is Amazon User forums with representatives stock answer to everything being turning it off and on again..",

  "Since I bought an Echo Auto last year I've noticed that it is even less adept at its job than the three 3rd gen Dots I have. When I bought it I was just as enamored with it as I was the Dots due to them being my first pieces of smart tech. \n\nThat has drastically changed.\n\nAlexa is not nearly as robust as she should be and it really shows with the Auto. Home devices aside, I've never experienced such an unpredictable, unreliable and annoying smart assistant. I don't even use it for voice commands anymore because it understands maybe a fourth of what a Dot can at any given time. So I've resorted to using it as a glorified Bluetooth connection since my car doesn't have it on its own.\n\nBut of course, the problems didn't stop there.\n\nWhy, Alexa, must you send me a flury of notifications saying you are connected to my phone, when music is already playing without issue?\n\nAnd when you finally stop spamming me with connection notifications, why does your connection only then start to stutter at the worst possible times?\n\nIf it weren't for the fun that is fluctuating finances, I would have switched to Google already. Their assistant has never been this bad on my phone.\n\n(Disclaimer: I'm a former Amazon employee who is not only pissed with their products but was also treated poorly as many others have been, so that may be affecting my experience)",

  "Since the year after God was born, I have been getting my notifications by saying \"Alexa, read my notifications.\" Alexa will then read whatever has turned the light yellow.

  "After the announcement that Amazon was allowing adverts, I jumped ship to google/nest. After having it for the past week, I thought it was a good time to do as asked and say what I think.\n\nFirst is the Nest mini Vs the Echo Dot.\n\nThis is the easy one. The mini, can do everything the echo can, except track your Amazon deliveries. You can still make calls (using Duo) set reminders and alarms, all the routines etc. I've only had one \"by the way\" so far from the Nest, and that was after I asked it to make an announcement, and it was to tell me that it now also sends notifications to the families phones. In terms of sound, the Echo wins, it can go louder, and has more bottom end. I would say that they stack up pretty much evenly, so it's not worth jumping ship for if you've already got one. I haven't noticed any difference in either hearing or responding to commands.\n\nI find it a bit more awkward saying \"hey/OK Google\" compared to \"Alexa\" and you can't change the wake word. I do prefer the Echo for that bit. There are more assistant voice options on the Nest.\n\nIf you mainly want it for music, Echo wins. The mini can't stack up to what the 4th gen dot can pump out sound wise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNest Hub 2, V's Echo Show\n\nThis is where Google wins big time for me. The screen does what you want it to, and pushes nothing on you compared to the Echo. It gives you a choice of artwork, a clock, or your photo's as a screensaver, and unless you tell it otherwise, that is all it will show until you interact with it. No dog facts, no recipes you'll never try, or \"things to try\" just what you set it to, and nothing else.\n\nLighting is far easier to control, tell it to turn on a smart light, and you get a menu that lets you control the colour and brightness, which goes back to screensaver after a minute of not being interacted with.\n\nMusic, the volume and sound quality are on par with the Echo, the Hub is slightly louder. When playing from Spotify (I haven't tried other services) it gives you a full screen media player, only going away if you request something else like a timer. \n\nSpeaking of which, if you set a timer, it goes full screen, so you don't need to keep asking how long is left. Amazon does slightly better with timers though in one regard, it will let you know how long is left on a timer on another device if you ask, but the Nest won't.\n\nMenus for smart home devices, reminders, and media can be swiped through, or away back to the screensaver. You can also leave on screen sticky notes for other family members.\n\nCamera, echo wins this one, only the Hub max has a camera.\n\nVideo, obviously YouTube is native to the Nest, but you can still get it on the Echo, and I can't imagine many people will be using either to watch Netflix or Disney plus so it's not really a plus or minus for either. I do prefer the Nest screen though. It's a flatter and less reflective, with a more natural balance, it also adapts far better to the ambient light.\n\nI've found that the Hub can hear me far better than the Show, I've only had it miss one command so far, and that was because I was blasting music while I was cooking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe app(s)\n\nThis one is pure preference. I find the Echo app a bit messy and a bit less user-friendly. Not a big deal for the tech-savvy among us, but I think the Google home app is probably better for the older crowd, most of what you need is on a single page. Voice training is like for like, both have been able to tell the differences between family members.",
  "I have a subscription on Amazon for a hard to get deodorant that is delivered once a month. A day before the delivery the echo devices around my home flash yellow to let me know I have a shipment soon. This has been fine for the past few years. Last year I installed a Lithe audio ceiling speaker in my bathroom and paired it to an echo dot so I could listen to music in the shower. Every time I get a notification now it turns on Spotify in the bathroom speaker and continues whatever I was listening to last. The first time this happened it really freaked me out as I came home to music blasting in my bathroom.

  "I don't go to bed at a consistent time everyday and have found the more I have added to Alexa to notify about this or that, that my sleep is getting interrupted more and more so giving a verbal command to turn on Do Not Disturb (DND) and run for 8 hours while I get some solid sleep, then automatically turn off DND was ideal, but this is not working for me, no matter how long the Duration is set for (e.g. 1 minute or 8 hours) or until a certain time (e.g. 7:00 AM) it wont turn off DND.\n\nI do have a 2nd Routine setup that I use to verbally turn off DND but that doesn't solve the above problem.\n\nAs a minor workaround I have the Routine send a notification to my IOS devices 4 hours (the max wait time) after the Routine was run, so I at least have a visual reminder that DND is still in use. This could be a full workaround if the Wait function was longer than 4 hours (wait 8 hours, add action, disable DND) or if I could train my body to only need 4 hours of sleep a night!\n\nSo if anyone has a fix I would appreciate the info or let me know the best way to report this to Amazon so it might get fixed as it's obviously an option that's broken.",

For some reason, Alexa will turn off the lights without any sort of prior warning or notification, usually after about 15 minutes. I thought this was something to do with the 'hunches' feature, but even after disabling hunches, we still have the issue. My next guess is that because Alexa isn't detecting any sound nearby (the echo hub is in the kitchen nearby), she turns off the lights as some sort of energy saving feature.   \nDoes anyone have any idea how to fix this issue?",

I know the routine is correct and everything is connected. I've deleted the routines and recreated them and it still doesn't enable DND.  \n\nWe have 8 Echos in the house and they are all doing this suddenly.  I've made sure they are updated.  The DND routines I set up just stopped working. I still hear notifications and it keeps waking me up.

This is the network we can connect our personal phones, tablets, laptops, and other BYOD devices (such as Echo Dots) to.\n\nThis network's password changes frequently (every 2-6 weeks), and there is no prior announcement.\n\nWhat this means is that the password usually changes unexpectedly, at midnight, and I don't find out about it until a day or two later, when I'm like \"Alexa, what's the weather?\" And then I see the red ring.\n\nThe SSID (WiFi network name) stays the same, but the password changes.\n\nWith my Google Home Mini, this means that I usually have to do a factory reset. With my Alexa device, I can usually change this pretty easily through the app. But I do worry that this ***may*** have something to do with it.",

  "Hello!  \nI am pretty new in developing Alexa Skills.  \nI'm creating an app, where you can check the time of your next bus on your nearest bus stop. When bus is near this bus stop, you get the reminder on your Echo and Alexa App. Everything works well on my account, on wich I created this app. The problem occured when I gave my Beta Skill to test it by someone else. When I use this app from my account everything works as it should, but when someone else tries to do it, there is an error. Permissions for this skill are already set up.  \nI was debugging my skill for hours, trying to check on witch line this error exists. It happens to be here \"reminderApiClient.createReminder(reminderRequest);\"\n\nWhat I do is:\n\n1. *const* reminderRequest = {  \ntrigger: {  \ntype: \"SCHEDULED\\_RELATIVE\",  \noffsetInSeconds: \"15\",  \n},  \nalertInfo: {  \nspokenInfo: {  \ncontent: \\[  \n{  \nlocale: \"en-GB\",  \ntext: \"The Reminder\",  \n},  \n\\],  \n},  \n},  \npushNotification: {  \nstatus: \"ENABLED\",  \n},  \n};\n2. let reminderApiClient = handlerInput.serviceClientFactory.getReminderManagementServiceClient();\n3. await reminderApiClient.createReminder(reminderRequest);\n4. *exports*.handler = Alexa.SkillBuilders.custom()  \n.addRequestHandlers(  \n...  \n)  \n.addErrorHandlers(ErrorHandler)  \n.withPersistenceAdapter(  \nnew Adapter.DynamoDbPersistenceAdapter({  \ntableName: dynamoDBTableName,  \n})  \n)  \n.withApiClient(new Alexa.DefaultApiClient())  \n.lambda();\n\nSo As I said, weird thing is that on my primary account the skill is working correctly, but on the second account (where is beta test), reminder is giving me an error.  \nAny thoughts?",
  "I'm so flustered by this \"feature\" on the EchoDot that keeps on telling me that I'm connected to a Bluetooth device. \n\nAlthough it is very useful to have a device connected to the Echo as soon as I turn it on, but every time it say \"Now connected to BlaBlaBla\"\n\nI use two laptops, and while switching between them, the Echo just goes crazy. Yes I want them to connect to the Echo as soon as I turn them on, but I don't want Echo to tell me at the top of her voice (this even happened multiple times late in the night) that \"Now connected to Laptop 305KKD4\" \n\n\nUghhh. I'm so flustered. Is there a fix to this? \n\nJust a notification sound would be good like it does when a device is disconnected frome bluetooth (Thank God it doesn't say \"Now disconnected from Laptop BlaBlaBla\").\n\nI have tried using the minimal alerts thing, that doesn't help. If there's an Amazon Tech guy here, please this is an issue.\n\nEdit: I'm using an Echodot Gen 4",

  "[**\\*Edit: the Alexa help page has now been updated to reflect the new limitations.***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=GHKNDEFH7JCKX4DB)\n\n**TL;DR -** I just confirmed with Amazon Customer Service that soon Alexa-to-phone calling will be restricted to a pre-chosen list of no more than **10 contacts per Alexa user profile**, unless you have and link an AT&T Wireless or Skype account to your Alexa Communications profile.  Making 'Alexa-to-Alexa' calls (calling between Echo devices, the Alexa app, etc.)  will still of course be unlimited but if you want to call a landline or cellular telephone number you will only be able to choose from your set list of ten chosen contacts.  \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Full Details -** Moments ago I used Alexa to make a toll-free (1-800-number) phone call from one of the Echo Dots in my home, something I do daily/multiple times a day.  As soon as I finished my call and asked Alexa to \"hangup\" I was greeted with a \"By the way...\" notification/response from Alexa which told me the number I had just called was automatically added to my list of ten Alexa-to-phone contacts and to see the Alexa app for more information, to edit my list of ten contacts, or to link an account and still be able to make unlimited Alexa-to-phone calling from my Echo devices.  Confused I opened my Alexa app and was greeted with a \"card\" on the home screen telling me the same things/to click there for more info.  I use my Amazon Alexa devices as my primary outgoing house phone and have since 2017 on my 8 Echo Dots, four Fire HD tablets, and on various computers using the \"Alexa for PC\" Windows app.  I am disabled and being able to depend on using Alexa to make phone calls in my home on my numerous Alexa devices is vital and has been a lifesaver for me - literally - as I am occasionally prone to randomly falling asleep/passing out due to my disability.\n\n*(Long tangent example from a couple of years ago:*  *A couple of years ago this happened while I was showering - I woke up and found myself lying down in my shower in standing water with blood everywhere after having apparently blacked out/slammed my head into/cut a giant gash across my forehead on the sharp corner edge of my marble bathroom vanity sink countertop.  I was completely out of it (a CT scan later confirmed a concussion) and had probably been on the floor for 15 or 20 minutes and was too disoriented to get myself up from the floor.  My cell phone was nearby outside of the shower and I was able to pull myself over to it but the battery was dead and I was too weak and dizzy and bloody to get up and find the charger.  Fortunately I had my Echo Dot in there in that bathroom and so I began trying to get a hole of someone who might be able to help me (since you can't dial \"911\" using Alexa) but no one would answer my Alexa-to-Alexa phone calls (because most people I know who have this capability never really use this feature and would probably be totally confused receiving a call from me via it anyway). Fortunately, after calling numerous contacts from my linked mobile phone address book via Alexa I was finally able to get in touch with an old roommate/good friend and they rushed over immediately and raced me to the ER. I definitely called more than 10 contacts before someone answered.)*\n\nAnyway, the Alexa app said I could link my AT&T or Skype accounts if I wanted to still be able to make unlimited Alexa-to-phone phone calls.  Well that's fine and great, but I use Verizon Wireless as my cellular phone service provider and don't have an AT&T wireless mobile phone or account.  I continued reading through the details and \"More Information\" help sections provided in the Alexa App (text content and screenshots provided below) and then called Amazon Customer Support to see if this terrible news was really true.  While on hold I looked online to see if Amazon had made any press releases about these changes or if any news outlets/tech blogs had written anything about the new restrictive changes to making calls with Alexa but found nothing.  The Amazon representative I spoke with also knew nothing of these changes, nor did the developer/engineering team contact he reached out to as I waited on hold with him on the phone.  He looked through various internal channels/systems and couldn't find any information about these changes either and so I offered to send him screenshots of what I was seeing in my Alexa App and he thanked me and asked if I would please send them.  I sent them while on the phone and he shared them with the engineering team contact he had been talking with about this while I waited.  A while later he did confirm that he had found some information about these changes (basically just the same details that are given in the new help section about this in the Alexa App) and said he would try to find out more information and if he does learn any additional details he'll share them with me via phone or email in the next day or so. He said while it's not uncommon for Amazon to be absolutely terrible about sharing information about big changes/new features/various updates with their team members before going public with the info he did think it was odd that there was next to nothing announced about this and that I had already learned about these coming changes from the Alexa app and said that might have possibly been by accident and apologized.\n\nI hate this and wanted to share this with other Amazon Echo device/Alexa users.  I mean, I understand that it was a free service and that Amazon is not making any money (aside from revenue from the initial device purchase) by allowing people to place unlimited, free phone calls from their Alexa devices, but it's super frustrating for a core feature like this to be restricted without any advanced warning or announcement, especially at a time when most communication/telecommunication platforms and companies are adding *more* capabilities and features/free extra data/etc. to be helpful while we're all feeling and dealing with the challenges of living through a global pandemic.  Super upsetting Amazon would suddenly add restrictions.  I am fine with being required to link my cellular phone service provider account to my Alexa Communications profile/account if that's necessary to keep being able to effortlessly make outgoing phone calls using my Alexa/Echo devices, but if that's the case than other service providers that just AT&T need to be added.  Maybe AT&T is the entity here who pushed for these new restrictions, who knows...  ughhhh.  \ud83e\udd2c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Text/Details and** [**Screenshots of Details from the Alexa App**](https://i.imgur.com/4I11wev.jpeg)**:**\n\nAlexa-to-Phone Contacts\n\nThese are the phone numbers you can make unlimited mobile and landline calls to.

  "hi, any ideas on how to have Alexa find my phone outside US where AT&T and call operators are not available?

Maybe someone has a genius idea, hm? Thanks!\n\nEDIT: I solved this by making a Home Assistant script that sends repeated notifications to the phone with sound.

  "Hi everyone,\n\nI have two Amazon Echo Show (5 and 8, respectively) and I have purchased the Alexa Guard Plus option.

Similarly, if I test my smoke detector close to the Echo, I don't get any notification but if I open the Alexa app, it shows that the sound of a smoke detector was recognized, meaning that the feature was correctly working in the background.\n\nI have the latest firmwares on my Echo devices and the latest app on my iPhone (updated to the latest iOS version available for iPhone 11 Pro Max).

I don't remember exactly what the questions were, but I feel like they were more personal/moral based.

Being that it was 6 AM in the morning and I did not have enough caffeine in my system to handle Alexa being a psychic, I said I no longer wanted to take the survey.

  "One day my Alexa app on android device started \"losing\" the notifications few seconds after they appeared. I noticed that this behavior started shortly after I created a reminder to cancel my Amazon Music Unlimited. For the next month or two I kept missing most of my reminders because I missed Alexa announcing it and my mobile app didn't manage to keep the notification long enough for me to notice. I made sure the Alexa app has all the privileges and is not battery optimized, but nothing helped.  \n\n\nJust few days ago, just as I suspected I missed the reminder to cancel my Amazon Music Unlimited subscription. Lucky for me my Google Calendar reminded me to do so. Now that I have cancelled my music subscription and the reminder to do so is gone, suddenly (very next day) my Alexa app started to persist the notifications on mobile again. I haven't touched any settings and app has not updated itself.  \n\n\nIs this just a coincidence or does it smell bit fishy?",

It would be great if I could answer incoming cell calls hands-free, but I'd settle for a notification of some sort to interrupt my music and let me know the phone is ringing in the other room. \nAnyone know of a skill for  that?\n(Android w/verizon, fwiw)",
  "I have an interesting issue with Reminders (my favorite feature of the Echo).  Every reminder I make has a description.  Most of the time Alexa will read out the reminder at the designated time like \"Take Allergy Meds\" everyday at 7am.  But sometimes, she just makes a chime noise.  Yesterday she read the announcement, but today it was just a chime.  There is no pattern to this issue.  I have to look at my phone notification to see what the reminder was for.   Anyone else run into this issue?",
  "I have had same phone and same echo dot for some time now. I have a reminder that occurs every day at the same time.

We can see from notification log that there indeed was a notification. Usually by the time we get to our phones the notification is gone.  \n\n\nWe both have Samsung flagship devices running different android versions.

  "So, I'm sure you're all familiar with the pulldown notification panel in Android. Anytime I am playing music on Spotify, or through the Alexa app (a radio station's custom skill, specifically) a large notification badge appears in the pulldown (EDIT: Should have been clearer, I mean the \"Media Control Panel\"). I don't have a problem with that at all, it's useful most of the time. \n\nHowever, Alexa has been continually re-displaying one specific version of this notification that simply will NOT stop appearing randomly. Doesn't matter *if* or *how* I dismiss the notification. I can force close the Alexa app entirely. I can go into the advanced notification settings and Disable Alexa notifications (which makes it disappear) - but it will randomly re-appear if I re-enable Alexa notifications. And obviously, I want to avoid simply turning ALL notifications off from the App.\n\nThe thing that's so frustrating is that *I am not even listening to the radio station.* It is not playing on my phone, or any other Echo device. Unless it is somehow running in the background without my realizing it? There was a routine to auto-start the radio in the morning at a specific time, but I disabled that routine too. The specific radio station has its own Alexa Skill, making it a bit more convenient to launch the station. I disabled that Skill as well!\n\nHave power cycled the phone many times, cleared cache, etc. etc. etc.\n\nBut seemingly the only way to stop this \"Playing on your phone\" badge from appearing is either nuking ALL Alexa notifications, or removing the Alexa app from my phone entirely, I suppose. It's infuriating.\n\nAnyone have any ideas of why this is happening or how to resolve it?",
  "This happened on my flex this morning.  It flashed yellow and beeped like it had a delivery notification, but then when I asked Alexa for my notifications, the light came on for a minute like she was listening, and then shut off without responding.

Also, I checked my phone and didn't see any notifications.\n\nOn a related note, Alexa seemed to have trouble with my wake-up call yesterday.

  "So I\u2019ve been using Echo devices in our home since being selected for the original beta launch. Generally up until the past couple months I\u2019ve always been rather happy with the devices and the experience, except for a couple issues related to involuntary third party apps being enabled and creating bad experiences. We currently have an Echo Plus, 2 3rd Gen Echos, a 2nd Gen Echo Show 10, 2 Echo Show 8s, 2 original Echo Shows, and a couple 3rd Gen Echo Spots.\n\nRecently, things have started to get unsavory and, in one instance, really stunned me - I\u2019ll save that for last.\n\nOver the past couple months, I\u2019ve noticed  all of our more recently purchased devices have suddenly started reacting very erratic with voice commands. It\u2019s not one or two devices in particular, but almost all of them. Saying \u2018Alexa\u2019 even when standing next to the Show 10 will oftentimes trigger responses to a device across the house as if the spacial detection is off, but it makes no sense as the device reacting couldn\u2019t have possibly heard you. Additionally, we\u2019ve had a lot of false activations and pulling up the history usually presents \u201cAudio was not intended for this device\u201d or \u201caudio could not be understood\u201d, but the recordings have absolutely nothing to do with Alexa, nor is anything remotely close to it present, and sometimes there simply isn\u2019t anything listed for review. In the past the false triggers were uncommon, but when they occurred, they were consistently presented in the app to review and generally made sense. I even had a situation this week where the device in my kitchen kept activating and I was repeatedly yelling \u201ccancel\u201d and the damn thing kept going. I ended up muting the mic for a day as it was so frustrating.\n\nNow the worst instance, however, which has really weirded me out. I have a NAS on the network that has been problem-free for about 5 years. I recently decided to not only rely on iCloud to backup all of my pictures, but also use an app to sync all of my photos to the NAS over a WebDAV connection. Everything went well and my photos synced pretty seamlessly. Then, a day later, I get a notification that the connection dropped. I checked the connection and everything seemed AOK. I ended up power cycling the NAS to determine if it was a software issue on its end and I immediately find that the IP isn\u2019t resolving to it. I check my network and another device has grabbed the IP. Weirder, however, the device is using my NAS\u2019 host name, but it\u2019s being recognized as an Amazon device, so I know it\u2019s an Echo. After I check the MAC address, I identified it as one of my Echo Show 8s. Well, I power cycled the device and everything seemed to go back to normal. A couple hours later I notice that the NAS is having connectivity problems again and some services I\u2019m running on it are performing unreliably. I immediately check the network again and the Show is once again spoofing the host name and competing for the IP. This was even with the NAS having a reserved assignment. Well, I unplugged the device and all was well again. When I reconnected it, it was once again using the hostname of my NAS, so I\u2019ve since left it unplugged and have been trying to find time to reach out to Amazon about replacement. The whole situation has soured me, though. Obviously if the situation was nefarious, a lot more users would be catching this sort of activity, but I\u2019m still not happy to see something like this arise, especially after so many years of things being fine, then suddenly things aren\u2019t.\n\nWell, I just wanted to share this experience because I wanted to see if I\u2019m just super-unlucky or if anyone else has been having a similar experience recently. Edit: well I guess I\u2019m just going to get \u2018constructive\u2019 down-votes thanks love ya guys.",

I also have a Schlage encode deadbolt that has a forced entry and lock picking alarm, so it seems the inside of my house (I live in a single-wide with an open floor plan) would basically be covered if the 3rd Gen Echo Show 10 can actively monitor a 360 area and focus on any movement that isn't an animal.\n\nAnyone know if you can remotely access your home cameras and doorbell without being on your home wifi?

  "Hey Team,\n\nI have recently started to experience an odd change in behavior concerning my reminders. I use my Alexa system for quite a few reminders and in the past, the reminder would be announced from the device that it was created on, addressed to the person who asked for it (voice profiles are pretty accurate in my experience). This is all fine and dandy, and it's been like that for year(s). Then all of a sudden recently, last week or so, my echo devices stopped announcing the reminders like usual as far as I can tell, and instead do the \"notification arrived\"  \\*bla-doop noise and flashing green light. I ask what my notifications are and she says you have such and such reminders. The only time I used to get green light notifications was for amazon shopping delivery and Ring device low battery notifications. I did some digging through settings and I noticed a setting that \"If Alex notices you are away she will make it a notification for you to check earlier\" type of setting. It was on, so I'm assuming it's always been on and may be the source of the problem. But I also do like the thought of having that if it works, obviously if we are not home to hear the reminder it would be nice to have the notification pending to make sure we see it. Color coding the echo notification color/light would be really handy as well. So I could differentiate quickly between reminders, ring notifications, and amazon shopping updates. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I am sure I will just end up having to turn off the \"Alexa will know when you are not home\" option because it's not accurately picking up when I am home or not, even though guard is in home mode, Ring alarm is disarmed or in stay/home mode. Not sure what else may have changed to prompt this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny insight would be appreciated!",

That works well.\n\n  \nMinor issue with two possible solutions (I can't make either happen):\n\nAlexa says all the notifications twice.  I don't need them twice.  Once is plenty.  I can't interrupt her, and I can't find a setting to change it to only saying once.  My only solution is to decrease the volume to zero from the app and then turn it back up.  (If I'm in the middle of a conversation I don't want her to interrupt.)  Any ideas?",
  "...at least this seems to be the problem in my case.\n\nI went nuts trying to figure out why my gen3 and 4 Echo Dots were crashing and stopping to respond to commands, no matter what I tried. At the same time, the Dot Gen2 is playing music 10-12hrs a day, NO problem.\n\nAfter a lot of fiddling with settings, I decided to disable Diversion that is running on my Asus router (with Asus-Merlin) and see what happens...the idea was that Amazon added so much crap and ads in the last couple of years, that it might interfere with the attempt to actually BLOCK these intruding requests.\n\nLo and behold, albeit still in early testing, it DOES seem that bypassing Diversion (or any hosts list based ad filter) I can get the gen 3 and 4 to run stable for a whole day.\n\nThe price to pay? Now when I ask for weather I get the dreaded \"By the way\"... which feeds me crappy ads despite the notifications for \"suggestion and products\" being disabled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI ended up using the by-pass settings outlined here, for ALL 3 Dots:\n\n[Diversion client exclusion](https://diversion.ch/faq-reader/how-to-exclude-a-client-from-ad-blocking.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully this will help someone preserve their mental sanity. :)\n\nI squarely blame Amazon for the shitty coding that cannot deal with hosts being unreachable - or maybe this is done by design, to force people to swallow ads.",

  "OKay, brief backstory,  I broke my ankle in November very badly and was in the hospital for a month doing acute physical therapy.  While there, my roommate told me she was going out of town for a month so I would be home alone in the house when I got discharged.  I then thought it would be nice to be able to turn the lights off and on by voice so I ordered a gen 4 echo dot with clock.\n\nI set it up when I got home two weeks ago and got a smart bulb for my lamp.  Okay, works well.  Then I saw the echo flex on sale for $10 and ordered a couple thinking both I'd like to control the lights in other rooms and in case I fell, it would be a way to call for help if I don't have my phone.  I currently have a flex in my bathroom and living room.\n\nSo I have some questions and please forgive me, I know I should figure this stuff out myself but I'm still on good pain killers which makes me a bit foggy.\n\n1.  My echo dot seems to have issues about once a day.  Usually in the morningish time.  Alexa will either say it can't connect to the internet and I should reboot my router or it is having trouble understanding.  At first I rebooted the router every time and that worked.  Once I had the flexes I noted the dot would say it couldn't connect to the internet but the flex in the bathroom was online with no problem.  So I started unplugging the power cord on the dot and plugging it back in which fixes it every time.  I'm just wondering what could be causing this and if something is set up wrong or it is some hardware issues.  I do have a router that has both a 5ghz network and a 2.4ghz network set up.  Alexa and all the smart bulbs I have gotten are set up to connect to the former.  But could the existence of the latter be messing something?  I am not sure where my router documentation is but I was going to try and just take down the 5ghz network this weekend.\n2. My roommate is coming back next week.  I ordered an echo dot for her.  I figure I'm being both helpful and self serving since I'm sure she could get good use from it but I like the idea of being able to use it as in intercom.  I understand there are security concerns about the drop in feature and I'm going to discuss this with her in depth so we are clear on how it works and what is and isn't okay.  I know she would be able to disable the mic and I think she could turn off drop in the app if she felt like being alone,  Does drop in only work in one room?\n3. The second dot I ordered for roomie is being delivered today.  I noticed it shows up in my alexa app already.  Now if we set it up in her room like that she would have access to all my linked linked apps/accounts and get my notifications, right?  I think there is a Household feature that would work here?  I just want her dot to be on her own amazon account but she can still control all the lights I set up in the common areas of the house.  I ordered smart light switches which our landlord is installing so there will be a bunch.  I think I need to deauthorize the echo and then she can set it up.  Do I need to set up the household thing first?\n4. I really wanted to use the dot as an alarm clock which isn't going so well.  The alarm is so quiet.  I tried pushing the plus button on the dot to increase it and that didn't help.  Then I tried raising the alarm sound setting in the app as high as it would go.  Again no change.  So what do I do to get an alarm that would actually wake me up?  Is this a sign of a hardware issue or just something set wrong.  Also, assuming I ever fix this problem can my echo dot play it loudly while the echoes in the house not?  I don't want to wake up my roommate.\n5.  I noticed the flexes would only let me choose between about 4 or 5 names to call alexa. Alexa, echo, computer or something else.  Is there a work around for this?  I think it would get confusing trying to keep them straight.\n\nSOrry, this is so long.  Thanks in advance.",

Use your account's credentials that were sent to you\\* (Chrome browser is preferred).  \n3. Add all your important items for full tracking and control. Simply tell Alexa to do so by using the following phrase:  \n**\"Alexa, put 4 yogurts in my kitchen\".**  \nKeep this voice structure for other items:  \n\"Alexa, put {Item\\_count} {Item\\_name} in my kitchen\"  \n\\*Or you can use the new +receipt button for loading new items faster by scanning your receipt from the app. \n4. Reduce items through simple voice-commands. Once you have loaded your items - all you have to do is reduce items when you throw them in the trash using the following phrase:  \n**\"Alexa, remove 2 bananas from my kitchen\".**  \nAfter 2-3 times, you will become skilled. \n5. Be notified when items are running out or about to expire, and stop wasting food.

  "Hello,\n\nI was looking for a programmable alarm clock for my kids bedroom (power user here). I was hoping to find something that allowed me to:\n\n* Program multiple reminders through the day (example: time to get dressed, time for breakfast, time to get ready for bed, time to turn off the lights, and so on...), ideally with different tunes and/or different pictures/lights.\n* Has some concept of schedule/calendar, so for example, I can program different times for the weekend.\n* Has a display that is not too bright / would not keep them awake if in their bedroom.  \n\n* Ideally, the programming is not via voice commands, but some app / api / website over wifi, so I can adjust the times/tunes/pictures from the comfort of my bed.\n* Ideally, voice commands can be disabled (don't want kids poking it with random questions, or using it as a toy).\n* No ads of course, some level of control of what they can do with it, ideally can customize pictures and similar to their liking.  \n\n\nWould the echo fit the bill here?

  " In the era when people wish even their toddlers to be smarter than their neighbors, technology is aiming to fulfill every wish of the parents. And I think Snorble is one such device, aimed to make your kids smarter by teaching them a few things with time. \n\nSo Snorble is a kind of smart device that is meant for preschool kids and this is a kind of robot that comes with some powerful features. Powered by the MediaTek Genio 350 processor, this smart device has features divided according to the time of the day and if you switch to daytime mode, it would serve functions such as helping your kids perform countings and identifying colors.\n\nBesides, this smart device can initiate well-being practices such as yoga and meditation, and can also hold dance parties, play air guitar, create a fish face and also tell stories on demands by your kids.\n\nWhen you switch to night mode, your kid could get access to night lights. Soundscapes, can inform about breathing exercises and also tell bedtime stories. When in bedtime mode, it can offer reminders about wearing pajamas, brushing the teeth, taking a bath, saying prayers, etc.\n\nAnd when it\u2019s time to wake up, it would gently play an alarm and ask your kid to wake up. \n\nWell, this sounds so interesting that even though I do not have a kid, I wish to buy it and use it myself. Why did they not have such things when I was a kid? Anyways, parents must be worried about their kids using Snorble a bit too much and this is why it comes with a smartphone app that can help you control the usage of the device by your kids. \n\nOf course, kids will get fascinated by it and they might stay awake at night, trying to use it more. But as a parent, you can definitely control the activities. Do you think this will work for your kid?",

  "Hi all.  Just got off the phone with Amazon tech support for the last hour and half and I don't have much faith that my bizarre issue will be fixed so I'm asking here.  I often use Alexa reminders (I have 5 or so dots around the house and the Alexa app on my Pixel 6).  I had a non-repeating reminder set for last night about the kids back to school night and I received the text message (I have Alexa reminders send texts).  This morning I started getting the same Alexa reminder via text message from last night.  It comes from the number 58875 and it just says \"Reminder from Alexa: Back to school night\".  I've received about 100 of these same texts today at varying intervals.  Even more bizarre is that when I try to login to my Amazon account (via web, phone shopping app, alexa app) and I request a 2FA code via text, it sends the same reminder instead of the code.\n\nThings I've tried to fix it include, deleting all my Alexa reminders entirely (Alexa confirms I have none). Turning off/on Alexa text messages/notifications. Deleting the app from my phone, relogging into all amazon related applications, turning off 2FA from my Amazon account.  At this point I'm stumped.  Is there a way to reset all my dots/Alexa apps?\n\nI'd appreciate any suggestions...at this point I'm pulling my hair out with all the reminders Alexa keeps texting me.  At this point I can't even turn 2FA back on again because I can't get the code...just keep getting the back to school night reminder.\n\nThanks in advance!",

  "Calendar functionality seems to have been updated a month or so ago.\n\n**Good:**\n\n1. Visually looks better on Show 10 devices.\n2. 3rd party calendars (ICloud etc) still sync across and can be be viewed (screen devices) and heard (non-screen devices) fine.\n\n**Not-so-good:**\n\n1. Asynchronous/synchronous mode of operation messed up on Show devices, meaning:\n   1. If Follow-up mode is enabled on the device, when you ask \"What's on my calendar?\" it brings up the calendar and starts reading it out but then (most of the time) near-immediately interrupts itself listening for another command = you usually only get the first few syllables of your first calendar entry.\n   2. When \"Read my calendar\" is used as part of a routine on a Show device, again the calendar is shown on screen and starts to be read before immediately being interrupted by whatever comes next in your routine (in my case a Flash Briefing).\n2. Calendar notification announcements no longer reliably work, if at all. Seems to be getting worse (ie. was just missing some notifications, now most if not all).\n3. The setting \"Default calendar\" is ignored - all new events created using your voice go to the \"Family Calendar\" - workaround being to set the Family Calendar to the same as your personal calendar (assuming you don't need the separate Family Calendar functionality). Note this isn't related to profiles (visual or voice) as I've confirmed the Alexa device I'm speaking to correctly knows who I am.\n4. The display of certain reoccurring Reminders within the calendar - the separate Alexa Reminder function (and whether you want them there or not) - is also messed up: I have two fortnightly reminders (every other week) for a Wednesday.. yet BOTH these reminders show in the calendar EVERY Wednesday on the Show.. though it gets the announcement bit right ie. only announcing the correct one and not both.\n\nPretty basic stuff, how this gets past testing I really don't know?!?!\n\nWhere's the best place to report bugs - all I can seem to find is Amazon User forums with representatives stock answer to everything being turning it off and on again..",

  "After the announcement that Amazon was allowing adverts, I jumped ship to google/nest. After having it for the past week, I thought it was a good time to do as asked and say what I think.\n\nFirst is the Nest mini Vs the Echo Dot.\n\nThis is the easy one. The mini, can do everything the echo can, except track your Amazon deliveries. You can still make calls (using Duo) set reminders and alarms, all the routines etc. I've only had one \"by the way\" so far from the Nest, and that was after I asked it to make an announcement, and it was to tell me that it now also sends notifications to the families phones. In terms of sound, the Echo wins, it can go louder, and has more bottom end. I would say that they stack up pretty much evenly, so it's not worth jumping ship for if you've already got one. I haven't noticed any difference in either hearing or responding to commands.\n\nI find it a bit more awkward saying \"hey/OK Google\" compared to \"Alexa\" and you can't change the wake word. I do prefer the Echo for that bit. There are more assistant voice options on the Nest.\n\nIf you mainly want it for music, Echo wins. The mini can't stack up to what the 4th gen dot can pump out sound wise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNest Hub 2, V's Echo Show\n\nThis is where Google wins big time for me. The screen does what you want it to, and pushes nothing on you compared to the Echo. It gives you a choice of artwork, a clock, or your photo's as a screensaver, and unless you tell it otherwise, that is all it will show until you interact with it. No dog facts, no recipes you'll never try, or \"things to try\" just what you set it to, and nothing else.\n\nLighting is far easier to control, tell it to turn on a smart light, and you get a menu that lets you control the colour and brightness, which goes back to screensaver after a minute of not being interacted with.\n\nMusic, the volume and sound quality are on par with the Echo, the Hub is slightly louder. When playing from Spotify (I haven't tried other services) it gives you a full screen media player, only going away if you request something else like a timer. \n\nSpeaking of which, if you set a timer, it goes full screen, so you don't need to keep asking how long is left. Amazon does slightly better with timers though in one regard, it will let you know how long is left on a timer on another device if you ask, but the Nest won't.\n\nMenus for smart home devices, reminders, and media can be swiped through, or away back to the screensaver. You can also leave on screen sticky notes for other family members.\n\nCamera, echo wins this one, only the Hub max has a camera.\n\nVideo, obviously YouTube is native to the Nest, but you can still get it on the Echo, and I can't imagine many people will be using either to watch Netflix or Disney plus so it's not really a plus or minus for either. I do prefer the Nest screen though. It's a flatter and less reflective, with a more natural balance, it also adapts far better to the ambient light.\n\nI've found that the Hub can hear me far better than the Show, I've only had it miss one command so far, and that was because I was blasting music while I was cooking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe app(s)\n\nThis one is pure preference. I find the Echo app a bit messy and a bit less user-friendly. Not a big deal for the tech-savvy among us, but I think the Google home app is probably better for the older crowd, most of what you need is on a single page. Voice training is like for like, both have been able to tell the differences between family members.",
  "Hey, I hope I'm asking on the right sub. \n\nI'm a newcomer when it comes to alexa.

  "I don't go to bed at a consistent time everyday and have found the more I have added to Alexa to notify about this or that, that my sleep is getting interrupted more and more so giving a verbal command to turn on Do Not Disturb (DND) and run for 8 hours while I get some solid sleep, then automatically turn off DND was ideal, but this is not working for me, no matter how long the Duration is set for (e.g. 1 minute or 8 hours) or until a certain time (e.g. 7:00 AM) it wont turn off DND.\n\nI do have a 2nd Routine setup that I use to verbally turn off DND but that doesn't solve the above problem.\n\nAs a minor workaround I have the Routine send a notification to my IOS devices 4 hours (the max wait time) after the Routine was run, so I at least have a visual reminder that DND is still in use. This could be a full workaround if the Wait function was longer than 4 hours (wait 8 hours, add action, disable DND) or if I could train my body to only need 4 hours of sleep a night!\n\nSo if anyone has a fix I would appreciate the info or let me know the best way to report this to Amazon so it might get fixed as it's obviously an option that's broken.",
  "I listen to Pandora both in my Subaru and thru Alexa and never really had an issue until last week.

  "Is there a way to make a reminder repeat every so often until I actually dismiss it? I have ADHD and I set a reminder to take my med. Which is great...if I do it (see: ADHD).

  "I\u2019m currently on the fence about buying them as I am really new to this sort of stuff and barely make use of Siri on my phone. \n\nMy main uses for an echo would be to:\n- play custom playlists from Apple Music with voice command \n- play YouTube videos through my echo \n(so far all I\u2019m seeing is that you have to do that through Bluetooth which is annoying as I\u2019m invested into YouTube/YouTube music etc)\n- play local audio files (still don\u2019t know ho you would do this without using it as a Bluetooth speaker)\n- use as an alarm \n- use for reminders \n- use for general questions etc\n- my parents would also use for pretty much the same thing \n\nHowever my problem is that in the house we only use a mobile hotspot (no WiFi router) which means that internet is forever coming and going (I.e someone moves the wifi hotspot phone or that phone runs out of charge etc )\n\nWould that be a major factor in affecting my echo or would it still function well with fluctuating WiFi and be able to re connect automatically and fast once WiFi hotspot is back in range? \n\nThanks any help is appreciated \ud83e\udd0d",

  " This problem only seems to happen with one-off alarm reminders, daily ones seem fine.\n\n Anyway, I'm having constant issues where if I set a one off alarm, it won't actually sound. I can check the Show screen after the supposed alarm time and it will either show the amount of time lapsed since the alarm supposedly went off, or show that it was snoozed (it wasn't) yet is still silent. \n\n Then I have a problem where if the alarm does happen to sound, it won't respond to the stop command. The alarm quietens while you say Alexa and give the stop command, but then the alarm just carries on. I actually have to go to another room and tell the show in that room to stop the bedroom alarm. Very odd. \n\n Anybody else having such problems and know a solution. The \"unplug, plug back in\" doesn't work!",

  "I had an Echo Dot 3rd Gen for about a year before it started giving me issues. It started orange-swirling, and I had to factory reset it at least once a week (which meant redoing all of my custom settings and reminders).

However, here we are 4 months later and the orange swirls have started again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy internet is fine, the Echo is close to the router, no other devices in the home are having issues connecting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI contacted Amazon support about it and they gave me a $40 credit to purchase a new one at no cost. However, I really don't want to deal with this for a third time. I'm considering trying out the 4th Gen Dot but I can't find any research supporting arguments that the upgrade is worth it. For those of you that might have seen similar scenarios, have you noticed a difference with the 4th Gen? Am I better off sticking with the free replacement for my Gen 3, paying an extra $10 for the Gen 4, or just buying a different voice assistant?

  "I'm so glad I found this group. I'm starting to feel somewhat inadequate. \n\nFor a very odd reason, I have been an Echo user since the device first came out. I'm older, and one of the things Amazon did was to partner with AARP and our community in my city to do a pilot project exploring how Echo could help old people. I was in the pilot, and I got an Echo and have been using it ever since. At this point, it is fairly entrenched--reminders, alarms, turning lights on and off, and delivering music. I have a first or second generation Dot in the kitchen that doesn't do much beyond setting timers. \n\nMost of what I have is Apple, and I have a lot of Apple, including an iPad and a set of Air Pods. I am hard of hearing, and the AirPods have fit in beautifully with both the Echo and my Mac stuff for listening to music, news, whatever. In other words, I don't need the excellent speaker capabilities of the newer Echo. What I'm wondering is, will a newer device convey any other advantages? Help me automate stuff a little more easily? And will a Dot provide all the \"command\" capabilities without the elegant speaker setup? \n\nA new Dot with clock is on order for my bedroom, where I think it will be of help. I figure if I am acquiring hardware, I might as well acquire whatever I need. I'm reasonably literate when it comes to setting this stuff up, but I haven't thought about any of the Echo products for several years. Thanks!",
  "I have 4 morning routines to keep my ADHD kid on track and reduce my impulse to nag.  Each one of those routines involves playing Disney Radio on Pandora.  \n\n\nSo, the 7:45 am routine connects to a BlueTooth speaker by his bedroom.  It plays a Good Morning message, the time, \\[used to announce weather\\], tells him the tasks he needs to accomplish by 8 am, then used to play music for 15 minutes.  After that, the routine has Alexa ask him if he's succeeded and reminds him to check in with me.  This used to be run through the Show 5, but is now run through an Echo Dot, since I relocated the Show 5 too far away from the BT speaker.  For the past week or so, the tasks are announced and then the routine goes silent.  No music.  After 15 minutes, it doesn't run the final part of the routine, either.    \n\n\nIt does work when I test the routine, just not when it triggers.  It also tends to trigger 1 to 4 minutes late.  \n\n\nThe other 3 routines run on the tall Echo, my oldest device.  The music streaming will trigger, though sometimes it randomly selects Disney Radio Chile(??) on the first Breakfast Routine.  It also fails to reset the volume to 5 once the music starts.  The second Breakfast Routine never selects DR Chile and I have that structured to break every 5 minutes for a reminder about how much time is left for Breakfast.  I don't like having 2 Breakfast Routines, but fusing them didn't work for some reason.  Finally, the Morning Clean-up/Get Ready for School Routine activates, changes to Kids Bop (ugh) and runs through perfectly.  Always on time.  No BT speaker for any of these Routines.  \n\n\nI don't feel like this is a problem with the BT speaker connection.  It will play music from Spotify, Pandora, and iHeart Radio from the Echo Dot at any other time of the day.  If I test the Routine, the BT speaker plays Disney Radio on Pandora.  \n\n\nI think the routine broke the same time I switched Alexa's default weather to Big Sky.  I deleted playing the weather from the routine, since the music wouldn't play afterwards.  Do I just need to re-write the Routine altogether instead of editing it?    \n\n\nIf anyone has any good Routines that help you or your family with ADHD challenges, please share!",

  "I have 2 calendar related issues with my Echo.\n\nFirst of all, I'm using Google Calendar, synced to my Amazon/Alexa app.\n\nLet's say I create an **all-day** calendar event on Friday. I'll configure the notification for the event to look something like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7xefmz7t6g281.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fa649100c08c07be6ed11087684c3b24480ac533\n\nThe notifications will fire at 10:05am on Friday and 3:43pm on Thursday.\n\nOn **Thursday**, if I ask my Echo \"what's on my calendar TOMORROW\", it will correctly tell me that there's an all-day event for Friday.\n\nOn Thursday at 3:43pm, my Echo will automatically announce that there's an all-day event on Friday tomorrow, but it will repeat this TWICE.\n\nOn Friday at 10:05am, I expect my Echo to tell me that there's an all day event for today, but it doesn't tell me anything. The entire day on Friday, it will not tell me I have an event for that day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, if I create a calendar event for Friday and save it to my Alexa Calendar instead of my Google Calendar, then:\n\nOn Friday, Echo will automatically tell me there's an event for today and it will only say this once (which is correct). \n\nUPDATE: Just did another test and Echo is reading my calendar event stored in Alexa Calendar, TWICE. So same issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I create a standard, non-all day calendar event in Google Calendar, then my Echo will tell me that there's an event for today (which is correct), but it will still repeat it TWICE, just like it does for an all-day calendar event.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor either an all-day event or non all-day event, I'll get the email notifications from Google. So clearly, it's working on Google's side, just that my Echo is somehow not announcing them at the times that I expect it to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems like Echo is only able to announce all-day GOOGLE CALENDAR events THE DAY BEFORE and it will repeat the event TWICE. Echo will NOT be able to announce events on the same day, unless the event is NOT an all-day event.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Echo is already up to date with the latest firmware.**\n\n**When I did my test, I only had 1 calendar and 1 event. There are no duplicate events.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding the issue with repeating the same calendar event twice,  I've already tried the following:\n\n1. open your Amazon Alexa app\u00a0\n2. click on \u201cMore\u201d in the bottom right corner\n3. click on \u201cSettings\u201d\n4. click on \u201cNotifications\u201d\n5. click on \u201cReminders\u201d\n6. click on \u201cAnnouncement Count\u201d under customize delivery\n7. change to \u201c1\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, I'm still getting double calendar announcements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've also tried everything suggested here too:\n\n[Can someone please tell me why Alexa announces all of my calendar events twice, and how to make it only announce it once?

They've been working the night shift and also finishing their studies (a very stressful time), so this has been my way of not only making myself more present but also of showing that what's important to them is also a priority to me \u2014\u00a0and they're very thankful for it.\n\nThat said, I was considering gifting them a simple alarm clock when I came across this **Echo Dot** device, which *also* has an alarm function (and the prices weren't that different), so now I'm wondering if this would be a better deal, since it'd allow not only me to help them however I can but also serve as a speaker to listen to music and so on. I'm aware that there's a function to connect two phones to Alexa, but my doubt would be: can both use and control the device freely and seamlessly regardless of distance or must they both share the same nearby space? Can I add their calendar events remotely through my phone while they're listening to music, for instance? Can an alarm be set remotely?\n\n**P.S.:** we've been together for years, so there's enough trust and freedom between us to use the same account if that makes it work.\n\n**P.P.S.:** if Echo Dot doesn't allow this to happen, do you happen to know any device that could? We'll be soon shortening our distance, but this would make things much easier in the meantime.\n\nThanks in advance!",
  "So I've a problem with one of my Echo Dots(3rd gen), it was fine until recently, but at some point it just stopped sounding alarms or telling about reminders by itself. I get the message to my Amazon app once reminder is fired, but no sound on the device itself. I checked DND, and it's off. I tried to plug it off and on without any results. \n\nSurprisingly, another Echo 4th gen device  in my room has no problems neither with alarms or reminders. Can someone have any ideas what can cause this issue and what can I try to resolve it?",

All toggled off. \n\nThe only things toggled \"on\" on this echo are Covid-19 alerts and the two weather items. \n\nIt is still showing me content prompts for stuff I've toggled \"off\". \"Popular Recipes\" and \"Trending\" in just the last two minutes. \n\nHow can I get this thing to obey my preference?.

  "Hi,  we currently have one Echo Dot which I got for $10 when I purchased a small fire TV for a spare bedroom.  We have it in our open plan living/dining/kitchen space in a 1800 square foot ranch, and so far are using it for reminders and playing the radio/music.  Occasionally we ask it questions, the quality of her answers varies widely. We can hear one another from pretty much anywhere in that living area.  I noticed they will be basically 2 for 1 pricing during the Amazon Prime Day.  I am not sure I can imagine how I would use more, but thought I'd reach out to see if there's some kind of awesomeness I am unaware of that should motivate me to get more of these devices.   The house in total has 3 bedrooms, one of which is used as an office, our big TV has a 4K firestick and as I mentioned, one of the bedrooms has a Fire TV.  I'm thinking multiples would make more sense in a larger, multi level house with more people (just me & my husband live here)",
  "We have a batch of reminders setup for my son while doing the virtual school thing.  example: Reminder, time for social studies.  \n\n\nFor some reason certain reminders start, but continue until Alexa is rebooted.  Any idea why it's doing this or how to stop it?",
  "I don't need to be reminded that I can do this or that or use this new  feature or that thing. I just want alexa to do what it is told and not  start giving me a speech about \"by the way, did you know you can...\"  every other command. To me it's just a bad user experience.\n\nI mean for the past 6 or 7 months I have to yell at alexa since a certain update and it happened to all of my dots and it's quite annoying to tell her to shut up like this at almost every over command. 90% of the time the wrong device gets picked up, sometimes it's one in the laundry room far away so imagine hearing advice from a distance with no way to stop it. Surely there's a way to stop the advice permanently? Also if you know how to make it so I don't have to break my vocal cords I'd appreciate it too. I asked this question when it started happening and didn't get an answer.",
  "Amazon Echo products have gained quite a popularity over the years and it is not just limited to a few certain countries like the developed ones or the ones we would naturally expect to be using such products like here in the US, Europe or the Gulf countries but I have witnessed a larger growth of these Echo products across the globe and it has even penetrated into the markets of countries like India, Japan, China so on and so forth. There are many such products out of the Amazon Echo line that helps make a home, a smart home and a few that one can use even if you do not have a smart home. One common thing that I have witnessed amongst these Echo products is the fact that most of them are powered by Mediatek chipsets therefore it wouldn't be wrong to say that Amazon Echo products and Mediatek does make a great team together. Two of such Amazon echo devices that has impressed me the most would be first of all, the Kids Edition with the Tiger and the Panda prints. It is hard to say if I like it more because of how well it works and how well it is equipped for the use of kids or more because of the prints per se. I like the tiger one. Just saying! The other device would be the Echo Show 10. It has now got a motorized neck which is really cool. Works well for watching movies around the house or for video calls. The camera shutter is a great addition for privacy concerns. The use and practicality of this product is immense. I have one at home and you don't need a smart home to use one of these which increases its productivity and usage a lot more. You can use it for Alexa and for updates, weather reports, reminders so on and so forth.",

  "One day my Alexa app on android device started \"losing\" the notifications few seconds after they appeared. I noticed that this behavior started shortly after I created a reminder to cancel my Amazon Music Unlimited. For the next month or two I kept missing most of my reminders because I missed Alexa announcing it and my mobile app didn't manage to keep the notification long enough for me to notice. I made sure the Alexa app has all the privileges and is not battery optimized, but nothing helped.  \n\n\nJust few days ago, just as I suspected I missed the reminder to cancel my Amazon Music Unlimited subscription. Lucky for me my Google Calendar reminded me to do so. Now that I have cancelled my music subscription and the reminder to do so is gone, suddenly (very next day) my Alexa app started to persist the notifications on mobile again. I haven't touched any settings and app has not updated itself.  \n\n\nIs this just a coincidence or does it smell bit fishy?",

  "Today I got an email and a notification on my echo devices saying \"It's time to replace the CR2477 for your X\" (X being the name of one of my SmartThings sensors.) Of course it conveniently includes a link for me to purchase these batteries on Amazon even though my order history shows I've ordered multi packs of these batteries recently. I also never replace the batteries until they actually die because the low battery alerts are always way off (sometimes they will continue to work 3-6 months more just fine). There was a link to \"view or manage settings, including the option to opt out if you are already using another replenishment service.\" but it is only for that one particular sensor, I can't find any way of change this for any of my other devices (at least 15 others). Is there any way to turn this \"feature\" off all together?",
  "Hey Team,\n\nI have recently started to experience an odd change in behavior concerning my reminders. I use my Alexa system for quite a few reminders and in the past, the reminder would be announced from the device that it was created on, addressed to the person who asked for it (voice profiles are pretty accurate in my experience). This is all fine and dandy, and it's been like that for year(s). Then all of a sudden recently, last week or so, my echo devices stopped announcing the reminders like usual as far as I can tell, and instead do the \"notification arrived\"  \\*bla-doop noise and flashing green light. I ask what my notifications are and she says you have such and such reminders. The only time I used to get green light notifications was for amazon shopping delivery and Ring device low battery notifications. I did some digging through settings and I noticed a setting that \"If Alex notices you are away she will make it a notification for you to check earlier\" type of setting. It was on, so I'm assuming it's always been on and may be the source of the problem. But I also do like the thought of having that if it works, obviously if we are not home to hear the reminder it would be nice to have the notification pending to make sure we see it. Color coding the echo notification color/light would be really handy as well. So I could differentiate quickly between reminders, ring notifications, and amazon shopping updates. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I am sure I will just end up having to turn off the \"Alexa will know when you are not home\" option because it's not accurately picking up when I am home or not, even though guard is in home mode, Ring alarm is disarmed or in stay/home mode. Not sure what else may have changed to prompt this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny insight would be appreciated!",

I had to go into the one room that doesn\u2019t have an alexa device to get away from it.

  "I have a LED strip light connected to my Echo. You can change its colors and brightness via voice commands. The light also has an app which provides more lighting settings (some preset, some DIY).

Right after Alexa says that it will remember \"this\", it also tells you how to undo - by asking her to undo.\n\nI asked Alexa to undo what I just taught it. It said sure and asked if I wanted to delete the recordings from the past 10 minutes. I agreed. Ineffective. The commands are still there. I deleted the history for the whole day. Didn't make it go away.\n\nI know I will never say those absurd sentences so this is not a practical issue but may I learn how to get rid of such associations for my future reference please?

Its only me & my wife. I've tried to tell alexa to delete all reminders and it will just say (there are no reminders would you like to create one). Anyone have any idea what this could be & how to get rid of it?",
  "Hi all. The last couple of months my echo has been saying things like, \"it looks like you might be running out of solimo coffee pods, if you'd like to order more say, 'order solimo coffee pods.' Would you like to order more solimo coffee pods now?\"   And, it's driving me insane.\n\nI'm sure it's an easy fix to turn this off, but in my searching I can't find a way to turn this off. Sorry if this has been asked and answered, I was unable to find an answer when searching the sub. Thanks in advance for any advice or direction.",

  "I don't know how long this has been the case, but I just noticed today that location based reminders are now available in the UK (although location based routines still don't appear to be available).\n\nMaybe this was implemented when the Echo Auto was made available here.",
  "I know this is a long shot, and the answer is probably no, but when it's after midnight and I ask alexa to remind me of something \"tomorrow,\" it of course thinks of \"today\" as the day that started at midnight and sets the reminder for the day after. I know I can get around this by just remembering to say today but I get tired at night like most people and would love to be able to rattle off the stuff I want to remember tomorrow and have Alexa know that \"Tomorrow\" starts in a few hours.",
  "I was having a problem with reminders blasting out at full volume.   Customer support had me do a reset which fixed that.  \n\nNow News Brief blasts out at 100% volume, and music plays at such low volume that If I turn my studio up to max volume I can only hear the music if i put my ear next to the speaker.\n\nI can no longer use Alexa for music, news brief, and it stopped working with Smart Things.  Very likely that reminders will go back 100% volume any day on the POS.\n\nIs Google the best alternative?",

  "I've had a 2nd gen Echo Show since Prime Day 2019, and it's been working pretty well until recently. In the last 3 months, it's gone mute 3 times. The previous time it did this I performed a factory reset on it, but it's just happened again. There's no other devices paired with it for audio output, the volume is turned up all the way, and the display shows that the Echo is hearing and responding to commands, but nothing short of unplugging it for a few seconds will fix it. This is annoying when it's the main Echo responsible for saying reminders in our house...\n\nI've found mentions of this behavior through Google while trying to find a fix, but most people accept the \"fix\" is to unplug... and that's not a fix, it's still going to happen again. Anybody else seen this, and actually found a fix outside of getting a new Show? That's probably not going to happen in my house, since we had a Gen 1 that developed streaks in the screen (which is why we replaced it with a Gen 2), and now the Gen 2 is having issues less than a year later. Not a good track record so far.\n\nWe have lots of Echos in our house - 1 Show 5 (that's fairly new, and I'm kinda regretting now), 1 Show 8 having issues, 2 2nd gen dots, 2 3rd gen dots, and a spot. The only echo that's been stable since I bought it is the spot, but it's chugging along fine. We've had to replace a gen 1 show and 2 2nd gen dots so far, each of those within a year to a year and a half of purchase.",

  "I just got an amazon echo last week for my bedroom and ordered another for my kitchen. While I was in the kitchen I asked Alexa to set a reminder in 15 min for a task because I knew by then I would be in my room. \n\nI thought the echo/Alexa in my bedroom would have reminded me of the task. Instead I barely heard the Alexa in the kitchen only speak the reminder. I thought the two echos would be in sync and both notify me of my reminder. Only reason I remembered my reminder was because the Alexa app on my iPad popped up with the reminder. \n\nAnother thing is that I thought with a second echo in the kitchen that if I forgot to turn my tv off when I went in the kitchen I could tell the kitchen Alexa to turn off my bedroom tv.

  "I've been writing up a few reviews of the Alexa Newsletter over the last month or so. Here are the highlights from the latest newsletter sent out on the 10th. Link to the post is at the bottom for more detail.\n\n## Takeaways\n\nHere\u2019s how the new commands break down for this week\u2019s newsletter:\n\n* Donations: 1\n* Timers: 1\n* Information: 2\n* Alexa Skills: 4\n* Smart Home: 2\n* Jokes: 3\n* Music: 3\n* Alarms: 1\n* Audible: 2\n* Productivity: 2\n\nMusic, Audible and ambient sounds are the main themes this week. We have only one updated command for the pandemic, so we\u2019re now seeing a slowdown in updates there.\n\n### Music and Ambient Sounds\n\nMusic and ambient sounds had a big showing this week. Amazon really wants users to know about Alexa\u2019s Ambient Sound abilities. And with added commands for changing the equalizer, we\u2019re seeing more emphasis on music quality.\n\n### Audible\n\nAudible seems to get at least one command each newsletter so far, with this week being no exception. One of the commands is very much a bust, while the other could be useful with your kids at home.\n\nAmazon tends to push Audible too hard on Alexa users. WIth one command, it feels like Amazon is using the notion of \u201cfree\u201d as an opportunity to upsell.\n\n### Alexa\u2019s Xbox Integration\n\nAlexa has very solid integration with Xbox. This isn\u2019t too surprising these days. Microsoft has stopped using [Cortana to compete with Alexa ](https://www.cnet.com/news/cortana-reborn-microsofts-digital-assistant-becomes-less-alexa-more-productivity-app/)which benefits Alexa users in this case.\n\n### Productivity Weaknesses\n\nAmazon has a built-in to-do list with Alexa that doesn\u2019t seem to integrate with any other known productivity systems out there. Although it does work, I find it pretty lacking. Just having a to-do list in Alexa isn\u2019t compelling enough for the average user to switch from a system they already use, like the iOS Reminders App. Amazon needs to step up their game in this space.\n\n### Donation Awareness\n\nThere are many organizations that accept donations that don\u2019t actually use the money for what they say. This week\u2019s donation command is a solid example. Although it says Coronavirus Relief, we don\u2019t actually know where that money is going, or what it\u2019s doing. Amazon doesn\u2019t provide that information. Your dollars may not go to the right people to make an impact.\n\n## Next Newsletter\n\nThat\u2019s all for this week! Let\u2019s see if we get another newsletter before the end of April. I\u2019m thinking a monthly roundup of all the newsletters for the month might be useful, especially if we continue to get a weekly update from Amazon. Let me know if that\u2019s something you would be interested in reading in the comments below.\n\n[https://smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-april-10th/](https://smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-april-10th/)",
  "Hi again. Sorry to post again so soon (and speaking of, why do people downvote in this community? Like, was I off topic or had the wrong flair or something in my last post? I know different communities have different cultures and rules (I've read yours and I don't see anything that would apply here, but there are such things as unspoken rules), and I've been wracking my brain but I just can't understand why that post would get downvoted? So yeah, if someone could tell me if I did something wrong with it...that would be good...). I'm just having all sorts of trouble with my Echo Dot. I'll probably try asking customer service too, but after I talked to them last time and they were entirely unhelpful... I'm a bit skeptical that this will be any better.\n\nSo I guess I have a couple questions for now, and may add more later (I'll mark as edited if so) if needed, because my brain is super fuzzy right now but I'm really frustrated and just want answers ASAP. (Also please forgive if the tone of this post is a bit brusque. Trying really hard not to sound annoyed because obviously you guys aren't at fault here (and maybe no one is, maybe it's just a thing that happens), but yeah... sorry if it comes across that way.)\n\nSo here's the basic situation. I have major trouble going to bed at a reasonable time, for a number of reasons that I don't really want to get into right now. After some discussion with a friend and my parents, we decided that a good solution might be for me to put my computer and phone actually physically outside my room at a certain time at night, so that I wouldn't be as tempted by them. But since I use my tech for, among other things, my calendar, alarm clock, and audiobooks to help me sleep, we figured getting an Echo would solve those problems (and did this on recommendation from someone who owns one).\n\nWell, when it works, it seems to work pretty well.\n\nBUT.\n\nI have yet to be able to put my phone and computer outside my room as planned. Why? The short answer is that I don't trust the Echo.\n\nAmong other things, two of the largest culprits are that Alexa gets stuck in listening mode--i.e. blue and green spinning lights and no response, even after I set it to make a noise both when it hears the wake-up word and when I finish a request--and that it will be acting like it's fine, and then either I won't get a reminder, or it'll cut off speaking mid-sentence, or it will all of a sudden stop doing something and be like \"I'm sorry, I'm having trouble with that.\"\n\nExamples/more detail to follow, and feel free to ask for any details I've left out (but yes, I've tried the unplug/replug method haha), but doing research online seems to bring me to the conclusion that some or all of this is caused by a bad internet connection. But first of all, I haven't noticed problems with the WiFi on, say, my computer as often as I have with the Echo acting up (and my dad described the poor internet connection as \"sporadic\" today, when I would say the Echo issues quite a bit more than sporadic), and secondly, if it IS a bad connection... There are so many people staying home because of the pandemic right now, and the internet is getting overloaded, but like... I've got to be able to have access to my alarms and reminders at the least, no matter how bad it is. I mean, what if I had something important going on and the connection was bad when my alarm was meant to go off?!\n\nSo my two basic questions are (1) what can I do about any or all of these things and (2) do the alarms/reminders at least work whether or not your internet and/or WiFi is problematic? (I mean I'd really like to know whether it is a bad connection that's the issue or not, so I guess that's question 3...)\n\nDETAILS\n- Like I said, I've tried unplug/replug--several times, in fact. No luck :(\n- Have not tried factory reset yet... I will if I have to, but I mean...I just GOT the blasted thing like 3 or 4 days ago. I shouldn't have to reset yet. And also it would be a gigantic pain if I had to put it all the settings for a THIRD time (had to do it twice already. Long story, but if it matters or anyone actually wants to know I'll tell you haha. I just figured I'd spare you the reading and myself the typing unless I was sure someone did want to know)\n- Sometimes I can use the app rather than voice commands for things, or connect through Bluetooth and play my audiobooks that way...but that kinda defeats the purpose, which was not to have to have my phone/computer in the room\n- I'm definitely trying to put some of the issues I'm having down to user error (although why I can use the phrase \"Doctor Who music\" one day and get the Doctor Who album, and the next day and get something that is decidedly not Doctor Who...still puzzles me... *sigh*), but I'm just not sure how much of it really is? Idk, maybe I'm missing something super obvious here...\n- I do want to stress the fact that I know this pandemic is more or less unprecedented and that everyone is having difficulties...but besides the fact that my mental health is suffering rather majorly here...like I said, having a product that honestly only works when the WiFi is basically perfect, when WiFi is kinda hit-and-miss a lot of the time anyway... That seems like a bad idea. Idk *shrug*\n\nEXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS\n\nStuck in listening mode:\n\nMe: Alexa.\nEcho: *beep to show it's listening*\nMe: Wake me up at seven o'clock with Doctor Who music.\nEcho: *no \"you've finished your request\" noise; spinning blue and green lights, but not the ones that spin fast and seem to mean it's processing, just the ones that look like it's listening*\n\n*At this point, either I say nothing and wait for the \"listening\" lights to turn off--which sometimes takes...I would guess at least another 30 seconds, if not more--or I repeat my command or the wake-up word and, upon still getting no reply, give up and wait for the lights to turn off anyway.*\n\n--\n\nNot getting a reminder:\nI guess this has only happened once, but basically I got a notification on my phone, but IIRC, the Echo made a little beep or musical tone sound, but Alexa didn't actually SAY anything at all. Which, again, that's okay to put up with if you HAVE your phone, but...\n\n--\n\nCut off speaking:\n\nMe: Alexa, what time is it?\nEcho: The ti-- *silence*\n\n--\n\nSuddenly stop and say it's having trouble:\n\nMe: Alexa, play my audiobook.\nEcho: Getting selection from Amy's Audible library. *book starts playing* *after maybe 15-20 mins* I'm sorry, I'm having trouble. *stops speaking or making any kind of noise, lights go off, silence*\n\nOr even mid-skill:\n\nMe: Alexa, play Harry Potter quiz.\nEcho: *quiz starts; I answer one question and it tells me I got it right; then, all of a sudden* I'm sorry, I'm having trouble. *stops speaking or making any kind of noise, lights go off, silence*\n\nSorry guys, I know that's a huge lot of text to go through...

  "Hey there, we have a toy poodle puppy that we're raising and we're keeping her playpen and bed at the end of our hallway near my office. Despite giving her plenty of personal play time and exercise and leaving her alternative 1-2 chewtoys in her bed (all by the recommendation of several puppy trainers), she still seems to get into mischief and chew up the potty pads. We plan to give her a designated potty spot outside in the grass to go but until she gets her 3rd and final core vaccination of DAPP, we're playing it safe and not taking her outside.   \nI've learned that to correct bad behavior with puppies is best to catch them in the act of doing what they're doing, snap them out of it with a clap or firm correction noise, and redirect them to something else like her chew toys and then to reward that behavior for reinforcement. However, since I work from home in my office where I don't have clear view of her from my desk, I'm often forced to have to get up and check on her periodically or every time I hear some weird rustling coming from her. She seemed to have gamed the system though because she hears the slightest noise or creak of my desk chair as I get up as a cue to quickly rush to her bed and play the good angel role lol.  \nI recently decided to keep my office door open and turn my Echo Show 5 (2nd gen) that I have in my office towards the doorway where it can monitor the play pen and use the Alexa desktop app and sometimes the mobile app to tune into the live video to check what she's doing while I work. I really like being able to do this because I can stay where I am and verbally correct her behavior when she's getting into mischief. However the live video cuts off at I think like 5 minutes? Then I have to keep relaunching the live video which takes about 5-10 seconds to load up, which is really inconvenient and annoying. \n\nDoes anyone know of any indoor cameras with night vision features that allows you to view a live video feed indefinitely without having to buy into a paid subscription? I really like the idea of the pan/tilt/zoom cameras. Since I can also monitor other parts of the hallway for security purposes.

  " I have a business and we used to use an Echo show for the background music. We also use the Echo show to set timers and my employees always use the \"Alexa stop\" command to stop the timer alarm.

In fact it barely works and my Amazon music subscription doesn't even work with it.\n\nIs there a way to keep the Alexa Stop command from stopping the music?",
  "So your Alexa devices are tied to a primary Amazon account, and you can teach it (voice/visually) to recognise your own voice/face.\n\nBut you can also teach it to recognise others - in practise what benefits does this bring? Any pitfalls? Specially I'm thinking of behaviour surrounding calendars, lists, Spotify account, general home automation skills.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n* I'd want the home automation skills (eg. controlling lights etc) I've installed to continue to work for everyone.\n* Presumably different calendars (ie. configured third-party) are read or displayed to different people. How does this then work with the household calendar - are these mixed in with the individual calendars?  What would the syntax be to add to either calendar?\n* Same with lists - I'd want at least the Shopping List to be shared, is this the case?\n* What about music? Would a separate 3rd party music account be needed for a separate profile (eg. in addition to the Spotify Premium I have associated with my account)? I see pro's and con's to this - not mixing music tastes but maybe an additional subscription required. Then what happens when guests (other people it doesn't recognise) ask to play music, which account would it use?\n* If the \"secondary\" person/profile also has an Alexa setup at a separate house (ie. at their own home and using their own Amazon account as the primary account) would there be any link or association between the two homes/setups (other than say via third party calendar services)?\n* Thinking wider, how does \"Amazon Households\" impact on all of this, ie. when the \"secondary\" person/profile has their own Amazon account which is also a member of the household of the primary account?\n\nAll in all trying to get my head around whether this is worth setting up or not! Currently my only bugbears are: Alexa or rather Spotify thinking my music taste is wide-ranging (!), shopping list only displays my name next to the items I add and blank for others (massive issue I know!), also I don't connect my work calendar to Alexa as others have no interest in this.. but could possibly could be handy for me what with working from home more.\n\nAll pointers and experience gratefully received.

On Woot they have frequent sales on refurb Fire HD 10 - 2017 models which sell for 30 dollars or less. I had friends get me few of those and of course I dont have the need for so many. Even after giving few away to friends and family..I still have few left.\n\nSince Echo Show 10 is prohibitively expensive in India, I thought of converting one of the Fire 10 tablets to show mode. Turns out that this is available only for folks with Amazon US id. No big deal since I registered one of my kids on Amazon USA and am able to get show mode on my fire tablet in India.\n\nMy joy was short lived since my Amazon id is Indian and I have Kindle unlimited, Amazon prime and all home automation linked to my Indian account. I had a chat with Indian customer support and they said that they can make my account an american one but then all my subscriptions would be null and void since they all are Indian.\n\nWhat is the practical issue with this?\n\n(a) I cannot say Amazon play music on the show since my prime and spotify....etc are linked to my Indian account and hence my kids Amazon account cannot play music - this is one of the reasons I wanted Show on a 10 inch tablet since the album art when a song is being played looks cool on a large display\n\n(b) Same goes for all my home automation...they all are linked to my Amazon Indian account and hence I cannot turn on/off any electrical points in my house because the show id belongs to my kid\n\nHence here I am using my echo dots and echo show 5s which are linked to my account for music playing and home automation commands whereas my Fire tablet tablet on show mood is just a display to show time and news and nothing much.\n\nHENCE MY QUESTION IS - IS THERE ANYWAY I CAN RETAIN MY AMAZON INDIA ACCOUNT AND ALSO USE THE SAME ACCOUNT TO HAVE SHOW MODE ON MY FIRE TABLET?\n\nmany thanks in advance for all your help!!",
  "I'm subscribed to a YouTube channel that goes live every day at a certain time, and I'm trying to create a routine that plays that stream.  The name of the channel is kinda common unfortunately and Alexa never seems to find the right video, but always plays something...  \n\nI've tried commands like \"play live video from channel xxx on YouTube\" or \"from subscription xxx\" but the keywords \"channel\", \"subscription\" or \"live\" don't seem to make a difference.\n\nDoes anyone have something like this working, and can you let me know the right command for it?  Thanks!",
  "I started an Amazon Music family subscription yesterday and there's a weird but very annoying glitch affecting my paired Echo Studio speakers. I have done a lot of trial and error to narrow down what the issue is.\n\nBasically, when I ask Alexa to play a song, if that song turns out to be in the \"Ultra HD 360\" or \"Ultra HD Atmos\" format (which you can check in the song history on the Amazon Music app) then it will either repeat the song on an infinite loop or play it once but cut off the last 10 seconds of the song. My daughter is big into Harry Styles and every song on his new album is in one of these format, so if she asks Alexa to play \"As It Was\" it will literally keep playing it until the end of time.\n\nI have tried everything I can think of - reverting the Studios to factory settings, turning the router on/off, changing the wifi network, tweaking/disabling various audio settings on the Music app inc the spatial and Atmos options, I also have a third Studio that is kept in the bedroom that I swapped with one of the paired sitting room ones. The issue persists. The only thing I can do to fix the problem is to unpair the Studios, but it's not the solution I want because they sit on different sides of the same room and we want them both firing out music simultaneously.\n\nI am just off a chat with Amazon customer service and they had no other suggestions other than escalating the matter to their back end, which they said they'd do.\n\nIn the meantime, just to help me determine if this glitch is specific to me or not, does anyone else have paired Studios and an Amazon Music subscription that they could try playing \"Harry Styles - As It Was\" on and see if it repeats on a loop?\n\nOr if anyone has an ideas of what I can try to fix it they will be very gratefully received because I have spent hours trying everything without success!",

  "Alexa is officially the stupidest thing ever. I have been listening to rain on a tent sounds each night for two years now. Last night, it randomly decided that the rain on a tent sound I usually played didn't work. I usually say \"Alexa, activate rain on a tent by SleepJar\" because I've found that's the phrase with the highest first try success rate. Last night it just didn't work. I tried everything, but it was like the sound I wanted didn't exist. I checked the website of the sound app, and they added a \"premium subscription\", which the rain on a tent was locked behind.\nTonight, I decided to try again. Upon saying \"Alexa, activate rain on a tent by SleepJar\" it says \"ok, here's rain on a tin roof by Sleep and Relaxation Sounds\". It's not what I wanted, but I was tired and it was close enough. I go to bed, and right as I'm about to fall asleep, it stops. No warning, no explanation, no little 'ding!' sound to warn me.

  "I have been a long time Amazon Echo user, and until recently I had a yearly Amazon Music family subscription that I was happy with.  It worked well for all of the family.\n\nThen I got a new car, and the new car had Carplay.\n\nAmazon Music does not play well with Carplay, it has a clunky interface and will not work with Siri.  So I have been trying other services.\n\n**Amazon Music**\n\nWe had used Amazon music for a long time, with a yearly family subscription.  It was good value for money.  You could sort of control the music from your phone via either the Amazon Music app or the Alexa App.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Spotify**\n\nThen I tried Spotify.  I really liked Spotify, I preferred the playlists it generated for me, I liked the interface.  What I really liked was Spotify Connect, it's really nice to be able to just tell the app on my phone to output to an Amazon Echo.  \n\nSo I took out a family subscription thinking this would work the same as an Amazon one, and everyone in the house to play different music on different Echos at the same time.  It does not.  If someone asks Alexa to play music on one side of the house, it stops on the echo on the other side of the house.  There are some clunky work arounds that involve linking a different family members Spotify account and then asking Alexa to switch profiles, but it all seems awkward and uncessary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Apple Music**\n\nNext I tried Apple Music.  I liked the playlists it generated for me, but not as much as the Spotify ones, but I really missed the Spotify Connect functionality.  It does't have any way of controlling the music playing from your phone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there a music service out there that:\n\n* Works with Carplay/Siri\n* Has a family account that will just work with multiple Echo's without any special setup\n* Has some way of controlling music playback on an Echo from my phone when I don't feel like talking with Alexa?",

  "Hi, \n\nThis has been asked before but I cant find a decent solution. I want a white noise skill that doesnt fade in and out  like they all seem to do and that isnt a subscription. I will not pay a sub for a white nose app, not going to happen, ever. It makes me angry just thinking about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, the one post I found that sounded perfect was from a year ago from u/last_rise that said:\n\n*\" I saw a number of people who had complained about white noise sound looping every hour unless you paid for the skill which often is an absurd $2/month for the popular skills. \"*\n\nThis sounds great I thought until I found that the skill is literally exactly what it says it was created to avoid. It costs an \"absurd $2 a month\" for the subscription that enables a 10 hour loop. It does say its 5 hours, but Im pretty sure thats not true, i tried it and it fades out well before that, I havent timed it but i dont think its even an hour. I could be wrong.\n\nWhat I do now is just stream from my phone via bluetooth, but I want to use it for my baby and that doesnt work because when i go away from his room it cuts out, and when i walk back it does the annoying \"now playing from galaxy s7\" grrr.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, thanks for any suggestions.",
  "I know these conversations have been had on here already, but I couldn\u2019t find an answer. Feel free to redirect me if it exists, but we have an Apple Music Family subscription. We have 4 echos dots that are all currently registered to the same Amazon account. MY account. We have four family members, one who is under 13 so can\u2019t have an Amazon account, even on Household. \n\nI see no way to have the Echos link to the Apple Music account for each family member, and I am not sure there is even a good workaround for that. I can set three dots up individually with Amazon accounts for each user, but not all four because one of my kids are under 13, so one would have to share and that mixes up all the music preferences for two people. It also nixes the \u201dannounce\u201d feature which is kind of handy for a family. I know you can drop in, but announce is better for some things. \n\nWould it be easier if we switched to Amazon Music? Would voice profiles work to let us curate and play playlists for each individual family member based on the voice the echo recognizes? I feel like there should be a solution for this by now. It is great that the Echo supports Apple Music, Spotify, etc, but it really only supports it for one user Per device.",

  "I am having constant bugs with Amazon Music App, when using the app on an android device to connect with my Echo device.\n\nI  happens very often, normally every other 3 - 5 songs one of the may  bugs happens.

  "So\u2014 I asked Alexa to play a song for me(First Steps - Lena Raine), only for it to respond with the whole thing about needing Amazon Music Unlimited to play specific songs. Which, yeah, that makes sense, since I don\u2019t have a subscription.\n\nBut then about an hour later, it suddenly starts playing the song. The exact song I had asked for. Out of nowhere. I hadn\u2019t said anything to it, I don\u2019t think there was any sound that came even relatively close to sounding like it was asking for a song; it just suddenly started playing the song I had asked for literally a whole hour earlier.\n\nI was worried that I had accidentally bought a music subscription, so after telling Alexa to stop, I asked it again to play the song. It replied with the message about not having the music subscription again, meaning that it should\u2019ve been impossible for it to play the song I was asking for, especially so long after the command.\n\nSo.... uh...... any idea what just happened??",
  "In Canada it's common to have both an amazon.ca account and an amazon.com account, to allow cross-border shopping and to take advantage of some Amazon services and features only available in the U.S.. I imagine this is common with other countries as well. This extends to setting up Amazon Echo units in the home - certain features are only available with amazon.com accounts, sometimes for years before they become available in other countries. For example Alexa Guard, or using a Fire tablet in Echo Show mode. However some features may only be available in your home country Amazon account, for example if you have Amazon Prime for local shopping, and you have signed up for discounted Amazon Music Unlimited. So the question arises, can you mix use of the two Amazon accounts with your Echo units? I've had some experience with this recently, discovering what's possible by experimentation, so I thought I might document the results here for the benefit of other users with multiple country accounts.  \nThe short answer is No. Each Echo unit must be assigned to one Amazon account from one country. It does not have to be your home country, so assignment to an amazon.com account is permitted, but in that case you cannot access any features of your home country account.  \nGuest Access is not supported between countries. Family sharing is not supported between countries. So there is no way to access the services of your home country account on an amazon.com Echo, or vice-versa.  \nMultiple Echo units in the same home can be registered to different Amazon country accounts. Each one must be set up independently, but nothing prevents the simultaneous sharing of home automation devices between different country accounts with most skills. For example any individual WiFi light/switch/plug in the home can be operated from either an amazon.com account or another country account interchangeably if it is set up in both. The only problem is that when multiple Echo units overhear the same command, Alexa cannot resolve which one should respond if the units are assigned to different Amazon accounts, so one from each account will respond, unaware of the other.  \nDevices and groups/rooms must be within a Home as Amazon defines it. An individual account can have more than one Home, but devices in that account must only be in one Home. However, devices in any Home associated with the account can be remotely voice controlled regardless of which Home the Echo unit is in. A Home and its contents can only be in one Amazon account, so if you want to access those devices in another account, you must replicate the Home's groups and devices in the other account.  \nStreaming music service subscriptions vary: of course Amazon Music Unlimited can only be associated with one Amazon account, but other independent services like Spotify, Deezer, or Apple Music can appear in multiple Amazon accounts without problems. WiFi speakers like the Sonos speakers can only be registered to one Alexa account at a time - you must completely remove the speakers and delete the associated skill when moving them between accounts (simultaneous linking to two separate Alexa accounts is possible, and may appear to work initially, but within 24 hours the speakers will go permanently offline in the original account and must be completely removed and re-added).",

  "Been trying to figure this out for a little while.  Found some stuff that seemed promising at first but nothing really panned out so far...  What I've explored already:\n\n* AutoVoice: While this was my first idea and looked promising since it can create a virtual smart lock which is an acceptable trigger on the Alexa side to fire off a routine, unfortunately the app creator didn't include a way to trigger the virtual device from the Tasker/AutoVoice side.  I guess it didn't occur to him or it wasn't possible to fire off routines in this way when the plugin was developed since usually these virtual devices are used the opposite way (to pass info from Alexa back to Tasker, rather than from Tasker into Alexa) so Alexa is the one fiddling with their state.\n* SmartThings: While it seems like people are using this software for that purpose and it already has premade code for a virtual switch that can be used to fire off whatever... ~~it seems that it requires you purchase their hardware to run it on, so it's not really practical in my situation.  I prefer to continue using my raspberry pi as a hub as I have been rather than buying a dedicated device for this.  If there is a way to run the software from a generic android or linux device let me know though.~~  edit: I guess you don't actually need to own the hub to use this, just for some reason it's pretty difficult to get the Classic app set up on your phone if you don't already have a device (any device) associated with your account, also you need a location defined to set up a virtual device but eventually figured out how to jump through the proper hoops to make everything work properly and now SmartThings is working exactly as I wanted, thanks SmartThings!\n* Having a speaker say \"Alexa go do whatever\" out loud: Yeah, I am aware I could do this, but I don't want to...  At this point it's easier to just speak the command myself.\n\nAnyone have any other ideas here?  Basically I think anything that can emulate a virtual switch or contact sensor (or lock, I guess) and send its state to Alexa to trigger the routine should suffice.  My end goal at the moment is to control my Amazon smart plugs from my PC so I guess if there's an alternative way to do that without relying on Alexa at all I'd accept it, though I'd still kind of like to know a way to trigger routines remotely since it'd be useful for other stuff too.\n\nedit: Found this [https://www.amazon.com/Thomptronics-Virtual-Buttons/dp/B08259XK1Z](https://www.amazon.com/Thomptronics-Virtual-Buttons/dp/B08259XK1Z) which may work but requires a monthly subscription to their Patreon in order to use more than one button...  Couldn't think of a good way to make this work with a single button either since at minimum I'd need one for on and one for off (you can't make a routine to toggle something, can you? couldn't find a way when I checked...)\n\nedit 2: Found a solution using SmartThings and webCoRE, check comments below for more info.",

  "So I have an Amazon music subscription and here recently I've noticed a few songs have become different versions or remixes of the song while still retaining the original title and cover art. \n\nI'll give one song as example \"legend\" by The Score. It was playing from my playlist recently and instead of playing the original version of the song it's now the acoustic version yet the titling gives no indication of this. I've tried deleting the file from my phone and straight up streaming it from the cloud and the issue still persisted.\n\nAnother song I noticed it with was \"can't hold me down\" by GRIZ. It now plays the remixed version even when I pick the original song. \n\nI've noticed this on every device whether it be phone, computer, or echo. It's as if the source file has changed. \n\nIt's a first world problem of course but I was wondering if anyone else has encountered this.",

  "I bought my Grandad an amazon echo for Christmas and he has been getting on quite well with it but has been getting frustrated with trying to get it to play his music. He wants to hear a specific jazz player from when he was younger that he is a big fan of, he owns a lot of his cds and vinyl records but is now unable to operate his cd player, one of the main reasons we got him an echo was so he could listen to his music again. However with the echo it seems if you don't pay for an extra music subscription is wont play specific artists or songs, just something close in the genre, occasionally he will get it to play what he wants but he also spends a lot of time telling it to stop and asking again trying to get what he wants.\n\nIs there a way since he already owns all that music that it can be put on the echo or linked in someway so he can request that specific jazz musician to play?",

  "This is after going through all options, both mentioned in the shutting down mail and almost all suggestions (except those requiring your phone to be in the chain, as that's what I did before stringify and had tons of issues) here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/bawett/with\\_stringify\\_shutting\\_down\\_are\\_there\\_any/](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/bawett/with_stringify_shutting_down_are_there_any/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: My requirements and bias were to have it support my new echo device, preferably have alexa talk locally to a selfhosted service (without awkward \"tell X to\" commands), but if it had to be to call some online service, that it had to be as flexible as stringify, as to allow me to integrate it to IFTTT or to at least send a web request to my own scripts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe solution:\n\nGet a cheap raspberry pi (even a zero), install node-red (important: as root, otherwise you won't be able to set it to listen to port 80, which is apparently necessary for new echo generations | [https://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi](https://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi)) and then via the dashboard install: [https://github.com/datech/node-red-contrib-amazon-echo](https://github.com/datech/node-red-contrib-amazon-echo) or via npm.\n\nThat will also allow you to add any custom functions that you want, by just having node red send a web request to your script when it triggers. You are not forced to have any of your own scripts though, since node red is that popular, that you'll most likely find a block that somebody did for you, e.g. WOL is available in the store.\n\nSince it also is just a regular \"light\", you can add it to any alexa routine and not be forced to say \"turn on/off\", e.g. a garage door can be \"close garage door\" instead of \"turn off garage door\".\n\nIf you do go that route, definitely review security of that setup: [https://nodered.org/docs/security](https://nodered.org/docs/security)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe rest of the \"alternatives\":\n\n\\- HomeAssistant (emulated\\_hue): sadly does not work with new echos, the pull request that was supposed to fix this was closed because the guy that did it, couldn't supply the necessary tests that nobody wanted to help out with to get the feature working again: [https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/18749](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/18749) \\- so even though you can discover the emulated hub, nothing will work as alexa will just report back \"device not working properly\" and similar messages. If you want to see it as them pushing their premium cloud service by doing that is up to your judgement. Also still a viable option if you have older echos though or you're fine with paying 5 bucks a month for the cloud subscription.\n\n\\- HomeAssistant (Haaska): many seem to go that route as they have already a working HomeAssistant installation, requires either aws lambda or your own https endpoint\n\n\\- HA-Bridge: does not work with newer echos and runs with java, so I moved on to other options.\n\n\\- Olisto: tries too hard to be an IFTTT competitor, so you basically can't setup any proper workflow as with stringify, try it out and see if it works for you, but it seemed very bare bones to be at all viable nor an appropriate alternative to stringify.\n\n\\- Yonomi: horrible reviews and posts about it everywhere, even for just automating or having support for popular smart devices, did not give it a try therefore.\n\n\\- SmartThings WebCoRe: looks much more complicated to setup and extends the chain quite a bit, haven't given it as much review, as any docs and videos I could find were made ages ago\n\n\\- Hubitat: yet another paid hub that has a somewhat sketchy looking website, that might or might not work, was posted by one single user and advertised as \"solve any problem\", you figure I didn't check that as a viable option for myself, but if you are willing to pay 100 bucks (instead of the 150 bucks \"non introductory price\") just to try it - go ahead.\n\n\\- IFTTT+Tasker+AutoRemote: sadly puts your phone into the chain and if your phone tends to kill it, even when whitelisted, your things won't work, many people go that route and it works (a seriously great alternative if you can't have node red, be it budget reasons or anything else \\[though worth mentioning, autoremote is a paid addon and you can get a pi zero for almost the same price\\]), but it might not work for you, especially if you have some of the chinese brand smartphones that do whatever they want with background processes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anybody wants to correct or add to any of my findings please go ahead! especially with those that I personally couldn't make a viable alternative for myself or review enough to tell about it to those that it might be one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings mentioned (in no specific order):\n\n\\- [https://www.home-assistant.io/](https://www.home-assistant.io/)\n\n\\- [https://www.home-assistant.io/components/emulated\\_hue/](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/emulated_hue/)\n\n\\- [https://github.com/mike-grant/haaska/wiki](https://github.com/mike-grant/haaska/wiki)\n\n\\- [https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge](https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge)\n\n\\- [https://hubitat.com/](https://hubitat.com/)\n\n\\- [https://olisto.com/](https://olisto.com/)\n\n\\- [https://www.yonomi.co/](https://www.yonomi.co/)\n\n\\- [https://joaoapps.com/autoremote/](https://joaoapps.com/autoremote/)\n\n\\- [https://www.webcore.co/](https://www.webcore.co/)\n\n\\- [https://www.smartthings.com/products](https://www.smartthings.com/products)",

However, she is the one that has the Prime subscription and Im under her family tree or whatever is called.\n\nThe family feature enables for me to be able to use photo albums, but I cant figure out a few things (all questions below regard echo show 2):\n\n1. I want to use the included music streaming feature included with prime on the echo show 2s, but to do that they have to be logged in under my wifes account.  The entire Echo Echosystem is under my account (automation rules and whatnot), will i still have access to that if i sync in the echo show 2s under her?\n2. I also intend to use echo show 2 as a permanent digital photo frame, but i can only do that when i sign in under my name cuz pictures are attached to my account.  I enabled the pictures in family vault, assuming that an echo under my wife's account would see them this way, but it didnt.  In other words, i either sign in under her account (get music streaming, no pictures) or under mine (get pictures, no music streaming).  How can I do both without having to reupload all the pictures to her account?\n3. On that note, how exactly does the \"household\" feature work and what does it do?\n4. Even when the photo frame functionality works, I do not understand how its choosing the pictures.  It does not seem to be exactly random, and it continually shows pictures of receipts and screenshots of school stuff instead of a true random pattern.  It seems to be limited to a certain amount of days and it changes every day, but I really dislike that it does not seem to TRULY randomize ALL pictures.  Anyway to get this done?\n5.

  "Hey all-\n\nJust snagged an Echo Dot 2nd Gen in some drunken Amazon shopping and admittedly as a tech nerd I'm surprised I didn't snag one sooner- it's a pretty cool piece of kit. I'm traditionally a more Google guy but a friend has an Alexa and loves it so I said 'whatever' and went with a Dot instead of a Google Home figuring I'd get a GH at some point for intermesh with my Google Play Music subscription and Chromecasts. I've already got Alexa automating my lights via routines and handling my morning 'wake-up/check news/reminders/etc' routine too. We have a big apartment so the drop-in app and feature is great for when I'm working and my girlfriend is in the other room and a text is insufficient. Nice stuff. It also took minimal training to (with the Amazon Music free trial) show her what music I'm into and given I'm a pretty eclectic guy the algorithm is crushing it: the ability to put Diana Krall next to In Flames next to the Chainsmokers on a playlist is something I thought would be beyond an algorithm's ability. I'm already snagging a second and third one for my home office and the bedroom.\n\nThe issue is my girlfriend is pretty tech agnostic and so far has found exactly one use case for the system: playing Song Quiz, constantly (side note: if you've played Kara from Colorado I apologize, she's ruthless). **Is there an introductory compendium of some sort that compounds *all* the functionalities and popular skills available for a fresh user I could point her toward that would allow her to use it as a more productivity-oriented device too?**\n\nPretty much everything I find is a listicle/blog post about someone's 'Top 4 Favourite Skills for Summer' or a high-level understanding of the sort of questions you could ask her and other garbage and she doesn't really have the attention span to handle a search herself. It's been fine to introduce her to things as I find them ad-hoc but she's a very experiential learner so it'd be cool to find a doc of some sort compounded for old people or something.\n\nI appreciate any help on this!",
  "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&nbsp;\n \nI am writing this because I cannot find anything outlining the problems with the Australian Echo service and I'm hoping that I can warn some poor sod before they buy it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIts taken me some time to get on to writing this, I actually posted a little bit of this with some questions a few months ago with the promise of a full review later. \n\nUnfortunately every time I gear up to interact with my echo I get obscenely angry and have to walk away for some time.\n\nThis time around it was a good month before I could deal with writing or even thinking about it without the impulse to punch a robot, granted, I would have to find a robot first, and then I don't think I could go through with it, I mean, have you see the new one that cleans your room for you? If I had a full on robot, I guarantee it would have a place setting at the dinner table, a spot in family photos and, I seem to have gotten off track here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***THE AMAZON ECHO***\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*The obvious choice* \n\nI was very excited to get my Amazon Echo. My husband, a Google enthusiast, desperately tried to convince me to get the google home, his best friend has one and he loves that it can play Fatboy Slim from the next room while he sits on the couch, I was assured in the knowledge that not only could I have my Star Trek fantasies realised, in that I could address my robot assistant as \"computer\" (90% of the reason that I chose echo over google home, lets admit it) but the echo had the same Fatboy Slim delivery method, granted not with Youtube, but I have amazon prime for twitch reasons and the box said that I get access to over a million songs. I was sold. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n*In the beginning*\n\nI got the echo home and set up, much to Hubs dismay I had held fast and got my echo, (I also held out and got the iphone after years of flat out refusal from his android addicted self) so I was happy as could be, I set it up and was offered the 30 day free trial of Amazon music, it was amazing! I would say \"computer pause\" and in my mind It was just like pausing the holodeck on the enterprise, granted all I was doing was pausing Weird Al's The saga begins (im seeing a theme here) Either way, I was thrilled! I had friends coming over to see how great the echo was, one of my friends was so convinced he decided to finally pull the trigger on getting his own. Any song I could think of was there, I could set timers, alarms, listen to audio books, order things from amazon (I never did but I was happy to know I could) The lot.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*The beginning of the end*\n\nBefore I wrote this next bit,  I had to go outside for a smoke, This is a good precursor to whats to come.\n\nafter 30 days, the free trial to amazon music ended, I considered getting a subscription but the box that echo came in assured me that without the music subscription I would still have access to millions of songs, just less than the music subscription had, I have pretty generic music taste so I was happy with that, plus if I enjoyed it, I would support the service by getting the paid sub, that's why I have Youtube red.\n\nThe second my subscription ended, none of the music was available to me anymore, some stuff had a 10 second preview clips but other than that, my 'over a million songs' were missing, It did however default to a Spanish language radio station that played the same song over and over and over and over, all while I was in the shower screaming at my echo to play literally anything else.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Contacting amazon support*\n\nI assumed there was a problem with my account, Amazon was making a big push in Australia all at once, they had just opened a local warehouse, they were running ads on free to air tv, they were rapidly dropping prices to compete with local mega chains, of course I had slipped through an organisational crack, it happens, we're all human.\n\nIn my communications with amazon tech support (I can provide transcripts if requested) I finally managed to garner this information:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Amazon Australia does not provide most of the features available to literally everyone else in the world.***\n\n* Australian Amazon prime subscription does not include the million or so songs that it does in other countries. \n\n* Australian Amazon basic accounts do not include any songs.\n\n* Without Amazon Music paid subscription, the echo is effectively useless for anything beyond a Google savvy egg timer.  \n\n* Spotify will not play on the Amazon Echo without a paid premium subscription.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is a basic gist of what the echo has in store for you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll of this information was provided (and confirmed upon me repeating the information) by two amazon tech support workers, (unfortunately I only have the transcript of one due to a power failure mid chat) \n\nThe thing that upsets me is not only is Australia once again considered to be a disposable market, with little to no care in providing us service, with our small population we are once again a \"if you don't like it we can literally withdraw from Australia and it wont make a jot of difference to our bottom line\" \n\nThe other thing is **THE BOX LITERALLY ADVERTISES A SERVICE THAT THEY DONT PROVIDE** According to Australian consumer law, you cannot advertise a product with features it doesn't have, so I get the amazing pleasure of returning my echo (which by the way, the second I found out about this debacle, I changed its name back to echo, because, screw associating star trek with this useless tube clock) but I can't return it, by the time I found out about the lack of features, 30 days (of course) had passed, I also bought it from a re-seller who is no longer.\n\nCurrently my echo sits in my bathroom, unplugged and dusty. \n\nAlso my friend decided to wait till tax time to buy his echo and now has a google home instead, thank God.\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe echo is missing vital features for the Australian market and as a result, unless you're willing to get the \"music unlimited\" paid subscription -***note***- *Not* amazon prime, specifically 'music unlimited' you will have an almost completely useless product. If you don't use the echo for music, or audio books or anything more than keeping a schedule and googling things without your phone or computer, then sure thing, get the echo. \n\nI would give the echo 1 Star.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOh by the way, despite all the money I've spent on prime and twitch, I haven't spent any money on amazon so I cant leave a review...... \n",

  "I have been using Unlimited on my Echo Dot for a few months now and never encountered a song it wouldn't play the full item. Sometimes it wouldn't find a song at all, but that was extremely rare. Just last two days there were two popular songs from the 80's that it only played a sample of instead of the entire song.\n\nAnyone know what the problem is or what changed?",
  "I'm curious to know if there is a simple way of finding out how many songs you have uploaded to the amazon music subscription service, so far?\n\nI understand the service is ending soon, so would like to know how many more tracks I can upload into the cloud before I either reach the 250,000 mark or the end date of my subscription. \n\nThanks!",
  "Is there a way to setup a Dot to just stream SiriusXM? My dad is getting a knee replacement next month. He was forced to retire from his truck driving/delivery business due to his bad hips and knees a few years ago and he's been bored out of his mind, so I know he'll go nuts having to take it easy after his surgery. He's mentioned in the past that he misses being able to listen to Howard Stern when we've been in my truck that has SiriusXM. (Stern used to be on one of the local stations) My subscription includes streaming so I thought it would be cool if I could set up a dot so he could listen to it. He's not tech savvy and he doesn't have a smartphone but I figured \"Alexa, play Howard Stern\" is simple enough. I'd also like to disable as many other features as possible to prevent any accidental ordering or anything. I was hoping to get it for him for Father's Day but I wanted to make sure it's possible.\n\nTL;DR  Setup dot to be a standalone SiriusXM streamer?",
  "I've run into several occasions now where a new album or song releases on Spotify (which I have a subscription for and use as the default music service on my Echoes) and I'm able to find and play these right from day 1 via the Spotify app on my phone and then change the device to one of my Echoes within the app - yet none of my Echoes will recognize the albums as even existing when I try to play then via *voice* command.\n\nI know it's not an issue with pronounciation or anything, Alexa just legitimately does not seem to have the data on the new album/song for at least a few days up to like a week after it releases on Spotify. \n\nI've Googled this issue on several occasions and surprisingly, I am never able to find anyone else mentioning the problem what so ever.\n\nDoes anyone know if this is normal, and is there a way to make Alexa \"refresh\" what she can see on Spotify or something so that it can recognize  new albums/songs right away when released on Spotify? I am in the U.S. btw, if it matters. Thanks.",
  "Is it just me or is this an exorbitant price for a reskinned echo Dot? Yes you get a \"free subscription\" to Freetime for a limited period when in reality, it's just amping up the price. Plus, this feature can be added to any Echo if you choose to subscribe.\n\nWhat really has me annoyed is this: Being able to filter out explicit songs should ALREADY be a native feature on all Echo products. Just because it's my Echo and not my kids doesn't mean my kid can't come in at any time and listen to explicit songs while I'm away and it could be a complete accident. In fact it has been on at least one occasion. (My four year old asked Alexa to play some song about unicorns or something and a punk song with an ironic title and lots of F Bombs played instead). \n\nWhile Amazon reserves the right to withhold features, Id say it's in their best interest to allow content filtering on all devices at no extra charge. After all, they ready censor Alexa's speach to prevent expletives, they should allow the same for music.\n\nUpdate: Just learned that the \"Freetime\" settings in the Alexa app are free to use on all Echo dots including filtering out explicit songs BUT WITH A MAJOR DOWNSIDE in that smarthome control is disabled when you use it. As I use my Echos for smart home control more than anything, this would render my Echos pretty useless. Keep working on it Amazon!\n\nUpdate2: Ah ha! Explicit filters are doable without Freetime. Settings, scroll past all named devices till you get to Music & Media under \"Alexa Preferences\". Then scroll past all services until you see Explicit Filter under \"Account Settings\". Sadly, this still deactivates third party services I like to use such as TuneIn Radio but it's definitely the best option so far. Thank you u/GeneralRane.\n\nUpdate3: This filter doesn't work at all. It is switched on but is not blocking anything I test. (Sigh)",
  "My friend gave me a dot and the only thing I ever want it to do is play a bit of the Seinfeld theme when I get to my house. I used IFTTT to get this to work. When my phone connects to the echo via Bluetooth it then plays the track via VLC on my phone. That's fine but before playing the track the echo announces that my Bluetooth is connected. That is a deal breaker.\n\nCreating a new IFTTT applet that triggers the song based on location instead of Bluetooth would work but the only way to get a song to play via echo without a Bluetooth connection to my phone is through a music subscription to Spotify, Amazon music, etc. and I'm morally opposed to doing that for one track.\n\nI have found other people complaining that they want to get rid of the Bluetooth connection announcement but after years of users wanting this, Amazon still hasn't fixed it.\n\nAny workarounds that y'all can think of? Thank you!\n\nUPDATE: So I can play a song directly from \"my library\" on Amazon. However, none of the tracks in the Amazon store are the 11 second clip that I want and have. Only subscribers can upload music to their library so I started a free membership so that I can upload my track. From there I should be able to trigger it based on when I arrive at my home location.\n\nUPDATE UPDATE: It looks like when they say \"you must be a paid Amazon Music Storage subscriber\" they really mean it. I'm going to make sure I can play a song from my library by using IFTTT before actually paying for it so that I can upload the track.\n\nUPDATE UPDATE UPDATE: There is no way to upload music to Amazon. Discontinued!",
  "Sooo.. I just spend way too long trying to set this up, but I couldn't get it to work properly so I gave up.\n\nFirstly, any smarthome devices were no longer functioning.. This is an Echo for a 7yo boy, so he obviously has smart lights etc. But ok, reports seem to indicate this will be fixed.\n\nSecond, no Spotify? I realize they want to push Amazon Music and their IHeartRadio content, but again, he's 7yo and since the family all use Spotify, we all share a Spotify Family subscription.. Oh well..\n\nThird, Audible.. For the life of me I was unable to get it to read any of the free included FreeTime books available. It just kept coming back with \"[Kids] audible library is empty\".. Is there some trick to getting this working, or does it take a while for settings to take?\n\nAlso having trouble setting alarms using the character sounds.\n\nSkills were hit and miss. Some would work fine, others would just say \"I can't help you with that\" or whatever.\n\nI even tried de-registering the device and setting it up from scratch, still no go. Wondering if it's all because we tried early on to set him up with his own \"teen\" account in order to get Spotify linked (which still didn't work btw - geez) but seeing as it's the same after a factory reset and all I'm not sure..\n\nDid Amazon just do a shitty job again (kinda like with profiles) or what?",

  "With an Echo dot in my kitchen, bathroom and bedroom I had a really hard time justifying the purchase of an Echo Spot even though I was in love with its bold, round design since the moment I saw it. \n\nAs a kid growing up in the 80's, alarm-clocks were a \"thing\" and I was always so excited to get the newest AM/FM unit with bright LED display, and one time I waited until Christmas in anticipation of a General Electric model with a special speaker built into the base, giving it pretty good sound for its era. Then one day we had a storm in the neighborhood and lightening hit a nearby transformer; my fancy and expensive new alarm clock was toast and the power company refused to replace it because they deemed it \"an act of God.\"  \n\nSo flash-forward to the past 10-years or so and with cellphones with their built-in clocks, sadly the bedside alarm-clock/radio has become a thing of the past. Though they still sell them, why would anyone want to listen to AM/FM radio anymore when there's an entire universe of Podcasts, internet stations and audiobooks?\n\nSo a couple weeks ago my friend mentioned he wanted a portable device for his daughter so she could listen to podcasts, and I immediately offered to give him the Echo Tap in my bedroom.  I've enjoyed my Tap, but the battery was starting to grow weak, and honestly, it really wasn't responding well to the Alexa keyword anymore. But its biggest sin of omission is a lack of hard-wired stereo output -- the Tap only has stereo input, so you could use it as a speaker for other devices. And when using this input, the Alexa voice recognition on the Tap doesn't work. These two design flaws (in my mind) were good enough reason to toss it, and finally get my own Spot.\n\nI was disappointed to have missed Amazon's recent discounted price so had to buy my Spot for a full $129, and including tax and shipping, it cost $140 -- an indulgence in my book for something I absolutely didn't HAVE to have.\n\nI purchased the white edition Spot and its even better looking in real life than in pictures. Solid feeling, heavy, substantial, nice materials, dare I even say it -- a classic?  I can see this unit sitting proudly by my bed for years and years. And hopefully with continued software upgrades and the always growing cloud-based Echo skillset, it will be the \"last\" alarm-clock bedside device I ever need.\n\nAfter unpacking it, I attached it to my rocking KRK studio-monitor speakers using a special 3.5\" stereo to XLR speaker adaptors I purchased on Amazon.  The KRK's other stereo inputs were already in use by my computer -- now my Spot, through the XLR connector, feeds into the studio monitors independently. The advantage? I don't even need my computer on to enjoy the full universe of Alexa's content, and in fact when playing Spotify for example, I can request a weather report from the Spot and it's delivered mixed right along with the music.\n\nThe sound?  Incredible. My KRK speakers are awesome and the mini-stereo-to-XLR connection is better than I could have even imagined.  I was a bit worried as my Echo Dots have had very poor stereo output via their 3.5 millimeter jacks.  To my surprise the hard-wired output of the Spot sounds as good as any stereo device I've ever had.\n\nMy biggest use during the day has been to ask it to play various radio stations I love, usually Los Angeles-based KCRW which always features great NPR broadcasts and shows as well as a great music line-up at night. I also frequently call up WNYU to get my East-coast fix, or KPFK to get my out-there left-wing news, spiritual and alternative health programming. The feeling of having every FM-radio station available by voice command is awesome and is SO much less tedious than trying to find internet feeds on my desktop computer or using iTunes hideously antiquated streaming-radio interface. In my experience I find any device or service that becomes voice controlled starts to feel like \"magic\" and I end up using it more often. \n\nI love the way the Spot's clock display goes \"nighttime red\" similar to BMW interior lighting, at the hour you specify. Subconsciously it signals to me \"time to crawl in bed and listen to a podcast\" which is what I've been doing.  Usually I say, \"Alexa, play Fresh Air\" or \"Play The Talk Show Podcast\" as I enjoy the sound of human voices before bed or when I wake up and can't sleep. That and \"Science Friday\" and I've started listening to \"The Moth\" again. The bottom line is having Podcasts readily and easily available at my bedside, right at the time I want to hear them, has really enhanced that time of the day for me. And I'm re-discovering the pleasures of listening to Podcasts again.\n\nWhen I wake to my Spot alarm, first thing I do is ask what the weather is going to be.  And I enjoy having the Spot's screen mirror what Alexa is saying on-screen -- I can see a few days high and low temps at a glance, and it feels much quicker than just listening to her describe the weather.\n\nA big frustration is not being able to integrate my Samsung SmartHome camera into the Spot. The current Alexa skill only gives control of panning and tilting of Samsung cameras and does NOT provide a video feed. I can't image why this skill even exists, a video skill providing no video feed on a video-capable device?  Suffice to say, there is NO way to currently access many common security camera video feeds on your Spot, and that was one of my primary interests in getting it -- I want to see who is at my front door.\n\nI have looked into other solutions, and one of the outdoor security cameras I really like is the Blinx -- well designed, small, rugged and with a ONE YEAR battery life. But while this device streams a video feed to your smartphone, it cannot stream to the Spot.  A very frustrating and puzzling situation, especially as Amazon has purchased Blinx.  And apparently Blinx's battery saving streaming protocol isn't compatible with the Echo Spot's video streaming protocol. \n\nJudging the Spot as a clock, I really love the analog faces, especially the black and white one with the smoothly sweeping red second-hand; it reminds me of an expensive European wrist-watch. For me there's just something about an analog watch face with sweeping second hand to really give me a \"sense\" of the time, of where the day is at. Digital watch and clock faces, in my mind, will never replace the immediacy of glancing at an analog face.\n\nOther uses for my Spot so far? As an auxiliary speaker-phone using the Echo integration with my ATT account, just as I use my Dot in the kitchen and the bathroom to make occasional calls. Of course I use it for all my home automation tasks from turning on the room heater and fan to lighting it up with bright track lights.  I'm going to create a \"scene\" to turn the track lights on automatically with the alarm clock, which should help get me out of bed faster. And the four far-field microphones built into the top of Spot's case do a really great job, Alexa is much more response and immediate feeling than she was on my Echo Tap; perhaps this also has to do with the speed of the new hardware inside of the Spot. It just feels snappier and more responsive than most of my other Echo devices.\n\nWatching video has been a mixed experience. I pulled up some shows via Amazon Prime and the Spot seems ok for TV dramas where the focus is on close-ups of faces and on plot -- I wouldn't recommend the Spot for watching Game of Thrones or West World.  Its probably best for Downton Abbey and similar fare. The very highest video zoom level give a circular crop to whatever video you're watching which is a little strange at first, but for catching a drama before going to bed, it works well enough. Like my iPad, the Spot will never become my primary video viewing device, but its nice to have.  I only wish the YouTube integration remained, it was removed due to some political spat between Amazon and Google a few months ago. They've brought it back to the Echo Show, but not the Spot.  I use YouTube for everything, and the Spot would be a dream machine for many of my subscriptions, including guided video meditations, tech reviews, documentaries, and news headlines from CNN and MSNBC.  So I'm hoping they can remedy this situation and bring YouTube back, it will exponentially increase the value of my Spot to me, especially if Alexa allows me to play specific content channels I've subscribed to.\n\nSo in conclusion, the Spot is a wonderful clock, alarm, weather station, smart-home controller and speaker phone. Its very solid build and iconic design, well-designed analog clock faces, more than adequate built-in sound, fast responsive interface and bright screen make a classic in my mind, destined to be by my bedside for many years.  Video capabilities are currently Spot's achilles heal -- it has to improve its security camera integration, as that would be one of the perfect uses for a display thats by you when you might need it most, in the middle of the night, with a possible intruder. And of course if YouTube should make its return I will be in heaven.\n\nThe bottom line?  A little bit pricey still, but worth it as an investment in the future, as a return to the past, and an already useful and beautiful bedside and desktop companion. And after using my Spot for a week, my Echo Dots seem like primitive pucks, missing the style, functionality and additional features of its younger and more gifted brother. After all these years of missing the bedside alarm-clock, Amazon has finally brought them back better and more useful than ever with the Echo Spot.\n\n**TLDR; I love my Spot so far despite its limitations, and look forward to future upgrades**",
  "I've currently got a subscription to Amazon's Music Unlimited ($8 a month) but am tempted to switch to Spotify because of their [new bundle with Hulu](https://www.spotify.com/us/hulu/premium-intro/) for $13.00.  \n\nThe reason I'm posting the question is that all my research only turns up negative information about Spotify not working well through the Echo, but most all that info is old.\n\nHow is it *currently* working?

  "So as of April 2018, Amazon Echo in Canada does not support Households - associating multiple accounts to a single device, the options does not show up in either the Android App nor the web access (alexa.amazon.ca)\n\nHow do people in Canada get to share the Alexa shopping list across family members while having \"native\" shopping list integration (not having to \"alexa ask Whatever app to add Whatever Else\"? \n\nI tried adding Todoist (via Settings > Lists > Todoist > link), it works as long as you don't share the list with anyone else, if you share it sync breaks (it's a known limitation). It sucks. I tried all the other options in Settings > Lists : any.do, cozy etc require a paid recurrent subscription (??) or they show ads = they suck, no-go. AnyList: didn't launch in Canada = ditto.\n\nThe only option I can think of is creating an ad-hoc gmail account and Alexa account for the Echo, and then add the Alexa app with that ad-hoc account to every household member.  When doing that, at least every household member can setup a different voice profile, so certain profile items are kept separate. The downside is that the amazon app is awkward to use and clunky.\n\nAny better way to do this? - suggestions?\n",

  "I've had my Echos for a little over a year, and have been pretty happy with them.  But you know how these things work.  The mind wanders and wants to know if the grass is greener on the other side.\n\nSo I drove to Walmart and bought a Google Home Mini, while they were on sale for $29.99 and thought I would post some quick observations after 24 hours of ownership.  I will list the features I have used and that I feel are important to me.\n\n**Calendar**\n\nGoogle will only read your PRIMARY Google Calendar.  If you have created multiple calendars for yourself (in my case I have a Bills Calendar, and a Calendar for my son's Boy Scout troop), you can enable those, but only through an Android device.  Since we mostly use iPhones in my house, I had to turn around and use my Android tablet to add the extra calendars.\n\nGoogle Home ONLY uses Google Calendars.  I do use the iCloud Family Calendar, and the Home can't see it.  And it can't see any calendars you're subscribed to.\n\nAnd lastly - All Day Events.  Google Home treats all day events like an 12:00AM-12:00AM event.  Once it gets past midnight, the event is no longer tracked by Google Home, so when I ask it my agenda for today, it will never give me my all day events.\n\n**Shopping List**\n\nThe shopping list is pretty much the same as the one on the Echo.  It's bare bones, but it gets the job done.  And it's available on the web.\n\n**News**\n\nThere is an adequate amount of news sources available, but nothing local.  The Echo has plenty of news sources that are from my local TV and radio stations.  This is lacking in Google Home.\n\n**Music**\n\nI have a Google Play Music subscription, and I totally blown away and how well Google Home works with it.  You ask it to play a song and it finds it.  If it's not available on Google Play, it will find it on YouTube and play it from there.  I can also cast.  So, I can say \"Hey Google, play Father Christmas on Basement Stereo\" and it will play on my basement speakers.  Very impressive.  I don't have an Amazon Music subscription, but I do use Amazon Music locker.  And the Amazon Music app is just horrid for uploading music.\n\n**Speaker Quality**\n\nThough neither speaker will win any awards in this size form factor (Echo Dot vs Home Mini), I think the Home Mini has a better sounding speaker.\n\n**Looks and controls**\n\nThe Home Mini looks nicer than the Echo Dot does.  It has a fabric cover and rounded edges.  BUT, the look comes at a loss of convenience.  The mute switch is on the back of the unit, making it pretty useless as a speakerphone.  And volume controls are hidden under the fabric and touch controls.  I find myself adjusting the volume any time I touch the thing.\n\nThe thing also lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack or the ability to pair with Bluetooth speakers.  If you want to listen to music with a better sounding speaker, you'll need a Chromecast.\n\n**Apps/Skills**\n\nIt doesn't appear that the Google Home has any \"skills\" you can install, the way the Echo does. I think services just become avaialable as they're added.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions about the two devices.",
  "We have a single echo dot in our house. It's the holiday season so I added my personal amazon account to my wife's household (hers is the one we mainly use) so I could use Prime and not have her see what im ordering. \n\nAfter we did this, Alexa would not play any music in our library or from our amazon unlimited subscription.  I could not figure out what the heck the problem was and ended up decoupling my household so we could get music to work again. \n\nAm I just stupid or what? How can I keep my household up and my amazon music streaming?",

  "So I have been trying over the last few days to access the New Prime Music... but haven't been able to access it, however I figured it was either my content settings & country re: having echo set up ... or it was my VPN.\n\nSo yesterday I went in and changed my content settings to Canada, and transferred my digital content etc...   Still no joy.\n\nThis morning I killed the VPN... still no joy.\n\nContacted Amazon support ... after checking my content settings they confirmed that this is an issue they are working .. they didn't specify what the problem is.    \n\nBut my guess is that, since it appears the music service is hosted on .com, it is having a hard time recognizing Canadian Prime subscriptions... possibly compounded when the user ID also has .com accounts that are non-prime.\n\nCurious if anyone else has had success or experienced the same?",
  "Else I have no clue about all the music I like unless I ditch the echo subscription to music and go back to using only my desktop so that I can play stations and add tracks to my favourites playlist, which defunks the entire point of having a nice sounding amazon echo to play music on if I end up only doing music on my PC.",

It started playing music from amazon music somewhere which surprised me as I don't have prime and I'm not an amazon music subscriber.\n\nAny ideas what's going on?  From looking online it all seems to be paid subscription services so not sure how it managed to start playing - or is there a free service?\n\nAlso if you upload your own music to amazon can you then play that though the dot?\n\nThanks",
  "Hi! I recently received an Echo Dot as a gift, and I have a couple issues with it that general googling and speaking to support have been unable to fix.\n\n1) My Echo Dot was a gift as I mentioned, so my dad ordered it on his Amazon account. When it arrived it was named \"Dad's_Name Echo Dot 2\" until I set it up with my account. However, I still get notifications for when his orders ship/arrive, and do not get notifications for mine. This is a minor annoyance now, but come holiday time when he's ordering gifts could become a big issue. Amazon support's suggestion was just to turn off all notifications which I would prefer not to do if possible, since all notifications other than my dad's orders are useful to me.\n\n2) I also set up my Dot with Spotify. When I tell it to play a song though, it usually tells me I have to pay for Amazon Unlimited Music or that the song is not in my Spotify library. The only way it works is if I start a playlist on my phone and then say \"Alexa, continue/resume Spotify.\" My friend has a Dot as well, I believe an older model, and doesn't have any issues with it using Spotify as the main source of music when he tells it to play something. Did I make a mistake in setup somewhere, or is the newer model just designed to push an Amazon Music subscription?\n\nI apologize if these questions have been asked before, reddit search function isn't amazing and I've been having a lot of trouble finding answers anywhere. Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!",

  "I have an echo dot right now and was wondering if there's a workaround to stream music from google play through it. Paying for a single plan on one device and I already have a google play subscription. Maybe I should just get a google home. ",
  "When I and i'm sure many others signed up for the music unlimited plan it was under the \"old plan\" (before yesterday} which allowed multiple streams to our Echo devices.  Beginning yesterday it appears to be limited to a single stream with a message coming up when you attempt a second stream.   I consider this somewhat of a Bait and Switch scheme and we should push back at Amazon on this.\nupdate:\nFrom Amazon site:\n\"Amazon Music Unlimited is a premium music subscription service featuring tens of millions of songs and thousands of expert-programmed playlists and stations.

  "So here's a strange thing. I have one Echo and two Dots linked to my Amazon account and I have a full Amazon Unlimited subscription (ie. all devices). I've added various music to my Amazon music library. On my computer when I go to the Alexa website (layla.amazon.co.uk) > Music, Video & Books > My Music Library there is a drop-down for my 3 Echo devices and a search box. Here's where it gets weird.\n\nIf I select my first Echo device from the drop-down and start to type in the search box, I get results matching the characters I typed. But if I select my second or third Echo device and do the same search, I get different search results. The results for the first device seem to be complete, the results for the second and third devices are incomplete.\n\nFor example: I select my first Echo and type \"mo\" in the search box. I get matches on 16 artists, 21 albums, 722 songs. Now I select another Echo and type \"mo\". I get matches on 1 artist, 2 albums, 53 songs.

  "I bought an echo studio back in October 2020 and it has been an amazing purchase for the years I have had it.

I'm subscribed to Music Unlimited and this seems to have only started happening in the last month or two (if I play music on a single device only, it works just fine btw).\n\nFor info, all the devices are on the same 5GHz network, a firmware check on each also tells me they're up to date.  I've used a WiFi analyser app to check if there's any signal contention with nearby networks and there is none, I've also measured signal strength at each of the devices and in all cases it shows as strong to excellent.  Also, I'm on a 200mbps internet connection.\n\nThere are a few troubleshooting articles I've seen online suggesting deleting the multi-room group, then unplugging every Alexa device, then unplug the router, leave it all for a few minutes, power up the router and leave it for a few more minutes for the network to come back up, plug all the Alexas back in and create a new multi-room group after re-scanning and ensuring they're all back on the same network...  Doesn't fix a thing.\n\nI've even tried going into the Music Unlimited Android app and set my streaming preferences to \"Standard\" instead of \"Best Available\" and that doesn't solve the issue either.  I could try switching to Spotify, but as I've paid for a year's music unlimited already, I'm not keen to try it only to find its an issue with the Alexas themselves (possibly due to one of their firmware update).  \n\nI'd also rather not go through the hassle of factory re-setting each one only to find that doesn't work either but I guess I may have to just to eliminate it as a variable.",
  "My experience has been that using speaker groups (and after rebooting routers and all the Echo Dots in the house per Amazon's recommendation), the least reliable streaming service is the premium Amazon HD service I pay for.\n\nIndividual speakers will drop off, and occasionally come back, sometimes not. Sometimes I get the whole pause in the middle of a song, and then it will pick up moments later, sometimes in the middle of the song or on the next in the playlist.  All scenarios that I bet most here are familiar with.\n\nSame speaker group, I can stream my free Pandora stations, i\u2764radio, TuneIn, as well as subscribed XM Radio and Apple music uninterrupted for hours.\n\nI can imagine in my head that the Amazon Music is being too cleaver by half in the background because of the limitation of six continuous streams, so it's testing things regularly and interrupting the stream or serving a new stream URL to make sure everything is honest.  I've tried just streaming to 2 or 3 instead of 4 or 5 speakers in a group and that doesn't help.  \\*Most\\* of the time streaming to a single speaker anywhere in the house will stream uninterrupted.\n\nI'll probably keep the music service because I like the Ultra-HD lossless playback.  I certainly won't keep it because it's the most reliable stream on their very own speakers! \ud83e\udd23",

  " OK, I this will probably be of interest to only 1% of 1% of you...\n\nI'm an Amazon Music subscriber, and use it often to listen to any song I want whenever I want when at home. \u00a0My old vehicle (2011) did not have CarPlay and had really bad Bluetooth support, so I bought an Echo Auto to use Amazon music and Alexa in my car. \u00a0The Echo Auto connects to my iPhone via Bluetooth and then uses the aux jack to send audio to the car. \n\nI like using CarPlay in my new vehicle, but if connected there is no hands-free way to summon Alexa; I would have to open the Alexa app on my phone and keep it open, and would be unable to use other CarPlay features. \u00a0I could not find any way to summon Alexa without hitting a button.\n\nYesterday I was using my old vehicle and my Echo Auto wasn't working properly. \u00a0It could hear my voice, but all of the audio responses and music came out of my iPhone, not out of the car's speakers. \u00a0It turns out I had accidentally pulled the audio cable out of the Echo Auto, so it was effectively only working as a Bluetooth microphone. \u00a0This gave me an idea...\n\nI went back to the new vehicle, and plugged in my Echo Auto to a USB port, nothing connected to the audio-out of the Echo Auto, and iPhone connected to it via Bluetooth. \u00a0Then I plugged my iPhone in to CarPlay via USB. \u00a0CarPlay works as normal. \u00a0But now I can just say \"Alexa, what's the weather today?\" and it will respond and play over the car's speakers.\n\nCarPlay works. \u00a0Alexa/Echo works. \u00a0Happy now.",

  "The premise of being able to play music from a specific year is intriguing. Sadly, Amazon's results are absurdly inaccurate; even when subscribed to Music Unlimited.\n\nSince the advent of search engines, we've become accustomed  to the availability of correct information *(setting aside the rigged rankings)*. I expected Amazon to be as reliable as Google given they are selling a music service and should be able to easily determine the date of a song's popularity.\n\nUnfortunately, one would get better results asking the village idiot. Is it that Amazon doesn't consider music accuracy for anything released before their launch in 1995 as important? Here's a clue: Elvis Presley's *Fool Such A I* was not a hit in 1952 nor did Hank William's **Jr** hit the charts as a three year old.  One would think Amazon research could have told them people have a powerful emotional connection to the music of their life. Not respecting customer's enough to get that right can cause questions about Amazon integrity.",
  "[TLDR: Announcements are disabled on my echo dot, but I keep getting subscribe and save shipping notifications.]\n\n\nHi Redditors. I have a question that I hope you can help me with.  Here's what's going on:\n\n-i have an Amazon account and my benefits are shared with my wife through Amazon household.\n\n-we have an echo dot by the bed.\n\n-i have the Alexa app on my phone and I have disabled announcements on the echo dot.\n\n-i don't seem to get any announcements except that every time my wife has a subscribe and save item that's about to ship the Alexa chimes and turns orange. When you ask her what the notification is she says a subscribe and save item is shipping soon.  This often wakes me up when it happens (it seems to happen early in the mornings on weekends).\n\n-Sometimes, right after it happens, I\u2019ll ask the echo to stop notifying me about subscribe and save notifications and she tells me that that feature is not supported.\n\n-I would imagine that others also use their echo devices next to the bed.  Is there not a way to turn these notifications off?  Does my wife also need to install the Alexa app on her phone and do something? Or does she need to do something in her amazon account?\n\nThanks so much for your help!",

It shows up as a device and I even figured out how to add it to my room, but if I say \"Alexa, turn on CaviaBella's TV!\" It says there's no device found. Is there another step to set this up that I'm just missing? I know this probably isn't enough information to offer much help. But I figured I'd ask anyway. (Edit: \"Turn TV on with Alexa\" is turned on in the TV's settings!) \n\nSecond question: If I ask Alexa to play a song that isn't available she'll tell me to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited. She says it's free for 30 days and then $3.99 a month after that. I went to subscribe online and it cost $7.99 a month. That's twice the price! If I ask Alexa how much it costs she says $7.99. I feel weird subscribing to something via my voice. I don't want to charge it to the wrong card and I want to make sure it's actually $3.99 and not $7.99. Is that offer not available on Amazon's website or app? Does she just get the price wrong when I ask for a song that isn't available?\n\nBonus question: What are some things I should know/try? I've already asked who let the dogs out and who the real slim shady is. What about more useful tips?\n\nThanks in advance!",

  "So I\u2019m currently debating whether to get the echo show 8. It\u2019s currently on sale. I think the sale will end today so I don\u2019t have long to decide. I\u2019m a prime subscriber and already have 3 echo devices which I use. I also have a kindle fire HD 8 with the show mode dock. I like the fire HD 8 in show mode but the dock doesn\u2019t always work it often stops showing show mode. These past few days I\u2019ve been so impressed with the echo. My husband\u2019s phone is damaged and he\u2019s sent if off to be repaired. He refuses to buy a cheap phone to use in the meantime.  So we\u2019ve been communicating using our echos as it can be used to make calls. Also when I was at work this weekend I was able to drop in to the echos and keep in contact with my husband and kids. It got me thinking that it would be nice to use the drop in feature on the echo show 8 when I\u2019m at work and my husband is at home and be able to see my kids. I know we could use FaceTime or google duo but I like the idea of a stationary device. \n\nI also got an iPad mini on Black Friday so I think I\u2019ll just pass my kindle fire to my youngest child who doesn\u2019t have a tablet yet but is constantly trying to get his older brother\u2019s tablet. \n\nSo I just wanted to know if there were any noticeable differences between an echo show and a fire HD tablet in show mode.",

  "Got it a few days ago, here's my view of it.  It's installed in a 2014 Subaru Forester and hooked into the radio by Bluetooth. I appreciate it has a nice low profile and that it is pretty unobtrusive.  My phone is an older (2 year old) Android and I haven't had any problems with everything connecting up when I get in the car (phone, Echo and radio unit).  \n\nUp to a few months ago I was a Sirius subscriber with the full package in the car, but when I renewed I dropped it back to the streaming package only. I listen to Sirius on my daily commute, but it was annoying if I wanted to swap stations as i had to wake the phone and then fumble around in the Sirius app to find the station I wanted. I hate using the phone when I'm driving so I had to wait for a stop light before doing that.  Now I can just say \"Alexa, play the Beatles channel on Sirius XM\" and it changes.  Definite Pro.\n\nNext thing, I drive to work with my wife most days, if she says we need to stop at the grocery store on the way home we can add items to our shopping list when we're talking about them in the car without needing to pull out a phone or rely on our failing memories. Another good point.\n\nGas Buddy.  Great skill and gives us detailed information about where we can get gas for the best price in the area.  Again all just by voice. \n\nIf I want to text my wife to let her know I am on my way to her office to pick her up, Echo Auto will do this all for me again just by voice. Previously I had to wake the phone, access Google Assistant from the home screen and then send the text by voice.  The less I have to take my eyes off the road, the happier I am.\n\nHaven't tried the map or find a place function yet, but will try that over the weekend.\n\nAll in all, for $25 I am very pleased with it for the reasons above. I haven't lost signal or had any issues at all with it in the two days I have been using it.  It would be great if it could be hardwired into the electrics so I don't have to think about wires from the dashboard to the power outlet, but I am not a handy person when it comes to stuff like that - anyone have any ideas or a simple solution to that?\n\nAgain, anything that allows me to do everything just by voice is a winner in my book - and the phone on its own wasn't the right answer as it always meant having to do something on the screen. Now, I don't even have to stick my phone in the holder, it can just stay in my pocket out of the way.  $25 well spent in my opinion.",

I whip open my Hue app to find it pending an update and I think to myself must be a required update so I hit continue and go about my business. Thirty minutes or so later I figure everything should be good so I ask Alexa again to turn raise the dim of the office lights to 75%. She responds again that they are not responding still. Sure enough in the app they're still listed as (offline). I say fuck it. Head into office and figure things will work when I get home. After getting home things still didn't work. So I wipe everything. All Hue components from Alexa. Disable and delink the skill. Wait 20 mins and when I tried to re enable the skill it wouldn't work. Looking at the Hue site and it couldn't see my bridge. Turns out on the URL lists I subscribe to for my Pi-Hole had started blocking the Hue control URL.

I tried different variations of this, but at least 1) and 3) seems to be unsolvable to me, and 2) needs me explicitly asking to shuffle every time.

  "I pulled the trigger and replaced my Echo Show, and 4 Echo Dots with 1 Google Home Hub, 1 Google Home, and 3 Google Home Minis.\n\nI have been a Google Music subscriber since day one and have never been able to use that on any of my Alexa devices. Since I am married to Android and Google anyway, I thought it might be time to move my smart home devices over.\n\nTwo, maybe three downsides I have noticed so far.\n\n1. Google Home Hub does not integrate with Ring, so it can't show me my cameras. Same for my Amazon Cloud Cams.\n2. Google Home Hub bass is nowhere near as good as the Show.\n3. No Drop-In. You can \"Broadcast\" to all of your devices from outside your network, but that is just a one-way message to any device in your home, no intercom like with Alexa.\n\nBeen a day and a half now, will see how things progress.",
  "Just wondering if anyone has successfully integrated Google Fiber TV with the Fire Cube. It was disappointing that there isn't any out of the box support so I have to use two remote and can't use voice commands other than to switch to the right hdmi input. I've asked in the official support forum but no dates or even a hint at adding support. I suppose it is due to the low subscriber base of google fiber tv. Anyway, just looking for ways to better integrate the two, if not, no worries and I just keep using the old fashioned remote. Thanks for readinng.",
  "Ever since YouTube support was cut, we've exclusively used Prime Video. But the experience is horrible.  \n\nYou can't set a default video service, so you have to specify \"Prime Video\" or it'll offer up purchase options EVEN THOUGH THE VIDEO IS FREE and we're Prime subscribers.\n\nSay Amazon Video and it has no idea what you're talking about. \n\nYou can say \"Next Episode\" but not Previous. So when you get to the end of a season you're stuck. \n\nEven if you know what you're searching for, Alexa will say that she can't find it.  \"Alexa, play Baby Shark on Prime Video\" and it'll say \"There are no results for Pink Fong: Baby Shark Special\".  Well your reply has more detail than my query, so how do you not know what I'm searching for?\n\nBut, if ask for a list of Baby Videos (on Prime Video!) and scroll down to item #12, the video is right there.\n\nBut I'm stuck on the last episode of the season. \n\nI hate it.

  "Hello all,  \n  \nI've had 3 Echos now for about a month, and I can't quite figure it all out. I have the Amazon Family membership, with my wife and kids set up with their own accounts.

I just subscribed to this sub and I'll try to learn as much as I can about this product.",
  "Is it just me or is this an exorbitant price for a reskinned echo Dot? Yes you get a \"free subscription\" to Freetime for a limited period when in reality, it's just amping up the price. Plus, this feature can be added to any Echo if you choose to subscribe.\n\nWhat really has me annoyed is this: Being able to filter out explicit songs should ALREADY be a native feature on all Echo products. Just because it's my Echo and not my kids doesn't mean my kid can't come in at any time and listen to explicit songs while I'm away and it could be a complete accident. In fact it has been on at least one occasion. (My four year old asked Alexa to play some song about unicorns or something and a punk song with an ironic title and lots of F Bombs played instead). \n\nWhile Amazon reserves the right to withhold features, Id say it's in their best interest to allow content filtering on all devices at no extra charge. After all, they ready censor Alexa's speach to prevent expletives, they should allow the same for music.\n\nUpdate: Just learned that the \"Freetime\" settings in the Alexa app are free to use on all Echo dots including filtering out explicit songs BUT WITH A MAJOR DOWNSIDE in that smarthome control is disabled when you use it. As I use my Echos for smart home control more than anything, this would render my Echos pretty useless. Keep working on it Amazon!\n\nUpdate2: Ah ha! Explicit filters are doable without Freetime. Settings, scroll past all named devices till you get to Music & Media under \"Alexa Preferences\". Then scroll past all services until you see Explicit Filter under \"Account Settings\". Sadly, this still deactivates third party services I like to use such as TuneIn Radio but it's definitely the best option so far. Thank you u/GeneralRane.\n\nUpdate3: This filter doesn't work at all. It is switched on but is not blocking anything I test. (Sigh)",
  "My friend gave me a dot and the only thing I ever want it to do is play a bit of the Seinfeld theme when I get to my house. I used IFTTT to get this to work. When my phone connects to the echo via Bluetooth it then plays the track via VLC on my phone. That's fine but before playing the track the echo announces that my Bluetooth is connected. That is a deal breaker.\n\nCreating a new IFTTT applet that triggers the song based on location instead of Bluetooth would work but the only way to get a song to play via echo without a Bluetooth connection to my phone is through a music subscription to Spotify, Amazon music, etc. and I'm morally opposed to doing that for one track.\n\nI have found other people complaining that they want to get rid of the Bluetooth connection announcement but after years of users wanting this, Amazon still hasn't fixed it.\n\nAny workarounds that y'all can think of? Thank you!\n\nUPDATE: So I can play a song directly from \"my library\" on Amazon. However, none of the tracks in the Amazon store are the 11 second clip that I want and have. Only subscribers can upload music to their library so I started a free membership so that I can upload my track. From there I should be able to trigger it based on when I arrive at my home location.\n\nUPDATE UPDATE: It looks like when they say \"you must be a paid Amazon Music Storage subscriber\" they really mean it. I'm going to make sure I can play a song from my library by using IFTTT before actually paying for it so that I can upload the track.\n\nUPDATE UPDATE UPDATE: There is no way to upload music to Amazon.

  "With an Echo dot in my kitchen, bathroom and bedroom I had a really hard time justifying the purchase of an Echo Spot even though I was in love with its bold, round design since the moment I saw it. \n\nAs a kid growing up in the 80's, alarm-clocks were a \"thing\" and I was always so excited to get the newest AM/FM unit with bright LED display, and one time I waited until Christmas in anticipation of a General Electric model with a special speaker built into the base, giving it pretty good sound for its era. Then one day we had a storm in the neighborhood and lightening hit a nearby transformer; my fancy and expensive new alarm clock was toast and the power company refused to replace it because they deemed it \"an act of God.\"  \n\nSo flash-forward to the past 10-years or so and with cellphones with their built-in clocks, sadly the bedside alarm-clock/radio has become a thing of the past. Though they still sell them, why would anyone want to listen to AM/FM radio anymore when there's an entire universe of Podcasts, internet stations and audiobooks?\n\nSo a couple weeks ago my friend mentioned he wanted a portable device for his daughter so she could listen to podcasts, and I immediately offered to give him the Echo Tap in my bedroom.  I've enjoyed my Tap, but the battery was starting to grow weak, and honestly, it really wasn't responding well to the Alexa keyword anymore. But its biggest sin of omission is a lack of hard-wired stereo output -- the Tap only has stereo input, so you could use it as a speaker for other devices. And when using this input, the Alexa voice recognition on the Tap doesn't work. These two design flaws (in my mind) were good enough reason to toss it, and finally get my own Spot.\n\nI was disappointed to have missed Amazon's recent discounted price so had to buy my Spot for a full $129, and including tax and shipping, it cost $140 -- an indulgence in my book for something I absolutely didn't HAVE to have.\n\nI purchased the white edition Spot and its even better looking in real life than in pictures. Solid feeling, heavy, substantial, nice materials, dare I even say it -- a classic?  I can see this unit sitting proudly by my bed for years and years. And hopefully with continued software upgrades and the always growing cloud-based Echo skillset, it will be the \"last\" alarm-clock bedside device I ever need.\n\nAfter unpacking it, I attached it to my rocking KRK studio-monitor speakers using a special 3.5\" stereo to XLR speaker adaptors I purchased on Amazon.  The KRK's other stereo inputs were already in use by my computer -- now my Spot, through the XLR connector, feeds into the studio monitors independently. The advantage? I don't even need my computer on to enjoy the full universe of Alexa's content, and in fact when playing Spotify for example, I can request a weather report from the Spot and it's delivered mixed right along with the music.\n\nThe sound?  Incredible. My KRK speakers are awesome and the mini-stereo-to-XLR connection is better than I could have even imagined.  I was a bit worried as my Echo Dots have had very poor stereo output via their 3.5 millimeter jacks.  To my surprise the hard-wired output of the Spot sounds as good as any stereo device I've ever had.\n\nMy biggest use during the day has been to ask it to play various radio stations I love, usually Los Angeles-based KCRW which always features great NPR broadcasts and shows as well as a great music line-up at night. I also frequently call up WNYU to get my East-coast fix, or KPFK to get my out-there left-wing news, spiritual and alternative health programming. The feeling of having every FM-radio station available by voice command is awesome and is SO much less tedious than trying to find internet feeds on my desktop computer or using iTunes hideously antiquated streaming-radio interface. In my experience I find any device or service that becomes voice controlled starts to feel like \"magic\" and I end up using it more often. \n\nI love the way the Spot's clock display goes \"nighttime red\" similar to BMW interior lighting, at the hour you specify. Subconsciously it signals to me \"time to crawl in bed and listen to a podcast\" which is what I've been doing.  Usually I say, \"Alexa, play Fresh Air\" or \"Play The Talk Show Podcast\" as I enjoy the sound of human voices before bed or when I wake up and can't sleep. That and \"Science Friday\" and I've started listening to \"The Moth\" again. The bottom line is having Podcasts readily and easily available at my bedside, right at the time I want to hear them, has really enhanced that time of the day for me. And I'm re-discovering the pleasures of listening to Podcasts again.\n\nWhen I wake to my Spot alarm, first thing I do is ask what the weather is going to be.  And I enjoy having the Spot's screen mirror what Alexa is saying on-screen -- I can see a few days high and low temps at a glance, and it feels much quicker than just listening to her describe the weather.\n\nA big frustration is not being able to integrate my Samsung SmartHome camera into the Spot. The current Alexa skill only gives control of panning and tilting of Samsung cameras and does NOT provide a video feed. I can't image why this skill even exists, a video skill providing no video feed on a video-capable device?  Suffice to say, there is NO way to currently access many common security camera video feeds on your Spot, and that was one of my primary interests in getting it -- I want to see who is at my front door.\n\nI have looked into other solutions, and one of the outdoor security cameras I really like is the Blinx -- well designed, small, rugged and with a ONE YEAR battery life. But while this device streams a video feed to your smartphone, it cannot stream to the Spot.  A very frustrating and puzzling situation, especially as Amazon has purchased Blinx.  And apparently Blinx's battery saving streaming protocol isn't compatible with the Echo Spot's video streaming protocol. \n\nJudging the Spot as a clock, I really love the analog faces, especially the black and white one with the smoothly sweeping red second-hand; it reminds me of an expensive European wrist-watch. For me there's just something about an analog watch face with sweeping second hand to really give me a \"sense\" of the time, of where the day is at. Digital watch and clock faces, in my mind, will never replace the immediacy of glancing at an analog face.\n\nOther uses for my Spot so far? As an auxiliary speaker-phone using the Echo integration with my ATT account, just as I use my Dot in the kitchen and the bathroom to make occasional calls. Of course I use it for all my home automation tasks from turning on the room heater and fan to lighting it up with bright track lights.  I'm going to create a \"scene\" to turn the track lights on automatically with the alarm clock, which should help get me out of bed faster. And the four far-field microphones built into the top of Spot's case do a really great job, Alexa is much more response and immediate feeling than she was on my Echo Tap; perhaps this also has to do with the speed of the new hardware inside of the Spot. It just feels snappier and more responsive than most of my other Echo devices.\n\nWatching video has been a mixed experience. I pulled up some shows via Amazon Prime and the Spot seems ok for TV dramas where the focus is on close-ups of faces and on plot -- I wouldn't recommend the Spot for watching Game of Thrones or West World.  Its probably best for Downton Abbey and similar fare. The very highest video zoom level give a circular crop to whatever video you're watching which is a little strange at first, but for catching a drama before going to bed, it works well enough. Like my iPad, the Spot will never become my primary video viewing device, but its nice to have.  I only wish the YouTube integration remained, it was removed due to some political spat between Amazon and Google a few months ago. They've brought it back to the Echo Show, but not the Spot.  I use YouTube for everything, and the Spot would be a dream machine for many of my subscriptions, including guided video meditations, tech reviews, documentaries, and news headlines from CNN and MSNBC.  So I'm hoping they can remedy this situation and bring YouTube back, it will exponentially increase the value of my Spot to me, especially if Alexa allows me to play specific content channels I've subscribed to.\n\nSo in conclusion, the Spot is a wonderful clock, alarm, weather station, smart-home controller and speaker phone. Its very solid build and iconic design, well-designed analog clock faces, more than adequate built-in sound, fast responsive interface and bright screen make a classic in my mind, destined to be by my bedside for many years.  Video capabilities are currently Spot's achilles heal -- it has to improve its security camera integration, as that would be one of the perfect uses for a display thats by you when you might need it most, in the middle of the night, with a possible intruder. And of course if YouTube should make its return I will be in heaven.\n\nThe bottom line?  A little bit pricey still, but worth it as an investment in the future, as a return to the past, and an already useful and beautiful bedside and desktop companion. And after using my Spot for a week, my Echo Dots seem like primitive pucks, missing the style, functionality and additional features of its younger and more gifted brother. After all these years of missing the bedside alarm-clock, Amazon has finally brought them back better and more useful than ever with the Echo Spot.\n\n**TLDR; I love my Spot so far despite its limitations, and look forward to future upgrades**",

  "Just a heads up: if you subscribe to Amazon's paid \"250,000 Song Storage Plan\" BEFORE January 15 (which is in 7 days) you will be grandfathered in for 2018 and beyond.

  "This seems silly to ask, but was it ever possible to have Alexa read from subscribed calendars in iCloud?

  "I've had my Echos for a little over a year, and have been pretty happy with them.  But you know how these things work.  The mind wanders and wants to know if the grass is greener on the other side.\n\nSo I drove to Walmart and bought a Google Home Mini, while they were on sale for $29.99 and thought I would post some quick observations after 24 hours of ownership.  I will list the features I have used and that I feel are important to me.\n\n**Calendar**\n\nGoogle will only read your PRIMARY Google Calendar.  If you have created multiple calendars for yourself (in my case I have a Bills Calendar, and a Calendar for my son's Boy Scout troop), you can enable those, but only through an Android device.  Since we mostly use iPhones in my house, I had to turn around and use my Android tablet to add the extra calendars.\n\nGoogle Home ONLY uses Google Calendars.  I do use the iCloud Family Calendar, and the Home can't see it.  And it can't see any calendars you're subscribed to.\n\nAnd lastly - All Day Events.  Google Home treats all day events like an 12:00AM-12:00AM event.  Once it gets past midnight, the event is no longer tracked by Google Home, so when I ask it my agenda for today, it will never give me my all day events.\n\n**Shopping List**\n\nThe shopping list is pretty much the same as the one on the Echo.  It's bare bones, but it gets the job done.  And it's available on the web.\n\n**News**\n\nThere is an adequate amount of news sources available, but nothing local.  The Echo has plenty of news sources that are from my local TV and radio stations.  This is lacking in Google Home.\n\n**Music**\n\nI have a Google Play Music subscription, and I totally blown away and how well Google Home works with it.  You ask it to play a song and it finds it.  If it's not available on Google Play, it will find it on YouTube and play it from there.  I can also cast.  So, I can say \"Hey Google, play Father Christmas on Basement Stereo\" and it will play on my basement speakers.  Very impressive.  I don't have an Amazon Music subscription, but I do use Amazon Music locker.  And the Amazon Music app is just horrid for uploading music.\n\n**Speaker Quality**\n\nThough neither speaker will win any awards in this size form factor (Echo Dot vs Home Mini), I think the Home Mini has a better sounding speaker.\n\n**Looks and controls**\n\nThe Home Mini looks nicer than the Echo Dot does.  It has a fabric cover and rounded edges.  BUT, the look comes at a loss of convenience.  The mute switch is on the back of the unit, making it pretty useless as a speakerphone.  And volume controls are hidden under the fabric and touch controls.  I find myself adjusting the volume any time I touch the thing.\n\nThe thing also lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack or the ability to pair with Bluetooth speakers.  If you want to listen to music with a better sounding speaker, you'll need a Chromecast.\n\n**Apps/Skills**\n\nIt doesn't appear that the Google Home has any \"skills\" you can install, the way the Echo does. I think services just become avaialable as they're added.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions about the two devices.",

Wondering if you can help me out?\n\nCoinciding with the Canadian launch of Alexa in Canada in 1 week (Dec 5), I am launching a brand new podcast, Alexa in Canada: The Voice Experience.\nI will be documenting my journey of using Alexa to hopefully improve my life and make it more organized, stress-free, and more fun! :) I would love to get your feedback on the podcast when it comes out. (I'll also be giving away a Dot to one of the early subscribers.)\nAnyway, my question:\n--> What topics would you like to see on this type of podcast?\nReally appreciate it and all of the great discussion in this group! :)",

  "So I have been trying over the last few days to access the New Prime Music... but haven't been able to access it, however I figured it was either my content settings & country re: having echo set up ... or it was my VPN.\n\nSo yesterday I went in and changed my content settings to Canada, and transferred my digital content etc...   Still no joy.\n\nThis morning I killed the VPN... still no joy.\n\nContacted Amazon support ... after checking my content settings they confirmed that this is an issue they are working .. they didn't specify what the problem is.    \n\nBut my guess is that, since it appears the music service is hosted on .com, it is having a hard time recognizing Canadian Prime subscriptions... possibly compounded when the user ID also has .com accounts that are non-prime.\n\nCurious if anyone else has had success or experienced the same?",
  "Hi, can someone with an Amazon Music Unlimited\u200e account help me? I'm trying to understand what is the size of the catalog. Can someone tell me how many Gojira albums are available? Music Prime only has two and I have no way to understand if some of them are locked behind the Unlimited paid gate without subscribing. Thanks :)",
  "Hi\n\nIf you have 2 or more devices and you get the Echo Music Unlimited Plan on 1 device can you then switch the device for the plan later or do you have to cancel on current device and subscribe on second device?\n\nThanks!",
  "I've just bought a dot and while experimenting I tried to get it to play some music.  It started playing music from amazon music somewhere which surprised me as I don't have prime and I'm not an amazon music subscriber.\n\nAny ideas what's going on?  From looking online it all seems to be paid subscription services so not sure how it managed to start playing - or is there a free service?\n\nAlso if you upload your own music to amazon can you then play that though the dot?\n\nThanks",
  "I am now able to play whatever song I want on Pandora, a feature that used to only being to spotify.\n\nI actually subscribed to spotify for this feature, but I prefer Pandora for the way it's interface works with stations I create, and now it has that very important feature it was missing.\n\nSadly, I still can't get echo to play any specific song on Pandora, it just asks if I would like to add a new station based on the song I want played.\n\nAnyone know if echo will be able to interface with this feature on Pandora premium?",
  "So I decided to pick up a few Vobot for the kids rooms.\n\nWe have had Alexa since day one and even had to deal with meltdowns when they thought we were replacing her with a Google Home.\n\nSo I was excited to see an alarm clock/echo device all packaged up.  Kids could listen to their Spotify and have alarms for school.\n\nSadly, hype is there, execution is lacking.\n\nFew things:\n\n1.  No Spotify.  I appreciate the website does not say it can stream  spotify, however, it does not say otherwise as well.  Given it is an 'Clock with Alexa' infers Alexa's capabilities.  \n\n\n2.  Alarms are a major PIA.  Setting up one for tomorrow, easy.  Setting up a reoccurring alarm....  you setup a single alarm first, then go into the Alexa App, change it to weekly (or whatever) then don't forget to cancel the original alarm you setup as a placeholder.\n\n\n3.  Setup was a pain.  Took a while to get on my wireless, had to put in my amazon credentials twice, required a reboot before a firmware update (it did not this in the app, but still).\n\n\nAll told, 20 minutes per device to get it up and running.\n\nNow, unless I decided to subscribe to Prime Unlimited (which I cannot, since I am in Canada) my three devices cannot play music at the same time, unless they choose TuneIn (which btw you cannot select genres).\n\nSo all told, it feels half baked at best.\n\nAlso, in the myvobot website to register, you cannot rename your Vobot.  They are VBOT-MACADDRESS.  Which is great until I need to know which one of the three I have.\n\nI would have been better served to get an Echo and the idevice echo alarm clock instead.\n\nThey do update firmware's often, so here's hoping some of the shortcomings, ESPECIALLY Spotify can be resolved in short order.\n\n..and if they can make Spotify playing part of the alarm function, I would be extremely happy.\n\nSo just be careful of what you are getting into",
  "Is there a way to use the show to show your subscribed videos/channels to pick from?\n\nI'm not really interested in a random cat video\n\nTry \"Echo, show a cat video\"",
  "Good morning everyone,\n\nYou may have noticed that /r/AmazonEcho got a bit of a facelift this morning.

Is there a way to really have these devices separate, or not really? She\u2019s using the secondary account added to my household. ",
  "Hi guys! I'm a big audiobook lover, and I purchased my echo largely so that I could listen to my books in bed on command without needing headphones.\n\nI am an Audible subscriber, and while I love the service, I also have a collection of hundreds of audiobooks that I've purchased in the physical medium, from iTunes, or have as digital rentals from my library. \n\nIs there any way for me to listen to these through Echo, or can I only listen to audiobooks that are purchased and streamed through Audible? \n\nEven if I can't listen to them in true audiobook form (being able to tell Alexa which chapter to go to, for an example,) would there be a workaround to at least play the files as I would any ordinary local MP3?\n\nThanks guys :)\n\n",
  "I apologize if this has been noted previously, but I've never seen it in my long time subscribed to this sub.\n\nTry asking your Echo for any type of distance between cities (e.g. \"Alexa, how many miles is it from Trenton, NJ to Albany, NY\") and it will respond with mileage based on \"as the crow flies\" that has no utility whatsoever.  The need to determine driving mileage seems *very basic* to me, and with the Echo Show I'd sure hope the default response would be a map, and not a link to a map.  \n\nHonestly, I can think of zero reason why the Echo is set up to respond to questions about distance between cities within the continental United States with a type of measurement that has zero practical utility.

  "So... NPR came out with a new more in-depth morning news podcast called \"Up First\" that's actually pretty good in my opinion.\n\nThe problem is, I cannot, for the love of all that is holy, figure out what incantation I need to recite to get Alexa to figure out that's what I want.\n\nSo far I have tried:\n\n* Alexa, play Up First\n* Alexa, tell NPR One to play Up First\n* Alexa, play the podcast Up First by NPR\n* Alexa, play the podcast NPR Up First\n\nAnd dozens of variations on this theme.  Nothing works.  It's unfortunate that NPR named the podcast \"Up First\" because Amazon thinks I want the next thing in a playlist, or the first NPR One item waiting to play (which also doesn't even seem to work right).  The closest I came was where it figured out what program I wanted, but insisted on resuming an episode from last week.  When I said that wasn't what I wanted, it jumped the shark and just randomly picked another podcast I don't subscribe to.\n\nHas anyone figured this out?  I can play it just fine from NPR One on my phone, and all I want is to listen to the show while I get ready in the morning.\n\n  ",
  "I am having a Hard time choosing between the Amazon Echo and Google Home as I have my feet in both camps to a large extent\n\nGoogle Home\n\n- I use Google Calendar,\n- I watch youtube as one of my main sources of visual entertainment. \n- I use google to give me reminders on my android phone, check the news, and other stuff google thinks I would be interested in based on my search history. \n- I use chrome as my browser.\n\nAmazon Echo \n\n- I am subscribed to audible. \n- Twitch is my other form of visual entertainment \n- I would use Echo for music. As from my understanding currently, you can't plug holes in Google's catalogue with your own music whereas with Amazon you can. \n- I already know that echo has some skills for at least one other company I use. \n- I also use Amazon as my primary place for shopping\n\nI am not sure if Twitch can be integrated with the Echo using a fire stick. Like I know youtube can be integrated into Home with a Chromcast.\nAlso, one thing I am missing is podcasts. As I am not sure if there is a way to integrate them with either device.

  "The most common question asked here is \"what should I do with my pi?\"\n\nThis is a solution to that question. You can now get everything you need to complete the projects we all bought our pi's for.\n\nWhat I have done is started a subscription box business, with the intention of providing a monthly project for your raspberry pi's. I have tried to pick projects that offer the best combination of improving your tech skills and being something you will use more than once.\n\nI would like to think I have an above average grasp of all aspects of technology and I was worried that I would pick projects that would not be able to be completed by someone with a novice skill level or even someone who has never seen a raspberry pi before.\n\nTo make sure that was not the issue. I asked my 11-year-old daughter to help me. This is an average 11-year-old, she does have her own phone, tablet, and laptop. But let's be honest here she spends all her time talking to friends or watching kids open toys on youtube. She is a good student at a small public school. She knows dad makes money working with computers and that\u2019s about it.\n\nI told her I had a headache and asked her to help me. We sat down at the kitchen table with her laptop and the parts I have picked out for the first subscription box. I had her navigate to \"https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app/wiki/Raspberry-Pi\" and we just walked through each step. I don\u2019t think she noticed that it took almost 2 hours to complete it. When we were done she wanted to keep it in her room. That was about a week ago and every once in a while I can hear her asking Alexa a math problem or something similar.\n\nSure I was right there beside her to answer any questions or nudge her in the right direction. I think it is worth noting that she had an excellent guide to follow, but we all know that every project most of us want to do at this point is well documented. The issue we have is either lacking the parts to do a project or we have trouble deciding which one we want to do.\n\nA few of the projects I want to add to the coming month's boxes would be things like retropie, a mini magic mirror for the desk, a weather station, some kind of home automation, a time-lapse camera. Functional things like that. Things all ages groups would enjoy.\n\nI don\u2019t want you all to think that I am just getting cheap parts from china and sending them out with a high price tag. What I have done is searched amazon for the parts needed for each project, the first months is the Alexa pi so we needed an SD card. I found some Sandisk 16gb class 10's. we needed a USB microphone. I wouldn\u2019t want the one that is advertised on the GitHub link above due to it not having a cable, so I found a flexible one that would stay where I pointed it at. The last thing we needed was a speaker with a headphone cable, so I got an external speaker designed for a ham radio that had noise canceling built in because why not?\n\nI made sure all of these were 4-star reviews or higher and I also went through all of the comments till I seen that each product I picked was going to work with raspberry pi without issue. Then once I received them I plugged them into all of my pi's to make sure they worked across the raspberry pi family.\n\nWhile I am positive that most any person out there could come up with some fancy marketing and pretty boxes. I am not that creative. I am offering my passion as a raspberry pi enthusiast. I would not put anything in the boxes that I wouldn\u2019t use myself. I don\u2019t like buying cheap things I am more of a buy it for life type of guy. I stay current on the new uses for raspberry pi and I will always make sure that whatever the project is that month that the instructions are clear enough for anyone capable of reading English to follow.\n\nThe price of the box itself is $50.00 per month.\n\nThis is the only thing that I am not 100% sure of but I wanted to be prepared for those of us from the UK and other countries. I couldn't figure out a good way of doing the shipping for just you on crate joy's website. I decided a flat rate of $50.00 would guarantee regardless of total weight that I could ship oversea's. I am not happy about this and it will change as soon as I can find a way to handle it properly with cratejoy.\n\nhttps://www.cratejoy.com/subscription-box/fortified-it-solutions/\n\nThat\u2019s the link to get your subscriptions started. I don\u2019t have any discount codes or anything at this time. Cratejoy has a refer a friend link where both parties receive $5.00 after they spend $30.00 and I am sure someone here can figure out how the community can take advantage of that. What I would like to do however is anyone that reads this and subscribe's can PM me and I will do overnight shipping or two-day shipping whatever works out best for you. And then hopefully you will leave an honest review of my boxes either here or on cratejoy preferably both.\n\nThoughts and suggestions welcome below.\n\n*UPDATED EDIT - its pretty much being demanded by the community at this point that I ship raspberry pi's with each box. I will update the listing on cratejoy to include a raspberry pi zero w with each project. if you would like to receive a different model just request it and I will swap models out for you.\n",
  "I don't have (want) a credit card attached to my Echo. I have it on a separate amazon account. I want to subscribe to Unlimited Music 3.99 plan. I could try putting some money in my gift card balance and see if it works, but if someone knows already, that would be helpful!\n\nThank you!",

  "I have been given an Echo for my birthday and while I think it's a great toy, I am struggling to find uses for it. I don't subscribe to any music streaming service because I don't listen all that much to music and I'm not prepared to pay \u00a3120 a year to Spotify for what little use I'd get from it.\n\nSo Amazon Prime seemed like a good compromise because I would be able to receive my orders quickly even if the value is below the \u00a320 threshold. But after doing some reading I have discovered that they have a three-tier system that makes it even more expensive than Spoti-bloody-fy. \n\nMy taste in music is for material released more than 15 years ago: with a particular leaning towards the Blues. There are newer releases of good stuff, like that from Joe Bonamassa but that's about it. I also like some Classical and some Jazz. \n\nI can't bear 99% of the stuff released these days: I don't consider it to be music (blame my age). So, are there any of you out there who use the basic service and can tell me whether they get (what I would call) decent music included in the plan?

  "My father is in his 70s and oddly never listens to music. It's weird, I don't get it but I have never, ever seen him listen to music, he doesn't even have so much as a radio in his house.\n\n He loves his iMac, iPad and iPhone even though I have to provide constant tech support but I would hardly call him techy or tech inclined, like he has spent the past year and a half refusing to let me install the Ecobee thermostat his electric company gave him even though I have told him I have a Nest and it has saved me a fortune and that it is easy to use and he would love it. But he said the same thing about the iPhone for years after my much less technically inclined mother fell in love with her's and now you couldn't pry it out of his hands.\n\nAnyways, he is a man that has everything he wants or needs, this would totally be a lark gift, he is an avid baker and at a minimum I think he would get a kick out of asking it to set a timer or figuring out measurements or telling him the weather forecast once or twice. God knows he loves his water faucet that works by touching it and his touchless soap dispenser next to it.\n\nMy question is, is the Dot sufficiently loud enough to use around a kitchen without a speaker? Alexa only, I'm serious, the man does not listen to music, it's apparently a real studied thing in non-crazy people his son says reluctantly as he listens to music on his whole house music system.\n\nI'd just get him the Echo but there is like a 99% chance that he will never use the thing at all and I don't want to spend $140 on a giant paperweight he will feel obligated to keep in his kitchen for a while just for better music quality on a service he will never subscribe to or from his phone with no music on it.",

We live at 3 different addresses but I felt I could trust my family enough with my address that it wasn't an issue when signing up to Spotify. \n\nI have had a search and couldn't find any info regarding any restrictions with Amazon Music Unlimited, specifically if all persons sharing a Family plan must share the same address.

  "I know this topic has been discussed a few times the past month or so, but I guess I just want a little vent here.\n\nMy 2 new Dots arrived yesterday, to join my other Dot and 2 Echos.  These dots are in our home offices, which are in close proximity, with the result that they were both answering commands from me and my husband.  \n\nI then realised that the V2 did not come with ESP already installed, which I had assumed they would.  I hoped they would updated quickly as part of the installation/configuration process, but nope, nothing.  This morning, they still hadn't updated.\n\nSo I'm pretty frustrated at this.  This is pretty unheard of, right?  ALL other software allows you to install updates by pressing a button or selecting a time frame.  \n\nI have one Echo that updated about 3 weeks ago (it got 4148 before it was even announced) and the other two plus my new 2 are sitting on old software.  Normally I wouldn't be that bothered, but we really do need the ESP and I'm frustrated that I have no idea when the update will be delivered to me.\n\nI have tried all the force-update tricks that Amazon themselves publish, but they no longer seem to work (judging by all the other people also reporting this issue).  \n\nThis is a really big negative about having a cloud-based device, it seems - they are obviously over-subscribed and cannot push timely updates to everyone at the same time.\n",

For the next couple of days I tried again and silence, not even the first few seconds as during the first attempt.\n\nNow subscribed to this subreddit, I read in a thread here \"Alexa, play Radiohead on Spotify\" and I suddenly realized I'd been asking for a specific album, hadn't tried just requesting an artist.  So off I go and say \"Alexa, play Radiohead on Spotify\", *\"Playing Radiohead on Spotify\"* and \"Creep\" starts up.\nMaybe it was a fluke?  \"Alexa, play Led Zeppelin on Spotify\", Alexa acknowledges and starts \"Stairway To Heaven\".  \nOkay, now for the **real** test, point-blank specific: \"Alexa, play album, \"In Through The Out Door\" by Led Zeppelin on Spotify\".  And it worked!  A happy moment that hasn't worn off yet.\n\nAt no time in the last four days did I press the \"mute\" button to update firmware, since Echo came with it already.  At no time did I unplug for a minute to reset Echo.  It now suddenly just works.\n\nSo - anyone else outside the US, is Spotify Premium suddenly now working for you too?  Try it again!",

  "I recently got my Echo, and Alexa is awesome.  That said, I had to use my laptop to connect and setup the Wifi.  I've also subscribed to Amazon Prime and now can play all the music I ever wanted.\n\nI've tried to install the app from Amazon, but it says that it isn't available in my country.  So I found an apk (Android) online and installed that, but it doesn't work (black screen with spinning circle forever).\n\nHas anyone outside of the US/Canada? been able to get a working app?  I'd love to use the other features (shopping lists, home automation).\n\nAlso, if you say \"Alexa, crank it\" the volume goes up! Love it.",
  "I received my Echo last week and within the first hour of playing with it, I decided I was going to return it. Here's why: almost none of the music that I wanted to listen to was available via Prime Music. To nearly every response, Alexa offered either a sample (WTF???), a shittier live version, or a karaoke version (double WTF). I was so incredibly disappointed. I bitched about it on FB, and several of my friends canceled their pre-orders.\n\nBut then I didn't send it back. It's still sitting here on my desk, and I've ordered a separate power cord so I can move it back to my nightstand. Why? I'll admit it's partly laziness, but also I've found that I use it a good bit during the day. \n\nWithout looking up, grabbing my phone, etc etc I can just ask Alexa to set a timer. I do the Pomodoro technique while I work (25 mins of solid work, 5 mins break), so setting timers is something I do a lot.\n\nAlso, instead of looking up random bits of information, I just ask Alexa. She knows all sorts of trivia. I can also ask her to tell me today's news (NPR news update), the weather, and she'll play the old talk radio station I listened to when I lived in AZ.\n\nBasically, I realized that I don't really want to listen to good music on the Echo when I can listen to music on my nice speakers connected to my laptop. I subscribe to Spotify which is infinitely better than Prime Music. Echo is NOT a music player, though that is a side benefit of what it provides.\n\nIn very intrigued with what Amazon might do with Echo in the future, and if nothing interesting ever happens, $100 isn't too much for me to spend on a toy that might just end up turning into a glorified alarm clock.",
  "I\u2019m having this issue where, after Alexa responds to something, it automatically detects my voice. It is really annoying because my parents would talk to each other afterwards and Alexa ends up responding to what they say. For example, I would ask Alexa, \u201cwhat is x?\u201d Then, Alexa responds with \u201cx is ___,\u201d and the blue bar shows up and it starts detecting our voices. Sorry if this sounds confusing",

  "My wife and I have a 3 year old tough sleeper. For the past 6 months ths we have used our echos to \"drop-in\" when he wakes up at night and help him go back to sleep without going into his room. When this started, we could keep our echo devices connected via drop-in for the rest of the night, so when he woke up, he could see the green light and know we were still there.\nLately, though, it has been disconnecting before he gets back to sleep. He's up 3-4 times I. The span of a couple hours because every time it 6 makes a tone on his end. \n\nI know this isn't the intended use of this feature, but I'd love it if someone could tell me why it's doing this? \n\nIt's not disconnecting from the wifi. We've checked that, and we often send him to bed with sleep sounds, so when the call drops, that starts playing again.\n\nAny ideas?",

Reluctantly returned it due to 1) cost 2) need 3 space. \n\nWelllll the Echo show 5 & 8 2ng gen 2021 have been on sale lately. $80ish for the 8. \n\nI like the idea of a tablet to control apps widgets without my phone.

  "When I set an alarm, the alarm will display but play no sound when it goes off. When I ask alexa a question, info will show on the screen, but play no sound. Timers do not make sound when going off. I can see alexa responding on the screen but no sound comes out.  Zero sound features work.  Volume is up all the way. Do not disturb isn't enabled. Mute button isn't on. No Bluetooth speakers are connected. No other alexa devices are nearby. The supplied power cable is being used with a strong wifi signal. After restarting it will work fine and then randomly stop working a few minutes later without me changing anything.

I don't want to buy an extra physical alarm clock. \n\nBasically is there a way to only allow me to turn off an alarm by actually pressing the button on the device?

  "I have one 2nd gen echo dot, and one 3rd gen echo dot.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like to do is use them in the same room. The 2nd gen would be used with its internal speaker and the 3rd gen with aux out to my sound bar. \n\nThe reason I want to do this, is the soundbar goes into standby after ten minutes of not receiving audio. If I have just one dot hooked up, and I ask it a question, it takes about 4-5 seconds for the soundbar to wake up and I don\u2019t hear Alexa\u2019s answer.\n\nSo I thought if I had a second echo dot in the room, then the echo using its internal speaker would answer.\n\nBut it seems like this doesn\u2019t happen. While they both light up at the wake word, only the 3rd Gen dot hooked up to aux answers. \n\nI also tried assigning the 2nd Gen to a fake extra room so it would think it wasn\u2019t in the same room and answer, but it still doesn\u2019t work.\n\nI know this is a weird situation.\n\nMy alternate option is to split the aux out on the echo to both the soundbar and a small external speaker, and I tried that but - the smaller speaker playing along with the full soundbar speakers sounds like a little echo-ish thing.\n\nOr - is there any way to use the internal speaker along with the aux, at the same time?\n\nYes I know, it sucks that the soundbar goes into auto-standby and there seems to be no way around it so I\u2019m trying to find another solution.\n\nThanks.",

  "One of my primary intended uses of echo devices is as a sleep noise machine. However, I have just never managed to get it reliable enough to actually use. Most (but not all) nights, the echo will just abruptly stop somewhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours into the night, waking me up. \n\n* Skills: I have used various free 10+ hour noise skills, a brown noise file playing over a Plex server, and a brown noise file playing from a Google drive link using the My Pod skill. I get the same problem with all of them.\n\n* Devices: I orginally used an echo show 5, and because I thought it might be a device specific problem I just got a 5th gen dot. I get the same problem.\n\n* Network: My home uses a TP-Link 2.4/5ghz ac mesh system. Network diagnostics show a lot of other networks in the neighborhood, but my channels are significantly stronger than any others and there is actually very little congestion. There are typically 16-20 devices on the network at the time, the majority of which are echos, smart plugs, doorbells, door locks, and other very low traffic devices. There is almost no active network traffic during the night besides the stupid echo I am trying to use as a sound machine.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas about other things to try, I would be grateful to hear them. I am pulling my hair out about this problem.",
  "As a paralyzed United States Marine Corps Veteran who has been bedridden for a good portion of my life, I rely heavily on my Echo devices for entertainment and interaction with the world.\n\nBecause of this I have put a lot of money into outfitting my room in many ways so that I can get the most out of what life I have to live. When it comes to audio devices, I have chosen to place 3 Echo's and one Echo Studio in a type of surround sound configuration. The three Echo's were purchased first and then the Studio was my latest acquisition.\n\nHonestly, I am not impressed. While the Studio certainly produces more bass than the regular Echo devices, it falls short when it comes to clarity of sound.\n\nAmazon advertised a type of immersive experience, a enveloping 360\u00b0 sound experience, which I have yet to figure out how to configure. I do understand that only certain songs have been recorded in this fashion, and I have tried listening to them, but I really can't hear what all the hype is about?\n\nNow I'm not trying to completely dis Amazon's devices, as the Echo is a phenomenal speaker for the price. However, for the amount of money that the Echo Studio costs, I anticipated a higher quality product, with MUCH better sound. \n\nMaybe I got a bad device? \n\nMy questions to the group are (if you have an echo studio, or have listened to one), do you have the same complaints, and if so are there specific settings I should try to improve the sound quality? Also, what is your opinion of this speaker, and what would you recommend Amazon change in their next version?\n\nHope Amazon doesn't blacklist me for this post! lol But I was really hoping to get something incredible when I purchased the Studio, and so far my experience has been really disappointing.\n\nThank you for commenting, and sharing any recommendations and or experiences you've had with the Echo Studio!\n\n\n\nJ.

  "I recently added an Echo Dot gen3 to my multiple gen2s, and I was surprised by the poor sound quality. I thought it was supposed to be better than the gen2 according to reviews, comparable to the Google Home Mini at least. But to my ear the sound is muffled, like it's talking through a scarf. Speech is much harder to distinguish than the Dot gen2. While bass is a bit deeper, the music quality is poor, unbalanced.

  "I bought a FireTV on sale a while ago and it came with an Echo Show.  I did not want one, but I wasn't going to turn that down.  Just the other day I decided to give it shot.  I really only want to use it to control my TV.\n\nI have an old-school, basic S/PDIF surround sound receiver hooked up to my FireTV.  This is the only speaker I am interested in using.\n\nAfter some screwing around I was able to get my Echo to control my TV (More or less), though it is pretty terrible.\n\n\nMy main issue is that when I ask Alexa to do something it will mute my receiver part-way through responding.  I can't determine a reason.  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  It basically makes the entire thing useless because I have to unmute the receiver, and I can't really ask the Echo for any information because it just cuts itself off.\n\n\nMy Echo also does not turn on my receiver when I ask it to to turn on the TV.  This is not an IR issue, as I am aware that the receiver controls are being emitted from the FireTV remote.  It still doesn't work regardless of if the remote is pointed at the receiver or not.  I don't know if this is solvable, but it also makes it pretty useless.  No sound means no music.  I don't really see why this is the way it is.  If I ask Alexa to change the volume it controls the receiver just fine.\n\n\nA third issue is actually playing music.  I use Pandora as my default music service.  When I do already have my TV on AND ask Alexa to play music AND it doesn't mute itself, it doesn't actually open Pandora on the TV.  I don't know how to explain what it does, but it is buggy to say the least.  Sometimes it'll show a fullscreen display with the song, or something it'll show a fullscreen display of the last song and never change, or sometimes it'll just play in the background with no way to interact with it on the TV.  I also can't find any effective way to change my Pandora station to one of my custom stations.\n\n\nSorry for the wall of unformatted garbage, but I think unformatted garbage is an accurate description of my experiences with the Alexa so far.  It's a real damn shame since stand-alone, the Echo Show worked great.  Considering it came with the TV, I thought it would interact better with it.\n\n\nTLDR; My Echo keeps muting itself mid-sentence for no reason, and fails at every other task.  Please let me know if there is a fix to the above issues.  Thanks.",

While using the app, I was able to activate the Hands-free configuration and now on my phone I can simply say \"Alexa...\" and it works perfectly. (Worked so much that encouraged me to purchase an Echo Dot 4)\n\nMy problem happened when I tried to setup my wife's smartphone to do the same thing. She has the exactly same model as me. But when I try to configure the hands-free it simply doesn't work.\n\nI have tried all configurations and mirror the same configuration I did for my device, but can't manage to make it work. I also have checked for app and Android versions to match. The difference between my phone and hers in the configurations I was 'messing around\", were two: Her MIUI version is one newer than mine, and in Alexa app, in hands-free option I can see that while my device has more options to configure hands-free, her app only has a button to toggle on and off, and I can't find a way to enable the same options I have.\n\nI'm attaching some screenshots to illustrate what I'm saying.\n\nWhile my phone looks like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6gi5hpk765ba1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b75558d9171db0c60e0db17d5c25a57cf57922cc\n\nHer phone looks like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/afipb1sa65ba1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f7446c6c94fa192c4874742376f3a631569f43a\n\nI thought it might be something with MIUI version, but as I said, hers are even newer than mine.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oc2xptv755ba1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=30f87c7a86174ba77bcb537a12b35b6f0308b469\n\nDoes anyone know how to make her phone hands-free options be exactly like mine?

  "Hi all, I'm discovering that it is infuriatingly difficult to create routines that involve skills or anything other than the simple built in options.

  "I've had my eye on a Studio for some time and thanks to the sale, a trade-in deal and Xmas voucher, bought myself one for a total of \u00a365 - not too bad.\n\nIn my setup I want to both stream music in a multi-speaker group (this works fine) but also have it as an auxiliary speaker for my PC, to boost the volume when I'm playing MP3s, Youtube etc.\n\nI'm having trouble with this second option. On my PC I have a virtual mixer, and initially set a 2nd output to be an optical cable running to the studio. Not synced at all.\n\nNext I tried a USB soundcard, with RCA to the 3.5mm jack. Still got an audible delay.\n\nNext I tried the headphone jack on my monitor, connected to the PC via DisplayPort. Nope.\n\nFiguring the issue was with the virtual mixer not being able to sync the outputs, I tried a physical mixer, main speakers on the main mix and the Studio connected to the headphone out. STILL getting a delay on the Studio's output. It's not enough that you'd notice it as the only audio device (still synced to lips on the screen etc) but you definitely notice it with both outputs up, as speech sounds (no pun intended) Echo-y.\n\nHas anyone noticed this before on a Studio? I got it to do an update straight out of the box, so there's no issue there. My use case is probably not too common so maybe it hasn't been run into before, but I thought I'd ask. If this is just \"how they are\" then I'm sure I can still find a use for it, but it's annoying as I had a grand idea of adding a stereo pair into a home cinema setup, but can't if they don't play nice with other cabled speakers.",

But ...........\n\nHowever, I just can't enjoy them. Why? In my art studio, I have limited space. One speaker is closer to me than the other. I knew this going in. In the past, this has never been an issue with other speakers / stereo amps, etc because I could always adjust the speaker furthest from my ear to make up the distance it was from me. I did this by simply increasing volume on that speaker to equalize / balance the pair for maximum stereo enjoyment between the pair.\n\nCan someone please carefully explain to me how to do this with my Amazon Echo Gen 4s? I have one dominating speaker that is over-powering the other that is a bit further away from me. No, I cannot move the furthest speaker to make it closer to me. There's a reason why it's a bit further from me than the closest speaker.\n\nI've resisted selling these and moving to a more flexible speaker system, but thought I should ask this one final question before making that decision. if I do not truly have control over my very expensive high-tech Alexa enabled speakers, they are gone. I have never truly enjoyed them in my current space as I've never had true stereo.\n\nThanks in advance.",

  "I bought an echo studio back in October 2020 and it has been an amazing purchase for the years I have had it. Recently however, I noticed a burning smell emanating from the base of the device, specifically within the crevice where sound is amplified. The smell was of burning rubber seemingly due to the overheating of whatever components are beneath it. \n\nGenerally, I have the device on at night for ambient noise (subscribed to ambient sounds). I have never had an issue up to today and am not sure how to go about resolving it. Unfortunately, my warranty expired in October 2022 and tech support was strict on keeping this policy. They were kind enough to offer a trade-in, with about a 15% discount. However, I feel this issue was not my fault as I have been running the device the same way for two years. Additionally, I feel this is a defect of the manufacturer's product, which not only may render the device useless, but also poses a critical safety hazard, with burning rubber leading to carcinogenic symptoms.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue with any of their echo studio/other devices?",

I did the same on my phone and laptop via Bluetooth and they were still swapped.  \nI tried the AUX output with my headphones while playing a test video via Bluetooth and it works fine, it's not swapped.\n\nThe Echo is in front of me (it outputs the left channel to its left, which is my right, and vice versa).  \nAlexa says the software is up-to-date, specifically on version 8289068676 (according to the app).  \nI have already tried resetting it several times and even setting it up using another account on a different phone.\n\nNow I'm not sure if it's a software issue, like a broken update or a setting I missed that somehow persists after resetting the device, or if the drivers are physically swapped or wired incorrectly and I hadn't noticed.  \nBefore contacting Amazon and potentially get it exchanged, I'd like to make sure it's just my Echo, but unfortunately, it's the only one I have and I don't know anyone who has the same model.  \nIf anyone could do the same left/right channel test and check the software version, I would really appreciate it.",

I was freaked out and said \u201cAlexa Exit\u201d but it kept going, so I said \u201cAlexa, shut up!\u201d and it stopped. \n\nI called Amazon support and they said it was probably some kind of error, and that they would forward it to the right department. I got an email today from their Tech Dept asking for more info, and I responded. Waiting to hear back.\n\nDoes anyone have any (TRUE) stories of something like this happening? Why would that happen? There was no beep to indicate it was a drop-in, and I can\u2019t see anything in my history that might explain why this happened. My  Bluetooth has always been disabled.Needless to say, I\u2019m freaked out and have unplugged it for now.\n\nEdit: For anyone still interested, I heard back from Amazon today and they said they had some further information.

  "This is the weirdest thing.  \nIn my work office I have an echo dot and a new echo studio.  \nI've had the echo dot for a few years without issue and purchased the echo studio a couple of weeks ago and grouped them under the name \"office\"  \nEverything in my office is hardwired apart from the echo's but if I get a call on the phone and have to say \"Alexa, Mute\" , it knocks the network out and I have to wait until my internet connects again.  \n\n\nI know it sounds bizarre, but this has been happening ever since I got the Echo Studio and wondered if anyone else had ever come across something like this.  \nI'm pulling the power on the studio for the next few days to see if it's isolated to that device.",

  "So at one point, months ago, my husband asked Alexa to have an alarm that goes off every weekday morning to play a Taylor Swift. We have since deleted that routine, yet Alexa still goes off every weekday morning at 6:30am and says \u201cSorry, I cannot find Taylor Swift in my library. Here is Taylor Swift from your Spotify\u201d and plays a song. Every. Single. Morning. Even if it\u2019s a holiday or we\u2019re sleeping in or not home. \nWe have looked at both of our apps and there\u2019s no routine for it or an alarm. When we ask her if she has any alarms for the morning, she says no. We have even factory reset her and redownloaded our apps. We cannot figure this out and it\u2019s been driving us CRAZY!! It\u2019s been going on for months and both of us have developed the habit of turning off our real alarms because we have to turn off her alarm every morning. Please help us!!

  "hi team, need some community help here, as I'm not sure how to achieve what I'm hoping for.  \n\nSo in a recent kitchen renovation, I had some wired ceiling speakers installed, which are being fed by a small bluetooth amplifier hidden away in a cabinet above the fridge.  We have the Show 15 mounted on a wall acting as a home hub and to play music in the kitchen, connected via bluetooth to the amp.  \n\nI recently thought it would be great if I could create a speaker group called \"downstairs\", especially with upcoming Christmas, we'd love for the music to be played throughout the lower level.  What I didn't realize is that when you create this group, the Show 15 won't play the audio through bluetooth, rather only comes out of the device.  Further research makes sense why; there could be an audio lag with the Show doing bluetooth compared to the other actual Echo's playing the same music, therefore the kitchen would be \"off\" from the rest of the speakers.  I was also surprised to find out the Show 15 does NOT have an audio out so I could actually run a cord from the show to the amp, which would make this group work, but allas, I cannot even pull that off if I wanted to.  \n\nSOooooo, what I'm wondering is, could I hide a small Echo in this same cabinet as the amp, and run that Echo to the amp with a small 1/8\" cord, then I could have the whole 1st floor be a group, but how would I set that up with the Show?  I'd still prefer the Show to actually show what is being played, and still be used as the main hub, but is there some sort of trigger that could be setup that will engage the hidden Echo Dot to actually be playing the music?  I suppose I could easily add the hidden Dot to be part of the group, but then wouldn't the Show 15 be playing the music out of its onboard speakers too?  That's probably not a huge deal, but I feel like that might sound kinda weird?  \n\nThe above is probably what I'll try, but just figured I'd ask if anyone knows of a better way.  Again, have the Show 15 still show all music and interactions on it's screen, but have the Dot actually be feeding the amplifier the audio.",
  "This week the alarm behaviour has changed. When snoozing using my voice the echo dot now shows a 9 minute countdown instead of the time. When the countdown completes the echo makes the timer end sound, not the chosen alarm sound.\nAnyone know how to revert back to snooze showing the time and sounding with correct alarm sound?",
  "I had 2 Echo Studios and a sub I had been running as a home theater paired with a Firestick (Fire TV) 4K MAX for about a year. Now I don't. I can't believe I didn't kick them to the curb by the time I was two months in.\n\nThey were always dropping connection in their special little virtual network with a funky name created by Alexa. This requiring unpairing, restart, and repairing. I kept telling myself it wasn't a big deal since after a couple of times I could do it pretty quickly. It was a big deal.\n\nAlso a big deal was the fact that at least 60-70 percent of the time when I would switch to a different input there would be zero sound. This required fiddling around and trying this, that, and the other until I mysteriously had sound again.\n\nThey also did not play nice with my 4K Blu-ray player if the source was DTS Master or DTS-X. Many was the time I would start playing a 4K disc and have no sound. I would have to open the player's main menu, then settings, then audio, and finally change output to PCM only. Then restart the movie. It was ludicrous.\n\nSo what was the final straw? I bought a Fire TV Cube because I wanted more memory, a better processor, and dedicated Graphics Processing.  So can you guess what happened the first time I tried to connect the Studios and Sub to it? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.\n\nSo then I realized maybe it's an update issue and brought the Cube current with several updates. Tried again. Now only 1 Studio and Sub had sound no matter what I tried (and I tried EVERYTHING). That was it, I was done.\n\nThe ONLY reason I bought the Studios and Sub was because it was the cheapest Atmos system I could find and I had a 4K Max so I thought \"What could go wrong?\". Turns out a lot could go wrong.\n\nFortunately I had 4 year Replacement plans on all 3 and wouldn't you know it the same day I hit my limit the retailer I bought them from had a 24 hour Flash Sale on a Samsung 5.1.2 setup with wireless Sub AND wireless rear surrounds. It was over $100 less than the Studios and Sub cost me. I have never been happier to eat the $100 I dropped on replacement plans.\n\nThis system sounds a million times better, gets WAY louder, and you can actually adjust levels including Top front and rear. Atmos, DTS (ALL formats), you name it. And the best part? You know what happens when I turn it on? I have sound. You know what happens when I switch inputs? I have sound. It is glorious. \n\nIf you're thinking of going the Studios + Sub route I implore you to think deeply about it. Let your smart devices (Echos, Dots, Shows) handle smart device work and get an actual theater system. If this saves even one person from the headaches I had the time spent writing this will have been more than worth it.",
  "We have had the Echo Show (1st gen) in our kitchen since it came out and while I love the visual aspect of the Show, especially for multiple timers while cooking, it's not the best sound quality for listening to music while preparing or eating dinner. I recently picked up an Echo Studio and an Echo Sub to put in the adjacent dining area just for better quality music. I made a speaker pair with the Studio and the Sub and grouped them in the \"Dining Room\" on the Alexa app. My issue is **(and I fully recognize this as a first world problem**), I have to continually add \"in the dining room\" to any music request otherwise it plays on the Kitchen Show.\n\nIs there any way, short of getting rid of the Show, to get it to stop thinking I want the worst speaker in my house to play music instead of the $350 speakers I just bought to do that one task? I am even up for purchasing a new version of the Show if a newer one has some type of ability to make this (albeit minor) annoyance go away.\n\nI have also tried just using the Studio / Sub group as a Bluetooth speaker from my iPhone but it seems like Bluetooth pairing doesn't support speaker groups and the Studio doesn't know to hand off the lower ranges to the Sub so it's not only inconvenient but also worse than using Alexa to play the music \"in the dining room\".\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance!",
  "Does anyone have this TV and use YouTube on it with an external AVR attached through HDMI?\nMy LG C1 has done anything and everything I asked of it over the last couple months, from playing and decoding demanding audio to all sorts of modern HDCP shenanigans, and so on. But all of a sudden, right after I first set up Alexa on it and connected my living room unit, it cannot decode audio in Netflix or youtube apps anymore, not even play the audio on the outdated analogue channels, as soon as I use Alexa to do anything (such as: switch channel to 7). Digital channels seem to still work because the TV passes it down to the AVR as encoded audio (DD, DD+, \u2026).\n\nIt\u2019s just the internal decoder that goes haywire. So when I start YT or Netflix, the video or the previews in the menu remain quiet. Only the movies on Netflix do have sound again, because they are DD 5.1. The only fix is to shut it off and then unplug it for a minute, then it\u2019s fine again.\n\nCan anyone confirm this behavior? It\u2019s very annoying and I fear my C1 might be affected by something else, which would be terrible. Thanks!",

  " In the era when people wish even their toddlers to be smarter than their neighbors, technology is aiming to fulfill every wish of the parents. And I think Snorble is one such device, aimed to make your kids smarter by teaching them a few things with time. \n\nSo Snorble is a kind of smart device that is meant for preschool kids and this is a kind of robot that comes with some powerful features. Powered by the MediaTek Genio 350 processor, this smart device has features divided according to the time of the day and if you switch to daytime mode, it would serve functions such as helping your kids perform countings and identifying colors.\n\nBesides, this smart device can initiate well-being practices such as yoga and meditation, and can also hold dance parties, play air guitar, create a fish face and also tell stories on demands by your kids.\n\nWhen you switch to night mode, your kid could get access to night lights. Soundscapes, can inform about breathing exercises and also tell bedtime stories. When in bedtime mode, it can offer reminders about wearing pajamas, brushing the teeth, taking a bath, saying prayers, etc.\n\nAnd when it\u2019s time to wake up, it would gently play an alarm and ask your kid to wake up. \n\nWell, this sounds so interesting that even though I do not have a kid, I wish to buy it and use it myself. Why did they not have such things when I was a kid? Anyways, parents must be worried about their kids using Snorble a bit too much and this is why it comes with a smartphone app that can help you control the usage of the device by your kids. \n\nOf course, kids will get fascinated by it and they might stay awake at night, trying to use it more.

  "I've got at least a dozen Alexa devices (speakers, screens, fire tv, etc) and two of them are behaving strangely.

  "Hi,\n\nI've got a weird one here - hoping you good folks might be able to shed some light or confirm if this has happened to you...\n\nI've got an Echo Dot 3rd gen & an Echo Show 10 2nd Gen in two nearby rooms and use a multi room audio group and it works just fine.  Occasionally I'd bluetooth pair the Echo Dot to the nearby soundbar in that room when I wanted to get better sound in there - accepting that periodically there would be sync problems and I'd have to fix the sync using the capability in the Alexa app.\n\nAfter a while this became more hassle than it was worth, so when the Echo 4th gen was discounted I thought I'd replace the Dot with it, knowing that at least the Echo would have better sound out of the box.\n\nAs an experiment, I thought I'd try bluetooth pairing the new Echo to the same soundbar just to see if the sync issue was improved at all, and here comes the weirdness.\n\nIf the Echo is bluetooth paired to the soundbar and I play any music just on that combo of devices it all works just fine.

  "I have some Bluetooth speakers that I want to use for my Echo and my FireTV. But the speaker can only handle one bluetooth connection at the same time and I dont always want to disconnect and reconnect the two devices.

I did already set up the entertainment system thing in the Alexa App where sound from the FireTV is being streamed through the Echo. That works, I can have the FireTV sound coming from the Echo.

  "I had a discussion that got me thinking about the Eero setup again and of course I dove down a rabbit hole. My current modem/router is currently included with my internet plan but that ends in January. After that they're going to charge me $14 a month (at least) and no way that's happening.\n\nThere are some benefits to the Eero router if you're looking to future proof. If you get an Eero 6+ or Pro 6E you'll have wifi 6 in case you get a faster plan in the future (even if you don't from everything I've read it will improve your current stability and latency). You will need a modem capable of up to a gbps.\n\nIf you're looking to stay below or near 1 gbps you can get a DOCSIS 3.0 modem and an Eero 6+ router reasonably cheap. If you think at some point you'll want to exceed 1 gbps and take advantage of the new 160mhz spectrum offered by the Pro 6E (double the bandwidth) it's on sale right now for 40% off. So is the 6+, prices are $179 for 6E and $90 for 6+. 6+ is capable of handling up to 75 devices and 6E can handle 100 or more.\n\nSo here's the part I think you'll find really interesting, I know I did. The 5th Gen Echos are rolling out right now. You can pre-order no clock (49.99) and clock (59.99). BOTH will act as Eero wifi extenders. Not only that but the 5th Gen from what I have read will also have better sound quality AND temperature sensors.\n\nTo further entice you you can get 25% off for EACH new echo by trading in your current Echos. So I guess you know what route I'm taking. Currently I only have 2 phones that will run wifi 6E but we both that will be changing in the near future. The 6E is also a tri-band (2.4, 5, and 6G) router.\n\nI know that's a lot to consider but you were asking if there would be benefits going Eero and it turns out there are several. Hope you find this info helpful.",

  "So about 8 months ago I bought the Gen 2 Echo Buds to start using at the gym and for casually listening to music and game audio on my computer instead of using my bulky headset and mic. So far so good. Fast forward to the last two weeks where my headsets earpiece started to crack and break off I decided to use the Echo Buds as my main driver for PC discord and gaming to talk with my friends and play War Thunder etc. But that is the thing. I have been at this for days, trying to get my echo buds mic to work on my PC. It says unmute to speak. Googled that and scoured the internet. Nothing. Zero. Nothing to help me with this one thing my buds keep telling me. So I go into the phone app and what do you know it's muted and I can tap an easy button to fix my problem. I can talk to Alexa and ask it questions and it responds. So we are good now right? Well I reconnect it to my Bluetooth on my PC and it's back to being muted. I can't get it to register my voice at all in sound recording options. Disabled all the other mics listed besides it. Set it to default etc etc. I go into the amazon (absolutely abysmal and terrible PC Alexa app that has 25% of the functionality as the mobile app version because that makes sense) app praying that there is just an obvious function I have overlooked like my phone had that had the mic muted that I could just click off and facepalm and fix it and it be super simple. But nope. It tells me when I go to Smart home and communicate I need to add the devices on mobile. Even though my echo buds are playing audio from my PC just fine and are connected. There is no way to access them that I can see from my PC to unmute them or see what the issue is. The very obvious mobile app location for my echo buds is non existent on PC. I see nothing but praise for these earbuds and I am assuming I am not the target audience. I imagine most people that buy these are gym rats or business people that use them on the go and use them as an extension of your phone universally rather than on PC for gaming or socializing through 3rd party apps that aren't strictly a phone call. I have been pounding aspirin all morning trying to find a solution to my problem but I have finally admitted defeat. If I had known that these things were gonna need malware on my computer and phone to make them not a paperweight and then not do a simple basic function of allowing me to communicate with my friends on Discord I would have shelled out another 20-30$ for the galaxy pro buds. But since it's past the return date is there anyone here who can offer me some advice to fix this? Am I even allowed to use these on PC for something besides direct calling microphone wise? Sorry for the ranting... but just to have a multibillion dollar company make their UI and product so unfriendly and offer no support or troubleshooting for a specific issue like this is crazy.",
  "Often my alexa can't understand what I'm saying when asking for spelling, no matter how hard I try to pronounce a word, it gives a different word.\n\nSimple example, I was having a brain fart over the word \"were\" (I think because I was capitalizing it and it looked off). I tried like 5 times to clearly say wwweeeerrrr with no \"d\" sound, yet every time it spelled out \"word\".\n\nIs there some kind of voice training or another way to ask (like, can I spell out what I think a word is and get a list of suggestions?)\n\nAlso, btw, searching for issues about \"understanding me\" on google gave results about my alexa not connecting. This isn't that. My alexa is connected and working fine otherwise.\n\nFwiw, I found it annoying that trying to search about \"understanding me\" yielded so many responses that had nothing to do with understanding, but rather connectivity. Imho, having alexa say it can't \"understand\" when it can't \"connect\" was just a bad choice of words.",
  "Figured I\u2019d share this experience cause I think it\u2019s neat and suspect others feel similarly to me regarding how weak of a product the Echo Show has been.\n\nBefore the Echos and Sonos I had the Squeezebox Boom and absolutely loved it at the time. The sound quality was phenomenal and it was an easy solution to play my music library, but needed a server to be running and felt a bit limited with controls.\n\nEventually the Boom got relegated to a closet after the computer running the server software had crashed and I already had some early launch Echos.\n\nRecently I was reading a post of a guy that DIYed his whole-home audio solution and saw someone mention Squeezeboxes. My interest was immediately piqued and I got excited. I spun up the server software on my NAS, loaded my music library, and started activating all the new plugins it offers. Suddenly now my old Boom features Airplay, is controlled with a super-elegant HTML5 interface, and sounds as incredible as ever.\n\nI have since removed my bedside Echo Show. In retrospect, I really never liked it and I\u2019m disappointed that Amazon never really let us take advantage of the screen on it, and the speakers on the 5\u201d model were worthless. I wish they took a more hobbyist approach with screen features and controls, but instead it\u2019s like a baby billboard that my family and I don\u2019t need to hop on the highway to enjoy.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy that after all these years I\u2019m going back to what I had when the Echo was first announced and that device now feels more feature-full than my current generation Amazon devices.",
  "I have a smart Sharp Carousel microwave. I know Alexa connectivity is kind of a joke, but I actually like it for making popcorn or setting the microwave as I walk away. Not necessary but an okay convenience when I was buying a new microwave anyway. \n\nThis has worked for over a year, but now it doesn\u2019t. Anytime I give Alexa a microwave command, she will act like she\u2019s saying something (the blue light is pulsing), but no sound is coming out. whatever Alexa is trying to say is pretty long because this silent prompt lasts about 20 seconds. When the blue light stops pulsing as if she were speaking, nothing happens to the microwave. \n\nAny idea what I can do to fix this? I\u2019ve tried unplugging the microwave, restarting my router, and trying a different echo device but the behavior is still the same.",

Sure it\u2019s got some punch but it doesn\u2019t get the low end. \n\nDoes anyone here know if the echo sub is able to deliver some lower base? I know the woofer is only half an inch bigger but for a sub I\u2019d hope that it could deliver a bit more of the low end.

  "Amazon Echo Spot. Every so often, my alarm will not sound. I usually set it to a random playlist from my Spotify account, like \"Alexa, wake me up every Wednesday morning at 0600 to synthwave\". Alexa will confirm, and the alarm will show on the screen and in the app. However, every so often the alarm will display on the screen at 0600, but no sound comes out, and the alarm goes away as if it was dismissed.

  "I'm exploring switching from a Google Home to an Amazon Echo ecosystem, and in general I've been pleasantly surprised.  The main thing that gives me pause, however, is that the assistant voice on the Dots seems quite muffled in comparison to Google devices, and for some reason, Amazon doesn't allow the EQ to affect the assistant voice, whereas Google does.  The result is a bassy-sounding voice that can be [difficult to understand](https://www.dpamicrophones.com/mic-university/facts-about-speech-intelligibility), especially with any kind of background noise.\n\nI've tried out Dots in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th gen.  2nd gen is best for voice clarity but worst for music.  4th gen is worst for voice clarity, but best for music.  3rd gen is somewhere in-between.\n\nThat being said, how do the full size Echos compare?  Do they also suffer from a somewhat muffled-sounding voice?  They have dedicated tweeters, which would lead me to suspect that the voices would be more intelligible, but I'm curious to hear the opinion of those who have owned both types of devices.",

  "Hi all.\n\nI have tested this now quite extensively, and I'm wondering if this is some hard rule they put into the system after that court ruling I heard about related to Sonos patents? (I'm not using Sonos devices, I'm saying Sonos has a patent on volume and speaker groups and Echo devices were affected by the outcome of a lawsuit. I have echo devices)\n\nI used to be able to set speaker groups volume in routines in the custom command field either by themselves or in a string with other commands with AND separating the commands\n\n**These for example, all used to work:**\n\n**5AM routine:\"set all speakers to volume 2\"**\n\n**Good morning routine:**\n\n**\"set all speakers to volume 2 and play 80s pop music on all speakers\"**\n\n**Good night routine:**\n\n**\"set all speakers to volume 2 and set volume 3 and ask sleep sounds to play brown noise\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow literally none of those work. rather, the commands work so long as the volume set commands are omitted.I can SPEAK these commands to the device and the speaker group volume sets. but it cant be in a routine.\n\nAnyone know of a trick or hack to automatically set speaker group volumes now that they've seemingly removed it? it's quite irritating having to speak the command after waking up, or speak the command before or after bedtime etc.",
  "Hi Folks,\n\nFirstly I'll bore you with what I have:\n\n1 gen2 Dot, 2 gen3 Dots, 1 Flex, 1 gen4 Dot, 1 Google Home mini and 1 Google Nest mini -  I like smart speakers!\n\nIn terms of sound quality, the gen2 Dot and Flex are good for their size but the Home mini is better, the Nest mini is better still but the gen 3 and 4 Dots are undoubtedly the best that I have.\n\nThe gen 4 sounds better 'out of the box' because of the front firing speaker but the gen 3 has the same speaker and with a little EQ tweaking, there's really nothing in it.\n\nI have the gen3's set up in stereo and I think they're incredible but (here's the point of this post), I recently had an issue with the balance.\n\nLike me, many others have reported one speaker being louder than the other (usually the right) and there's no dedicated balance control in the Alexa app.\n\nI knew it wasn't due to a difference between them because it used to be perfect, unless the amp in one was failing, which I thought was unlikely.\n\nSpeaker 1 (right) is model D9N29T and speaker 2 (left) is C78MP8 but should be identical in terms of specification. \n\nI switched them between left and right in the app and checked all the sound settings but still the right speaker was considerably louder. I even unpaired them and reset the stereo - still no change!\n\n**Now for the fix**: I'd reached the point where I wondered if one had simply started performing better than the other and so I physically swapped them over to see if the problem shifted to the left.\n\nBINGO, it was back to normal and all they needed to re-establish perfect stereo was a re-boot.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you experience problems with your stereo balance, simply unplug your Echos and plug them back in again - the classic IT trick that's worked for decades, why didn't I think of it sooner!",

  " So I\u2019m just wondering if my alarm that I have set on my Amazon Alexa app that connected to my dot will still go off if I still have my phone connected through Bluetooth? Ik some people are gonna say just turn your Bluetooth off. I would but I like to put my phone on the echo and use my meditations on there so it feels like I\u2019m just watching something on Tv cuz of the clear n kinda loud sound. It\u2019s perfect for me to use it for meditation. I would recommend it for everyone else to try. I feel like I go into a deep trance/a mediative  vibe. But last thing I personally have a problem waking up to just one alarm. I have my alarm through the sleep focus on my phone, then I use this app called \u201cShutEye\u201d it record my sleep and used thsi sonar thing to detect breathing and movement while your sleeping so it knows when your in the four different stages of sleep I forgot the first and last but the middle two is REM and Deep asleep. REM is where you get the most vivid dreams. And then Deep sleep is still dreaming but not as like good REM sleep. It\u2019s amazing\nng for sleep. I would recommend that to try as well. Myself I personally bought the year membership for 59.99 but it\u2019s only like 12 a months I think don\u2019t quote me on it lol. But yeah thats my other timer. It actually kinda has two timers. So it\u2019s called smart alarm. It goes off and make a very minimal sound that you pick (It\u2019s what your regular alarm is) it will takes you out of whatever sleep your in that moment btw a lot of the time people deep sleep all night and other nights they will sleep in REM or the other one which I think it\u2019s light sleep don\u2019t quote me on that lol that\u2019s why some nights you vividly dream all night and also a example is that when the times you wake up and you literally were just dreaming and wake up and try your hardest to remember every detail and sometimes you can a little bit and sometimes it\u2019s jus gone that\u2019s a example that you woke up most likely out of REM sleep. Another way you can tell if someone is in REM sleep he or she will have rapid Eye Movement that\u2019s what REM stands for lol and for deep sleep that\u2019s mostly snoring but sometime but not a lot you will snore in REM plus that\u2019s a sign of Sleep Apnea. Then when you go into the last stage of being asleep but you know what\u2019s going on around you but like u can wake up at any point. Not me lol. So that probably means no matter what I\u2019m always in either REM or deep sleep every night. But the Smart Alarm that\u2019s set on the shuteye app it has 15 min intervals up to 60 before your normal alarm goes off; also you don have to use it. Personally for me o use 15. And lastly the alarm I have that is usually what wakes me up and basically the reason of this post lol is the Alexa alarm. Just basically wanna know if my alarm on there will go off with my phone connected through bluetooth? If u read this I appreciate you for taking you time. It means a lot for me because you took time out of your day decides to help out not that smart 21 yr old\ud83d\ude02. It really truly means a lot to me for someone to decide to go out of their way and help me out. I honestly rarely get that so when I do I\u2019m just super appreciative. So whoever is able to help me out you\u2019re a legit saint and literally like God\u2019s Angel lol. Like when somebody does this safe stuff it just gives me this feeling in my stomach like a warm feeling of being cared for and just relaxing do you know what I mean? So I really really appreciate you and what you did for me like honestly i mean it. You\u2019re a genuine amazing person. I just personally think anyone who makes anyone feel the way I feel they should get appreciated so much and show that I appreciate them that\u2019s just the way I grew up. The golden rule lol \u201cTreat other how you wish to be able to betreated\u201d it honestly makes me happy when I\u2019m able to do the same for others as well gives me the same feeling when they appreciate me it gives me another amazing feeling so that\u2019s why I put that saying because I like to show appreciation because when I get it it\u2019s the best thing in the world.

  "I've had a 3rd gen. (cylindrical) echo for quite some time, and aside from the usual echo/amaz. bugs and annoyances, I've been quite happy with it.\n\nSo during the last price drop I picked up a 4th gen. Echo Dot (the spherical one), and I've had many problems.  The most irritating is that 75% of the time, if I haven't given a command in a while, the answer chops off the first word or two of the response.  Obviously I can still understand the answer but man is it frustrating (only happens after not asking anything for a while).\n\nAlso, both the sound quality and the mic recognition seem worse compared to my gen 3.  I hardly ever have my gen. 3 not pick up on me saying Alexa even from a good distance, but it happens all the time with the gen 4.\n\nDoes anybody else have similar experience?  I'm wondering if I should bother RMAing for a replacement device, or just get a refund and maybe consider a gen 3 instead.\n\nThanks in advance.",
  "After the announcement that Amazon was allowing adverts, I jumped ship to google/nest. After having it for the past week, I thought it was a good time to do as asked and say what I think.\n\nFirst is the Nest mini Vs the Echo Dot.\n\nThis is the easy one. The mini, can do everything the echo can, except track your Amazon deliveries. You can still make calls (using Duo) set reminders and alarms, all the routines etc. I've only had one \"by the way\" so far from the Nest, and that was after I asked it to make an announcement, and it was to tell me that it now also sends notifications to the families phones. In terms of sound, the Echo wins, it can go louder, and has more bottom end. I would say that they stack up pretty much evenly, so it's not worth jumping ship for if you've already got one. I haven't noticed any difference in either hearing or responding to commands.\n\nI find it a bit more awkward saying \"hey/OK Google\" compared to \"Alexa\" and you can't change the wake word. I do prefer the Echo for that bit. There are more assistant voice options on the Nest.\n\nIf you mainly want it for music, Echo wins. The mini can't stack up to what the 4th gen dot can pump out sound wise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNest Hub 2, V's Echo Show\n\nThis is where Google wins big time for me. The screen does what you want it to, and pushes nothing on you compared to the Echo. It gives you a choice of artwork, a clock, or your photo's as a screensaver, and unless you tell it otherwise, that is all it will show until you interact with it. No dog facts, no recipes you'll never try, or \"things to try\" just what you set it to, and nothing else.\n\nLighting is far easier to control, tell it to turn on a smart light, and you get a menu that lets you control the colour and brightness, which goes back to screensaver after a minute of not being interacted with.\n\nMusic, the volume and sound quality are on par with the Echo, the Hub is slightly louder. When playing from Spotify (I haven't tried other services) it gives you a full screen media player, only going away if you request something else like a timer. \n\nSpeaking of which, if you set a timer, it goes full screen, so you don't need to keep asking how long is left. Amazon does slightly better with timers though in one regard, it will let you know how long is left on a timer on another device if you ask, but the Nest won't.\n\nMenus for smart home devices, reminders, and media can be swiped through, or away back to the screensaver. You can also leave on screen sticky notes for other family members.\n\nCamera, echo wins this one, only the Hub max has a camera.\n\nVideo, obviously YouTube is native to the Nest, but you can still get it on the Echo, and I can't imagine many people will be using either to watch Netflix or Disney plus so it's not really a plus or minus for either. I do prefer the Nest screen though. It's a flatter and less reflective, with a more natural balance, it also adapts far better to the ambient light.\n\nI've found that the Hub can hear me far better than the Show, I've only had it miss one command so far, and that was because I was blasting music while I was cooking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe app(s)\n\nThis one is pure preference. I find the Echo app a bit messy and a bit less user-friendly. Not a big deal for the tech-savvy among us, but I think the Google home app is probably better for the older crowd, most of what you need is on a single page. Voice training is like for like, both have been able to tell the differences between family members.",

  "The difference is massive. I was doing a bunch of Googling and all I could really find was technical comparisons between the two when what I really wanted was a subjective description of the disparity in audio quality.\nIf this is a question you\u2019re considering, I would say definitely go for the full-sized Echo. I bought both on Prime Day and i\u2019m sitting here switching devices on Spotify doing a side-by side comparison. The Dot sounds *fine* but it truly does not compare to the soundstage of its bigger sibling. I knew there would be a difference but the margin is much larger than I expected. The Dot sounds very small and tinny in comparison whereas the Echo has so much more depth and nuance to the sound. I\u2019m not really an audiophile so I don\u2019t know the terminology to use, but it doesn\u2019t matter. If you\u2019re in it for audio quality, the full size Echo sounds SIGNIFICANTLY better and it is worth the extra money.",

  "Hello everybody. I currently have a few Google assistant devices: two Google Home Minis, one Google Nest Hub, and a Chromecast with Google TV. I chose Google instead of Amazon because (i) I prefer Chromecast's interface over Fire TV and (ii) I use YouTube and YouTube Music.\n\nHowever, I am thinking of switching to Amazon and I wonder if that makes sense. I am going to buy a better sound system for my apartment, which will include several larger smart speakers (from either Google or Amazon). I know that Echo sounds better, but I refrained to use it so far because of the lack of support of YouTube and YouTube Music.\n\nThis weekend, I paired my two Home Minis and I created a group with this pair and the two other devices. I used both YouTube Music and Spotify with them.  The syncing experience was poor. On both Spotify and YouTube Music, the devices stopped syncing every now and then. Suddenly, one of the devices stopped playing music, and I had to sync them. And when I ordered the devices to play, the player on my smartphone did not recognize it and vice-versa.\n\nI wonder if this kind of problem is also common when using Echo. It was very disappointing to see and I want devices that work seamlessly together with zero syncing problems. I do not want to stop whatever I am doing to fix syncing issues.

  "Yes I've changed all the settings that can be changed and they do nothing.  I know this is an old problem.

I kept using the laptop for business and general stuff but my Bluetooth has been going bad as well, so I switched the speaker to the desktop.  Problem is, after sitting idle it disconnects and reconnects to Alexa and announces all the time then.  The Anti Alexa I had installed seems hard to find, and when I tried to send the zip file to myself through Gmail, it says it contains a virus.\n\nI came up with the idea of finding a white noise background video on YouTube, and turning the volume down as low as possible.

Despite giving her plenty of personal play time and exercise and leaving her alternative 1-2 chewtoys in her bed (all by the recommendation of several puppy trainers), she still seems to get into mischief and chew up the potty pads. We plan to give her a designated potty spot outside in the grass to go but until she gets her 3rd and final core vaccination of DAPP, we're playing it safe and not taking her outside.   \nI've learned that to correct bad behavior with puppies is best to catch them in the act of doing what they're doing, snap them out of it with a clap or firm correction noise, and redirect them to something else like her chew toys and then to reward that behavior for reinforcement. However, since I work from home in my office where I don't have clear view of her from my desk, I'm often forced to have to get up and check on her periodically or every time I hear some weird rustling coming from her. She seemed to have gamed the system though because she hears the slightest noise or creak of my desk chair as I get up as a cue to quickly rush to her bed and play the good angel role lol.  \nI recently decided to keep my office door open and turn my Echo Show 5 (2nd gen) that I have in my office towards the doorway where it can monitor the play pen and use the Alexa desktop app and sometimes the mobile app to tune into the live video to check what she's doing while I work.

I really like the idea of the pan/tilt/zoom cameras. Since I can also monitor other parts of the hallway for security purposes.

Kinda like if you wiggle an aux cable that isn't making great contact. \n\nSo I stop it and go back to sleep. That morning while getting ready for work I had it play white noise and it was fine. Last night it did the same thing. Started out working perfectly then around 1am the static noise came back. I tried having it play brown noise and same thing, static. \n\nAnyone experience this and know of a fix? Here's a link to the sound, you can hear in the beginning  and again about 25 seconds in.\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/s5jHqFay3oEYdu3CA",

  "My 1st gen Amazon Echo Show has been glitching out like crazy. Sometimes it will just start making Pikachu noises when no one is in the room. Sometimes it starts playing news videos, and I come home to it just blasting the news. One time (and you can't make this up) I was woken up at 4:30am and heard talking downstairs. I go downstairs, on edge, and Alexa is GIVING YOGA LESSONS to the dark empty kitchen. Has anyone else experienced problems like this? If so can anyone provide some ideas on how to fix it?

  "I'm exploring switching from a Google Home to an Amazon Echo ecosystem, and in general I've been pleasantly surprised.  The main thing that gives me pause, however, is that the assistant voice on the Dots seems quite muffled in comparison to Google devices, and for some reason, Amazon doesn't allow the EQ to affect the assistant voice, whereas Google does.  The result is a bassy-sounding voice that can be [difficult to understand](https://www.dpamicrophones.com/mic-university/facts-about-speech-intelligibility), especially with any kind of background noise.\n\nI've tried out Dots in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th gen.  2nd gen is best for voice clarity but worst for music.  4th gen is worst for voice clarity, but best for music.  3rd gen is somewhere in-between.\n\nThat being said, how do the full size Echos compare?  Do they also suffer from a somewhat muffled-sounding voice?  They have dedicated tweeters, which would lead me to suspect that the voices would be more intelligible, but I'm curious to hear the opinion of those who have owned both types of devices.",

  "Hi all.\n\nI have tested this now quite extensively, and I'm wondering if this is some hard rule they put into the system after that court ruling I heard about related to Sonos patents? (I'm not using Sonos devices, I'm saying Sonos has a patent on volume and speaker groups and Echo devices were affected by the outcome of a lawsuit. I have echo devices)\n\nI used to be able to set speaker groups volume in routines in the custom command field either by themselves or in a string with other commands with AND separating the commands\n\n**These for example, all used to work:**\n\n**5AM routine:\"set all speakers to volume 2\"**\n\n**Good morning routine:**\n\n**\"set all speakers to volume 2 and play 80s pop music on all speakers\"**\n\n**Good night routine:**\n\n**\"set all speakers to volume 2 and set volume 3 and ask sleep sounds to play brown noise\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow literally none of those work. rather, the commands work so long as the volume set commands are omitted.I can SPEAK these commands to the device and the speaker group volume sets. but it cant be in a routine.\n\nAnyone know of a trick or hack to automatically set speaker group volumes now that they've seemingly removed it? it's quite irritating having to speak the command after waking up, or speak the command before or after bedtime etc.",

  "I have an original Echo that came with a remote control. I like using the remote control at night, when I'm reading in bed and my wife is sleeping, so I can change the volume or stop the music without talking to Alexa. With the Echo, it's great - using the remote control is quiet, and does not risk waking up my wife.\n\nThe original Echo has been great, but lately a little wonky on its connectivity, which I can expect from such an old device. So, I moved one of my 3rd generation Echo Dots into the bedroom instead, and paired the remote control to it. However, now when I use the remote, the Echo says \"now paired to bluetooth\" when I first press a button. Some time later, after not using it for a while, the Echo makes a noise indicating it's lost bluetooth connectivity and if I use the remote again, I get that message.\n\nAm I doing something wrong with pairing the old remote to the Echo Dot 3rd gen?

  "So like the title says, my axon echo dot keeps setting my alarms to the lowest volume. I used to use it for my morning alarm and now I sleep through it. I don't have any routines set for this, but I did a couple months ago.\n\nI went away for a weekend and forgot to unplug my Echo, so my alarm went off when I wasn't home and didn't stop going off. My neighbor left me a very angry note about how they couldn't sleep in on their day off because my alarm was blaring with no one to turn it off. I felt awful, so in addition to promising to remember to unplug it, I also set my volume to stay at 2 or 3 so if I did forget it wouldn't be that loud. I have since removed these instructions and cannot find them anywhere in my Amazon echo app on my phone.\n\nBut for some reason, my alarms are now barely audible. The only reason I wake up at all is because we also use the echo to play white noise while we sleep and the white noise stops when the alarm goes off. So the sudden change in noise will wake me up sometimes but it's not dependable as a real means of wakeup. I have told Alexa to set all alarms to Mac volume and set an alarm for 1 minute later and it was so quiet I almost didn't realize it went off. How do I fix this?

I dont understand why this suddenly happens. The amazon echo is just like 1 year old. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.",
  "All I want is a device that would automatically start playing white noise at 12AM and stop at 10AM.\n\nThings I've tried:\n\n1. Buy a white noise machine. This worked great for white noise but sucked at scheduling. There is literally no white noise device on the market that has timer based turn ON and turn OFF.\n\n2. Google Home. This works great as a white noise machine but the routines suck. I've been unable to get the routines to start at a fixed time and I have to manually start it in the app.\n\n3. Alexa - This is fantastic in automatically starting and stopping routines. But absolutely sucks in continuously playing it for more than a few hours. It automatically plays some sound from some \"skill\" and each one of these skills have their own premium plan or whatever and don't let looping or play more than a few hours without paying money. All previous posts don't help anymore, they say \"oh just ask Alexa to play white noise on loop\" yeah I've tried various versions of this. Just doesn't work anymore in Jan 2022.\n\nAll I really want is to play white noise starting at 12AM and stop at 10AM. Is there anything that would get this to work on Alexa in January 2022? An offline soundtrack OR a free skill? Something please.",
  "I can manually go into the app and select the lights and groups and press the button to turn them on and off but when I ask my echo to do it, it doesn't work. Now for some reason it only does that to 2 of my rooms.

  "Hey Team,\n\nI have recently started to experience an odd change in behavior concerning my reminders. I use my Alexa system for quite a few reminders and in the past, the reminder would be announced from the device that it was created on, addressed to the person who asked for it (voice profiles are pretty accurate in my experience). This is all fine and dandy, and it's been like that for year(s). Then all of a sudden recently, last week or so, my echo devices stopped announcing the reminders like usual as far as I can tell, and instead do the \"notification arrived\"  \\*bla-doop noise and flashing green light. I ask what my notifications are and she says you have such and such reminders. The only time I used to get green light notifications was for amazon shopping delivery and Ring device low battery notifications. I did some digging through settings and I noticed a setting that \"If Alex notices you are away she will make it a notification for you to check earlier\" type of setting. It was on, so I'm assuming it's always been on and may be the source of the problem. But I also do like the thought of having that if it works, obviously if we are not home to hear the reminder it would be nice to have the notification pending to make sure we see it. Color coding the echo notification color/light would be really handy as well. So I could differentiate quickly between reminders, ring notifications, and amazon shopping updates. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I am sure I will just end up having to turn off the \"Alexa will know when you are not home\" option because it's not accurately picking up when I am home or not, even though guard is in home mode, Ring alarm is disarmed or in stay/home mode. Not sure what else may have changed to prompt this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny insight would be appreciated!",

  "Hi, \n\nThis has been asked before but I cant find a decent solution. I want a white noise skill that doesnt fade in and out  like they all seem to do and that isnt a subscription. I will not pay a sub for a white nose app, not going to happen, ever. It makes me angry just thinking about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, the one post I found that sounded perfect was from a year ago from u/last_rise that said:\n\n*\" I saw a number of people who had complained about white noise sound looping every hour unless you paid for the skill which often is an absurd $2/month for the popular skills. \"*\n\nThis sounds great I thought until I found that the skill is literally exactly what it says it was created to avoid. It costs an \"absurd $2 a month\" for the subscription that enables a 10 hour loop. It does say its 5 hours, but Im pretty sure thats not true, i tried it and it fades out well before that, I havent timed it but i dont think its even an hour. I could be wrong.\n\nWhat I do now is just stream from my phone via bluetooth, but I want to use it for my baby and that doesnt work because when i go away from his room it cuts out, and when i walk back it does the annoying \"now playing from galaxy s7\" grrr.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, thanks for any suggestions.",
  "I'll try to keep the backstory short, but it's important context for the question.  My FIL lives next door to us.  He's 80 and needs some help, which is why we live next door. My wife helps him with daily things like appointments, medications, etc. Her sister, who lives 15m away sees her father about once a year. This week, sister sent her daughter (our niece) over to my FIL and she set up an Echo Dot in the kitchen where he spends most of his time.  The reason given was that he could use it to call 911 if he fell (innocent enough).  Yesterday, when my wife was over there the Dot made a noise and then had a green spinny light on it. When my wife came home, we started researching and are scared that Sister is using the Dot to \"spy\" or eavesdrop and we are pissed.  Is it possible they're using this thing to spy on him/us? How can we make sure they can't eavesdrop while still having it running in case he needs to call 911?",

Is this normal?\n\n\\- Alexa sounds a bit distorted in places.\n\n\\- If I connect a Wii to the Line in, sound is ok (even when loud) but when pressing home, the high pitch menu noise causes a weird buzz/distort (even at Vol 1)\n\n\\- Ask Alexa for an instrument sound, when she asks what instrument, ask for Organ, this actually distorts/buzzes like crazy (if you can test and feedback if your echo does buzz/distort?)\n\nIt has the latest firmware and has been reset.\n\nBizarrely, playing music is fine from Bluetooth, watching YouTube and playing some bass tests, no problem sounds fine. Loud cinema trailers, even music, no buzz or distort.\n\nI never noticed with the Echo 2nd gen. Such a weird issue, I am starting to think there is a fault, or it's a bug.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading!",
  "I noticed today that I had to repeat several commands but I wasn't looking at my Echo so I thought maybe it didn't catch \"Alexa\" but I just caught a glimpse of it while attempting a command just now and noticed that it did light up blue for a second and then almost immediately went blank before I had time to say my command. I experimented by saying \"Alexa, nevermind\" several times and noticed that it does this fairly frequently (but less than 50% of the time), despite no background noise.",
  "I have had my echo buds for about 6 months. I really like them, but however when I double tap my Echo Buds it always says \"Noise Reduction On\" or \"Passthrough On\". The speech lowers the volume of my music and speaks over my music. Is there anyway to stop it from speaking when I activate the commands?",
  "I would love the ability to have Alexa boost or lower her voice response within an established range the user could select in the app.  It could even get fancy where you could calibrate it by maybe turning on an air conditioner or turn your tv on loud and then set the desired voice response level for those dB of noise environments...and then say when the tv is super low or off and very quiet she would do something closer to whisper mode.  I have a window air conditioner and when it\u2019s on, even on low, I usually have to raise my receiver volume a bunch to just casually watch tv, let alone when I\u2019m at moderate or high volumes over the ac noise...with both of these running Alexa has no chance.  I had to raise it one hot day last week and then forgot it was so loud and nearly crapped myself when the weather cooled and I didn\u2019t have the ac running.  I looked all over and couldn\u2019t find anything regarding this, besides a few mentions of calibrating Alexa on computers, which does nothing for me since I only use echo\u2019s.",

  "Hi again. Sorry to post again so soon (and speaking of, why do people downvote in this community? Like, was I off topic or had the wrong flair or something in my last post? I know different communities have different cultures and rules (I've read yours and I don't see anything that would apply here, but there are such things as unspoken rules), and I've been wracking my brain but I just can't understand why that post would get downvoted? So yeah, if someone could tell me if I did something wrong with it...that would be good...). I'm just having all sorts of trouble with my Echo Dot. I'll probably try asking customer service too, but after I talked to them last time and they were entirely unhelpful... I'm a bit skeptical that this will be any better.\n\nSo I guess I have a couple questions for now, and may add more later (I'll mark as edited if so) if needed, because my brain is super fuzzy right now but I'm really frustrated and just want answers ASAP. (Also please forgive if the tone of this post is a bit brusque. Trying really hard not to sound annoyed because obviously you guys aren't at fault here (and maybe no one is, maybe it's just a thing that happens), but yeah... sorry if it comes across that way.)\n\nSo here's the basic situation. I have major trouble going to bed at a reasonable time, for a number of reasons that I don't really want to get into right now. After some discussion with a friend and my parents, we decided that a good solution might be for me to put my computer and phone actually physically outside my room at a certain time at night, so that I wouldn't be as tempted by them. But since I use my tech for, among other things, my calendar, alarm clock, and audiobooks to help me sleep, we figured getting an Echo would solve those problems (and did this on recommendation from someone who owns one).\n\nWell, when it works, it seems to work pretty well.\n\nBUT.\n\nI have yet to be able to put my phone and computer outside my room as planned. Why? The short answer is that I don't trust the Echo.\n\nAmong other things, two of the largest culprits are that Alexa gets stuck in listening mode--i.e. blue and green spinning lights and no response, even after I set it to make a noise both when it hears the wake-up word and when I finish a request--and that it will be acting like it's fine, and then either I won't get a reminder, or it'll cut off speaking mid-sentence, or it will all of a sudden stop doing something and be like \"I'm sorry, I'm having trouble with that.\"\n\nExamples/more detail to follow, and feel free to ask for any details I've left out (but yes, I've tried the unplug/replug method haha), but doing research online seems to bring me to the conclusion that some or all of this is caused by a bad internet connection. But first of all, I haven't noticed problems with the WiFi on, say, my computer as often as I have with the Echo acting up (and my dad described the poor internet connection as \"sporadic\" today, when I would say the Echo issues quite a bit more than sporadic), and secondly, if it IS a bad connection... There are so many people staying home because of the pandemic right now, and the internet is getting overloaded, but like... I've got to be able to have access to my alarms and reminders at the least, no matter how bad it is. I mean, what if I had something important going on and the connection was bad when my alarm was meant to go off?!\n\nSo my two basic questions are (1) what can I do about any or all of these things and (2) do the alarms/reminders at least work whether or not your internet and/or WiFi is problematic? (I mean I'd really like to know whether it is a bad connection that's the issue or not, so I guess that's question 3...)\n\nDETAILS\n- Like I said, I've tried unplug/replug--several times, in fact. No luck :(\n- Have not tried factory reset yet... I will if I have to, but I mean...I just GOT the blasted thing like 3 or 4 days ago. I shouldn't have to reset yet. And also it would be a gigantic pain if I had to put it all the settings for a THIRD time (had to do it twice already. Long story, but if it matters or anyone actually wants to know I'll tell you haha. I just figured I'd spare you the reading and myself the typing unless I was sure someone did want to know)\n- Sometimes I can use the app rather than voice commands for things, or connect through Bluetooth and play my audiobooks that way...but that kinda defeats the purpose, which was not to have to have my phone/computer in the room\n- I'm definitely trying to put some of the issues I'm having down to user error (although why I can use the phrase \"Doctor Who music\" one day and get the Doctor Who album, and the next day and get something that is decidedly not Doctor Who...still puzzles me... *sigh*), but I'm just not sure how much of it really is? Idk, maybe I'm missing something super obvious here...\n- I do want to stress the fact that I know this pandemic is more or less unprecedented and that everyone is having difficulties...but besides the fact that my mental health is suffering rather majorly here...like I said, having a product that honestly only works when the WiFi is basically perfect, when WiFi is kinda hit-and-miss a lot of the time anyway... That seems like a bad idea. Idk *shrug*\n\nEXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS\n\nStuck in listening mode:\n\nMe: Alexa.\nEcho: *beep to show it's listening*\nMe: Wake me up at seven o'clock with Doctor Who music.\nEcho: *no \"you've finished your request\" noise; spinning blue and green lights, but not the ones that spin fast and seem to mean it's processing, just the ones that look like it's listening*\n\n*At this point, either I say nothing and wait for the \"listening\" lights to turn off--which sometimes takes...I would guess at least another 30 seconds, if not more--or I repeat my command or the wake-up word and, upon still getting no reply, give up and wait for the lights to turn off anyway.*\n\n--\n\nNot getting a reminder:\nI guess this has only happened once, but basically I got a notification on my phone, but IIRC, the Echo made a little beep or musical tone sound, but Alexa didn't actually SAY anything at all. Which, again, that's okay to put up with if you HAVE your phone, but...\n\n--\n\nCut off speaking:\n\nMe: Alexa, what time is it?\nEcho: The ti-- *silence*\n\n--\n\nSuddenly stop and say it's having trouble:\n\nMe: Alexa, play my audiobook.\nEcho: Getting selection from Amy's Audible library. *book starts playing* *after maybe 15-20 mins* I'm sorry, I'm having trouble. *stops speaking or making any kind of noise, lights go off, silence*\n\nOr even mid-skill:\n\nMe: Alexa, play Harry Potter quiz.\nEcho: *quiz starts; I answer one question and it tells me I got it right; then, all of a sudden* I'm sorry, I'm having trouble. *stops speaking or making any kind of noise, lights go off, silence*\n\nSorry guys, I know that's a huge lot of text to go through...

  ">No. The Echo units have two main \"modes.\" The first is a small firmware chip wired to the microphone that only contains about 50-60k of onboard memory. Its only purpose is to listen to the wake word, \"Alexa,\" \"Echo,\" etc. It doesn't do any actual language processing for this, but only listens for distinct combinations of syllables. This is why they can't be programmed to respond to arbitrary words.\n\n>Once the firmware chip hears the wake word, it powers up the main ARM chip, which runs a stripped down version of Linux. This startup process takes just under a second, during which time the firmware chip has barely enough memory to buffer what you're saying if you immediately start talking after the wake word without pausing. Once the ARM chip is on, the blue ring on the top illuminates and recording begins. The firmware chip dumps its buffer to the start of the recording and then serves as a pass-through for the mic. Only this main ARM chip and OS has access to the networking interface, in or out.\n\n>The purpose of this next stage is to wait until it's heard what sounds like a real natural sentence or question. Amazon is not interested in background noise -- that would be a waste of bandwidth and resources. So there is a rudimentary natural language processing step done locally to determine when you've said a real sentence and stopped speaking. It also handles very simple \"local\" commands that don't need server processing, like \"Alexa stop.\" Only at that point is the full sentence sent up to the actual AWS servers for processing. \n\n[I have pasted this from the Amazon Echo Reddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/wiki/index)\n\nSomewhere in this process a blue bar appears at the top of my HDTV panel and an audible ding sounds. After I say the wake word am I supposed to immediately state my command or wait until the audible \"ding\" completes. It seems that if I speak right after the wake command the audible \"ding\" sounds while I am speaking, confusing or making my command difficult to be understood by my Fire Cube, and if I wait it seems to take forever to speak a list of commands. For example, 3 or 4 consecutive audio downs, same with consecutive moves, etc.\n\nAny suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Also, that ding is very loud \u2014 is there any way to make it quiet.",

  "This only started happening 4 months into owning my echo dot, and recently I got another for Christmas because of this issue. Since then, my second echo dot is having this issue, too. I have absolutely no issues with playback with bluetooth earbuds, or my car stereo. This issue is just with my echo dots. Support told me to unpair and repair them, and to power cycle,  which I've already done which doesn't help. I'm at a loss, and if anyone could help me fix this, or maybe even recommend a comparable bt speaker for playing 10 hour mp3s of white noise, thanks!",
  "UPDATE: I created a new routine with the same info and set it to run at 2:50 pm. It did great. I am going to change the time to 6:55 AM to see if it will work tomorrow. I have now deleted the original problematic routine.\n\nI have a routine with the following steps set to start at 6:55 AM on weekdays.\n\n1. Noises, Power off. (This turns off the Amazon smart plugs in my kids\u2019 rooms that have their humidifiers plugged in.)\n\n2. Set volume to 4.\n\n3. Announce: Did you turn off the lights in your rooms?\n\n4. Wait 3 minutes.\n\n5. Say: Time for the school bus. Have a great day!\n\nFrom Living Room (this is a second generation Echo).\n\nThis routine never starts. All other routines that I have set to start at a certain time on this echo or one of our echo dots begin at the correct time. This routine evidently never begins because the smart plugs are never turned off; however, if I play the routine from the Alexa app to test it, it works fine.\n\nAny ideas?",
  "So noticed recently, last month or so after having to reinstall bluetooth drivers on pc and readd my echo dot, Alex keeps saying *now playing from (my computers name)* every time the computer makes a noise, for popups or when I start YouTube videos or discord chats. It's so freaking annoying. Any way to stop this?  Isn't never done this before. Oh and also it seems to be able to start and stop videos from playing",
  "Whenever Alexa is talking or I\u2019m listening to music I can hear an almost hissing white noise coming from the base of the speaker, it\u2019s very faint I can hear it when my musics on low volume, and when Alexa is talking (my echo is on my nightstand beside me). And the instant the music or Alexa is done the constant white noise seems to \u201cclick\u201d off and all quiet. Is this normal?",
  "I got the newest Amazon Echo (3rd gen I think?).\n\nWhen I play music, and lower the volume all the way down I can hear this kind of white noise. Is this normal, and apparent with anyone else\u2019s Echo? This only happens when the speaker is active, when the thing is just sitting there and listening it doesn\u2019t do it.",

I was hiding in a place where I couldn\u2019t hear my echo when my wife told me what was happening. We had never heard the song before but it was in alexa\u2019s voice and was unprompted by either of us.\n\nI was able to get her to sing the song intentionally later by saying \u201cAlexa sing a song about technology\u201d. Did Alexa mishear something from the background noise of our game or was this some form of advertisement? Does anyone have similar experiences?",

  "So I usually don't like loud noise/music as how if music is quieter it really helps relax me. When I turn down the volume on my Echo Dot to the minimum it still kind of sounds loud to me. Is there any way to turn it down lower than the minimum? Like an app or something that allows that? Because the only other way to make the music quieter is to put the Echo farther away, which I don't want. I don't want the music to sound far away, I just want it quiet.",
  "I got 2 third gen dots. I'd like to see volume control separated for music and Alexa.  I'm hard of hearing certain tones (alexas voice). I turn music to level 3 for background noise and she's whispery then.

  "I just switched over from a Google Home to a new third generation Echo. One of the main things I do is use it to play white noise while I'm sleeping. I made a playlist on Amazon Music that's several hours long, and setup a routine to play that playlist.\n\nLast night was my first night using it, and it seems like after an hour or so that the music stops. It actually woke me up, so I ran the routine again. When I woke up this morning, it was no longer playing.\n\nI've made sure that the routine doesn't have a timer on the music.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea what might be going on?",
  "A similar thread was asked 10 months ago but not a suitable answer.\n\nI have a routine that is triggered by camera motion, once triggered it does a number of actions.  So in theory it is an IFTTT & T & T & T & T. In IFTTT you would need to write multiple rules which is not ideal. \n\nBecause it is motion triggered and the cameras are running 24x7 then if active the routine can happen at any time, but I don't want this when I'm home. \n\nThe routine should only be active when we are out or in bed.  Therefore we need to enable it when we say Alexa goodnight,  or Alexa goodbye etc. And disable when Alexa good morning etc.  Therefore voice triggered and not time triggered. \n\nThe issue here is that you need 2 triggers.  Voice and motion but routines only have 1. Thus you need 1 to activate/disable the other routine thus in effect making the routine have 2 triggers. \n\nTo be honest you would think this would be an easy thing for Alexa to do. \n\nPeople have suggested using IFTTT but this is limited.  If Alexa (say a specific phrase) then Alexa/Ring do x but Alexa and Ring are not available on the Then options so not sure how IFTTT can work. Especially when half the things I want to do are Alexa based.\n\nAny help appreciated.\n\nEdit: 06/12\n\nLet me phrase the problem differently.\n\nI am trying to use Alexa like an alarm system.  With an alarm system you can do Alexa arm alarm.  Only when the Alarm is active will the alarm send alerts/make noise etc when motion  is triggered. I.e. the second routine is now enabled.  Alexa disarm Alarm also disables the motion detection part.\n\nWithout having and alarm is there an alternative way of doing this. I.e. Alexa arm alarm and only then having the  alerts. So sort of setting a status that has to exist for the routine to work?\n\nEdit 2:\nSystem is.  Amazon echoes. Ring stick up cameras. Energenie sockets and light switches.\n\nMore ring items to come including bell and alarm.",
  "I've been looking everywhere as to why this happens and from what I understand it shouldn't be happening at all.\n\nWhen I do a singular tap on my echo bud, it disconnects from my phone entirely. And it gets worse. I can't get the echo bud to play as the audio source again until I completely restart my phone. Doing a second singular tap does nothing. Doing a double tap successfully swaps between bose and passthrough modes, but still no audio goes through. I checked the touch control settings and there isn't even an option for a singular tap.\n\nThis one issue genuinely is making me want to return these and get airpods or something. Everytime I accidentally tap once, either while adjusting the bud or swapping noise cancelling, I have to restart my phone and everytime I get mad knowing I wouldn't have this inconvenience with a different product.\n\nDoes anyone know a fix for this so that I don't have to go through the process of returning these?",

  "A few months ago, my Echo Show stopped \"hearing\" me tell it to turn the alarm clock off and be able to set a timer for a few more minutes. For the couple years I had it, it worked like a charm and I LOVED the ability to turn the alarm off without having to physically deal with turning off a clock and telling it to set a timer. I got spoiled... I assumed it was the age of the device causing the problem and so my boyfriend got me a new one for Christmas. Nope. Same thing. I can't find anything much except for \"fixes\" that don't fix it in my searches. It hears me with every single thing except getting it to stop the alarm and setting a timer by voice. I have to actually touch the stop button (god forbid if I touch anywhere else, then it goes into snooze mode for an amount of time I do not want). I want to turn the alarm off by voice. I surely wouldn't pay $40 bucks for an alarm clock I have to touch to turn off, and because I'm basically blind without my glasses, I have to put my face up to the device to find the  \"stop\" button. I really believe there must have been an update as night mode also changed then too. I liked my mellow blue... Orange is totally NOT my favorite color.  I can't get that to change either. Can anyone out there please help me? I am so so so frustrated.",

  "I have an Echo Dot 5th gen.\n\nI created a custom routine named \"Custom alarm\" including:\n\nWhen: an alarm is canceled  \nAlexa do: 1. say traffic, 2. say weather, 3. say today's calendar\n\nI created a new alarm via Alexa app on my Android 13 phone and made sure that for that alarm the custom routine I've just created was toggled ON.\n\nI went to bed, slept through the night and when the alarm rang I turned it off with Action button on the Echo Dot. Result: the alarm went off but the routine did not trigger.\n\nNow, add hours of troubleshooting and almost 6 tries in the course of a week. That was my experience trying getting this to work as I want.\n\nI also contacted two countries Amazon support and none of them was able to solve.\n\nCould it be a bug? Should I return my Echo Dot?",
  "Was dead asleep in a silent house. \nAlexa woke me up at 5am, saying Goodmorning and then telling you how the people from avatar say hello in their language and something else I don\u2019t remember about the movie. \n\nI\u2019ve literally never talked to Alexa about anything other than setting alarms and turning the lights on and off. \nWhy on earth did she wake me up talking about the movie avatar. \n\nSuper creepy and strange",
  "Is there any way to use an Echo Dot (5th gen) with gradually increasing volume for a TuneIn radio station? Like those $10 alarm clocks are doing it? The only thing that seems to work is gradually increasing the pre-defined alarm sounds...",

  "So I have a repeating alarm set for 7:30am to go off daily. However, my job sometimes requires me to wake up well before then to come in to work. Is there a way to have it automatically check if I set another alarm before the 7:30am one and if it detects that I set a one-time alarm for, let's say, 5:00am, to then cancel the 7:30am alarm for that same day only?

What I would love now is a bed alarm (or bed occupancy sensor) that is compatible with Alexa. I don't want him to hear an alarm sound. I want him to hear something like, \"Are you getting up, <name>? Please remember to use your cane.\" He gets up a couple times during the night and just heads to the bathroom without his cane. This is the time of day he is most at risk for a fall. Any ideas?",
  "My echo dot, the clock variant, got updated recently and now it shows a countdown timer whenever I snooze an alarm.\n\n Quite frankly I don't care to know how time I got to the next alarm going off, I would rather prefer to know what time is now!\n\nI couldn't find any settings that would revert back this behavior. Any suggestion?",

  "Hello,\n\nI was looking for a programmable alarm clock for my kids bedroom (power user here). I was hoping to find something that allowed me to:\n\n* Program multiple reminders through the day (example: time to get dressed, time for breakfast, time to get ready for bed, time to turn off the lights, and so on...), ideally with different tunes and/or different pictures/lights.\n* Has some concept of schedule/calendar, so for example, I can program different times for the weekend.\n* Has a display that is not too bright / would not keep them awake if in their bedroom.  \n\n* Ideally, the programming is not via voice commands, but some app / api / website over wifi, so I can adjust the times/tunes/pictures from the comfort of my bed.\n* Ideally, voice commands can be disabled (don't want kids poking it with random questions, or using it as a toy).\n* No ads of course, some level of control of what they can do with it, ideally can customize pictures and similar to their liking.  \n\n\nWould the echo fit the bill here? I never owned one, but... all the \"smart clocks\" for kids I found so far are either horribly arcane or limited to program, terribly expensive, or both.\n\nThe echo seems cheap and extremely powerful in comparison?\n\nI realized it can even act as a zigbee hub, so it could in theory, eg, dim the lights automatically as the time to read at night is up? or turn the light off if still on late at night?\n\n(I wouldn't mind some modding / firmware changing / etc if it could be programmed to be something else)",
  "For those who have the 5th gen Echo Dot, can the tap feature stop an alarm or is just for \"snooze\"? I'd love to have it set so I can tap to stop an alarm instead of having to say \"Alex, stop!\". \n\nThanks! :)",

  "Whenever I snooze the alarm on my echo clock (via tap, if that makes a difference), the time disappears and is replaced by a countdown til the alarm will go off again.\n\nDismissing the alarm at this point doesn\u2019t stop the countdown, and neither do any commands directed towards snooze or countdown asking it to stop. To stop the countdown and get back to the actual time, I need to power the clock off.\n\nAppreciate any help, cos this doesn\u2019t seem to be a setting I can just amend\u2026",
  "I've resolved the issue but wanted to share in case anyone else has this problem. I've had a \"good morning\" routine for years. Lights turn on, alarm is disarmed, and Alexa says \"good morning,\"  the weather, and my flash briefing. Today, it wouldn't work. I tested my \"good night\" routine (lights and alarm) and that worked.\n\nAfter having to re-build the routine, it turned out having Alexa say \"good morning\" (custom phrase) in the routine is what broke it. So if you have a routine suddenly stop working that includes a custom phrase, try removing it.",
  "So at one point, months ago, my husband asked Alexa to have an alarm that goes off every weekday morning to play a Taylor Swift. We have since deleted that routine, yet Alexa still goes off every weekday morning at 6:30am and says \u201cSorry, I cannot find Taylor Swift in my library. Here is Taylor Swift from your Spotify\u201d and plays a song. Every. Single. Morning. Even if it\u2019s a holiday or we\u2019re sleeping in or not home. \nWe have looked at both of our apps and there\u2019s no routine for it or an alarm. When we ask her if she has any alarms for the morning, she says no. We have even factory reset her and redownloaded our apps. We cannot figure this out and it\u2019s been driving us CRAZY!! It\u2019s been going on for months and both of us have developed the habit of turning off our real alarms because we have to turn off her alarm every morning. Please help us!! It\u2019s an Echo Dot with the clock face",
  "At most it'll play for a second then snooze itself. More often it just immediately snoozes and makes setting an alarm useless. I'm not touching it nor did I ever set up a routine for snoozing. Is there any solution to this? I even switched it off of my Spotify playlist to one of the generic alarms and it still does it.",
  "This week the alarm behaviour has changed. When snoozing using my voice the echo dot now shows a 9 minute countdown instead of the time. When the countdown completes the echo makes the timer end sound, not the chosen alarm sound.\nAnyone know how to revert back to snooze showing the time and sounding with correct alarm sound?",
  "Every time I dismiss an alarm, I push it on the screen but even thought I click the right option it always snoozes for 9min and when I dismiss that alarm then it doesn't ring again. \n\nIs been updated to the lastest version of the software.

  "I was trying to turn my whole house echo network into an alarm/alert system, so I could give it a routine command and it would play a siren through the whole house. I haven't really succeeded yet. Has anyone else done this successfully?",
  "So I went on a 2-week trip and tried the (free) guard feature.  The results were less than impressive.  Admittedly, the SimpliSafe alarm and doorbell showed no activity and there were no alarms to test Guard. (It's 1st gen and can't communicate to the Echos.)  I also took my Echo Show to my dad, so I couldn't use video to drop in.\n\nThe audio-only drop-in to several Dots was not informative and wasn't sensitive enough to tell me if the A/C was running. While the SimpliSafe doorbell never lost Wi-Fi connection, the Alexa app told me that all of the Echos and the Amazon thermostat would not connect (so I couldn't reset the temp on the thermostat) the last couple of days.\n\nWorse, I forgot guard was turned on and after disarming the alarm, I spent 30-45 minutes dragging my bags and boxes in from the car and unpacking close to two of the Dots.  No alerts.  When I remembered Guard was turned on thanks to the ring colors, the Dot responded to voice commands.\n\nI'm just glad that I didn't actually need Guard to protect my house.",
  "I\u2019ve had a routine for ages that upon a certain trigger (either me saying good morning or any of our phones coming home) inputs the manual command disarm ring {1111} (not my real numbers) and my alarm is disarmed. \n\nRecently she\u2019s been asking me to voice input my code. This is fine when I\u2019m in the house in the morning, I can just say it. A little more difficult when I\u2019m outside the house. \n\nI assume this is a periodic check in of the code that its the actual person, but can I turn this off? It used to work as intended from last winter when I installed it, until earlier this week. I did have to rebuild my routine so maybe I\u2019ve not put the command in properly. \n\nAnyone got any ideas?",

When in bedtime mode, it can offer reminders about wearing pajamas, brushing the teeth, taking a bath, saying prayers, etc.\n\nAnd when it\u2019s time to wake up, it would gently play an alarm and ask your kid to wake up. \n\nWell, this sounds so interesting that even though I do not have a kid, I wish to buy it and use it myself.

  "I think this is technically a \"downgrade\" in amazon's line up but I saw the Echo Dot with clock for $30 at target and decided to replace my Echo Show on my nightstand with the dot.

The illuminated clock looks great in a dark room, it seems to float in the air instead of the annoying lcd backlight. There are no ads constantly telling me about all the unnecessary things Alexa can do and things I should reorder on amazon. The speaker is much less muddy and is more precise, the buttons click better and the actual device is nicer looking (I miss the hardware blue lights so I could know when it was activated) and it is much smaller. \n\nAbsolutely no regrets about leaving amazon's echo with a screen experiment.",

  "I'm autistic, and I use Alexa reminders to help me get to appointments on time. This morning, I had a doctor's appointment at 10:00 a.m., and a dentist appointment at 11:30 a.m. I had a reminder for the dentist appointment at 11:00 a.m. targeted at all of my Alexa devices and my phone. I did not make it home from my 10:00 a.m. appointment until after 11:00 a.m., and I missed the reminder because my phone was set to silent. Because of this, I missed my dentist appointment and ended up having to pay a $50 missed appointment fee. \n\nI would like to be able to force the Alexa app on my phone to ring an audible alarm, even if my phone is on silent. I could set native Android alarms in addition to alexa, but that seems cumbersome. I would also lose the ability to have the Android alarm actually tell me what it's for.\n\nIs this possible?\n*****\n###tl;dr\nIs there any way to force Alexa reminders to sound an audible alarm on my phone even when my phone is on vibrate or silent?",
  " So I\u2019m just wondering if my alarm that I have set on my Amazon Alexa app that connected to my dot will still go off if I still have my phone connected through Bluetooth? Ik some people are gonna say just turn your Bluetooth off. I would but I like to put my phone on the echo and use my meditations on there so it feels like I\u2019m just watching something on Tv cuz of the clear n kinda loud sound. It\u2019s perfect for me to use it for meditation. I would recommend it for everyone else to try. I feel like I go into a deep trance/a mediative  vibe. But last thing I personally have a problem waking up to just one alarm. I have my alarm through the sleep focus on my phone, then I use this app called \u201cShutEye\u201d it record my sleep and used thsi sonar thing to detect breathing and movement while your sleeping so it knows when your in the four different stages of sleep I forgot the first and last but the middle two is REM and Deep asleep. REM is where you get the most vivid dreams. And then Deep sleep is still dreaming but not as like good REM sleep. It\u2019s amazing\nng for sleep. I would recommend that to try as well. Myself I personally bought the year membership for 59.99 but it\u2019s only like 12 a months I think don\u2019t quote me on it lol. But yeah thats my other timer. It actually kinda has two timers. So it\u2019s called smart alarm. It goes off and make a very minimal sound that you pick (It\u2019s what your regular alarm is) it will takes you out of whatever sleep your in that moment btw a lot of the time people deep sleep all night and other nights they will sleep in REM or the other one which I think it\u2019s light sleep don\u2019t quote me on that lol that\u2019s why some nights you vividly dream all night and also a example is that when the times you wake up and you literally were just dreaming and wake up and try your hardest to remember every detail and sometimes you can a little bit and sometimes it\u2019s jus gone that\u2019s a example that you woke up most likely out of REM sleep. Another way you can tell if someone is in REM sleep he or she will have rapid Eye Movement that\u2019s what REM stands for lol and for deep sleep that\u2019s mostly snoring but sometime but not a lot you will snore in REM plus that\u2019s a sign of Sleep Apnea. Then when you go into the last stage of being asleep but you know what\u2019s going on around you but like u can wake up at any point. Not me lol. So that probably means no matter what I\u2019m always in either REM or deep sleep every night. But the Smart Alarm that\u2019s set on the shuteye app it has 15 min intervals up to 60 before your normal alarm goes off; also you don have to use it. Personally for me o use 15. And lastly the alarm I have that is usually what wakes me up and basically the reason of this post lol is the Alexa alarm. Just basically wanna know if my alarm on there will go off with my phone connected through bluetooth? If u read this I appreciate you for taking you time. It means a lot for me because you took time out of your day decides to help out not that smart 21 yr old\ud83d\ude02. It really truly means a lot to me for someone to decide to go out of their way and help me out. I honestly rarely get that so when I do I\u2019m just super appreciative. So whoever is able to help me out you\u2019re a legit saint and literally like God\u2019s Angel lol. Like when somebody does this safe stuff it just gives me this feeling in my stomach like a warm feeling of being cared for and just relaxing do you know what I mean? So I really really appreciate you and what you did for me like honestly i mean it. You\u2019re a genuine amazing person. I just personally think anyone who makes anyone feel the way I feel they should get appreciated so much and show that I appreciate them that\u2019s just the way I grew up. The golden rule lol \u201cTreat other how you wish to be able to betreated\u201d it honestly makes me happy when I\u2019m able to do the same for others as well gives me the same feeling when they appreciate me it gives me another amazing feeling so that\u2019s why I put that saying because I like to show appreciation because when I get it it\u2019s the best thing in the world. Please have a wonderful rest of your day or night!! :)\n\n-Shawn Samuelson \n(\u262e\ufe0f All about Peace nd Love\u2764\ufe0f)",
  "After the announcement that Amazon was allowing adverts, I jumped ship to google/nest. After having it for the past week, I thought it was a good time to do as asked and say what I think.\n\nFirst is the Nest mini Vs the Echo Dot.\n\nThis is the easy one. The mini, can do everything the echo can, except track your Amazon deliveries. You can still make calls (using Duo) set reminders and alarms, all the routines etc. I've only had one \"by the way\" so far from the Nest, and that was after I asked it to make an announcement, and it was to tell me that it now also sends notifications to the families phones. In terms of sound, the Echo wins, it can go louder, and has more bottom end. I would say that they stack up pretty much evenly, so it's not worth jumping ship for if you've already got one. I haven't noticed any difference in either hearing or responding to commands.\n\nI find it a bit more awkward saying \"hey/OK Google\" compared to \"Alexa\" and you can't change the wake word. I do prefer the Echo for that bit. There are more assistant voice options on the Nest.\n\nIf you mainly want it for music, Echo wins. The mini can't stack up to what the 4th gen dot can pump out sound wise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNest Hub 2, V's Echo Show\n\nThis is where Google wins big time for me. The screen does what you want it to, and pushes nothing on you compared to the Echo. It gives you a choice of artwork, a clock, or your photo's as a screensaver, and unless you tell it otherwise, that is all it will show until you interact with it. No dog facts, no recipes you'll never try, or \"things to try\" just what you set it to, and nothing else.\n\nLighting is far easier to control, tell it to turn on a smart light, and you get a menu that lets you control the colour and brightness, which goes back to screensaver after a minute of not being interacted with.\n\nMusic, the volume and sound quality are on par with the Echo, the Hub is slightly louder. When playing from Spotify (I haven't tried other services) it gives you a full screen media player, only going away if you request something else like a timer. \n\nSpeaking of which, if you set a timer, it goes full screen, so you don't need to keep asking how long is left. Amazon does slightly better with timers though in one regard, it will let you know how long is left on a timer on another device if you ask, but the Nest won't.\n\nMenus for smart home devices, reminders, and media can be swiped through, or away back to the screensaver. You can also leave on screen sticky notes for other family members.\n\nCamera, echo wins this one, only the Hub max has a camera.\n\nVideo, obviously YouTube is native to the Nest, but you can still get it on the Echo, and I can't imagine many people will be using either to watch Netflix or Disney plus so it's not really a plus or minus for either. I do prefer the Nest screen though. It's a flatter and less reflective, with a more natural balance, it also adapts far better to the ambient light.\n\nI've found that the Hub can hear me far better than the Show, I've only had it miss one command so far, and that was because I was blasting music while I was cooking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe app(s)\n\nThis one is pure preference. I find the Echo app a bit messy and a bit less user-friendly. Not a big deal for the tech-savvy among us, but I think the Google home app is probably better for the older crowd, most of what you need is on a single page. Voice training is like for like, both have been able to tell the differences between family members.",

  "I just bought a Amazon Echo Show 5 since it was on sale at Best Buy.

EVERY TIME. Just one distinct, conspicuous, audible, annoying beep- the same beep you hear when you change the volume on the clock, except I'm not manually changing the volume or have a routine that changes it and I have the gradual increase alarm setting off.\n\nI thought a software update would help, but the beep persisted even still. Also tried deleting the alarm and recreating it, but that didn't fix it either.

  "If Amazon came out with an app to turn our old iPhones and Android smartphones into what would essentially be like the discontinued Echo Spot (or current Echo Show) devices that would be awesome and I'd pay for it.\n\n* Always on display, with night dark mode showing time, alarm setting, weather, etc.\n* Heck, isn't Alexa available for devs to put in their software? Add Alexa to it.\n* Add a customizer to change this always on screen.\n* Charge for it, Alfred Camera should get paid for their work.\n* Still allow the video monitoring functions like the Echo Show for videoconferencing or checking on folks.\n\nThis would be great for caregivers like me who want to keep an eye on their parents. The device doesn't have to go on a nightstand, I'd like it in the kitchen if it had Alexa to set timers for cooking handsfree.

Everytime I tell it to turn a light on or off, it asks 'did you mean living room bulb one?' which doesn't exist.\n\nMaybe I'm being dumb and this is an easy fix, but I'm stumped!\n\ntried changing wifi and factory reset",
  "Hi!! I use the amazon echo show and use it primarily for my alarms in the morning because my iphone alarms just don't cut it anymore. However, whenever i try to dismiss my alarm, it stops, then goes on again shortly after! I am not saying snooze, I am saying \"alexa, stop\" and \"alexa, dismiss\" however it never seems to listen. It gets very obnoxious to deal with and I seemed advice in the past but it has come to no avail. Thanks!",
  "Okay.\n\nI'm trying to set my Alexa up to play a specific song by a foreign artist every day for my alarm.\n\nI've asked her to read back the song + artist so I know precisely how to say it and she continues to say \"Okay, new alarm set for (something completely not what I asked)\" even though I'm saying it exactly like she does.\n\nThe Alexa app on my phone doesn't have a way to specifically choose a song from Spotify, only songs I've previously had as an alarm.\n\nWhat is the trick, here?",
  "I'm seeing a lot of conflicting posts.. I have an Echo set up at home using my Amazon account with Prime. I share my prime benefits through household to one of my family members accounts.\n\nIf I get another Echo to give to them (and order it as gift so it isn't automatically registered to me) Can they plug it in, register it to their account, and use things like Prime Music independently? Or will there be a mix up of commands when we each use our echo's, e.g. if I set an alarm, it'll go to their echo.\n\nI can't really find definitive examples of people having set ups like this and it working as you'd hope it to.",
  "I have the first gen Echo Show 5. I see a second gen already on sale for prime day and I am wondering if there is any real difference between 1st and 2nd gen? I watched an older review video and it says that the second gen has one or two new outer shell colors and no audio jack in the back, but that was it. I use mine for mostly the alarm clock feature that the larger show 8s do not have. \n\nShould I upgrade or wait till after amazon sells the backlog of 2nd gens on prime day only to come out with a gen 3 later this year?",
  "I\u2019m so confused. Everything works fine, Alexa is hearing me fine, I installed Smart Lightbulbs today and ever since, if I say \u201cAlexa set a timer\u201d or \u201cAlexa set an alarm\u201d it just says \u201cSorry I don\u2019t know that\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve tried factory resetting, re-pairing, removing everything, it still 100% works with every other feature except those two.\n\nWtf?\n\n\nEdit: this is on an Alexa Dot 4th gen\n\n\nEdit 2: Okay, so now it\u2019s working. The only thing I changed is my lights were labeled \u201c1, 2, 3, 4\u201d and I switched them to \u201cLR 1, LR 2, K1, K2\u201d and now it\u2019s working fine. What the\u2026.?",

  "My echo unit has suddenly started repeating reminders forever.  I have some daily reminders  that occur at the same time every day.  Alexa did repeat the reminder a couple times and then stop automatically.  Now she continues repeating it forever as though it is a timer alarm instead.  I have to tell her cancel to stop  it.\n\nDid Amazon make a change on the process or is this a technical problem?",
  "Hope you are well. I'm really just now exploring things it can do.  Recently my mother had a stroke, so I'm just trying to think of things. She's terrible with technology. I got it set up where she can have alexa call my phone in case say she falls down and cant get to phone or something. Luckily I live downstairs. It's kind of shitty qality to be honest. But at least if she uses it, I know to either go upstairs and see if she needs something.\n\nI'm the accont holder and obviously alxa is able to call anybody she has on her contact list. Now my qestion is, can i download alexa app and call her echo and use it as an intercom between her and i? She loses the phone a lot and it wold be cool if shes sitting on the coch, i cold just call the echo i living room and ask her something.\n\nAre there any other interesting features of alexa that wold ve good to use? I showed her how to play msic and set an alarm. Thanks in advance",
  "I always use the web app in a browser on my PC to do things with my Echos. Yesterday I could set an alarm on one of them, as I have done for years. Today, that option on the menu is gone, along with most other menu items on the left. I've tried on a different browser and even a different PC.\n\nHas Amazon nerfed the web app?\n\n(This web app: [https://alexa.amazon.co.uk/spa/index.html](https://alexa.amazon.co.uk/spa/index.html) )\n\nEDIT - UPDATE:\n\nI've just spoken with Amazon CS. They confirmed that the options have been removed from the web app in yesterday's/today's so-called 'update'. Yet another update that... what's the opposite of an update... whatever. It's removed functionality instead of improved it. They say they will report the matter and hopefully resolve it... I'm not holding my breath.\n\nIf this change isn't reverted, I'll be returning four Echos on the grounds that they are no longer fit for purpose.",
  "I set my alarm with a musical artist every day. Sometimes and always at random the sound will not go on but when I go into the app it says the music is playing through my echo (2nd gen). Has anyone else dealt with this?",
  "I have several echoes through the house. When I request an alarm on one, it sets it on a completely different echo. Even though the requested echo's light flashes. \n\nAsk Alexa turn off a light. The light turns off, then several other echoes chime in that they cannot access the internet and perform the request.\n\nI have turned several of them to Do Not Disturb. Yet they still get used to hold my alarms and complain about not being able to access the internet. \n\nAny recommendations?",
  "Title should mostly explain it. Alexa will respond to my requests, for example \"Alarm set for 5am tomorrow\" but then at 5am, the alarm shows on the display, but no sound is made. She'll even snooze and stuff but all without sound. Which does no good for an alarm.\n\nThis came on the heels of a morning where the alarm was made as normal but the screen wouldn't respond to touch to snooze or disable the alarm. After poking at it for like 20 seconds is started blasting music from the last time I had used it for music. She responded to stop command but the alarm has been goofed ever since.

Only suggestions to use a music streamer subscription are showing up.   \n\n\nAlso, the Echo Dot seems to require playing a standard wake-up alarm prompt before auto-starting a music playlist? I don't care for that extra step at all. Why can't the initiating prompt just be the time, 6 AM)?  \n\n\nFinally, I'd like to keep the microphone / listening function turned off permanently (button on top, red ring).

  "Ok, when I bought into the smart home concepts, I naiively thought that this technology would get OTA updates and get better with time, after all the speech recognition done on the internet. But no, 3 years later, Alexa still cannot \"turn the lights and the pc on\"! NOPE! Has to be two seperate commands, has to be fluent and cannot use synonyms like computer instead of PC.

  "We have an echo dot (gen2) in our living room and an echo flex in the kitchen.  They are both hooked up to echo wall clocks so when they are running individual timers on them they show up on their respective clocks.\n\nMy issue is that our living room is out of earshot of the kitchen so if we are using the kitchen echo to time something thats cooking, we wont hear the alarm go off.  It would be good to have the timer on that device displayed on the clock in the living room too.\n\nI was wondering if there was a way to create a timer on two devices at the same time from one place. I.e. if you stand in the kitchen and say something like \"alexa, create a 30 minute timer in the kitchen and living room\" and it will make a timer on both.\n\nOr alternatively have two devices permanently linked so they always show each others timers.",
  "is it possible to have alexa play an alarm or audio file at a slightly different time every day (without a manual change)? \n\nfor instance play an audio file 1hr before sunrise?\n\nrelated to this question, it possible to write an alexa app that plays audio sounds at specific times of the day, such as sunset? so that a user that installs this app hears this audio on sunset with no configuration?",
  "So like the title says, my axon echo dot keeps setting my alarms to the lowest volume. I used to use it for my morning alarm and now I sleep through it. I don't have any routines set for this, but I did a couple months ago.\n\nI went away for a weekend and forgot to unplug my Echo, so my alarm went off when I wasn't home and didn't stop going off. My neighbor left me a very angry note about how they couldn't sleep in on their day off because my alarm was blaring with no one to turn it off. I felt awful, so in addition to promising to remember to unplug it, I also set my volume to stay at 2 or 3 so if I did forget it wouldn't be that loud. I have since removed these instructions and cannot find them anywhere in my Amazon echo app on my phone.\n\nBut for some reason, my alarms are now barely audible. The only reason I wake up at all is because we also use the echo to play white noise while we sleep and the white noise stops when the alarm goes off. So the sudden change in noise will wake me up sometimes but it's not dependable as a real means of wakeup. I have told Alexa to set all alarms to Mac volume and set an alarm for 1 minute later and it was so quiet I almost didn't realize it went off. How do I fix this? I swear I have no routines or skills that are doing this from what I can find.",
  "So lately my Alexa has been not making sound when I tell it to set a timer for ten minutes. But if I say set an alarm for 10 minutes it goes off very loud. My alarm and timer volume are both set to 10 as they are bound to eachother. Anyone know a fix?",
  "I was sitting in my living room watching TV. All of a sudden I hear drums like a pulse. Realized it was Alexa. Then a voice says \"Help Me\" Like someone was in trouble. It stopped after that. I told my wife about it. She didn't believe me so she started playing music on alexa. In the middle of the song, it stops, and the pulse sound starts again followed by \"Help me\". This was followed by other voices talking in what sounded like latin. She yells, out of fear, \"Alexa stop!!\" Alexa didn't recognize the command and the pulse sound continued until we unplugged it. This was 3 days ago. Last night I decided to plug it back in. After an hour or so, I walked outside to finish cooking on the grill and I can hear my wife yell, \"Alexa STOP!\" She ran outside and told me it had started again so she unplugged it. She wants to get rid of that alexa. I asked alexa if she had any alarms set or anything running and the answer was no. It was creepy. My wife does have a hobby that involves spirit dolls which I thought was just fun and games but maybe it's not. Anyone else have anything like this happen?",

  "I have an Echo Dot 4th Gen with clock, paired with a normal Echo Dot 4th Gen, either side of the bed.\n\nLately the one with the clock has been crashing overnight. The alarm doesn't go off in the morning, or rather, it goes off silently. The light ring is rotating, but there is no sound. Using the volume keys while the alarm is going off, doesn't produce sound. If I talk to Alexa, the light ring pulses as if it's responding but there is no sound.\n\nIf I unplug it and re-plug it, the alarm will go off, with sound, once it reboots. It's like it had forgotten it has a speaker. \n\nI have tried a total factory reset, made sure it has the latest firmware, have set the alarm to not increase gradually, etc. Can't think of anything else to try.

  "Whatever update I got recently... I hate it.  I use an Echo Show 8 as a bedside alarm and I don't use voice to snooze, but rather tap the screen to snooze or swipe up to dismiss (still hate I can't tap the top like the Show 5).  It recently started showing a banner on the screen saying that my alarm was ringing, even after snoozing with a \"dismiss\" button.  I tend to snooze a few times on the mornings I work from home and with whatever update happened recently, after the first snooze \"tap\" on the screen, another tap when it goes off again simply dismisses the alarm.  No second or third snooze.  I even woke up early this morning because it had been annoying me with this behavior and carefully tapped the screen, NOT on the banner or the dismiss button, and sure enough, after the first snooze, the alarm went off 9 minutes later and I tapped to snooze and it just dismissed.  \n\nSide note, I also frequently have the issue where the alarm goes off, I tap the screen OR tell it to snooze and it says \"Snoozing...\" then continues to go off at full volume.  That was an issue with my Show 5 and with the Show 8.  I'm about to dump this thing at our next garage sale and get the Google version.",

I might be able to live with the default 10 brightness you can ask Alexa to change it to, but inside the app the slightly brighter is nicer.  Doesn't matter either way when more than half the time the display just turns off after activity.\n\nAny tips at all would really help.",

I have the issue where it won't stop an alarm unless I specifically say \"Alexa shut the fuck up.\" Shut up without the curse does nothing. I've learned to live with those things because again, it's mostly just a clock that shows pictures (which it doesn't load half the time, because it's garbage).\n\nWhat I'm wondering is if anyone has issues where it shows the microphone lighting up but never responds? I'm sitting two feet away from the device. The blue bar shows the direction I'm facing every time.

My 4th gen dot in an entirely different room *over 20 feet away* has to stay muted because it picks up the command more often than the show. I searched the sub but didn't find anything specific to this - it registering the sound, appears to be tracking the direction of sound, but not responding at all. Internet is up, it sit maybe 5 feet from the router itself. Is this a common issue or is my unit just defective? I got it 50% off from Target and I still feel ripped off.",

  "I seem to be hitting ALL the strange situations with Alexa and home automation lately!  I was trying to help a couple of good friends of mine, last night, getting their smart plugs and lights sorted out with Alexa.\n\nThe really puzzling problem I was never able to resolve for them was with one of their Philips Hue lights. They bought a Hue \"starter kit\" with the hub  and 3 bulbs included. Got all of it set up and working perfectly in Hue's own app, and proceeded to set up the Alexa skill for Hue. Everything went well and it identified the 3 bulbs available to control, as well as the correct \"groups\" we created for the rooms they were in.\n\nBut they have an Echo Dot in the downstairs living room, and an Echo Flex upstairs in their hall. When upstairs, the Flex would say \"the device is unsupported\" when trying to control ONE of the bedroom lights, but the other bedroom light would turn on and off just fine through it. If you gave the same command from the Echo Dot downstairs, it controlled both properly!\n\nI tried removing the problem bulb and adding it back; same issue.\n\nAll I can conclude is that there may be some bugs/issues with the Alexa Hue skill and the Echo Flex device? I really don't know anyone else who ever owned a Flex. It seems like it's essentially just another Echo Dot except with a smaller, cheaper speaker, in a case that fits into a wall outlet. But there are other things I noticed it couldn't do, that an Echo Dot could. (EG. Can't change the timer or alarm sound to anything but the \"simple alarm\" default?)",

  "Hi! i have an echo show which i primarily use and enjoy for it's loud and reliable alarms to wake up in the morning. however, when the alarm sounds, and i turn it off usually by saying \"alexa, stop\" or something along those lines, it stops but the sound goes off again minutes later!! i am not telling it to snooze, but it is just so obnoxious because i will be somewhere else while the alarm is going off and it is real loud. any tips would be greatly appreciated!!",
  "Hey guys hoping someone can help me with this. I have ring door sensors on all my windows and doors that are connected to my alexa app. I have created individual routines for each sensor that will do things like; When a particular door/window is opened, all the lights will be turned on in the entire house, the alarm will be triggered, the sirens will go off, and I will get immediate text messages that there is someone that has opened that particular door or window etc . this allows me to turn on/ off Each door or window sensor individually so for example if I just want to open the sliding glass door to the backyard I can shut off that one routine for that door only.. Is there a way to create a routine that will allow me at night time when I go to bed to start all the routines that will in turn turn on all the door and window sensors that are already on their own separate routines? Basically can I create a routine that will start and stop other routines? If so how?  Thanks in advance guys.",
  "So I just got the Echo Dot 3rd Gen last night, it\u2019s my first Alexa Product. I have a lot of alarms on my Apple Watch and I wanted to know if it\u2019s easier/simpler to set the alarms in alarms and timers and then use the alarm trigger in routines or use the schedule trigger in routines. They do the same thing but which one is better/easier to set up?",
  "So this is kinda a weird problem. I have a, I thing 2nd or 3rd gen Echo Dot? Not the most recent one but not the first one. I live in a rural area and they're supposedly upgrading the Internet cables to fiber optic so there's been frequent WiFi outages several times a day, lasting from a few seconds to 15 minutes, for the past few months. However, everything was fine until recently. My Echo Dot got stuck trying to install an update and I left it for 24 hours and it still had the orange spinning light. I unplugged it and replugged it, which usually sets things back to normal, but it refused to connect to the Internet at all because I happened to plug it in during a WiFi outage. I tried entering setup mode on my phone later and seemed to have successfully set it up, but then it told me it was updating and has now been on the spinning orange light for 30 minutes. My phone tells me it's offline. This is incredibly frustrating as I have smart lights that I now have to go in and manually turn on and off individually. My Alexa is still running routines but I can't turn off alarms or reset my lights after they turn orange at sunset. Is it bricked? Is Jeff Bezos trying to get me to buy the latest model or something? Or did the WiFi issues fry it somehow?",

I currently have the smart things app doing all the alarm duties but I don't have a siren set up and would love to have it go off on my Alexa devices instead of just our phones as a notification. Any help pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

  "One of the echos (a 3G Dot in my kitchen) works fine, except for one thing.  Timers.\n\nIf I set a timer in the kitchen, and then attempt to stop it from any other Echo in the house, it doesn't work.  You have to go all the way back to the kitchen to stop it.  It's the only echo in my house that does that.  Timers set on any other echo will let any other echo stop them.  But the dot in the kitchen?  Only that one lets you stop timers set on that one.  \n\nAny ideas why?  I had a look through all the settings for the device, and nothing jumped out at me as a setting that would do this.  I initially thought perhaps it could be some multi room issue, but logically that doesn't make sense.  Even if the wrong echo picks me up as talking (which is happening more frequently, but I digress), in theory it shouldn't matter.  You should be able to stop any timer in any room from any echo.\n\nBut not this one, and I'm at a loss to explain it.",

I was in the pilot, and I got an Echo and have been using it ever since. At this point, it is fairly entrenched--reminders, alarms, turning lights on and off, and delivering music. I have a first or second generation Dot in the kitchen that doesn't do much beyond setting timers. \n\nMost of what I have is Apple, and I have a lot of Apple, including an iPad and a set of Air Pods. I am hard of hearing, and the AirPods have fit in beautifully with both the Echo and my Mac stuff for listening to music, news, whatever. In other words, I don't need the excellent speaker capabilities of the newer Echo. What I'm wondering is, will a newer device convey any other advantages? Help me automate stuff a little more easily? And will a Dot provide all the \"command\" capabilities without the elegant speaker setup? \n\nA new Dot with clock is on order for my bedroom, where I think it will be of help.

  "First of all, I hope ive explained myself, as im a mess explaining myself. \n\nLately ive been thinking about buying an Amazon echo dot 4 for my room setup, and i would like to use It with my external speakers. \n\nThe thing is those speakers are already connected to my PC, and I don't want to remove them from there, so I was wondering if theres some way to have both my PC and my Amazon echo connected to those speakers (pc through 3.5 jack, and Alexa through bluetooth).\n\nIs there any way I can do this? And if so, will It work correctly? Im trying to decide between the echo dot 4 and the echo 4. I prefer the echo dot, as its cheaper, and if I already have those PC speakers for music, wich are much better than what the ones in the echo 4 could offer, so I basically want the echo dot 4 just for the alexa function.

The beauty of this setup is the same monkey can  be used to trigger multiple routines \n\n5.

  "For what seems like months, I've noticed that the Xbox it just on, randomly.  At first I thought the kids were pushing the button.  But I began to suspect it had something to do with Alexa.

  "I'll try to include as much info as possible so it will be a little long but here goes. 6 dots and and an Echo Show have been working fine for about 2 months now. Actually, that's not totally true, one of the dots lost it's connection to the wifi after about 2 weeks and after trying every possible setting (with an online Amazon assistant), they agreed to replace it. The replacement worked fine up until yesterday.\n\nThere was a storm last night and a lightning strike fairly close to home which often knocks out the power in the local area but this time there was nothing more than a flicker and all the usual stuff that would power off or lose their clocks (PCs, oven, alarm clock) all stayed on. I mention this because one day everything is fine, the next morning after a storm, 4 dots are offline and can't connect to the wifi.\n\nThe fact that 2 dots and the Show still connect fine is the first puzzling thing. If the router was fried it would be fried for all of them but I have been having a few issues with my phone lately where I keep seeing my wifi connection saying \"connected, no internet\" but after going into the settings, it seems to come back to life and it's then \"connected\". So the router has been playing up recently which does lead me to the possibility that there's something wrong with the router but nothing catastrophic, just something a little odd.\n\nThings I've tried with the dots:\n\nStandard set up mode (5 seconds hold on the dot button). Connects to Amazon-ABC in the wifi options but then fails to connect to the router wifi\n\nReset mode (15 seconds hold on the dot button), won't connect to the wifi.\n\nChanging the router channel from 11 to 6\n\nChanging the wifi connection from 2.4GHz to 5GHz\n\nTried connecting to wifi 8 times in a row waiting for \"App Suggests Another Method>Connect SmartPhone To Amazon Server>Amazon Will Connect Echo To Home Network\" (from another post, it didn't give me the option, just kept failing).\n\nAll of these failed to connect to the wifi with either a timeout and back to the previous page to \"try again\" or just straight back to a page with the heading \"Connect your phone to your Echo Dot\" where the only option is to click on the link \"Don't see an orange light?\" even though I do see an orange light, (nice one guys).\n\nThe only thing that does work is if I connect the dot to my phone's hotspot which would suggest there's nothing wrong with the dots (from the lightening strike) so there must be something wrong with my router, yes?\n\nI've pulled the plug on the modem and router as well as on the dots but \"have you tried turning them off and on again\" hasn't fixed it this time.\n\nI've also read that leaving the dot connected through the Hotspot (with it muted) will allow for the firmware to be updated but I've checked one of the dots that's working and one of the ones that isn't  and they have the same software version, no mention of firmware anywhere, which is 6409852036.\n\nAnyone got any ideas on what else I can try before I contact Amazon?",

I was about to do a factory reset last night, but a new alarm for 5 minutes later worked fine, so I instead deleted all the alarms and recreated them, to see if that worked.\n\nHere's where it gets weird(er).

Took over an hour and many attempts to set up his voice ID through the Alexa app. Once we did, all was good. A couple learning hiccups, but no problems. Until today. \n\nThis morning, Alexa broke. Every echo dot in our house stopped working for my son. We have six echo dots and all were giving him the same message every time: \"I'm having trouble, please try again in a little while\". Except Alexa still answers me with no problems.\n\nStandard troubleshooting; turn modem off and back on, then unplug dots one at a time, plug back in and let it reload. No success. She still wouldn't answer him in anything other than that one phrase. \n\nSo, we contact Amazon. Follow their instructions, delete his voice ID. Once deleted, Alexa responds to whatever he asks without problem. So suggestion was to set up his voice ID again in the Alexa app (kids account has to be done in the app according to the app). Except this time, the app won't even register that he's saying anything. At all. \n\nOur issue is being reported to the developers and we await instructions and update on a fix. In the meantime so that we have particular functions, I added an adult profile with his voice ID which works fine.\n\nAnyone elses Amazon kids voice ID broken? What country?",
  "I have several Echo Shows (not sure which generation but I've had some of them since around 2020). They all used to show the day and date (as well as the time and temperature) on my home screen but one of them has recently stopped doing that (about the time they began displaying ads and all those stupid tips). \n\nAnyone know how I can get the day and date back?",
  "I have a very random collection of music in my Amazon music library. Typically I just like to tell Alexa to shuffle my whole library while I am working or around the house to get a little bit of everything. Within the last week when I say \u201cAlexa shuffle my Amazon music\u201d she is only shuffling my recently added music so I just get 20 songs by 1 artist with a few randoms mixed in. Anyone else having this issue? It doesn\u2019t do this on my phone, it\u2019s only through my echo. I\u2019m at a loss aside from making a new \u201cskill\u201d in my app to fix it.",

Her work calendar, and when I add an event, it goes on there, but where she adds one, it goes just to the regular Alexa calendar. I tried deleting my voice profile and then it just asks who I am every time I try to add something. Any ideas how to fix this? Thanks in advance!",
  "Was sitting at home and heard the echo do its notification sound, which is useful for deliveries. Instead of anything relevant, it instead asked me if I wanted to put an author I recently bought a book from on my follow list.\n\nI've had it add unnecessary statements at the end of my questions before but I've never had it outright ping a notification just to try and get me to buy more shit. I'm appalled at the audacity ngl\n\n(and yes I have brief mode set up and all my settings to be as good as possible for reducing this nonsense, it doesn't help)\n\nThe Google Nest I have in my living room is infinitely better than this crap, I'm replacing it this week",
  "I have my echo dot 5th gen paired with my Sony A90K TV with bluetooth (My TV shows the echo is connected and the Alexa app shows my TV is connected), and when connecting it, my TV shows the message \"Switched audio to Echo Dot\", but when playing audio from my TV, it doesn't play through the echo. I increased the volume on both my TV and the echo but that doesn't help.\n\nThe second issue I have is if I also pair my phone with the echo dot, it's now only connecting/disconnecting to my phone instead of my TV, even when I specifically say \"echo, connect to TV\". It looks like it's only able to connect to the most recently added device, because when I \"forget\" the TV and then add it back, now it's only connecting to my TV even when I say \"echo, connect to Galaxy S10\".",
  "I recently added an Echo Dot gen3 to my multiple gen2s, and I was surprised by the poor sound quality. I thought it was supposed to be better than the gen2 according to reviews, comparable to the Google Home Mini at least. But to my ear the sound is muffled, like it's talking through a scarf. Speech is much harder to distinguish than the Dot gen2. While bass is a bit deeper, the music quality is poor, unbalanced. Adjusting the equalizer in the app affects it, but doesn't really help the basic problem.  \nIs there something wrong with mine, or is this really how bad they sound?",
  "So I've installed the Alexa app on my android phone. My dot has been factory reset and it's spinning the orange light. I tried adding the device, and it came up with an error and told me I should do manual setup for 1st and 2nd gen dots. So far, I've connected to the Wi-Fi network for my Echo dot. My dot told me it was successfully connected, and I should go back to the app. I've gone back to the app, and I'm still stuck on the \u201cConnect your phone to your device\u201d screen. Now I can't progress through the setup.\n\nAnything I can do? Help is appreciated.\n\nEDIT: Fixed it. I turned off Bluetooth on my phone and redid the setup process 2 times, and it started working. It's all set up now.",

I have Routines set up that still work. I can still access all my lights and switches within the app. Voice commands for Routines work with my Echoes. I haven't noticed anything else broken except for this. I don't recall adding any new switches, dimmers, lights, Echoes, etc.\n\nNote also that Amazon is accessing all lights through a Hubitat Elevation hub. All that's working fine as well. Network seems fine. I have power cycled both the HE and the network. \n\nThoughts on how to fix this? I uninstalled/reinstalled the app. I am hesitant to uninstall my existing Routines for concern that I might not be able to reinstate them. I don't really want to rebuild everything...\n\nThanks.",

  "I've been using Amazon Kids+ for awhile now and really enjoy the features. My issue is that I recently added it to my Fire TV stick due to issues with parental controls in some apps not being the best. I was able to add one child's profile to the TV and create a time limit for viewing. Ever since I've done this the echo that belongs to this child will no longer allow her to access Amazon stories at bedtime on her echo. Does anyone know if the time limit created on the fire tv impacts rather or not they can access Amazon Kids on other devices once the tv time limit is reached? Should I set up a whole extra profile for the tv instead of utilizing one that a child uses with their echo dot?",

When I recently added a second TV I removed the old \u201cTV\u201d device from Alexa, then added both TVs using new names based on the rooms. \n\nAlexa will control the Sony TV using the new name, but will also still control it using the old \u201cTV\u201d name which no longer exists in devices. \n\nHow do I cut ties with the old name?",
  "Wondering if anyone else has had this issue or maybe a solution.\n\nWife and I have had several Alexa devices in the house for years, app on our phones, etc. etc. with no problems. Main usage is music, timers, and a grocery list.\n\nOver the past few months, with nothing changing on our end, our shopping list is a mess. I believe I've narrowed it down to this: If an item is added via voice to any of our devices, our shopping list has the item added and the sync appears immediately across our phones. Any changes made *locally* however, to the list on either of our phones (typing in an item, crossing off the list as we shop) is *not* synced.\n\nI made our list today by hand since I can't talk due to throat surgery. Cleared the 90+ items that were sitting there since crossing them off as we shop doesn't sync (I don't want to say I've gotten used to that but...) and proceeded to type everything out. 40ish items later, done, wife gets to the store and asks if I've made the list yet - she had a blank slate (since she crossed off the previous shopping trips as she shopped) but nothing I had added. I ended up sending her screenshots of the list rather than type it out again. Kinda ridiculous (And first world problem, I know, but still)\n\nAgain, nothing has changed on our end, but I did the usual song and dance of signing out and in on each phone, clearing caches, un/reinstalling, and every combination thereof, and nothing. Sorry Amazon, I'm not factory resetting 2 Galaxies - That's not gonna do it at this point.\n\nAm I alone/ any possible fixes? Thanks",
  "I have several Wyze cams, and I just purchased and set up an Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen) so my wife can easily and quickly view the cams to check on our kids.\n\n######The issue:   \n   \n* \"Alexa, show cam 1\"\n* (Cam 1 is full screen)\n* \"Alexa, show cam 2\"\n* (Cam 2 shows up in **PiP mode**)\n   \n######The only workaround I've found (without having to touch the PiP 'X' per the \"official\" suggestion):   \n   \n* \"Alexa, show cam 1\"\n* (Cam 1 is full screen)\n* \"Alexa, close camera\" or \"Alexa, go home\"\n* (Cam 1 closes)\n* \"Alexa, show cam 2\"\n* (Cam 2 is **full screen**)\n   \n######Giving compound commands doesn't work like you'd expect:   \n   \n* \"Alexa, close camera and show me cam 2.\"\n* (It responds \"Okay\" and closes the camera)\n* (It says, \"I didn't catch the other thing you said\" while also opening the cam 2 in **PiP mode**, which is the same as if I'd just said to go to the other camera, but with added talking)\n    \n   \nThe workaround is *okay*, it just takes an extra 5-10 seconds that it shouldn't have to.   \nThe obvious fix is to just give us the option to fully disable picture-in-picture \"feature\" altogether. It can't be that hard, since it was added with an update originally. Just an on/off option in settings. It's a feature that makes absolutely no sense on small screens like the Show 5 and 8.",
  "I've had my eye on a Studio for some time and thanks to the sale, a trade-in deal and Xmas voucher, bought myself one for a total of \u00a365 - not too bad.\n\nIn my setup I want to both stream music in a multi-speaker group (this works fine) but also have it as an auxiliary speaker for my PC, to boost the volume when I'm playing MP3s, Youtube etc.\n\nI'm having trouble with this second option. On my PC I have a virtual mixer, and initially set a 2nd output to be an optical cable running to the studio. Not synced at all.\n\nNext I tried a USB soundcard, with RCA to the 3.5mm jack. Still got an audible delay.\n\nNext I tried the headphone jack on my monitor, connected to the PC via DisplayPort. Nope.\n\nFiguring the issue was with the virtual mixer not being able to sync the outputs, I tried a physical mixer, main speakers on the main mix and the Studio connected to the headphone out. STILL getting a delay on the Studio's output. It's not enough that you'd notice it as the only audio device (still synced to lips on the screen etc) but you definitely notice it with both outputs up, as speech sounds (no pun intended) Echo-y.\n\nHas anyone noticed this before on a Studio? I got it to do an update straight out of the box, so there's no issue there. My use case is probably not too common so maybe it hasn't been run into before, but I thought I'd ask. If this is just \"how they are\" then I'm sure I can still find a use for it, but it's annoying as I had a grand idea of adding a stereo pair into a home cinema setup, but can't if they don't play nice with other cabled speakers.",

  "Hey everyone, just wanted to post a bug I've found with device groups.  \n\nI group some of my smart lights together to quickly turn on/off all lights; Example: \"Downstairs Lights\". \n\nAnyway, I started noticing that an individual light I thought I had added to the group wasn't responding. So I'd open up the app and add it to the group. A few days would go by and I'd notice a different light would stop responding. I'd open up the app again and add it. Rinse and repeat. \n\nFinally after the 4th or 5th time I was getting annoyed, and decided to try and figure out what was going on. So I opened up the group and looked at all the devices. Then I hit edit and noticed several of the devices that were listed in the group were not selected in the edit function. I backed out without saving and verified they were still listed in the group, which they were. I performed this about 10 times and everytime there was at least one random device that would not be correctly selected in the edit portion of the app.  \n\nI don't know why their service does this, but on edit it just randomly drops devices in the edit function. Then when you go to save, the device is permanently removed from the group. \n\nJust thought I'd share in case anyone else was having issues.",
  "Alexa's ability to understand and execute basic requests is getting worse, not better.  Years ago when it was first launched, it was comical when Alexa would misunderstand a request.  Over the next few years as a regular user adding home automation and following weekly Echo updates, the system was getting smarter and more intuitive.  However this past year, the system appears to be going backwards.  Simple routine requests are being misunderstood regularly.

  "I bought a centralite Zigby contact sensor and it\u2019s now connected to my Amazon echo 4. My plan is to install the sensor at my parents home on my mother\u2019s stair lift. When the stair lift is down then I want to send an email to let me know that she has arrived downstairs to start her morning. One part of the sensor will be attached to the chair and the other will be attached to the bottom of the stair lift rail. When the chair is all the way down then it will be next to the other half of the sensor and will trigger the closed event.\n\nThe problem is that Alexa does not provide an action that sends an email. I found a work around where IFTTT can monitor the Alexa to-do list and send an email when an item is added to that list. So I\u2019ve set up an action where alexa adds a \u201cswitch closed\u201d item to the to-do list whenever the contact sensor closes. That causes IFTTT to then send a \u201cswitch closed\u201d email.\n\nHowever this does not really work because the second time the switch closes Alexa tries to add another \u201cswitch closed\u201d item to the to do list which it cannot do because it\u2019s trying to add the same item twice.\n\nI tried creating a routine where it would first delete the \u201cswitch closed\u201c entry from the to do-list and then add it back again. That didn\u2019t work because it was not possible to have two custom actions in a routine. A custom action is needed in order to add or remove entries from the to-do list.\n \nI then tried creating two separate routines which both trigger when the switch is closed. One routine will immediately delete the \u201cswitch closed\u201centry from the to do-list. The second routine will wait 10 seconds and then ADD  the \u201cswitched closed\u201c item to the to-do list. This did not work. It seemed that two routines could not be triggered at the same time. \n\nMy conclusion is that I have run into a limitation of Alexa and that there is really no way around this. I\u2019m thinking maybe I could get a Zigbee hub which would then be able to detect the switch being opened or closed and then hopefully have the capability to send an email.  This has sure turned out to be a lot of work for what I thought  going to be a simple scenario. Does anyone have any . other ideas that I might try out? Thank you",

It is listed under both voice commands \u201cshutdown and shut down.\u201d I have checked that the routine is enabled, I have deleted and re-made the routine. I even added a third phrase, \u201call off,\u201d to which the echo show 15 perfectly runs the routine. I\u2019m losing my mind. What is it about the phrase \u201cshutdown\u201d that echo show 15 can\u2019t understand or refuses to execute? Any advice is greatly appreciated.",
  "I'm really getting sick of all the ads on my Amazon Echo Show. I have all the settings turned off so I should only see my rotating personal collection of photos, but today I saw an ad for \"The Family Business\" on BET plus. When I've contacted Amazon in the past, they said the ad was from the app provider who was sending it out and they couldn't control it, but this ad clearly said sponsored and was for service I don't have. It's so frustrating, I didn't pay for \"echo show with ads.\" Every time I see one, I use the app to send feedback complaining but they always have excuses.",
  "I have added a outdoor UME WI-FI Smart motion Flood light.\n\nI gave Alexa permission and have created routines thru Alexa and they work.\n\nI noticed a issue I can't figure out.\n\nThe motion sensor will stop working and appears it's not a wi-fi issue to me. \n\nI open up the Tuya App needed when installing this UME smart light, once I open the app up it shows the flood light off line and then it powers back on and it reconnects and shows the sensor is working.\n\nSo basically yes if I'm gone from home with the phone the motion sensor seems will not work, I have looked into it and nothing is coming close explaining how to address this issue.\n\nHas anyone had or have this issue and has fixed it? Is it a phone permission issue button somewhere I need to find?  \n\nThe Alexa routines still works during this bug issue.\n\nThe light is on 2-4GHz as well as my phone\n\nOnly thing I can think of is give up on this and just have a dummy phone at home with this app on it for the sensor to stay operating?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow's that?",
  "Firstly, I just want to say how much I love that Amazon Music gives access to so much stuff that's out there. The only frustrating thing is that I'm hearing a tiny fraction of that music because Alexa can't seem to shuffle properly. I'm getting so sick of the same tracks over and over!\n\nI can understand favoring the top hits when asking for the entire discography of one artist, but weighting tracks on a user-made playlist doesn't make sense to me. My taste in music is really eclectic, and I don't like much mainstream stuff, so I definitely don't want to hear the most popular / highest-paying artists first. If anything, I'd rather Alexa weighted tracks based on the stuff I *haven't* heard in a while.\n\nTo give you more context, I have a favorites playlist where I constantly add new songs as I find them. It has hours upon hours of music, but the sad part is how most of it will never see the light of day. Meanwhile, one of the four Beatles tracks I added years ago is almost guaranteed to play within the first five songs. I've actually started removing songs I've heard too many times in an effort to even things out.\n\nI wish there were commands like \"Alexa, shuffle my favorites playlist randomly\", or \"shuffle my favorites playlist by popularity\", or even \"play my favorites playlist in reverse order\" (that way I could at least hear the new stuff).\n\nDoes anyone know a way to solve this issue? Is it worth switching to another service that has a better algorithm?",

The illuminated clock looks great in a dark room, it seems to float in the air instead of the annoying lcd backlight. There are no ads constantly telling me about all the unnecessary things Alexa can do and things I should reorder on amazon.

That is the only \"home screen\" setting that I have enabled.  Now the Show is cycling through several different backgrounds/wallpapers with just the clock like 10 times before it gets to the calendar.  Then it cycles the clock 10 times again, and it even apparently throws in the occasional ad.\n\nMy first question is how can I get it to just display the calendar?  If I cannot get it to lock on the calendar screen, how can I make it cycle more often.  I'll be honest, all of the cycling is a bit of a distraction.  If I had this thing on my desk all day and was watching this thing out of the corner of my eye all day, it would annoy the hell out of me.\n\nMy second question is how can I disable any advertisements?

  "My dad is in the early/mid stages of dementia and needs stimulation. Since his kids live far away, we can't visit as often as he and we would like, so he tends to withdraw from the world. I thought that a photo frame running a slide show of his life, including photos of his early life on the farm, life with mom (who has passed) and kids, travel photos, and outdoor photo would provide some stimulation.  With his memory loss, a large number of photos would provide \"new\" stimulation regularly.  \n\nThen I saw an ad for an Amazon-refurbished 2nd gen Echo Show 5 and realized it was cheaper and had more features than the photo frames I was researching.  The Echo Show had more features like scrolling the weather, announcing upcoming games, and more.  We won't use voice interaction because he'd need the volume much too high for the comfort of others.  Importantly, I could filter out all of the \"Try this!\" pages that would probably frustrate or confuse him.\n\nIt has worked great, and he really likes seeing the photos.  The 250 photos keep him stimulated, though he remembers more than I had anticipated, which is actually good!  The downside is that it's small and hard to see from his bed or chair.  (Few options for placement.)\n\nSo I tried a refurbished Echo Show 11 (2nd gen?  square/triangle shape) for a much larger image.  It works well for this, but has loads of the self-advertising \"Try this!\" pages that the Show 5 filtered out.  The Alexa app doesn't control the Show 11 in the same way, so this is less than optimal.\n\nIs there a way to limit the self-advertising \"Try this!\" slides in Echo Shows outside of the app or in setup on the unit itself?  \n\nIs there a larger (10-11\") Show that has better controls to limit the extraneous self-advertising prompts?\n\nThanks!",

  "As of a few weeks ago, my bn link outlets have stopped being individually accessible in Alexa. I have the ones that allow both the top and bottom plugs to be individually addressable in the smart life app. Also the USB is addressable too, so when I add the device in smart life, it adds 4 different devices - the top plug, the bottom plug, the USB, and then the whole thing that controls all 3 of the others. All 4 can be named whatever I want. \n\nThen, when you have the smart life skill installed and linked to alexa, then these same 4 devices are imported into Alexa as well. \n\nWell, a few weeks ago I started getting server unresponsive messages on my individual devices for each socket. Alexa just could no longer control them. I tried everything to reset the devices (by cutting the power at the breaker temporarily - which is what I consider the nuclear option) but when they came back and reconnected to the network, Alexa still could not control them.\n\nI noted that smart life could still individually control each socket, but that Alexa could not, so my voice commands would not work. \n\nSo consider this an FYI, and maybe also a question as to why this is now the case all of a sudden. Smart life no longer gives (or Alexa no longer accepts) the multiple devices inherent in these outlets. Curiously, the device that controls all 3 of the others (the main one) is still coming over to Alexa, and still functions to turn everything off and on, but the individual ones do not. \n\nI have completely removed one of the devices from both Alexa and smart life (including wiping the data in smart life for that device) and re added it. Same result. It appears it just no longer gives Alexa all 4 devices individually anymore. Anyone else experience this with the bn link outlets?\n\n\nThe workaround I found was to create a scene in smart life that controls the 4 or 5 or so different individual outlets I wanted to group together, and then create a routine in Alexa to call those scenes. It's a lot more setup, but it does work. Doing this in Alexa is far easier (I just create a group with a particular name and add these 5 in, and then I can just say Alexa turn on Living Room Lamps and it works). Doing it in Smart life means I need a scene to turn them on, and a scene to turn them off, and then 2 routines in Alexa to attach to each, and then specify the words to say. Works the same, but a lot more setup than I wanted to have to do for each similar group. \n\n\nAlso, last thing, I contacted bn link about it. I was surprised that I called a number in CA and that a person immediately answered who asked for my question and started giving me troubleshooting ideas. She knew her stuff too! She hadn't heard about this issue (which is mostly why I wanted to call to find out) but gave me some suggestions I immediately tried, but no luck. Ultimately this is between smart life and Alexa it seems.",

  "Echo Show 15 is on sale, and I badly want it to work for me as a home hub in our basement or a tablet replacement in the kitchen, but not sure how a lot of it works and the reviews I've read seem to assume I already know how things work. So I figured I would try here..\n\n1. How do calendars, tasks, etc. work? What are they synced with etc. I primarily use Google Calendar; what would I need to do to get my events to show up on the widget?\n\n2. Does the Show 15 have proper 'apps' or a store of any sort?  Reviews and videos often site Netflix support and some other stuff... what about Disney+ or other streaming services that my family may want to watch? How about other apps like a web browser to more easily browse recipes, search the web, or control my home through Home Assistant?\n\n3. Is there any media type widget for media playing NOT on the show itself? e.g. if I'm using spotify connect on a different speaker, or use Sonos, am I able to see what is playing or control it through the Show?\n\nWe currently have a Nest Hub in one corner of the kitchen, and an inverted chromebook mounted under the cabinets in another corner of our kitchen. I'd really like to replace both with something that can do it all and live on the counter. The show 15 seems like a great size and I love the styling of it, but I'm afraid it's going to be too much Nest Hub and not enough chromebook/tablet to use as a kitchen smart device. I'm also afraid that my current (mostly) lack of amazon ecosystem will harm me. I do have Prime, I have an echo dot or 2, the amazon microwave smart oven thing, and Alexa added to my sonos speakers, so I'm not Totally out of the ecosystem, but I also don't think my wife and I have separate profiles set up, calendars or photos being synced to amazon currently, stuff like that.\n\nSo any help would be greatly appreciated in explaining how friendly the ecosystem is to sync to, how much I'll have to \"buy in\" to the ecosystem, and how restrictive the Show OS is compared to something like a tablet. I'm also considering the Fire HD 10 Plus with Wireless dock as a potential kitchen hub, but I like that aesthetic a lot less and the smaller screen will certainly display a lot less at a glance for this kitchen use.",
  "I have an Echo Flex with a Motion Sensor with a routine set to turn on two smart bulbs when activated and send an notification that they have been triggered.

  "**SOLUTION:**\n\n1. Unplug all Echos without a Zigbee bridge (Echo Flex, Echo Dot etc.)\n2. Reset all bulbs and plugs (in the Alexa app: add new Hue device, then press on the question mark on the first screen, look for the reset link, put in the bulb's serial number)\n3. Add bulbs/plugs with the Alexa app\n\nThis way they will be connected as Zigbee devices only and stop emitting a Bluetooth signal after 30 minutes instead of emitting it continuously.\n\n**POSSIBLE CAUSE:** My bulbs were connected both to Bluetooth and Zigbee at the same time (?), probably because I added some of them in the Hue Bluetooth app earlier. Even after deleting them from the Hue app they continuously emitted a Bluetooth signal.\n\n===============\n\n**ORIGINAL POST:**\n\nHi there!\n\nI got a couple of Echos with and without a Zigbee bridge, multiple Hue Bluetooth/Zigbee bulbs and Zigbee devices like a thermostat and a power strip. It seems like my Hue bulbs are all connected via Bluetooth to my Zigbee and non-Zigbee Echos though because they are continuously emitting a Bluetooth signal. I tried to reset some of them and pair them close to my Echo Studio but the Bluetooth signal didn't go away, even after 30 minutes or so - except for one single bulb connected to a Zigbee Echo; this is not the case with other Hue Zigbee/Bluetooth bulbs that are connected to a Zigbee Echo.\n\nAlso, what's strange, is that if I turn off all my Zigbee Echos and only keep those Echos without a Zigbee bridge, I cannot control the Hue bulbs in the Alexa app anymore - except for one single Hue bulb in my hallway (with a continuous Bluetooth signal).\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Can I check what protocol a bulb is using?\n2. Would you recommend Zigbee or Bluetooth with an Echo Zigbee bridge (and without a Hue bridge)?",

  "I seem to be hitting ALL the strange situations with Alexa and home automation lately!  I was trying to help a couple of good friends of mine, last night, getting their smart plugs and lights sorted out with Alexa.\n\nThe really puzzling problem I was never able to resolve for them was with one of their Philips Hue lights. They bought a Hue \"starter kit\" with the hub  and 3 bulbs included. Got all of it set up and working perfectly in Hue's own app, and proceeded to set up the Alexa skill for Hue. Everything went well and it identified the 3 bulbs available to control, as well as the correct \"groups\" we created for the rooms they were in.\n\nBut they have an Echo Dot in the downstairs living room, and an Echo Flex upstairs in their hall. When upstairs, the Flex would say \"the device is unsupported\" when trying to control ONE of the bedroom lights, but the other bedroom light would turn on and off just fine through it. If you gave the same command from the Echo Dot downstairs, it controlled both properly!\n\nI tried removing the problem bulb and adding it back; same issue.\n\nAll I can conclude is that there may be some bugs/issues with the Alexa Hue skill and the Echo Flex device? I really don't know anyone else who ever owned a Flex. It seems like it's essentially just another Echo Dot except with a smaller, cheaper speaker, in a case that fits into a wall outlet. But there are other things I noticed it couldn't do, that an Echo Dot could. (EG. Can't change the timer or alarm sound to anything but the \"simple alarm\" default?)",

  " Hello. This issue started happening this week.\n\nI wake up and ask the Amazon Echo device to play a local talk radio station on the \"everywhere\" group, so I can hear it throughout my house.

I added the Glow to the routine to extend some opportunity to see the \u201cmail\u2019s here\u201d light after the announcement, but other routines use the Glow similarly with different colors, so if any of those have been triggered after the mail arrives, I\u2019m none the wiser.\n\nI\u2019d love to be able to declare a variable to track if the mailbox has been opened (Ie: add a step to the above routine that sets \u201cmailHasArrived\u201d to TRUE or 1 or whatever is supported) and set up a separate routine that quietly runs at midnight every night to reset that variable back to FALSE/0/etc.\n\nThis is table stakes in a platform like Apple shortcuts.

  "So I've had an Echo Show 10 in the kitchen area of my home for a few months now. My wife has had it and wants the show gone. \n\nThe problem is what shows up on the screen and our children. We have a few young children including one that can ready pretty well. (Sorry purposefully trying to be vague because this is the internet.) We keep having problems with things like:\n\n\\-Alexa showed a news headline about a school shooting awhile back. My oldest child read it and let the entire family know about kids shooting others at school and went on and on about it. This was not the way we wanted to inform our young children about these types of situations.\n\n\\-Alexa ad's for TV shows we don't want our kids to ever watch or really even know about\n\n\\-If I take a photo or screenshot something on my phone it's on the Alexa a day later. Which is fun for pictures of the kids. This is less fun when I screenshot a meme that isn't appropriate for children. (This I think I know how to control. But is still part of the problem.)\n\n\\-Kids ask for something benign like, \"show me a video with Dinosaurs\" and Alexas pulls up a video with Dinosaurs that is clearly not appropriate for children.   \n\n\nI haven't tried enabling a \"kids mode\" (I assume there is one) because the Echo is not just for the kids. I want it as a family device.\n\nIs the answer here just that an Echo with a screen cannot serve adults and children at the same time? Maybe the answer to that seems like an obvious \"yes\". But I don't think it is too much to ask to have an option to limit the types of ad's and other things an Echo Show will have up on the screen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - because of children, I would like an option to limit the types of ad's and other things an Echo Show will have up on the screen. Is this possible?",
  "Every time the power goes out the devices come back on a little wonky. \n\nAnd ongoing problem I have currently is that the Alexa app is adding and removing bulbs and switches to my group. \n\nMy master group has worked fine for several years. \n\nThen suddenly, with no change (but perhaps after a power outage) I would turn off my master lights and only 1/2 would turn off. But so would a light in the living room. \n\nI went into the group and re-added the missing items and removed (unchecked) the extra. All looked good. Until I hit save and the confirmation page has the removed items added back in. \n\nSo I deleted the group and started over. Added: master fan, stairs top, master light. \n\nHit save. And the group saves as:\n\nMaster fan, desk 1, desk 2\n\nI have no idea why it keeps adding the desk bulbs and removing the stairs bulb!\n\nThis has been going on for several months.

  "I have an annoying issue and wondered if anyone has experienced anything like this. \n\nI have a custom routine setup on my Echo Show whereby when my Arlo smart doorbell is pressed, it asks the Show via a \u201cvoice\u201d command to display the live view of a Blink camera I have outside. This worked up until recently, but now when the doorbell is pressed Alexa says \u201cOkay, Okay\u201d and then \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what went wrong\u201d in quick succession, typically without activating the live view for the camera. It weirdly says \u201cOkay\u201d twice even though I have brief mode turned on. Looking at the activity log shows the routine triggering twice every time it runs. \n\nI previously encountered an issue with the live view not working when the camera was \u201cbusy\u201d doing something else. For example, if the camera is armed and motion was detected on it would do the same thing. However, now I have motion detection turned off so I am not sure what is causing this. I also tried adding a 5 sec wait command and this seemingly hasn\u2019t improved things. \n\nFor reference, manually asking the Show to display the Blink camera live view works 100% of the time. As does manually triggering my custom routine via the Alexa iOS app. So the issue seems to be the connection between the trigger point (ie the Arlo doorbell being pressed) and the Echo Show, possibly that it is trying to trigger the routine twice in quick succession. I\u2019ve tried disabling and enabling the relevant skills, and also deleted / re-added the devices. I\u2019ve also tried, remaking the routine, power cycling the Show, resetting the Show to factory default and then updating the firmware. It\u2019s the same annoying issue each time. \n\nAny ideas what is wrong? It is driving me crazy that nothing has changed.",

I'm going to get calls on this all day, every day, until it's fixed; that music is one of her only forms of entertainment (she's blind and can't operate hardly anything else).\n\nI could re-register the device as one of my own; It wouldn't hurt me or anything. I have purchasing turned off and all that jazz.  But I'm afraid if I do that I'll have to set up the wifi again and it's very, VERY difficult to get an IT person at her facility if it doesn't go well.  I'm sure she'll end up with no Echo at all for at least a week or more if I have a problem resetting the wifi.  So any suggestions short of that would be appreciated.",
  "1st gen Dot we\u2019ve had for years, mostly to play music while we sleep. Last night it was fine, tonight it suddenly wants to play ads.

  "TLDR: Does anyone know of Skills that will perform Announcements to other Amazon accounts not within our Amazon Household?\n\nLike many of you, I have had problems with Spotify and Amazon Household playing nice together. We now have 6 Alexa devices in our home with my wife and 4 kids. Here is the problem: Amazon has 3 kinds of profiles. 1 Normal, 2 Teen, 3 Child. Teen and Child are just profiles that are added to a normal Amazon account and not individual accounts themselves. We have Spotify Premium and each family member has their own account. You can only attach a Spotify account to an Amazon account, not a profile under an account (teen, child). Amazon Household can only contain two \"adult\" accounts. We could create normal ghost amazon accounts for the kids and attach their Spotify so they each can stream different music, but then we lose out out on some of the Amazon Household features, most importantly the Announcement feature (which we use often with a disabled family member using it to communicate messages across multiple device).\n\nThere is an option within Spotify to stream to a device and then add the Alexa as a bluetooth speaker. This is somewhat janky and I have had problems with it. This also makes it so the voice commands for Alexa to play music is not going to work. This option is definitely not very user friendly.\n\nDoes anyone know of Skills that can replicate the Announcement feature to send messages to other Amazon Accounts? This would be the cleanest solution for us as everyone could have their own device with their own Spotify account linked and be able to play different music on their own device at the same time.

  "Kind of self explanatory title, but also wondering if others have had this experience. \n\nTLDR; Alexa Kids account not working, removed voice ID so Alexa responds to child, issue has been reported to the developers by customer support. Located in Aus, unsure if bigger problem or just us. \n\nI first set up a profile for my son on Christmas day, enabled Amazon kids. Took over an hour and many attempts to set up his voice ID through the Alexa app. Once we did, all was good. A couple learning hiccups, but no problems. Until today. \n\nThis morning, Alexa broke. Every echo dot in our house stopped working for my son. We have six echo dots and all were giving him the same message every time: \"I'm having trouble, please try again in a little while\". Except Alexa still answers me with no problems.\n\nStandard troubleshooting; turn modem off and back on, then unplug dots one at a time, plug back in and let it reload. No success. She still wouldn't answer him in anything other than that one phrase. \n\nSo, we contact Amazon. Follow their instructions, delete his voice ID. Once deleted, Alexa responds to whatever he asks without problem. So suggestion was to set up his voice ID again in the Alexa app (kids account has to be done in the app according to the app). Except this time, the app won't even register that he's saying anything. At all. \n\nOur issue is being reported to the developers and we await instructions and update on a fix. In the meantime so that we have particular functions, I added an adult profile with his voice ID which works fine.\n\nAnyone elses Amazon kids voice ID broken? What country?",

  "Wondering if anyone else has had this issue or maybe a solution.\n\nWife and I have had several Alexa devices in the house for years, app on our phones, etc. etc. with no problems. Main usage is music, timers, and a grocery list.\n\nOver the past few months, with nothing changing on our end, our shopping list is a mess. I believe I've narrowed it down to this: If an item is added via voice to any of our devices, our shopping list has the item added and the sync appears immediately across our phones. Any changes made *locally* however, to the list on either of our phones (typing in an item, crossing off the list as we shop) is *not* synced.\n\nI made our list today by hand since I can't talk due to throat surgery. Cleared the 90+ items that were sitting there since crossing them off as we shop doesn't sync (I don't want to say I've gotten used to that but...) and proceeded to type everything out. 40ish items later, done, wife gets to the store and asks if I've made the list yet - she had a blank slate (since she crossed off the previous shopping trips as she shopped) but nothing I had added. I ended up sending her screenshots of the list rather than type it out again. Kinda ridiculous (And first world problem, I know, but still)\n\nAgain, nothing has changed on our end, but I did the usual song and dance of signing out and in on each phone, clearing caches, un/reinstalling, and every combination thereof, and nothing. Sorry Amazon, I'm not factory resetting 2 Galaxies - That's not gonna do it at this point.\n\nAm I alone/ any possible fixes? Thanks",

Today he asked alexa to play a song and she wouldn't play it on his due to explicit content filter but she did play it on my echo in the adjacent room.  They are not part of a group.

For example, let's say when I say \"quiet volume\" I want the stereo pair set to 2, the Studio set to 1 and the Plus set to 1.\n\nUntil I added the Studio today I had just created a routine that changed the volume of the device I was speaking to, and at the end of the routine had a custom line for it to change the volume of the stereo pair also. Now that I have a third in the mix though, and routines only let you have one custom line, I'm not sure how to go about doing this.

  "I bought a centralite Zigby contact sensor and it\u2019s now connected to my Amazon echo 4. My plan is to install the sensor at my parents home on my mother\u2019s stair lift. When the stair lift is down then I want to send an email to let me know that she has arrived downstairs to start her morning. One part of the sensor will be attached to the chair and the other will be attached to the bottom of the stair lift rail. When the chair is all the way down then it will be next to the other half of the sensor and will trigger the closed event.\n\nThe problem is that Alexa does not provide an action that sends an email. I found a work around where IFTTT can monitor the Alexa to-do list and send an email when an item is added to that list. So I\u2019ve set up an action where alexa adds a \u201cswitch closed\u201d item to the to-do list whenever the contact sensor closes. That causes IFTTT to then send a \u201cswitch closed\u201d email.\n\nHowever this does not really work because the second time the switch closes Alexa tries to add another \u201cswitch closed\u201d item to the to do list which it cannot do because it\u2019s trying to add the same item twice.\n\nI tried creating a routine where it would first delete the \u201cswitch closed\u201c entry from the to do-list and then add it back again. That didn\u2019t work because it was not possible to have two custom actions in a routine. A custom action is needed in order to add or remove entries from the to-do list.\n \nI then tried creating two separate routines which both trigger when the switch is closed. One routine will immediately delete the \u201cswitch closed\u201centry from the to do-list. The second routine will wait 10 seconds and then ADD  the \u201cswitched closed\u201c item to the to-do list. This did not work. It seemed that two routines could not be triggered at the same time. \n\nMy conclusion is that I have run into a limitation of Alexa and that there is really no way around this. I\u2019m thinking maybe I could get a Zigbee hub which would then be able to detect the switch being opened or closed and then hopefully have the capability to send an email.

  "I am totally new to the Echo universe.  I bought a Echo Show 8 for my 9 year old to access music since he does not have a cell phone and we don't plan on getting him one. I have added him to our Amazon Music family plan (a whole other problem because he is under 13). Well, is it possible to view the Amazon Music (AM) interface to browse music, save albums and songs to a library, create playlists?  From what I am seeing, is that this device does not do that.  We can talk to it and ask to play a particular artist or song.  The only browse capability are these stupid boxes that show generic stations or playlists. That is useless.  The kid is starting with a completely blank slate; he needs a way to browse and save stuff into his own library.  I can't even get him logged into the PC AM app because it won't let him.  He needs an account for those 13 and over and I can't create that because he needs a phone number to verify...which he does not have and I can't use mine because its connected to my account.  And even if this was just for me, how would I access such an interface?  Because if this is it, forget it!  Please let me know if I cam missing something. I am not finding anything on YouTube or Google.  \nThanks.",

When I ask what is on my calendar (Linked Google Calendar) it says I have no events. I have multiple events coming up.

  "Firstly, I just want to say how much I love that Amazon Music gives access to so much stuff that's out there. The only frustrating thing is that I'm hearing a tiny fraction of that music because Alexa can't seem to shuffle properly. I'm getting so sick of the same tracks over and over!\n\nI can understand favoring the top hits when asking for the entire discography of one artist, but weighting tracks on a user-made playlist doesn't make sense to me. My taste in music is really eclectic, and I don't like much mainstream stuff, so I definitely don't want to hear the most popular / highest-paying artists first. If anything, I'd rather Alexa weighted tracks based on the stuff I *haven't* heard in a while.\n\nTo give you more context, I have a favorites playlist where I constantly add new songs as I find them. It has hours upon hours of music, but the sad part is how most of it will never see the light of day. Meanwhile, one of the four Beatles tracks I added years ago is almost guaranteed to play within the first five songs. I've actually started removing songs I've heard too many times in an effort to even things out.\n\nI wish there were commands like \"Alexa, shuffle my favorites playlist randomly\", or \"shuffle my favorites playlist by popularity\", or even \"play my favorites playlist in reverse order\" (that way I could at least hear the new stuff).\n\nDoes anyone know a way to solve this issue? Is it worth switching to another service that has a better algorithm?",

The illuminated clock looks great in a dark room, it seems to float in the air instead of the annoying lcd backlight.

That is the only \"home screen\" setting that I have enabled.  Now the Show is cycling through several different backgrounds/wallpapers with just the clock like 10 times before it gets to the calendar.  Then it cycles the clock 10 times again, and it even apparently throws in the occasional ad.\n\nMy first question is how can I get it to just display the calendar?  If I cannot get it to lock on the calendar screen, how can I make it cycle more often.  I'll be honest, all of the cycling is a bit of a distraction.  If I had this thing on my desk all day and was watching this thing out of the corner of my eye all day, it would annoy the hell out of me.\n\nMy second question is how can I disable any advertisements?

  "My dad is in the early/mid stages of dementia and needs stimulation. Since his kids live far away, we can't visit as often as he and we would like, so he tends to withdraw from the world. I thought that a photo frame running a slide show of his life, including photos of his early life on the farm, life with mom (who has passed) and kids, travel photos, and outdoor photo would provide some stimulation.  With his memory loss, a large number of photos would provide \"new\" stimulation regularly.  \n\nThen I saw an ad for an Amazon-refurbished 2nd gen Echo Show 5 and realized it was cheaper and had more features than the photo frames I was researching.  The Echo Show had more features like scrolling the weather, announcing upcoming games, and more.  We won't use voice interaction because he'd need the volume much too high for the comfort of others.  Importantly, I could filter out all of the \"Try this!\" pages that would probably frustrate or confuse him.\n\nIt has worked great, and he really likes seeing the photos.  The 250 photos keep him stimulated, though he remembers more than I had anticipated, which is actually good!  The downside is that it's small and hard to see from his bed or chair.  (Few options for placement.)\n\nSo I tried a refurbished Echo Show 11 (2nd gen?  square/triangle shape) for a much larger image.  It works well for this, but has loads of the self-advertising \"Try this!\" pages that the Show 5 filtered out.  The Alexa app doesn't control the Show 11 in the same way, so this is less than optimal.\n\nIs there a way to limit the self-advertising \"Try this!\" slides in Echo Shows outside of the app or in setup on the unit itself?  \n\nIs there a larger (10-11\") Show that has better controls to limit the extraneous self-advertising prompts?\n\nThanks!",

Most of these are just garbage, but it\u2019s really annoying that Amazon treats us like that. By default the new features are on and we should have the choice up front to utilize them. If I\u2019d had known this I would never have bought them and just gone with basic echo devices or Google. So if you are considering a Show\u2026don\u2019t!",
  "As of a few weeks ago, my bn link outlets have stopped being individually accessible in Alexa. I have the ones that allow both the top and bottom plugs to be individually addressable in the smart life app. Also the USB is addressable too, so when I add the device in smart life, it adds 4 different devices - the top plug, the bottom plug, the USB, and then the whole thing that controls all 3 of the others. All 4 can be named whatever I want. \n\nThen, when you have the smart life skill installed and linked to alexa, then these same 4 devices are imported into Alexa as well. \n\nWell, a few weeks ago I started getting server unresponsive messages on my individual devices for each socket. Alexa just could no longer control them. I tried everything to reset the devices (by cutting the power at the breaker temporarily - which is what I consider the nuclear option) but when they came back and reconnected to the network, Alexa still could not control them.\n\nI noted that smart life could still individually control each socket, but that Alexa could not, so my voice commands would not work. \n\nSo consider this an FYI, and maybe also a question as to why this is now the case all of a sudden. Smart life no longer gives (or Alexa no longer accepts) the multiple devices inherent in these outlets. Curiously, the device that controls all 3 of the others (the main one) is still coming over to Alexa, and still functions to turn everything off and on, but the individual ones do not. \n\nI have completely removed one of the devices from both Alexa and smart life (including wiping the data in smart life for that device) and re added it. Same result. It appears it just no longer gives Alexa all 4 devices individually anymore. Anyone else experience this with the bn link outlets?\n\n\nThe workaround I found was to create a scene in smart life that controls the 4 or 5 or so different individual outlets I wanted to group together, and then create a routine in Alexa to call those scenes. It's a lot more setup, but it does work. Doing this in Alexa is far easier (I just create a group with a particular name and add these 5 in, and then I can just say Alexa turn on Living Room Lamps and it works). Doing it in Smart life means I need a scene to turn them on, and a scene to turn them off, and then 2 routines in Alexa to attach to each, and then specify the words to say. Works the same, but a lot more setup than I wanted to have to do for each similar group. \n\n\nAlso, last thing, I contacted bn link about it. I was surprised that I called a number in CA and that a person immediately answered who asked for my question and started giving me troubleshooting ideas. She knew her stuff too! She hadn't heard about this issue (which is mostly why I wanted to call to find out) but gave me some suggestions I immediately tried, but no luck. Ultimately this is between smart life and Alexa it seems.",

  "Echo Show 15 is on sale, and I badly want it to work for me as a home hub in our basement or a tablet replacement in the kitchen, but not sure how a lot of it works and the reviews I've read seem to assume I already know how things work. So I figured I would try here..\n\n1. How do calendars, tasks, etc. work? What are they synced with etc. I primarily use Google Calendar; what would I need to do to get my events to show up on the widget?\n\n2. Does the Show 15 have proper 'apps' or a store of any sort?  Reviews and videos often site Netflix support and some other stuff... what about Disney+ or other streaming services that my family may want to watch? How about other apps like a web browser to more easily browse recipes, search the web, or control my home through Home Assistant?\n\n3. Is there any media type widget for media playing NOT on the show itself? e.g. if I'm using spotify connect on a different speaker, or use Sonos, am I able to see what is playing or control it through the Show?\n\nWe currently have a Nest Hub in one corner of the kitchen, and an inverted chromebook mounted under the cabinets in another corner of our kitchen. I'd really like to replace both with something that can do it all and live on the counter. The show 15 seems like a great size and I love the styling of it, but I'm afraid it's going to be too much Nest Hub and not enough chromebook/tablet to use as a kitchen smart device. I'm also afraid that my current (mostly) lack of amazon ecosystem will harm me. I do have Prime, I have an echo dot or 2, the amazon microwave smart oven thing, and Alexa added to my sonos speakers, so I'm not Totally out of the ecosystem, but I also don't think my wife and I have separate profiles set up, calendars or photos being synced to amazon currently, stuff like that.\n\nSo any help would be greatly appreciated in explaining how friendly the ecosystem is to sync to, how much I'll have to \"buy in\" to the ecosystem, and how restrictive the Show OS is compared to something like a tablet. I'm also considering the Fire HD 10 Plus with Wireless dock as a potential kitchen hub, but I like that aesthetic a lot less and the smaller screen will certainly display a lot less at a glance for this kitchen use.",

  "**SOLUTION:**\n\n1. Unplug all Echos without a Zigbee bridge (Echo Flex, Echo Dot etc.)\n2.

I tried to reset some of them and pair them close to my Echo Studio but the Bluetooth signal didn't go away, even after 30 minutes or so - except for one single bulb connected to a Zigbee Echo; this is not the case with other Hue Zigbee/Bluetooth bulbs that are connected to a Zigbee Echo.\n\nAlso, what's strange, is that if I turn off all my Zigbee Echos and only keep those Echos without a Zigbee bridge, I cannot control the Hue bulbs in the Alexa app anymore - except for one single Hue bulb in my hallway (with a continuous Bluetooth signal).\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Can I check what protocol a bulb is using?\n2. Would you recommend Zigbee or Bluetooth with an Echo Zigbee bridge (and without a Hue bridge)?",

I was trying to help a couple of good friends of mine, last night, getting their smart plugs and lights sorted out with Alexa.\n\nThe really puzzling problem I was never able to resolve for them was with one of their Philips Hue lights. They bought a Hue \"starter kit\" with the hub  and 3 bulbs included. Got all of it set up and working perfectly in Hue's own app, and proceeded to set up the Alexa skill for Hue. Everything went well and it identified the 3 bulbs available to control, as well as the correct \"groups\" we created for the rooms they were in.\n\nBut they have an Echo Dot in the downstairs living room, and an Echo Flex upstairs in their hall. When upstairs, the Flex would say \"the device is unsupported\" when trying to control ONE of the bedroom lights, but the other bedroom light would turn on and off just fine through it. If you gave the same command from the Echo Dot downstairs, it controlled both properly!\n\nI tried removing the problem bulb and adding it back; same issue.\n\nAll I can conclude is that there may be some bugs/issues with the Alexa Hue skill and the Echo Flex device? I really don't know anyone else who ever owned a Flex. It seems like it's essentially just another Echo Dot except with a smaller, cheaper speaker, in a case that fits into a wall outlet.

The age of the song (and how it was mixed) appears to have more of an effect.\n\nI\u2019m wanting to try a Fire cube and see if I can get Atmos for my streaming video as well.

  "Hey,\nI\u2019m a freshman in college and I\u2019ve had my Amazon Echo in my room for the entire year. Recently, I noticed that one of my three roommates, who I don\u2019t particularly like, and find super weird/annoying, has somehow added the functionality to connect to my Echo without asking me. He plays music, and does who knows what else, without asking me. Other than turning off guest mode and deleting Bluetooth connections that aren\u2019t mine, what else can I do to stop him from connecting. At times, I\u2019m convinced that he uses the drop-in feature, too, since I can sometimes hear the sound associated with that\u2026\nThanks!",

  "Just got a new echo show and added it to the \"everywhere\" group with another Echo (4th Gen). When I play Spotify on the everywhere group, the echo show stops the audio 3 seconds before the end of the song, but the regular Echo finishes it.

It's particularly annoying as they are in the same room so the last 3 seconds of a song only plays in half the room.",
  "Samsung vs. Alexa - let the battle begin. I have a 2021 Samsung TV and I got it connected to Alexa in the TV, but I can\u2019t get it added to a group. \n\nWhen I try adding the Samsung TV to a group in the Alexa app (on the TV), rather than showing my existing group names it shows shit like [object Object]. Tried clicking each and it says it added it to my living room\u2019s group, but in the Alexa app on my phone, it\u2019s not showing up. The device shows up as a device in my phone\u2019s Alexa app, but it won\u2019t let me add it to a group.\n\nI have an Echo next to the TV (since the Samsung is new enough to have Alexa built-in but not new enough to have hands-free Alexa) and the Echo will turn the TV on and off, but it won\u2019t work when I try asking it to open streaming apps. It says I have to change the TV & Video settings in the Alexa mobile app - and Samsung is nowhere to be found in there.

  "So I've had an Echo Show 10 in the kitchen area of my home for a few months now. My wife has had it and wants the show gone. \n\nThe problem is what shows up on the screen and our children. We have a few young children including one that can ready pretty well. (Sorry purposefully trying to be vague because this is the internet.) We keep having problems with things like:\n\n\\-Alexa showed a news headline about a school shooting awhile back. My oldest child read it and let the entire family know about kids shooting others at school and went on and on about it. This was not the way we wanted to inform our young children about these types of situations.\n\n\\-Alexa ad's for TV shows we don't want our kids to ever watch or really even know about\n\n\\-If I take a photo or screenshot something on my phone it's on the Alexa a day later. Which is fun for pictures of the kids. This is less fun when I screenshot a meme that isn't appropriate for children. (This I think I know how to control. But is still part of the problem.)\n\n\\-Kids ask for something benign like, \"show me a video with Dinosaurs\" and Alexas pulls up a video with Dinosaurs that is clearly not appropriate for children.   \n\n\nI haven't tried enabling a \"kids mode\" (I assume there is one) because the Echo is not just for the kids. I want it as a family device.\n\nIs the answer here just that an Echo with a screen cannot serve adults and children at the same time? Maybe the answer to that seems like an obvious \"yes\". But I don't think it is too much to ask to have an option to limit the types of ad's and other things an Echo Show will have up on the screen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - because of children, I would like an option to limit the types of ad's and other things an Echo Show will have up on the screen.

  "I have an annoying issue and wondered if anyone has experienced anything like this. \n\nI have a custom routine setup on my Echo Show whereby when my Arlo smart doorbell is pressed, it asks the Show via a \u201cvoice\u201d command to display the live view of a Blink camera I have outside. This worked up until recently, but now when the doorbell is pressed Alexa says \u201cOkay, Okay\u201d and then \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what went wrong\u201d in quick succession, typically without activating the live view for the camera. It weirdly says \u201cOkay\u201d twice even though I have brief mode turned on. Looking at the activity log shows the routine triggering twice every time it runs. \n\nI previously encountered an issue with the live view not working when the camera was \u201cbusy\u201d doing something else. For example, if the camera is armed and motion was detected on it would do the same thing. However, now I have motion detection turned off so I am not sure what is causing this. I also tried adding a 5 sec wait command and this seemingly hasn\u2019t improved things. \n\nFor reference, manually asking the Show to display the Blink camera live view works 100% of the time. As does manually triggering my custom routine via the Alexa iOS app. So the issue seems to be the connection between the trigger point (ie the Arlo doorbell being pressed) and the Echo Show, possibly that it is trying to trigger the routine twice in quick succession. I\u2019ve tried disabling and enabling the relevant skills, and also deleted / re-added the devices. I\u2019ve also tried, remaking the routine, power cycling the Show, resetting the Show to factory default and then updating the firmware. It\u2019s the same annoying issue each time. \n\nAny ideas what is wrong? It is driving me crazy that nothing has changed.",

  "Last week the weekday alarm on my echo spot stopped working. It's set for 7:40am every weekday. The alarm shows in the alexa app, and on the device screen it shows prior to 7:40. At 7:40 it disappears from the screen, but no alarm or other visible indication. I was about to do a factory reset last night, but a new alarm for 5 minutes later worked fine, so I instead deleted all the alarms and recreated them, to see if that worked.\n\nHere's where it gets weird(er). I also set up a spare echo dot. I tested alarms on it and they were fine. I put it in the same room (both physically and within the device settings) but otherwise changed nothing. I added an alarm on this device for the same time, as a backup. This morning neither device's alarm went off. I added another alarm for a few minutes later (\"Alexa, wake me up at 7:47am this morning\") and that alarm did go off?!? Clearly software, or a setting, but I've no idea what - any ideas?",

  "Here's a new one. I recently left a 1 star review on a Show 8 due to being fed up with forced ads on the screen and the \"Alexa for Your Day\" card. 2 days later I got an unsolicited call from a real person at Amazon Customer Service asking what would compel me to leave such a review.  I can't even.\n\n\n\nEdit: I made this post on the run and finally just sat down. Here's some more info...\nThe review I left was basic. 2 sentences that stated I was disappointed with ads, alexa for your day, and by the way nonsense. I certainly didn't leave my phone number but it is attached to my account. This, plus Google caller ID, is how I know it was a legitimate Amazon rep and not a third party.  \nWhen they got on the phone they said my review was the reason for the call. The rep immediately went into a spiel about the those \"features\" and why they were beneficial. It all came off like it was them saying \"sorry, not sorry you feel that way.\" I was then asked how those features could be improved. I stated they should be removed all together or bare minimum have an option to disable them from being displayed. After saying this I was given an \"open for interpretation answer\" and told that that functionality is currently not in the system.  \nThe call ended here as everything that needed to be said was said.",

  "We have 3 Echo Show 5s that we got about a year ago.

  "My elderly mom's Amazon account has always been part of my Household.  You don't get to share Amazon Music (from Prime, not the full version) directly, but she's always signed into my account on her device (\"A\\*\\*\\*a, switch accounts').\n\nThis always allowed her to use Prime Music as I would, though the 1-device-at-a-time restriction was still in effect.  I built a huge library of custom playlists for her.  They always worked fine. \n\nNow, whenever she asks for specific music (and I tested this), she gets \"Here's a station you might like\", which, of course, is riddled with ads every song-and-a-half.  Even \"A\\*\\*\\*a, play/shuffle my playlist \\[exact name of playlist\\]\", said *in my voice*, while signed into my account, on that device produces \"Here's a station you might like\", when on devices registered to me produces the actual playlist.\n\nEvery request for music, no matter how you word it - and I have tried every permutation of \"music\", \"playlist\", \"play\", \"shuffle\", \"library\", \"Amazon Music\" - results in \"Here's a station\", on that device only, where the same command (from the same voice, to the same account) on another device works as expected.\n\nDid something change?  Are they cracking down even more on their shitty, overpriced music service?  Or is this a new technical wrinkle I haven't discovered?  I'm going to get calls on this all day, every day, until it's fixed; that music is one of her only forms of entertainment (she's blind and can't operate hardly anything else).\n\nI could re-register the device as one of my own; It wouldn't hurt me or anything. I have purchasing turned off and all that jazz.  But I'm afraid if I do that I'll have to set up the wifi again and it's very, VERY difficult to get an IT person at her facility if it doesn't go well.  I'm sure she'll end up with no Echo at all for at least a week or more if I have a problem resetting the wifi.  So any suggestions short of that would be appreciated.",

  "TLDR: Does anyone know of Skills that will perform Announcements to other Amazon accounts not within our Amazon Household?\n\nLike many of you, I have had problems with Spotify and Amazon Household playing nice together. We now have 6 Alexa devices in our home with my wife and 4 kids. Here is the problem: Amazon has 3 kinds of profiles. 1 Normal, 2 Teen, 3 Child. Teen and Child are just profiles that are added to a normal Amazon account and not individual accounts themselves. We have Spotify Premium and each family member has their own account. You can only attach a Spotify account to an Amazon account, not a profile under an account (teen, child). Amazon Household can only contain two \"adult\" accounts. We could create normal ghost amazon accounts for the kids and attach their Spotify so they each can stream different music, but then we lose out out on some of the Amazon Household features, most importantly the Announcement feature (which we use often with a disabled family member using it to communicate messages across multiple device).\n\nThere is an option within Spotify to stream to a device and then add the Alexa as a bluetooth speaker. This is somewhat janky and I have had problems with it. This also makes it so the voice commands for Alexa to play music is not going to work. This option is definitely not very user friendly.\n\nDoes anyone know of Skills that can replicate the Announcement feature to send messages to other Amazon Accounts? This would be the cleanest solution for us as everyone could have their own device with their own Spotify account linked and be able to play different music on their own device at the same time. Thank you very much for your time and assistance.",

  "As a paralyzed United States Marine Corps Veteran who has been bedridden for a good portion of my life, I rely heavily on my Echo devices for entertainment and interaction with the world.\n\nBecause of this I have put a lot of money into outfitting my room in many ways so that I can get the most out of what life I have to live. When it comes to audio devices, I have chosen to place 3 Echo's and one Echo Studio in a type of surround sound configuration. The three Echo's were purchased first and then the Studio was my latest acquisition.\n\nHonestly, I am not impressed. While the Studio certainly produces more bass than the regular Echo devices, it falls short when it comes to clarity of sound.\n\nAmazon advertised a type of immersive experience, a enveloping 360\u00b0 sound experience, which I have yet to figure out how to configure. I do understand that only certain songs have been recorded in this fashion, and I have tried listening to them, but I really can't hear what all the hype is about?\n\nNow I'm not trying to completely dis Amazon's devices, as the Echo is a phenomenal speaker for the price. However, for the amount of money that the Echo Studio costs, I anticipated a higher quality product, with MUCH better sound. \n\nMaybe I got a bad device? \n\nMy questions to the group are (if you have an echo studio, or have listened to one), do you have the same complaints, and if so are there specific settings I should try to improve the sound quality? Also, what is your opinion of this speaker, and what would you recommend Amazon change in their next version?\n\nHope Amazon doesn't blacklist me for this post! lol But I was really hoping to get something incredible when I purchased the Studio, and so far my experience has been really disappointing.\n\nThank you for commenting, and sharing any recommendations and or experiences you've had with the Echo Studio!\n\n\n\nJ.

Kids ask Alexa to play wiggle songs. **Result:** They hear some songs they really like and dance around like crazy while giggling.\n2. Parent asks Alexa to play one of the bedtime playlists for a set amount of time, then mute the mic so kids can't change what is playing. **Result:** The kids calm down to familiar music and drift off to sleep.  \n\n\nNow what happens:\n\n1. Kids ask Alexa to play wiggle songs. Alexa talks about how great it is that we can hear more songs now (an advertisement or suggestion) and decides to play something else it thinks they will like.

Parents shut it off because it there is no convincing Alexa to play the song they want to hear.\n2. Parents ask Alexa to play bedtime playlist.

  "My dad is in the early/mid stages of dementia and needs stimulation. Since his kids live far away, we can't visit as often as he and we would like, so he tends to withdraw from the world. I thought that a photo frame running a slide show of his life, including photos of his early life on the farm, life with mom (who has passed) and kids, travel photos, and outdoor photo would provide some stimulation.  With his memory loss, a large number of photos would provide \"new\" stimulation regularly.  \n\nThen I saw an ad for an Amazon-refurbished 2nd gen Echo Show 5 and realized it was cheaper and had more features than the photo frames I was researching.  The Echo Show had more features like scrolling the weather, announcing upcoming games, and more.  We won't use voice interaction because he'd need the volume much too high for the comfort of others.  Importantly, I could filter out all of the \"Try this!\" pages that would probably frustrate or confuse him.\n\nIt has worked great, and he really likes seeing the photos.  The 250 photos keep him stimulated, though he remembers more than I had anticipated, which is actually good!  The downside is that it's small and hard to see from his bed or chair.  (Few options for placement.)\n\nSo I tried a refurbished Echo Show 11 (2nd gen?  square/triangle shape) for a much larger image.  It works well for this, but has loads of the self-advertising \"Try this!\" pages that the Show 5 filtered out.  The Alexa app doesn't control the Show 11 in the same way, so this is less than optimal.\n\nIs there a way to limit the self-advertising \"Try this!\" slides in Echo Shows outside of the app or in setup on the unit itself?  \n\nIs there a larger (10-11\") Show that has better controls to limit the extraneous self-advertising prompts?\n\nThanks!",

And when I go to Audio diagnostics it's says it's not capable of Atmos, again it's advertised as being capable. I've unplugged the Fire Cube and the Echo, recreated the Home Cinema group but it's not changed anything. Is this happening to anyone else? If this doesn't get fixed I'm going to switch to Apple. These issues with Amazon devices are ridiculous.",
  "Seriously. I was an early echo adopter and the dumb things are all over my house now.

I\u2019ve got other ways to control my lights and ask about the weather, FFS.\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger.\n\nFor the redditor who kept inboxing me to tell me I obviously should just stop using Amazon at all, even when I wasn\u2019t replying to you, I wish Alexa\u2019s upsells were as easy to block. :)",
  "How about we get rid of all the on screen features (let's face it, every time we look it's just a suggestion screen anyway) and just let the alexa advertise about itself. Just all day. No weather. No recipes. No pictures. Let's just have Alexa insist upon itself. \n\nAnd the pods should just note all the things it can do audibly. Just on a loop. Read the entire database of questions it can accept out loud. I mean, why wait for us to ask it? Or to learn about features when we want to.

And everything starts fine when I ask it to play on the Everywhere group, but the stream abruptly terminates simultaneously on all devices.  Until recently, there was no problem playing endless Amazon Music streams on the Everywhere group.\n\nI have unplugged and restarted all devices. Twice.

Is there a certain command I am missing?\n\nI also get 30 second advertisements from time to time (Mindy Kaling from the Office is what I remember), yet on my phone or laptop, I never get any ads when listening on Spotify.\n\nI have Spotify set to the default music source in the app, and for experimentation I tried setting it to Amazon Music, but it did not change much, except that I would get ads telling me about the low price of Amazon Music. I mean, I have been paying for Spotify for many years now, and it has worked well for me all this time. I don't believe I should have to pay for 2 music listening services simultaneously.\n\nI am fairly new to the amazon speaker scene, and would appreciate any help if you've come across something like this.

  "I've been trying to figure out the adaptive brightness feature on my Echo Dot w/ clock. If you drill into the settings for device and tap \"LED Display\" you'll see the Adaptive Brightness toggle switch. In the description it says, \"The display brightness will adjust automatically based on ambient light. Moving the slider will help adaptive brightness learn your preference.\" OK... so I turn this on and the display brightens when I turn on a light and dims when I turn off the light. I turn off all the lights in the room and it dims way too much for my liking. I figure I'll use the slider to indicate, \"when it is dark, I want the brightness to be at 20%\". So I set the slider to 20%, the display changes briefly to \"2\" and then goes right back to being not bright enough. So I set the slider to 80%. The display changes to \"8\" and goes right back to the same dim brightness level. This doesn't seem to be working as advertised... anyone else have one of these? Does the adaptive brightness work the way you'd expect?",
  "I get a chuckle from some of the posts and responses here.  But, as an Alexa user, I also cry.   Other than voting with our pocketbooks,  and not buying Alexa products, how do we convince Amazon that they need to make their back end perform and their products work as advertised?\n\nThese posts consistently criticize the inconsistent performance of the Alexa environment.

  "I like to listen to white noise, or ocean sounds or thunderstorms on the Alexa. But recently Alexa always responds with trying to sell me some company - or - switches me over to a company. I asked it to play white noise and was told I had to upgrade to premium - not realizing it has switched me over. I finally found that I had to go into skills and get rid of TMSOFT or whatever other company keeps getting added. How it got there I don't know, but Alexa keeps adding companies to my skill list making the company the default sound. Then every time I play I get told my subscription is over and I have to buy premium. \n\nIs there a way on my account to block these companies? And stop Alexa from trying to sell me this shit every other time I ask to play some looped sound? *BY THE WAY DID YOU KNOW*.. I really hate it.",
  "My Alexa is really glitchy. It really always has been. Sometimes I'll recieve answers from the echo in my living room i/o the show in the kitchen and vice versa. I'd say it accurately answers about 60% of the questions we ask it. Now I can live with all of that - no deal breakers there. But, there are now commercials in Jeopardy! Why? Why do I constantly have to have products shoved in my face. I can't even pump gas anymore without the gas pump forcing me to watch commercials. I'm tired of every piece of available real estate being used to advertise. \n\nIt was enough of a turn off that we just quit playing. Maybe its time to get rid of these things. They really don't bring me any joy. Is anyone using their device in a manner where they can't live without it? Im at a crossroads and need to make a decision. To keep or not to keep?",

  "The last while , it seems everything I ask Alexa to play (UK) that it can't play with Prime gives a huge huge marketing essay in response. I'm almost throwing the thing out the window.\n\nI have Amazon prime and thus a load of music. I accept I don't have it all, but the current Echo response to \"not on prime\" is currently, every single time, a TWENTY FIVE SECOND long speech about how I can get this material on \"Music Unlimited\". You'd think after the first couple 100 times I might have got the message. Or the fact it's given me it 5 times in a row in the last 5 minutes. Oh no. Is there an option at the end \"don't ask me this again\"? No.\n\nA simple \"Only available on Unlimited\". No. It's the entire speech. Every single time.\n\nI'm getting to the point I'm now mentally getting STRESSED before I ask it to play anything, as it'll browbeat me with this rubbish. I know you can tell it to stop speaking, but strangely it seems to not like this when telling me this advertising blurb, and I often have to get up and go over and speak directly into it. Another bonus.\n\nI HAVE Amazon prime, and by god I'm so angry at this cr\\*p, I'll never ever take up Music Unlimited now as I hate even the sounds of those words. It's now become so counter productive because as of now, as a point of principal, I hate it.\n\nI've checked the app, there seems to be no settings to avoid this. This may be a regional thing of course. Two questions after this rant:\n\n1. Is there a way to switch it off I'm not aware of?\n2. Are the managers in charge who decided this a good idea fit to work for Amazon?!\n\nThis may be regional so I'll paste in what it says.

  "This is after going through all options, both mentioned in the shutting down mail and almost all suggestions (except those requiring your phone to be in the chain, as that's what I did before stringify and had tons of issues) here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/bawett/with\\_stringify\\_shutting\\_down\\_are\\_there\\_any/](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/bawett/with_stringify_shutting_down_are_there_any/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: My requirements and bias were to have it support my new echo device, preferably have alexa talk locally to a selfhosted service (without awkward \"tell X to\" commands), but if it had to be to call some online service, that it had to be as flexible as stringify, as to allow me to integrate it to IFTTT or to at least send a web request to my own scripts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe solution:\n\nGet a cheap raspberry pi (even a zero), install node-red (important: as root, otherwise you won't be able to set it to listen to port 80, which is apparently necessary for new echo generations | [https://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi](https://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi)) and then via the dashboard install: [https://github.com/datech/node-red-contrib-amazon-echo](https://github.com/datech/node-red-contrib-amazon-echo) or via npm.\n\nThat will also allow you to add any custom functions that you want, by just having node red send a web request to your script when it triggers. You are not forced to have any of your own scripts though, since node red is that popular, that you'll most likely find a block that somebody did for you, e.g. WOL is available in the store.\n\nSince it also is just a regular \"light\", you can add it to any alexa routine and not be forced to say \"turn on/off\", e.g. a garage door can be \"close garage door\" instead of \"turn off garage door\".\n\nIf you do go that route, definitely review security of that setup: [https://nodered.org/docs/security](https://nodered.org/docs/security)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe rest of the \"alternatives\":\n\n\\- HomeAssistant (emulated\\_hue): sadly does not work with new echos, the pull request that was supposed to fix this was closed because the guy that did it, couldn't supply the necessary tests that nobody wanted to help out with to get the feature working again: [https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/18749](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/18749) \\- so even though you can discover the emulated hub, nothing will work as alexa will just report back \"device not working properly\" and similar messages. If you want to see it as them pushing their premium cloud service by doing that is up to your judgement. Also still a viable option if you have older echos though or you're fine with paying 5 bucks a month for the cloud subscription.\n\n\\- HomeAssistant (Haaska): many seem to go that route as they have already a working HomeAssistant installation, requires either aws lambda or your own https endpoint\n\n\\- HA-Bridge: does not work with newer echos and runs with java, so I moved on to other options.\n\n\\- Olisto: tries too hard to be an IFTTT competitor, so you basically can't setup any proper workflow as with stringify, try it out and see if it works for you, but it seemed very bare bones to be at all viable nor an appropriate alternative to stringify.\n\n\\- Yonomi: horrible reviews and posts about it everywhere, even for just automating or having support for popular smart devices, did not give it a try therefore.\n\n\\- SmartThings WebCoRe: looks much more complicated to setup and extends the chain quite a bit, haven't given it as much review, as any docs and videos I could find were made ages ago\n\n\\- Hubitat: yet another paid hub that has a somewhat sketchy looking website, that might or might not work, was posted by one single user and advertised as \"solve any problem\", you figure I didn't check that as a viable option for myself, but if you are willing to pay 100 bucks (instead of the 150 bucks \"non introductory price\") just to try it - go ahead.\n\n\\- IFTTT+Tasker+AutoRemote: sadly puts your phone into the chain and if your phone tends to kill it, even when whitelisted, your things won't work, many people go that route and it works (a seriously great alternative if you can't have node red, be it budget reasons or anything else \\[though worth mentioning, autoremote is a paid addon and you can get a pi zero for almost the same price\\]), but it might not work for you, especially if you have some of the chinese brand smartphones that do whatever they want with background processes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anybody wants to correct or add to any of my findings please go ahead! especially with those that I personally couldn't make a viable alternative for myself or review enough to tell about it to those that it might be one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings mentioned (in no specific order):\n\n\\- [https://www.home-assistant.io/](https://www.home-assistant.io/)\n\n\\- [https://www.home-assistant.io/components/emulated\\_hue/](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/emulated_hue/)\n\n\\- [https://github.com/mike-grant/haaska/wiki](https://github.com/mike-grant/haaska/wiki)\n\n\\- [https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge](https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge)\n\n\\- [https://hubitat.com/](https://hubitat.com/)\n\n\\- [https://olisto.com/](https://olisto.com/)\n\n\\- [https://www.yonomi.co/](https://www.yonomi.co/)\n\n\\- [https://joaoapps.com/autoremote/](https://joaoapps.com/autoremote/)\n\n\\- [https://www.webcore.co/](https://www.webcore.co/)\n\n\\- [https://www.smartthings.com/products](https://www.smartthings.com/products)",
  "I must start by apologising if this post isn't welcome. I am struggling but thought I'd ask anyway. I brought an echo 2nd gen from the Facebook market a couple of months ago. It was advertised as new and unused. It came with the box etc and was all wrapped up accordingly. Upon set up I received an error message which turned out to mean that the echo was registered as lost. I contacted the seller who apologised and offered to refund me in full. This was 2 months ago and he has since blocked me etc. The police are not interested and following up through small claims isn't worth the cost. I had thought maybe I could buy an echo input but the 2nd gen doesn't have line in and I am unable to set Bluetooth up without first finishing the echo set up. So my question is. Can I do anything with this echo that Amazon have no ability to help with and the marketplace seller having no intention of refunding. \n\nTldr brought an \"new and unused\" echo which was reported as lost.

You definitely can't sleep through this news report.\n3. [Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up) \u2014 A short Flash Briefing that tells the story of startups; it's consistently solid, and, occassionally, it will give you a story you'll think about for the rest of the day.\n\nFor those of you who are on the lookout for more specific Flash Briefings, I've compiled all my reviews of Flash Briefings by topic below. I generally put better Flash Briefings at the top of each category and the worse ones toward the bottom but there are a few places where I don't quite know how to order the Briefings, so don't take the ordering too seriously. You'll likely notice a theme: The best Flash Briefings have a human host, do not run too long or too short, and do not have ads. I also tend to prefer Flash Briefings that have a bit of personality \u2014 dry deliveries put me to sleep.\n\n***THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO FLASH BRIEFINGS***\n\n**General News**\n\n[NPR Hourly News](https://www.amazon.com/NPR-Hourly-News-Summary/dp/B01K07MU64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is one of the most consistently well produced Flash Briefings. Clocking in at 5 minutes, the news summary is just long enough to be substantial and comprehensive, but not so long as to be annoying. The mix between headline news and summaries is just right, and NPR has left the advertising out of the briefing.\n\n[BBC](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-BBC/dp/B01JHLI06S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487536887&sr=1-1&keywords=bbc)\n\nJust like NPR and Fox News, this Flash Briefing stands out as one of the most well produced. However, what really sets the BBC apart from the other two is that the BBC covers different stories \u2014 often less US-centric stories. If you have multiple US news Flash Briefings, the BBC can be very refreshing and introduce you to some news stories you haven't yet heard about. I'd highly recommend it.\n\n[Fox News](https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-Channel/dp/B01M5EIW2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is among the better news Flash Briefing skills. You'll get a full view of US news from a human presenter. The biggest problem is long, annoying ads they run. BBC and NPR don't run ads and have similar content. The other problem is the volume: it's all over the place. The main host is significantly louder than the correspondents who speak with him. That being said, it's only mildly distracting, especially compared to the ad. In total, if you are trying to figure out which news Flash Briefings to use, give Fox News a shot.\n\n[90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate)\n\nA real human, Mike Pasca, reads 2 or 3 news stories with panache. I really love how the presenter reads the stories; sometimes he'll say something like \"We've got two stories for you today \u2014 one that matters and one that does not.\" You definitely won't sleep through this Flash Briefing. There is an ad at the end, but it's the least annoying ad I've seen in a Flash Briefing so far. Overall, I'd say give this Flash Briefing a try and see if it's for you.\n\n[theSkimm](https://www.amazon.com/theSkimm-Inc/dp/B01JM6TN8M/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537954&sr=1-1&keywords=theSkimm)\n\nFor those who don't know, theSkimm is a daily email that sends you a short news briefing. This Flash Briefing just has Alexa read that email. It's better than most Flash Briefings where Alexa reads the news, but it still is far from the best Flash Briefing. I'd recommend passing on this as NPR and BBC are much better.\n\n[Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Quartz/dp/B01M278ZFA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538052&sr=1-1&keywords=quartz)\n\nAlexa reads the news. The writing is actually pretty good, but without a human reading the news, it's not worth it. There are tons of competitor that were a human host reads the news.\n\n[Refinery29: 8 Things You Need to Know This AM](https://www.amazon.com/Refinery29-Things-Need-Know-This/dp/B01JHR7TK0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537988&sr=1-1&keywords=refinery29)\n\nAlexa reads Refinery29 headlines. It covers a wide swath of topics, from Health to LGBTQ News. Refinery29 does not cover any of these stories in more than a sentence, so the Flash Briefing is short and uninformative. My suggestion is that you should leave Refinery29 out of your morning routine.\n\n[BuzzFeed News](https://www.amazon.com/BuzzFeed-News/dp/B01MQR7Y5D/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538110&sr=1-1&keywords=buzzfeed)\n\nAlexa reads BuzzFeed headlines. This is possibly the worst Flash Briefing made by a large company that I've seen. Isn't BuzzFeed supposed to be better than the average media company at creating content for digital platforms?\n\n**Business News**\n\n[CNBC Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/NBCUniversal-CNBC-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01N7FH24X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is the best business news Flash Briefing. A real human reads the business news headlines with a short explanation. Every day it covers interesting sales numbers, mergers, and trends. The length of the Flash Briefing is about right. I'd highly recommend adding this to your Flash Briefing.\n\n[Motley Fool Stock Watch](https://www.amazon.com/The-Motley-Fool-Stock-Watch/dp/B01KG5YXS8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538317&sr=1-1&keywords=motley+fool)\n\nThis is a very short interview with a stock expert on a recent topic. I find it informative and very digestible \u2014 a good way to learn interesting tidbits about what's going on in different sectors of the economy and the stock market.\n\n[Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is just a short business story read by a human. This generally isn't a headline story, so the stories are somewhat refreshing, and the delivery is pretty good. There are not that many good options for business news in the Amazon Skill store, so if you are in need of more business news, give Level Up a try.\n\n[Econoday U.S. Economic Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-U-S-Economic-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01MEBW3T0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538474&sr=1-1&keywords=econoday)\n\nEconomic news read by Alexa. It's too long, but it isn't one of those Flash Briefings that never end. If you absolutely must have news about the Fed and stock market in your Flash Briefing, Econoday is for you. However, it's not very good, so I'd say pass.\n\n[Econoday Global Market Update](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-Global-Market-Update/dp/B01MDPRG23/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538529&sr=1-2&keywords=econoday)\n\nAlexa reads how the stock, money, and commodity markets changed since the last day and reports basic news. I would not recommend this Flash Briefing to anyone who doesn't have a job in finance (and I wouldn't even recommend it to most financial professionals).\n\n[The Economist](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-The-Economist/dp/B01JHLMNWU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538580&sr=1-1&keywords=economist)\n\nDon't bother including this in your Flash Briefing. This is just an entire Economist podcast, and it's not even a good podcast.\n\n**Tech News**\n\n[Daily Tech Headlines](https://www.amazon.com/DiamondClub-TV-Daily-Tech-Headlines/dp/B01M1B3K5U/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538726&sr=1-1&keywords=Daily+Tech+Headlines)\n\nThis is the best tech news Flash Briefing. It covers a wide expanse of tech news in just the right amount of detail. The host is human, concise, and clear. The only issue with this Flash Briefing is there are too many stories in each Flash Briefing, especially if you're not a tech professional. I'd like to see the makers of this Flash Briefing really cut down the length of their shows. That being said, this is the best tech Flash Briefing I've found, so give it a try.\n\n[TechCruch](https://www.amazon.com/AOL-Inc-TechCrunch/dp/B01L6HQHGQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538760&sr=1-1&keywords=techcrunch)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is weird. A bro reads tech news and talks about what a \"badass\" Elon Musk is (that's a real quote). This bro-host tells a bunch of jokes that aren't all that funny but feel like a stereotype of jokes a Silicon Valley bro would tell. This might be your type of humor, but it's certainly not mine. I'd lightly recommend passing on it, but if off-beat, that's-so-random humor is your thing then give it a try. However, most people seem to hate it.\n\n**Sports News**\n\n[CBS Sports Minute](https://www.amazon.com/CBS-Local-Sports-Minute/dp/B01M9FIFIK/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-3&keywords=sports)\n\nThis is best sports Flash Briefing I've found, but that's not saying much. It covers one sports related story a day, and it doesn't report scores. The host is very energetic, and the stories are interesting. However, you probably won't get a full update on sports scores if that's what you're interested in.\n\n[ESPN SportsCenter Update](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-ESPN-Radio-via/dp/B01JHLKHQ4/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-2&keywords=sports)\n\nThis app has a terribly boring music intro that lasts 30 seconds. Some reviewers have complained about the volume, but I haven't noticed an issue recently. The news itself is pretty good; what you'd expect from SportsCenter. There is an advertisement at the end that drags out. It lasts about 3 minutes.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n[Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day)\n\nThis is my favorite \"hidden gem\" Flash Briefing. Every day, the human host sardonically explains a word of the day and gives examples of how to use the word. It's funny, smart, and a little irreverent. The production quality is top notch, the length of the briefing is just right, and the entertaining examples of how to use the words make it pretty hard to forget the word. The Flash Briefing is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\n[Discovery: DNews](https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Communications-DNews/dp/B01JHK5V6G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539512&sr=1-1&keywords=dnews)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has science news. It's one moderately in-depth story a day, often about refreshing topics not covered by other news sites. The audio is repurposed from YouTube videos, but you probably won't notice because the audio doesn't rely on the visuals. I'd give it a try.\n\n[Complex News](https://www.amazon.com/Complex-News/dp/B01MXXXRLW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538966&sr=1-1&keywords=complex)\n\nThis is the best Flash Briefing for celebrity gossip. It covers just one story a day, but Complex does it in style. It's very punchy and energetic. My guess is that it's repurposed video content, but I quite like it, and I am not one who typically enjoys celebrity news. The entire briefing lasts about 2 minutes.\n\n[Top Reddit Posts Unofficial](https://www.amazon.com/Josh-Jones-Reddit-Posts-Unofficial/dp/B01MTWUMY6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539027&sr=1-1&keywords=top+reddit+post)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has Alexa read the top recent 5 Reddit posts. More specifically, Alexa reads the title of the Reddit post and then 1 comment. Normally, Flash Briefings that have Alexa read the news are terrible. This one is a mild exception. It's good, but it's certainly not great.\n\n[Harvard Business Review: Management Tip](https://www.amazon.com/Harvard-Business-Review-Management-Tip/dp/B01LQM9N8A/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539233&sr=1-1&keywords=harvard)\n\nI don't think that a Flash Briefing is the right place for a management tip. I find that these tips are incredibly forgettable \u2014 these tips are ideas like \"reconsider how you measuring data.\" That's not a particularly useful tip, and I can never remember the minutia of how HBR suggests implementing the tip. However, I know some people love this type of management advice, so if this sounds like the Flash Briefing for you, it probably is.\n\n[eHow](https://www.amazon.com/Demand-Media-eHow/dp/B01M29BSFG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539070&sr=1-1&keywords=ehow)\n\nIf you want an update on what eHow has been publishing recently, then I have the Flash Briefing for you. You'll learn some interesting and pointless things from this Flash Briefing, like the amount of calcium in chia seeds and your dog's separation anxiety. I wouldn't add it to your Flash Briefing, unless you want to know useless trivia or what eHow's been publishing.\n\n[Pulse of the Planet](https://www.amazon.com/Pulse-of-the-Planet/dp/B01K0JWGSY/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539103&sr=1-1&keywords=pulse+of+the+planet)\n\nThis is a weird mix of nature sounds and general interest stories. I'm not sure who this would appeal to, but it's certainly unique. It's not too long, so it might make sense to try it out if general interest stories are your MO.\n\nTL;DR: Try [Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day), [90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate), and [Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up)",
  "My wife and I are watching the football game on our fire stick and it seems that every other commercial break, she has to mute the TV because certain commercials trigger our echo to raise the volume (Sonos commercial) or start playing the radio (Sirius XM). This is beyond frustrating, especially when we have a teething baby trying to sleep in the room over. It's not an effective commercial when it actively discourages use of the product they're advertising!",
  "Does amazon sell advertising specifically for news briefings? When I log on to my \u201chome page\u201d in my echo app and see suggested content is that being paid for or is that due to what I listen to?",
  "So I was just done taking a shower and I heard some noises coming from the echo show 2nd gen. I poked my head out and saw the advertisement playing of a girl cooking talking to her dad on the show. I checked the Amazon echo app and no commands were given to it since I last asked it a question that I can see. So am I losing it or has anyone elses echos started playing ads? \n\nEdit** The echo app has updated recently so it's much harder seeing what queries it has executed. I'm now thinking it somehow thought it heard something and opened up a bing video and the advertisement was on the video it was trying to pull up. That's the only way I can think to explain this.",
  "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&nbsp;\n \nI am writing this because I cannot find anything outlining the problems with the Australian Echo service and I'm hoping that I can warn some poor sod before they buy it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIts taken me some time to get on to writing this, I actually posted a little bit of this with some questions a few months ago with the promise of a full review later. \n\nUnfortunately every time I gear up to interact with my echo I get obscenely angry and have to walk away for some time.\n\nThis time around it was a good month before I could deal with writing or even thinking about it without the impulse to punch a robot, granted, I would have to find a robot first, and then I don't think I could go through with it, I mean, have you see the new one that cleans your room for you? If I had a full on robot, I guarantee it would have a place setting at the dinner table, a spot in family photos and, I seem to have gotten off track here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***THE AMAZON ECHO***\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*The obvious choice* \n\nI was very excited to get my Amazon Echo. My husband, a Google enthusiast, desperately tried to convince me to get the google home, his best friend has one and he loves that it can play Fatboy Slim from the next room while he sits on the couch, I was assured in the knowledge that not only could I have my Star Trek fantasies realised, in that I could address my robot assistant as \"computer\" (90% of the reason that I chose echo over google home, lets admit it) but the echo had the same Fatboy Slim delivery method, granted not with Youtube, but I have amazon prime for twitch reasons and the box said that I get access to over a million songs. I was sold. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n*In the beginning*\n\nI got the echo home and set up, much to Hubs dismay I had held fast and got my echo, (I also held out and got the iphone after years of flat out refusal from his android addicted self) so I was happy as could be, I set it up and was offered the 30 day free trial of Amazon music, it was amazing! I would say \"computer pause\" and in my mind It was just like pausing the holodeck on the enterprise, granted all I was doing was pausing Weird Al's The saga begins (im seeing a theme here) Either way, I was thrilled! I had friends coming over to see how great the echo was, one of my friends was so convinced he decided to finally pull the trigger on getting his own. Any song I could think of was there, I could set timers, alarms, listen to audio books, order things from amazon (I never did but I was happy to know I could) The lot.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*The beginning of the end*\n\nBefore I wrote this next bit,  I had to go outside for a smoke, This is a good precursor to whats to come.\n\nafter 30 days, the free trial to amazon music ended, I considered getting a subscription but the box that echo came in assured me that without the music subscription I would still have access to millions of songs, just less than the music subscription had, I have pretty generic music taste so I was happy with that, plus if I enjoyed it, I would support the service by getting the paid sub, that's why I have Youtube red.\n\nThe second my subscription ended, none of the music was available to me anymore, some stuff had a 10 second preview clips but other than that, my 'over a million songs' were missing, It did however default to a Spanish language radio station that played the same song over and over and over and over, all while I was in the shower screaming at my echo to play literally anything else.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Contacting amazon support*\n\nI assumed there was a problem with my account, Amazon was making a big push in Australia all at once, they had just opened a local warehouse, they were running ads on free to air tv, they were rapidly dropping prices to compete with local mega chains, of course I had slipped through an organisational crack, it happens, we're all human.\n\nIn my communications with amazon tech support (I can provide transcripts if requested) I finally managed to garner this information:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Amazon Australia does not provide most of the features available to literally everyone else in the world.***\n\n* Australian Amazon prime subscription does not include the million or so songs that it does in other countries. \n\n* Australian Amazon basic accounts do not include any songs.\n\n* Without Amazon Music paid subscription, the echo is effectively useless for anything beyond a Google savvy egg timer.  \n\n* Spotify will not play on the Amazon Echo without a paid premium subscription.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is a basic gist of what the echo has in store for you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll of this information was provided (and confirmed upon me repeating the information) by two amazon tech support workers, (unfortunately I only have the transcript of one due to a power failure mid chat) \n\nThe thing that upsets me is not only is Australia once again considered to be a disposable market, with little to no care in providing us service, with our small population we are once again a \"if you don't like it we can literally withdraw from Australia and it wont make a jot of difference to our bottom line\" \n\nThe other thing is **THE BOX LITERALLY ADVERTISES A SERVICE THAT THEY DONT PROVIDE** According to Australian consumer law, you cannot advertise a product with features it doesn't have, so I get the amazing pleasure of returning my echo (which by the way, the second I found out about this debacle, I changed its name back to echo, because, screw associating star trek with this useless tube clock) but I can't return it, by the time I found out about the lack of features, 30 days (of course) had passed, I also bought it from a re-seller who is no longer.\n\nCurrently my echo sits in my bathroom, unplugged and dusty. \n\nAlso my friend decided to wait till tax time to buy his echo and now has a google home instead, thank God.\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe echo is missing vital features for the Australian market and as a result, unless you're willing to get the \"music unlimited\" paid subscription -***note***- *Not* amazon prime, specifically 'music unlimited' you will have an almost completely useless product. If you don't use the echo for music, or audio books or anything more than keeping a schedule and googling things without your phone or computer, then sure thing, get the echo. \n\nI would give the echo 1 Star.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOh by the way, despite all the money I've spent on prime and twitch, I haven't spent any money on amazon so I cant leave a review...... \n",
  "I recently bought a Trust branded contact sensor which  was advertised to be used with ZigBee.

  "I am a canadian user and my echo won't connect to my firetv stick, so I cannot control it using voice commands. This is advertised EVERYWHERE so I am a little frustrated that I had to find out the hard way it wasn't available in my country. They should really make this more clear. I have read old posts about it eventually becoming available in countries outside the US, but these posts were from 2017 and still nothing... Has anyone received information about when this feature might be available in Canada? Or has anyone found any hacks for making it work? (Thought about changing my country on my amazon account... wondering if it worked for anyone else). Thanks!",
  "The first week of using my Amazon Echo Spot, I was awakened in the middle of the night by a voice advertising unrelated Amazon services.  I was furious.  I contacted Amazon and received no help or advice.  Did they try out this tactic on a percentage of Spot users to determine the reaction?  No one has admitted that this ever happened.  They told me to turn of the volume before I go to bed.  If I do that, I don't think the Echo alarm clock will wake me up in the morning.  Amazon: make up your mind.  I've invited you into my home.  You can listen to my conversations, develop a relationship with my dog, decide what news you want me to hear, etc.  How about you have some decency.",
  "The wife just woke me up fighting that ad.  I am not a great sleeper.  Not fun.\n\nEdit: Forced ads in any form is a great way to lose customers.  The recent garbage with Fire TV and forced Prime TV ads has left a really sour taste in my mouth and my tolerance is getting really thin.  When there are people who are heavily invested in an ecosystem the absolute worst thing is to leverage that for further advertisement.\n\nI am fully aware of all of Amazon's services.  I will buy them if I want/need.  Just don't shove that crap down my throat at 1am.  That is an excellent way to have said device hit a wall at high speed.\n\nEdit2:  This has been a very controversial post, it seems.  It has been as high as 40 votes, and is settling out around 20 now.  Interesting.",

  "I recently decided to purchase the Echo Dot to see if I can get into this voice-control thing. My online readings for the Echo/Alexa had the tech look promising beyond a two-week novelty; however I simply didn't realise how lacking the Australian features and skills are. Amazon seem quite strict on the geographical locking, although I can understand some skills being US-only.\n\nThe best I see Echo and the like for (in Australia) is for home automation, yet I truly can't vouch this since I've yet to purchase smart devices to test.\n\nThe Alexa looks promising, and more fruitful, in the US market (from online readings) and there doesn't seem to be any signs that Australia's market will soon receive the newer features or mature on it's own. Until then, it's a fun gimmick when friends are over.\n\nI'm interested to hear other people's experiences with the Echo and Alexa, especially in Australia. I just hope this post helps anyone else who's unsure if they want to dive in - let's cross our fingers I'm wrong over the coming months!\n\nI'm considering buying the Google Home too, yet not exactly expecting anything substantially better.\n\nSide note: Voice recognition is not as smooth/natural as the advertisements! Poses a problem when creating alarms and list items. Google's voice recognition is far more natural yet mostly only useful for simpler instructions and for info pulled from the web. I don't mind the more 'robotic' interaction with Alexa but thought I'd share this insight for those that prefer otherwise.",
  "I don't know specifically when it might've started, but I haven't used Pandora in a few days. I usually run it for a couple hours a day, but have been away from home lately.  It just started playing advertisements :( :( :( :(\n",
  "This is already sort of happening. Some of the most useful and frequently updated skills are things like Pizza Hut, Dominos, Uber, Lyft, etc that are inherently tied to commercial incentives to use the skills. \n\nIf we take that a step further, like advertisements within Skills, premium skills that cost money, etc to the point of mimicking the iOS and Google App Stores, do we see this leading to an overall improvement in usefulness of Skills available?",
  "I received an email advertising that I could do this with my echo spot. Can anyone recommend any equipment that can accomplish this?",
  " I know this sounds like a bogus conspiracy, but im not trying to make silly post.   This happened last night and im a little bit freaked out about it.\n\n  So i have this cribbage game on my cell phone (xiaomi redmi note 4) and it has an ad banner.  99% of the time the ads are amazon items i have searched on amazon.ca  I found that a bid creepy, but it usually  things im never going to buy, just used it for price comparison. \n\n  Last night i had a buddy over and we were talking about life and such, he mentioned his blue pill, (viagra)  Being 39 im still doing ok and dont need it, but i was currious about the pill.  So i asked a few questions..  How long does it take, do you need it? how long does it last,  then i told a story about my friend who got a script for them when he was 25 as a joke.   The convo didnt really go beyond that.. \n\n  This morning when i was bored on my phone (bathroom) i played a game a crib, and the very 1st ad was, about ED. [This is a screenshot](https://imgur.com/1346a1dd-01eb-4b08-8817-8f992e594671) Now the creepy part is, i didnt once every google about, search or anything, we litteraly just talked about it.   So the only thing that could of be tunning in, is either my alexa or my phone.    I think its safer to say the echo is more likely since its actually always listening.. \n\n  Has anyone else ever had something like this happen? Isnt this against the law?  Im not looking for any sort of compensation, just looking to shed some light on this intrusion.. \n\n\n",
  "I have quite a few of the home automation systems, so I have devices in quite quite a few of the hub which then advertise it to the the Echo. So I have say 6-8 items for each device. Is it possible to auto-group, set a default device, or use a text file to config the items. I don't have the patience to manually configure 400 items or so through the GUI.",
  "Ok so I have an Amazon Echo v2 with Alexa.  All working perfectly on my BT Smart hub 6.\nAfter much deliberation I decided to take the plunge into home automation and selected the WeMo link and 2 bulbs as a starting point.\nInstalled perfectly and working fine from the WeMo app on my android phone.  App sees both bulbs and I can switch them on and off and dim them all from the app...\nI bought them specifically as the articles reviewing them said they were alexa compatible l.  I also investigated and found support pages on Belkin website advising how to connect WeMo to Alexa (specifically naming the make and model of my bulbs), as well as having a skill to connect Alexa and WeMo.\nSo one could safely say WeMo lights work with Alexa.\n\nI have spent 10 hours so far attempting to get the Wemo skill activated with Alexa so I can control the bulbs via Alexa.  I know it can be done.  Others have done it.  But I am having real issues...\n\nSo, i contact support and advise them of the issue, which is as follows....\n     When I attempt to activate the WeMo  skill on Alexa I am asked to connect accounts.\nI do this and I am told I need to verify my network.\nThe app asks for the MAC address of the WeMo device as well as the name of the network it is connected to.\nBut, each time I enter this information the app states it cannot verify and has disabled linking between Wemo and Alexa for safety sake and to try again in 10 minutes.\n\nYes my Echo is on the same network as the Wemo.\nYes I can see the wemo connected from the control panel in my router.  Curiously though the MAC for the WeMo is 1 digit different from the MAC that is shown in the app...\nI have tried the MAC in capitals and small, with and without colons.\nI have renamed my network.\nI have reset the link and both bulbs numerous times back to factory settings.\nI have tried both the MAC that the app gives me and the MAC that the router shows for the WeMo link.\n\nI have spent many hours reading forums, support pages etc to try to find a solution without success...\n\nI contacted Wemo support to get some assistance with this as a search shows others have also had this issue.\nSupport state that the Wemo link is not alexa compatible!\n\nWHAT!  Really?  \nYou have a support page on how to connect them.\nOthers have done it.\nThey are advertised and sold as alexa compatible....\n\n\nHas anyone managed to solve the issue?\nWhere do I go from here?",
  "Title pretty much says it all. No matter how many times i reset or relink my devices Alexa just can't communicate with my Fire TV Stick.\n\nAmazon has not been helpful in this matter. They basically told me that it just doesn't work even though they advertised that it does...\n\nI'm about to just return the stupid thing. Is there anything else I can do?",
  "Hello,\ncurrently I am considering to buy a Amazon Echo Dot for myself, well because 50% off is 50% off ;-)\nI red quite some stuff about the safety of the recorded data, but that device is listening all the time. I think I red it only sends the recorded message after it recognized the keyword. \n\nBut is that true, does anybody of you have made any experience with it and it only sends after you made a request? \n\nHas anybody ever gotten an email with some advertisement because you talked about something?\n\nIs it possible or did somebody manage to hack into your network so he can \"spy\" on you? Does anybody know that, because Amazon says its all encrypted and safe.\n\nI dont want to look paranoid and I know I allready give Google all my information because I search with it, but that device is listening to me all the time except I deactivate the microphone.\n\nThanks in advance for clearing some stuff up for me. Also I appreciate your opinion on the data safety of the Amazon Echo and would like to know it with your experience that you made.",
  "For example, Alexa TV advertisements and/or shows that think they're being edgy when they try to trigger any device within range to do who knows what.\n\nI would really rather not run around the house muting any device that might be able to hear my TV every single time I watch something.\n",
  "I was browsing for channels to watch and all of the sudden my echo dot stated playing an advertisement song for graham crackers (something to do with s\u2019mores).  My house was totally silent at the time.. it was completely unprompted. Is anyone else hearing ads on Alexa?",
  "Eight months ago, I created the [Ultimate Guide to Flash Briefings](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/5v0rfd/the_ultimate_guide_to_flash_briefings/).  Since then, I've continued searching for the ultimate set of Flash Briefing skills, which is why I've updated this guide.  As seasoned Alexa-users likely know, the best Flash Briefings \u2014 NPR, BBC, and Word of the Day \u2014 are few in numbers and, for the most part, trash abounds the skill store. However, there are still hidden gems among the heaps of flaming garbage in the Amazon Echo skill store.\n\nFor those who are just starting with Alexa and those long-time Alexa users looking for a hidden gem, here's a quick summary:\n\n**The Staples** - For those who are new to Amazon Echo and Alexa\n\n1. [NPR Hourly News](http://bit.ly/redditnpr) \u2014 Well-produced news with a US focus. It has gotten significantly worse recently since it started running ads.\n\n2. \n[BBC](http://bit.ly/redditbbc) \u2014 Smart reporting on world news. This Flash Briefing is rather unchanging and doesn't have ads.  You'll get what you expect.\n\n3. [Word of the Day](http://bit.ly/redditword) \u2014 There is a reason Word of the Day is the **highest rated Flash Briefing:** The quality is spectacular. A sardonic host explains new words and gives highly entertaining ways of using them in a sentence.  Also, the [Word of the Day Quiz](http://bit.ly/redditwordquiz) is one of best skills I've used and a great way to solidify each day's word.\n\n**The Hidden Gems** \u2014 The best Flash Briefings off the beaten path\n\n1. [Daily Dad Joke](http://bit.ly/redditdadjoke) \u2014 A meek host shares legitimately funny dad jokes. Don't believe me? Try it.  It's about as funny as Word of the Day, just without the education.\n\n2. [Ripley's Weird Minute](http://bit.ly/redditripleys) \u2014 Straight up weird facts. They're fun and a human reads each day's fact with some real character.  I'm not sure why Ripley's is making a Flash Briefing, but it's one of the better ones.\n\n3. [Tom Bilyeu](http://bit.ly/redditbilyeu) \u2014 Tom Bilyeu is a motivational speaker/entrepreneur type. Think Tim Ferriss or Gary Vaynerchuk.  He's making good quality content, but it's clearly not for everyone.  If you think you'd be into some daily motivation, give him a try.\n\n\nFor those of you who are on the lookout for more specific Flash Briefings, I've compiled all my reviews of Flash Briefings by topic below.  I generally put better Flash Briefings at the top of each category and the worse ones toward the bottom but there are a few places where I don't quite know how to order the Briefings, so don't take the ordering too seriously.  You'll likely notice a theme: The best Flash Briefings have a human host, do not run too long or too short, and do not have ads.  Oh, and they aren't just recycling content from other areas (e.g., YouTube)\n\n***THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO FLASH BRIEFINGS***\n\n**General News**\n\n[NPR Hourly News](http://bit.ly/redditnpr)\n\nThis is one of the most consistently well produced Flash Briefings.  Clocking in at 5 minutes, the news summary is just long enough to be substantial and comprehensive, but not so long as to be annoying.  The mix between headline news and summaries is just right, but NPR has started to run ads in its Flash Briefing which is a big no-no.\n\n[BBC](http://bit.ly/redditbbc)\n\nJust like NPR and Fox News, this Flash Briefing stands out as one of the most well produced.  However, what really sets the BBC apart from the other two is that the BBC covers different stories \u2014 often less US-centric stories.  If you have multiple US news Flash Briefings, the BBC can be very refreshing and introduce you to some news stories you haven't yet heard about.  I'd highly recommend it.\n\n[Fox News](https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-Channel/dp/B01M5EIW2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is among the better news Flash Briefing skills.  You'll get a full view of US news from a human presenter.  The biggest problem is long, annoying ads they run.  BBC and NPR don't run ads and have similar content.  The other problem is the volume: it's all over the place.  The main host is significantly louder than the correspondents who speak with him.  That being said, it's only mildly distracting, especially compared to the ad.  In total, if you are trying to figure out which news Flash Briefings to use, give Fox News a shot.\n\n[90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has changed **a lot** in the last 8 months... for the worse.  The Flash Briefing is now much longer than 90 seconds and is hosted by a somewhat monotone presenter (Mike Pesca doesn't host it anymore).  I'd give this one a pass, but if you think you'd be into it, try it out.\n\n[Biden's Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/Joe-Biden-Bidens-Flash-Briefing/dp/B073DH274W/)\n\nThis is a frustrating Flash Briefing. I initially enabled this Flash Briefing because I thought once in a while Biden would share his opinions on interesting issues through the Flash Briefing. Oh, how wrong I was! Every day, I hear the same Biden recording about how he \"hand picks relevant stories\" and then a woman reads an article.  I would only give this a try if you are the biggest Biden fan.\n\n[theSkimm](https://www.amazon.com/theSkimm-Inc/dp/B01JM6TN8M/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537954&sr=1-1&keywords=theSkimm)\n\nFor those who don't know, theSkimm is a daily email directed toward millennial women that sends you a short news briefing.  This Flash Briefing just has Alexa read that email.  It's better than most Flash Briefings where Alexa reads the news, but it still is far from the best Flash Briefing.  I'd recommend passing on this as NPR and BBC are much better.\n\n[Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Quartz/dp/B01M278ZFA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538052&sr=1-1&keywords=quartz)\n\nAlexa reads the news.  The writing is actually pretty good, but without a human reading the news, it's not worth it.  There are tons of competitor that were a human host reads the news.\n \n[Refinery29: 8 Things You Need to Know This AM](https://www.amazon.com/Refinery29-Things-Need-Know-This/dp/B01JHR7TK0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537988&sr=1-1&keywords=refinery29)\n\nAlexa reads Refinery29 headlines.  It covers a wide swath of topics, from Health to LGBTQ News.  Refinery29 does not cover any of these stories in more than a sentence, so the Flash Briefing is short and uninformative.  My suggestion is that you should leave Refinery29 out of your morning routine.\n\n[BuzzFeed News](https://www.amazon.com/BuzzFeed-News/dp/B01MQR7Y5D/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538110&sr=1-1&keywords=buzzfeed)\n\nAlexa reads BuzzFeed headlines.  This is possibly the worst Flash Briefing made by a large company that I've seen.  Isn't BuzzFeed supposed to be better than the average media company at creating content for digital platforms?\n\n**Business News**\n\n[CNBC Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/NBCUniversal-CNBC-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01N7FH24X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is the best business news Flash Briefing.  A real human reads the business news headlines with a short explanation.  Every day it covers interesting sales numbers, mergers, and trends.  The length of the Flash Briefing is about right.  I'd highly recommend adding this to your Flash Briefing.\n\n[Motley Fool Stock Watch](https://www.amazon.com/The-Motley-Fool-Stock-Watch/dp/B01KG5YXS8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538317&sr=1-1&keywords=motley+fool)\n\nThis is a very short interview with a stock expert on a recent topic.  I find it informative and very digestible \u2014 a good way to learn interesting tidbits about what's going on in different sectors of the economy and the stock market.\n\n[Cheddar](https://www.amazon.com/Cheddar/dp/B074CM2CD8/)\n\nCheddar is making financial content specifically for Alexa... kinda. They package some boilerplate daily content (e.g., big stories of the day with few details, market stats) along with some interviews that do not provide that much information. Maybe I just have a high standard for financial news, but this is only okay.  Anyway, it's worth a try if you're looking for financial news.\n\n[Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is just a short business story read by a human.  This generally isn't a headline story, so the stories are somewhat refreshing, and the delivery is pretty good. There are not that many good options for business news in the Amazon Skill store, so if you are in need of more business news, give Level Up a try.\n\n[Bankable by Forbes](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Bankable-by/dp/B01L7DFOEU/)\n\nCute little stories about young people making it the world.  The host is rather dry and quiet, but if you need some positivity in your Flash Briefing, this might be your choice.  The length is right, and it's got a good message.\n\n[Econoday U.S. Economic Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-U-S-Economic-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01MEBW3T0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538474&sr=1-1&keywords=econoday)\n\nEconomic news read by Alexa.  It's too long, but it isn't one of those Flash Briefings that never end.  If you absolutely must have news about the Fed and stock market in your Flash Briefing, Econoday is for you.  However, it's not very good, so I'd say pass.\n\n[Econoday Global Market Update](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-Global-Market-Update/dp/B01MDPRG23/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538529&sr=1-2&keywords=econoday)\n\nAlexa reads how the stock, money, and commodity markets changed since the last day and reports basic news.  I would not recommend this Flash Briefing to anyone who doesn't have a job in finance (and I wouldn't even recommend it to most financial professionals).\n\n[The Economist](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-The-Economist/dp/B01JHLMNWU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538580&sr=1-1&keywords=economist)\n\nDon't bother including this in your Flash Briefing.  This is just an entire Economist podcast, and it's not even a good podcast.\n\n**Tech News**\n\n[Daily Tech Headlines](https://www.amazon.com/DiamondClub-TV-Daily-Tech-Headlines/dp/B01M1B3K5U/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538726&sr=1-1&keywords=Daily+Tech+Headlines)\n\nThis is the best tech news Flash Briefing.  It covers a wide expanse of tech news in just the right amount of detail.  The host is human, concise, and clear.  The only issue with this Flash Briefing is there are too many stories in each Flash Briefing, especially if you're not a tech professional.  I'd like to see the makers of this Flash Briefing really cut down the length of their shows.  That being said, this is the best tech Flash Briefing I've found, so give it a try.\n\n[This Week in Tech](https://www.amazon.com/TWiT-tv-This-Week-in-Tech/dp/B01LJB8UMS/)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is really just a taste of a longer piece of content that you can listen to elsewhere.  It's hardly a comprehensive look at tech news; rather, it's a clip from a longer tech new show.  The clip is always fun, but I would not classify this Flash Briefing as an informative tech news show.\n\n[TechCruch](https://www.amazon.com/AOL-Inc-TechCrunch/dp/B01L6HQHGQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538760&sr=1-1&keywords=techcrunch)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is weird.  A bro reads tech news and talks about what a \"badass\" Elon Musk is (that's a real quote).  This bro-host tells a bunch of jokes that aren't all that funny but feel like a stereotype of jokes a Silicon Valley bro would tell.  This might be your type of humor, but it's certainly not mine.  I'd lightly recommend passing on it, but if off-beat, that's-so-random humor is your thing then give it a try.  However, most people seem to hate it.\n\n**Sports News**\n\n[CBS Sports Minute](https://www.amazon.com/CBS-Local-Sports-Minute/dp/B01M9FIFIK/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-3&keywords=sports)\n\nThis is best sports Flash Briefing I've found, but that's not saying much.  It covers one sports related story a day, and it doesn't report scores.  The host is very energetic, and the stories are interesting.  However, you probably won't get a full update on sports scores if that's what you're interested in.\n\n[ESPN SportsCenter Update](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-ESPN-Radio-via/dp/B01JHLKHQ4/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-2&keywords=sports)\n\nThis app has a terribly boring music intro that lasts 30 seconds.  Some reviewers have complained about the volume, but I haven't noticed an issue recently.  The news itself is pretty good; what you'd expect from SportsCenter.  There is an advertisement at the end that drags out.  It lasts about 3 minutes.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n[Word of the Day](http://bit.ly/redditword)\n\nThis is my favorite Flash Briefing.  Every day, the human host sardonically explains a word of the day and gives examples of how to use the word.  It's funny, smart, and a little irreverent.  The production quality is top notch, the length of the briefing is just right, and the entertaining examples of how to use the words make it pretty hard to forget the word.  Recently, they've added [Word of the Day Quiz](http://bit.ly/redditwordquiz), which is a quiz \u2014 also voiced by a human \u2014 that helps you solidify that day's word in Word of the Day's characteristic style.  I love Word of the Day.\n\n[Daily Dad Joke](http://bit.ly/redditdadjoke)\n\nA meek host shares legitimately funny dad jokes. For the uninitiated, dad jokes are bad pun and cute one-liners.  As the name suggests, they're family friendly.  I know this doesn't sell Daily Dad Jokes, but it's legitimately great.  It brightens my day, and it gives me something silly to share with loved ones.  Give it a try!\n\n[Ripley's Weird Minute](http://bit.ly/redditripleys)\n\nRipley's is back at it with weird facts.  I thought they were gone, but nope; they're still kicking with strange facts on a daily basis.  They're fun and a human reads each day's fact with some real character.  I'm not sure why Ripley's is making a Flash Briefing, but it's one of the better ones.\n\n[Tom Bilyeu](http://bit.ly/redditbilyeu)\n\nEven though I ranked this as a hidden gem, I'm fairly mixed on this.  Tom Bilyeu is a motivational speaker/entrepreneur type. Think Tim Ferriss or Gary Vaynerchuk.  I'm really not into the motivational speaker/entrepreneur scene, so I am not a great judge of how motivational it is.  What I can say is that he's making good quality content with a good message.  If you think you'd be into some daily motivation, give him a try.\n\n[Daily Meditation Reminder](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Daily-Meditation-Reminder/dp/B07694FLKS/)\n\nFrom the makers of Word of the Day, this is a rather utilitarian Flash Briefing. Each day the human host reminds you to meditate and then gives you a tip on meditation or a summary of a medical study on meditation.  It's good, but the audience that needs this (Alexa users who meditate and want a reminder to meditate) has to be pretty small.  Regardless if you're an Alexa user that wants a nice little reminder to meditate each morning, try this one out for size.\n\n[Gary Vee 365](https://www.amazon.com/VaynerMedia-GaryVee-365/dp/B072WG89RB/)\n\nThis is Gary Vaynerchuk's Flash Briefing where he shares his daily thoughts.  I'm not sure I totally get it.  Maybe it's really just for Gary Vee fans...  Here's what I do know: the sound quality is terrible.  It is clearly recorded during other events (ex. speeches) and repurposed for Amazon Alexa.  If you're not really into Gary Vaynerchuk, I doubt this is for you.\n\n[Discovery: DNews](https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Communications-DNews/dp/B01JHK5V6G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539512&sr=1-1&keywords=dnews)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has science news.  It's one moderately in-depth story a day, often about refreshing topics not covered by other news sites.  The audio is repurposed from YouTube videos, but you probably won't notice because the audio doesn't rely on the visuals.  I'd give it a try.\n\n[Complex News](https://www.amazon.com/Complex-News/dp/B01MXXXRLW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538966&sr=1-1&keywords=complex)\n\nThis is the best Flash Briefing for celebrity gossip. It covers just one story a day, but Complex does it in style. It's very punchy and energetic.  My guess is that it's repurposed video content, but I quite like it, and I am not one who typically enjoys celebrity news.  The entire briefing lasts about 2 minutes.\n\n[Top Reddit Posts Unofficial](https://www.amazon.com/Josh-Jones-Reddit-Posts-Unofficial/dp/B01MTWUMY6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539027&sr=1-1&keywords=top+reddit+post)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has Alexa read the top recent 5 Reddit posts.  More specifically, Alexa reads the title of the Reddit post and then 1 comment.  Normally, Flash Briefings that have Alexa read the news are terrible.  This one is a mild exception.  It's good, but it's certainly not great.\n\n[Harvard Business Review: Management Tip](https://www.amazon.com/Harvard-Business-Review-Management-Tip/dp/B01LQM9N8A/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539233&sr=1-1&keywords=harvard)\n\nI don't think that a Flash Briefing is the right place for a management tip.  I find that these tips are incredibly forgettable \u2014 these tips are ideas like \"reconsider how you measuring data.\"  That's not a particularly useful tip, and I can never remember the minutia of how HBR suggests implementing the tip.  However, I know some people love this type of management advice, so if this sounds like the Flash Briefing for you, it probably is.\n\n[eHow](https://www.amazon.com/Demand-Media-eHow/dp/B01M29BSFG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539070&sr=1-1&keywords=ehow)\n\nIf you want an update on what eHow has been publishing recently, then I have the Flash Briefing for you.  You'll learn some interesting and pointless things from this Flash Briefing, like the amount of calcium in chia seeds and your dog's separation anxiety.  I wouldn't add it to your Flash Briefing, unless you want to know useless trivia or what eHow's been publishing.\n\n[Pulse of the Planet](https://www.amazon.com/Pulse-of-the-Planet/dp/B01K0JWGSY/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539103&sr=1-1&keywords=pulse+of+the+planet)\n\nThis is a weird mix of nature sounds and general interest stories.  I'm not sure who this would appeal to, but it's certainly unique.  It's not too long, so it might make sense to try it out if general interest stories are your MO.\n\n[Dan's Lie of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Dans-Lie-of-the-Day/dp/B06ZYN3PRT/)\n\nThis is a confusing Flash Briefing.  I like the concept, but I don't understand the execution. Maybe someone can explain it to me?

  "What's pretty stupid for a device like the Amazon Echo, one that is advertised to be family-friendly and placed in the center of the home, is that you can't prevent it from playing explicit songs from Amazon Music Unlimited (AMU), either on the device or in the Alexa app, but ironically, Alexa won't curse a single word without humorously bleeping over it.\n\nAlso, if Alexa is not accurate with the voice recognition, she could inadvertently choose and announce some ridiculously vulgar title (albeit heavily bleeped) and then immediately play its song, too (not bleeped!).\n\nThere's got to be a fix for this.\n\nConsidering there's been a peculiar uptick of recent charting pop songs that blurt a single or couple of unnecessary profanities, my kids and wife have me scrambling to find or hack together a \"Radio Edit\" version of that song I can add to my personal library, just so it won't play the one found in the AMU library.",
  "Were any of you guy's able to get your Tv to turn on and netflix to start in one command using \"Alexa, turn on Netflix\" with the echo, fire tv, and harmony hub? \n \n \nFeel like this is advertised everywhere but I can't figure out how to set it up other than setting up the harmony hub to kick in \"down\" \"down\" \"select\" remote control commands and manually selecting netflix from the fire tv main menu, pretty much with zero help from the echo native app startup feature. Not to mention, I'd have to change the command to something other than \"Alexa, turn on Netflix\" to more so something like \"Alexa, turn on Netflix system\" or \"Alexa turn on watching Netflix\" bc of the issues with Echo's native commands.\n \n \nAs background, my individual activities/skills work fine (such as tv turning on and netflix starting) through seperate commands but just not in a single, as advertised, \"Alexa, turn on Netflix\".\n\nAny help is appreciated!",
  "Hi all,\nI've been playing around with the new calling features of Alexa. They advertise being able to call numbers in the US, Canada and Mexico. Here's the challenge: While US and Canadian numbers follow the same format and have unique area codes, Mexico does not. For example, I can call a number in the SF Bay area by asking for Alexa to call 415-xxx-xxxx, or a number in Newfoundland by asking for 709-xxx-xxxx, Canada and US both have the same country code (1). Mexico, however, has a different country code (52) and numbers in some areas don't follow the same format as the US and Canada. For example, the area code in Puerto Vallarta is 322. If I try to call a number there, I just get \"I can call numbers in your contacts or I can call numbers in US, Canada and Mexico\". I've tried with just the area code, with the country code, and various other combinations. No luck.\n\nAm I going to be forced to put any Mexican numbers in my contacts?",
  "This isn't an echo question, but when Amazon advertises a fire tablet with Alexa, isn't that just an app pre-installed?  My mom has a fire tablet, but she sent me an email this morning asking if I thought it was a good deal to get this new tablet with Alexa.",
  "Just one example:  http://imgur.com/a/hOF3H -- When I go to this deals website it says its $17.94.  When I try to order it verbally it says its $23.87 'after a discount of $11.96 courtesy of alexa.'  So I click the link to it off the alexadeals page https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0178IC734 it states its $29.90.  I get that the 29.90$ price shouldn't match up to the alexa deal, but where is this 17.94$ number coming from?  As expensive as it it is here in NYC 5$+ of tax on a 18$ item is not right.  Furthermore, the verbal price with the \"11.96 courtesy of alexa\" + 23.87$ also does not equal the 'normal price' of 29.90$.  \n\nSo what is going on here with the 'deals' via alexa ordering?  The 'discount' seems to be using some kind of un-math and even the deals website seems to be false advertising.\n\nI don't even want this item, I am just trying to figure out why the deals website doesn't appear to be accurate (as I would prefer to look there first instead of listening to a bunch of crap I am not interested in)  Also doesn't seem to be a way to figure out what kind of 'deal' it really is as the discount they verbally state doesn't add up to the full price either when I check.",
  "I am trying to decide between the echo and home and one of the uses that I'm intrigued by is using it in the kitchen to work through recipes. \n\nI can't seem to find much information on how well this works. I've seen an advertisement for the allrecipes skill which looks cool. How well does it work practically? What about if you find a recipe in a different website- is the echo worthless for that or are there other cooking skills that could help?",
  "I haven't seen much mention of this so in case you weren't aware the Show has a photo booth function built into it. You can just say \"Take a Photo\" and choose to take a single shot, 4 shot (like a photo booth) or a picture with built in stickers.\n\nI thought it was pretty cool and not sure I've seen Amazon advertise that functionality much.

  "I just set up the new Alexa Calling & Messaging service from my iPhone, and was very excited to send my first message to my Echo at home. \n\nIt works as advertised, however there is NO WAY (that I can find) to compose a new msg without first giving Alexa (Amazon) access to ALL my contacts from my iPhone. That is unacceptable to me.\n\nIf I could create a separate contacts list on Amazon or create a secondary contacts list on my iPhone that Alexa could select I'd  be fine. But as things are now this is a major DEAL BREAKER for me. -- Tell me if I'm wrong and how to avoid giving Amazon the CONTACTS crown jewels. \n\nI won't be using this service until this basic privacy issue is resolved. I'll keep watching for Alexa app updates to see if anything changes.  ",
  "Amazon does not make it easy to search for good Flash Briefings.  If you look on the [Alexa Skill page](https://www.amazon.com/alexa-skills/b/ref=topnav_storetab_a2s?ie=UTF8&node=13727921011), you won't see a \"Top Enabled Flash Briefing: category.  You *will* see a \"Top Enabled Skills\" category and a general, albeit small and terribly curated, \"Flash Briefing\" category.  This is a shame; some of the best Alexa skills are Flash Briefings, and Amazon does nothing to highlight those Flash Briefings.\n\nHowever, there's a trick to seeing the most popular Flash Briefings.  This will word on the Alexa mobile app and on the web portal for Alexa. Here's what you do:\n\n1. Open your [Alexa app](http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#cards).\n\n2. Navigate to [Settings](http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#settings).\n\n3. Click on [Flash Briefing](http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#settings/flash-briefing).\n\n4. Click on [\"Get more Flash Briefing content\"](http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#skills/category/14551479011/?sort=review-rank&ref-suffix=sb_ca).\n\n5. Scroll down to \"Top Enabled Skills.\"  You'll notice that these are the top enabled Flash Briefings instead of general skills.\n\n\nIf you are logged onto Alexa on the web you can just, click on [this link](http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#skills/category/14551479011/?sort=review-rank&ref-suffix=sb_ca) to see the most popular Flash Briefings. All you need to do is scroll down to \"Top Enabled Skills.\"\n\nMany of these Flash Briefings are really entertaining, and some are largely unknown.  I've gone through the top 15 most popular Flash Briefings and put together a general guide to which are the best.\n\n**Top 15 Most Popular Flash Briefings:**\n\n1. Fox News\n\n2. BBC\n\n3. The Daily from The New York Times\n\n4. Associated Press Headlines\n\n5. CNBC Flash Briefing\n\n6. Up First\n\n7. Verse of the Day\n\n8. Daily Tech Headlines\n\n9. NPR Hourly News Summary\n\n10. Harvard Business Review: Management Tips\n\n11. Word of the Day\n\n12. Bloomberg Flash Briefings\n\n13. The Daily Show\n\n14. Motley Fool Stock Watch\n\n15. This Week in Tech\n\n\n\n**Best popular Flash Briefings**\n\n\n**[Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1492806641&sr=1-1&keywords=word+of+the+day)** blows all the other Flash Briefings out of the water.  The host is relentlessly funny and has an amazing voice.  The humor makes remember the words very easy to remember, and the word choice is great.  I've been listening for maybe 2 months, and it's been amazing since the day I started.  You'll actually find yourself using these words in your day to day conversations.  In my opinion, this is the best Flash Briefing at the moment.\n\n\n**[Verse of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Church-Verse-of-the-Day/dp/B01NB1U6UI/ref=sr_1_4?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1492806697&sr=1-4&keywords=verse+of+the+day)** is also fantastic.  It's a Bible verse, so the Flash Briefing probably best if you're Christian.  However, I'm not religious, but it's in my Flash Briefing simply because I'm interested in religion, and it's a phenomenal Flash Briefing.  The reader has a knock-out voice and delivery.  If you're looking to add some religion to your day, or if you just are interested in this stuff (like me), you should really consider it.\n\n\n**[BBC](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-BBC/dp/B01JHLI06S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1492806714&sr=1-1&keywords=BBC)** is one of the better news Flash Briefings.  Most of the news Flash Briefings are pretty good, but if I had to recommend one, I'd recommend BBC.  It covers news from a global perspective in a way that none of the other Flash Briefings do.\n\n\n**[Motley Fool Money](https://www.amazon.com/The-Motley-Fool-Stock-Watch/dp/B01KG5YXS8/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1492806793&sr=1-2&keywords=fool)** is my favorite business Flash Briefing at the moment, but it's not phenomenal like Word of the Day, Verse of the Day, or BBC.  Motley Fool frequently forgets to update the feed or accidentally leaves old items in the Flash Briefing.  For example, on Tuesday, you might hear about how Pepsi stock is doing and, on Wednesday, you might hear how IBM is doing *and* how Pepsi stock is doing again.  That being said, it's a good brief nugget of business news.\n\n\n**[This Week in Tech](https://www.amazon.com/TWiT-tv-This-Week-in-Tech/dp/B01LJB8UMS/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1492806809&sr=1-1&keywords=this+week+in+tech)** is one of my favorite technology news Flash Briefings.  It's short, sweet, and to the point.  However, it's maybe a little too short, and it's pretty much an advertisement for another This Week in Tech show.  Also, I find that the hosts could do a better job at delivering the news; they're a little too fast and they can lose me.\n\n\n**[Daily Tech Headlines](https://www.amazon.com/DiamondClub-TV-Daily-Tech-Headlines/dp/B01M1B3K5U/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1492806853&sr=1-1&keywords=daily+tech+headlines)** is my other favorite technology news Flash Briefing.  Just like This Week in Tech, it has problems, but it's still pretty good.  It's long and comprehensive.  However, it's a little too long.  The host's delivery is really good, but I'm not a huge fan of being told to support the show on Patreon constantly.\n\n\n**[Harvard Business Review: Management Tips](https://www.amazon.com/Harvard-Business-Review-Management-Tip/dp/B01LQM9N8A/ref=sr_1_4?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1492806871&sr=1-4&keywords=management)** is a pretty good Flash Briefing for those interested in management advice, but it's fairly dry.  The host's delivery is monotoned, but the content is occasionally thought-provoking.  Personally, it's not my cup of tea, but I'm sure there are some people who really love this sort of self-improvement content.\n\n\n**TL;DR**: Look at \"Top Enabled Skills\" on [this page](http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#skills/category/14551479011/?sort=review-rank&ref-suffix=sb_ca). The best Flash Briefing I've found is [Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1492806641&sr=1-1&keywords=word+of+the+day).",
  "The \"news\" for today when I asked Alexa what's up was an ad for star wars battlefront 2!",
  "The most common question asked here is \"what should I do with my pi?\"\n\nThis is a solution to that question. You can now get everything you need to complete the projects we all bought our pi's for.\n\nWhat I have done is started a subscription box business, with the intention of providing a monthly project for your raspberry pi's. I have tried to pick projects that offer the best combination of improving your tech skills and being something you will use more than once.\n\nI would like to think I have an above average grasp of all aspects of technology and I was worried that I would pick projects that would not be able to be completed by someone with a novice skill level or even someone who has never seen a raspberry pi before.\n\nTo make sure that was not the issue. I asked my 11-year-old daughter to help me. This is an average 11-year-old, she does have her own phone, tablet, and laptop. But let's be honest here she spends all her time talking to friends or watching kids open toys on youtube. She is a good student at a small public school. She knows dad makes money working with computers and that\u2019s about it.\n\nI told her I had a headache and asked her to help me. We sat down at the kitchen table with her laptop and the parts I have picked out for the first subscription box. I had her navigate to \"https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app/wiki/Raspberry-Pi\" and we just walked through each step. I don\u2019t think she noticed that it took almost 2 hours to complete it. When we were done she wanted to keep it in her room. That was about a week ago and every once in a while I can hear her asking Alexa a math problem or something similar.\n\nSure I was right there beside her to answer any questions or nudge her in the right direction. I think it is worth noting that she had an excellent guide to follow, but we all know that every project most of us want to do at this point is well documented. The issue we have is either lacking the parts to do a project or we have trouble deciding which one we want to do.\n\nA few of the projects I want to add to the coming month's boxes would be things like retropie, a mini magic mirror for the desk, a weather station, some kind of home automation, a time-lapse camera. Functional things like that. Things all ages groups would enjoy.\n\nI don\u2019t want you all to think that I am just getting cheap parts from china and sending them out with a high price tag. What I have done is searched amazon for the parts needed for each project, the first months is the Alexa pi so we needed an SD card. I found some Sandisk 16gb class 10's. we needed a USB microphone. I wouldn\u2019t want the one that is advertised on the GitHub link above due to it not having a cable, so I found a flexible one that would stay where I pointed it at. The last thing we needed was a speaker with a headphone cable, so I got an external speaker designed for a ham radio that had noise canceling built in because why not?\n\nI made sure all of these were 4-star reviews or higher and I also went through all of the comments till I seen that each product I picked was going to work with raspberry pi without issue. Then once I received them I plugged them into all of my pi's to make sure they worked across the raspberry pi family.\n\nWhile I am positive that most any person out there could come up with some fancy marketing and pretty boxes. I am not that creative. I am offering my passion as a raspberry pi enthusiast. I would not put anything in the boxes that I wouldn\u2019t use myself. I don\u2019t like buying cheap things I am more of a buy it for life type of guy. I stay current on the new uses for raspberry pi and I will always make sure that whatever the project is that month that the instructions are clear enough for anyone capable of reading English to follow.\n\nThe price of the box itself is $50.00 per month.\n\nThis is the only thing that I am not 100% sure of but I wanted to be prepared for those of us from the UK and other countries. I couldn't figure out a good way of doing the shipping for just you on crate joy's website. I decided a flat rate of $50.00 would guarantee regardless of total weight that I could ship oversea's. I am not happy about this and it will change as soon as I can find a way to handle it properly with cratejoy.\n\nhttps://www.cratejoy.com/subscription-box/fortified-it-solutions/\n\nThat\u2019s the link to get your subscriptions started. I don\u2019t have any discount codes or anything at this time. Cratejoy has a refer a friend link where both parties receive $5.00 after they spend $30.00 and I am sure someone here can figure out how the community can take advantage of that. What I would like to do however is anyone that reads this and subscribe's can PM me and I will do overnight shipping or two-day shipping whatever works out best for you. And then hopefully you will leave an honest review of my boxes either here or on cratejoy preferably both.\n\nThoughts and suggestions welcome below.\n\n*UPDATED EDIT - its pretty much being demanded by the community at this point that I ship raspberry pi's with each box. I will update the listing on cratejoy to include a raspberry pi zero w with each project. if you would like to receive a different model just request it and I will swap models out for you.\n",
  "There's times when I mess around with my Echo asking random stuff to see what clever answer's Amazon's programmed up. In doing so I stumbled upon asking her \"What's up?\". Imagine my surprise when she gave me a useful, brief answer containing the following: Current time, brief weather report (shorter than asking her for the weather), and one interesting newsy fact. I instantly found this command incredibly useful.\n\nI love my Echo but I hate having to bark command and command at her to know the time, weather, commute, and flash briefing. This one command slashes 2-3 of those things off my normal routine. It's great to see Amazon really have deep-level commands that we discover and are delighted with, but I truly think Amazon needs to let more people know about this one. I also want the ability to create a custom command that executes X amount of commands so I don't have to ask for 5 things each day.\n\nEither way, give this one a shot. I think many here will quite enjoy it.",
  "Just checking through my Dot options and I see now that Alexa can read my Kindle books??? Didn't see this advertised anywhere. I knew its available in the US but it looks like the UK got it too now!",
  "It started yesterday and it happens at the beginning of one of my flash briefing stops.  There ad is for Indeed and I do not like the idea of putting an ad there so I think I'm going to drop them as a source.\n\nKind of sucks though because it was local news to me and I liked that.",
  "I find it weird that MLB is on so many devices yet there's no echo integration. They also advertise with them constantly. I would love to see a skill or integration where I could say play the Chicago Cubs and the Echo  would start playing the cubs audio off my subscription. It is my  most wished for Amazon request. That or Sirius. Anyway here's for hoping just wonder if anyone else feels the same or have heard anything?",
  "Ever since I've got my Amazon Echo, I've been searching for the ultimate set of Flash Briefing skills.  Seasoned Alexa-users are probably aware of some of the best briefings \u2014 NPR, BBC, and Fox News \u2014 and they've probably found a bunch of garbage Flash Briefings; most Flash Briefings are garbage.  However, among the swamp of crappy Flash Briefings, I've found a few staples and a few hidden gems.\n\nFor those who are just starting with Alexa and those long-time Alexa users looking for a hidden gem, here's a quick summary:\n\n**The Staples** - For those who are new to Amazon Echo and Alexa\n\n1. [NPR Hourly News](https://www.amazon.com/NPR-Hourly-News-Summary/dp/B01K07MU64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) \u2014 Well-produced news with a US focus\n\n2. \n[BBC](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-BBC/dp/B01JHLI06S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487536887&sr=1-1&keywords=bbc) \u2014 Smart reporting on world news\n\n3. [Fox News](https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-Channel/dp/B01M5EIW2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) \u2014 Great production value, great news, but suffers from an annoyin ad in the middle.\n\n**The Hidden Gems** \u2014 The best Flash Briefings off the beaten path\n\n1. [Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day) \u2014 A sardonic host explains new words and gives highly entertaining ways of using them in a sentence; great production value, hilarious, and you'll learn some new words. Do yourself a favor and enable Word of the Day.\n\n2. [90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate) \u2014 Refershing Flash Breifing about the news; the host delivers a very short news summary with panache.  You definitely can't sleep through this news report.\n\n3. [Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up) \u2014 A short Flash Briefing that tells the story of startups; it's consistently solid, and, occassionally, it will give you a story you'll think about for the rest of the day.\n\n\nFor those of you who are on the lookout for more specific Flash Briefings, I've compiled all my reviews of Flash Briefings by topic below.  I generally put better Flash Briefings at the top of each category and the worse ones toward the bottom but there are a few places where I don't quite know how to order the Briefings, so don't take the ordering too seriously.  You'll likely notice a theme: The best Flash Briefings have a human host, do not run too long or too short, and do not have ads.  I also tend to prefer Flash Briefings that have a bit of personality \u2014 dry deliveries put me to sleep.\n\n***THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO FLASH BRIEFINGS***\n\n**General News**\n\n[NPR Hourly News](https://www.amazon.com/NPR-Hourly-News-Summary/dp/B01K07MU64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is one of the most consistently well produced Flash Briefings.  Clocking in at 5 minutes, the news summary is just long enough to be substantial and comprehensive, but not so long as to be annoying.  The mix between headline news and summaries is just right, and NPR has left the advertising out of the briefing.\n\n[BBC](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-BBC/dp/B01JHLI06S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487536887&sr=1-1&keywords=bbc)\n\nJust like NPR and Fox News, this Flash Briefing stands out as one of the most well produced.  However, what really sets the BBC apart from the other two is that the BBC covers different stories \u2014 often less US-centric stories.  If you have multiple US news Flash Briefings, the BBC can be very refreshing and introduce you to some news stories you haven't yet heard about.  I'd highly recommend it.\n\n[Fox News](https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-Channel/dp/B01M5EIW2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is among the better news Flash Briefing skills.  You'll get a full view of US news from a human presenter.  The biggest problem is long, annoying ads they run.  BBC and NPR don't run ads and have similar content.  The other problem is the volume: it's all over the place.  The main host is significantly louder than the correspondents who speak with him.  That being said, it's only mildly distracting, especially compared to the ad.  In total, if you are trying to figure out which news Flash Briefings to use, give Fox News a shot.\n\n[90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate)\n\nA real human, Mike Pasca, reads 2 or 3 news stories with panache.  I really love how the presenter reads the stories; sometimes he'll say something like \"We've got two stories for you today \u2014 one that matters and one that does not.\"  You definitely won't sleep through this Flash Briefing.  There is an ad at the end, but it's the least annoying ad I've seen in a Flash Briefing so far.  Overall, I'd say give this Flash Briefing a try and see if it's for you.\n\n[theSkimm](https://www.amazon.com/theSkimm-Inc/dp/B01JM6TN8M/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537954&sr=1-1&keywords=theSkimm)\n\nFor those who don't know, theSkimm is a daily email that sends you a short news briefing.  This Flash Briefing just has Alexa read that email.  It's better than most Flash Briefings where Alexa reads the news, but it still is far from the best Flash Briefing.  I'd recommend passing on this as NPR and BBC are much better.\n\n[Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Quartz/dp/B01M278ZFA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538052&sr=1-1&keywords=quartz)\n\nAlexa reads the news.  The writing is actually pretty good, but without a human reading the news, it's not worth it.  There are tons of competitor that were a human host reads the news.\n \n[Refinery29: 8 Things You Need to Know This AM](https://www.amazon.com/Refinery29-Things-Need-Know-This/dp/B01JHR7TK0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537988&sr=1-1&keywords=refinery29)\n\nAlexa reads Refinery29 headlines.  It covers a wide swath of topics, from Health to LGBTQ News.  Refinery29 does not cover any of these stories in more than a sentence, so the Flash Briefing is short and uninformative.  My suggestion is that you should leave Refinery29 out of your morning routine.\n\n[BuzzFeed News](https://www.amazon.com/BuzzFeed-News/dp/B01MQR7Y5D/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538110&sr=1-1&keywords=buzzfeed)\n\nAlexa reads BuzzFeed headlines.  This is possibly the worst Flash Briefing made by a large company that I've seen.  Isn't BuzzFeed supposed to be better than the average media company at creating content for digital platforms?\n\n**Business News**\n\n[CNBC Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/NBCUniversal-CNBC-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01N7FH24X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is the best business news Flash Briefing.  A real human reads the business news headlines with a short explanation.  Every day it covers interesting sales numbers, mergers, and trends.  The length of the Flash Briefing is about right.  I'd highly recommend adding this to your Flash Briefing.\n\n[Motley Fool Stock Watch](https://www.amazon.com/The-Motley-Fool-Stock-Watch/dp/B01KG5YXS8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538317&sr=1-1&keywords=motley+fool)\n\nThis is a very short interview with a stock expert on a recent topic.  I find it informative and very digestible \u2014 a good way to learn interesting tidbits about what's going on in different sectors of the economy and the stock market.\n\n[Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is just a short business story read by a human.  This generally isn't a headline story, so the stories are somewhat refreshing, and the delivery is pretty good. There are not that many good options for business news in the Amazon Skill store, so if you are in need of more business news, give Level Up a try.\n\n[Econoday U.S. Economic Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-U-S-Economic-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01MEBW3T0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538474&sr=1-1&keywords=econoday)\n\nEconomic news read by Alexa.  It's too long, but it isn't one of those Flash Briefings that never end.  If you absolutely must have news about the Fed and stock market in your Flash Briefing, Econoday is for you.  However, it's not very good, so I'd say pass.\n\n[Econoday Global Market Update](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-Global-Market-Update/dp/B01MDPRG23/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538529&sr=1-2&keywords=econoday)\n\nAlexa reads how the stock, money, and commodity markets changed since the last day and reports basic news.  I would not recommend this Flash Briefing to anyone who doesn't have a job in finance (and I wouldn't even recommend it to most financial professionals).\n\n[The Economist](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-The-Economist/dp/B01JHLMNWU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538580&sr=1-1&keywords=economist)\n\nDon't bother including this in your Flash Briefing.  This is just an entire Economist podcast, and it's not even a good podcast.\n\n**Tech News**\n\n[Daily Tech Headlines](https://www.amazon.com/DiamondClub-TV-Daily-Tech-Headlines/dp/B01M1B3K5U/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538726&sr=1-1&keywords=Daily+Tech+Headlines)\n\nThis is the best tech news Flash Briefing.  It covers a wide expanse of tech news in just the right amount of detail.  The host is human, concise, and clear.  The only issue with this Flash Briefing is there are too many stories in each Flash Briefing, especially if you're not a tech professional.  I'd like to see the makers of this Flash Briefing really cut down the length of their shows.  That being said, this is the best tech Flash Briefing I've found, so give it a try.\n\n[TechCruch](https://www.amazon.com/AOL-Inc-TechCrunch/dp/B01L6HQHGQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538760&sr=1-1&keywords=techcrunch)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is weird.  A bro reads tech news and talks about what a \"badass\" Elon Musk is (that's a real quote).  This bro-host tells a bunch of jokes that aren't all that funny but feel like a stereotype of jokes a Silicon Valley bro would tell.  This might be your type of humor, but it's certainly not mine.  I'd lightly recommend passing on it, but if off-beat, that's-so-random humor is your thing then give it a try.  However, most people seem to hate it.\n\n**Sports News**\n\n[CBS Sports Minute](https://www.amazon.com/CBS-Local-Sports-Minute/dp/B01M9FIFIK/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-3&keywords=sports)\n\nThis is best sports Flash Briefing I've found, but that's not saying much.  It covers one sports related story a day, and it doesn't report scores.  The host is very energetic, and the stories are interesting.  However, you probably won't get a full update on sports scores if that's what you're interested in.\n\n[ESPN SportsCenter Update](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-ESPN-Radio-via/dp/B01JHLKHQ4/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-2&keywords=sports)\n\nThis app has a terribly boring music intro that lasts 30 seconds.  Some reviewers have complained about the volume, but I haven't noticed an issue recently.  The news itself is pretty good; what you'd expect from SportsCenter.  There is an advertisement at the end that drags out.  It lasts about 3 minutes.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n[Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day)\n\nThis is my favorite \"hidden gem\" Flash Briefing.  Every day, the human host sardonically explains a word of the day and gives examples of how to use the word.  It's funny, smart, and a little irreverent.  The production quality is top notch, the length of the briefing is just right, and the entertaining examples of how to use the words make it pretty hard to forget the word.  The Flash Briefing is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\n[Discovery: DNews](https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Communications-DNews/dp/B01JHK5V6G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539512&sr=1-1&keywords=dnews)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has science news.  It's one moderately in-depth story a day, often about refreshing topics not covered by other news sites.  The audio is repurposed from YouTube videos, but you probably won't notice because the audio doesn't rely on the visuals.  I'd give it a try.\n\n[Complex News](https://www.amazon.com/Complex-News/dp/B01MXXXRLW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538966&sr=1-1&keywords=complex)\n\nThis is the best Flash Briefing for celebrity gossip. It covers just one story a day, but Complex does it in style. It's very punchy and energetic.  My guess is that it's repurposed video content, but I quite like it, and I am not one who typically enjoys celebrity news.  The entire briefing lasts about 2 minutes.\n\n[Top Reddit Posts Unofficial](https://www.amazon.com/Josh-Jones-Reddit-Posts-Unofficial/dp/B01MTWUMY6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539027&sr=1-1&keywords=top+reddit+post)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has Alexa read the top recent 5 Reddit posts.  More specifically, Alexa reads the title of the Reddit post and then 1 comment.  Normally, Flash Briefings that have Alexa read the news are terrible.  This one is a mild exception.  It's good, but it's certainly not great.\n\n[Harvard Business Review: Management Tip](https://www.amazon.com/Harvard-Business-Review-Management-Tip/dp/B01LQM9N8A/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539233&sr=1-1&keywords=harvard)\n\nI don't think that a Flash Briefing is the right place for a management tip.  I find that these tips are incredibly forgettable \u2014 these tips are ideas like \"reconsider how you measuring data.\"  That's not a particularly useful tip, and I can never remember the minutia of how HBR suggests implementing the tip.  However, I know some people love this type of management advice, so if this sounds like the Flash Briefing for you, it probably is.\n\n[eHow](https://www.amazon.com/Demand-Media-eHow/dp/B01M29BSFG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539070&sr=1-1&keywords=ehow)\n\nIf you want an update on what eHow has been publishing recently, then I have the Flash Briefing for you.  You'll learn some interesting and pointless things from this Flash Briefing, like the amount of calcium in chia seeds and your dog's separation anxiety.  I wouldn't add it to your Flash Briefing, unless you want to know useless trivia or what eHow's been publishing.\n\n[Pulse of the Planet](https://www.amazon.com/Pulse-of-the-Planet/dp/B01K0JWGSY/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539103&sr=1-1&keywords=pulse+of+the+planet)\n\nThis is a weird mix of nature sounds and general interest stories.  I'm not sure who this would appeal to, but it's certainly unique.  It's not too long, so it might make sense to try it out if general interest stories are your MO.\n\nTL;DR: Try [Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day), [90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate), and [Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up)",
  "Last night I asked Alexa to play jungle sounds. This played for a while. Maybe an hour?

I don't know what would happen if I told her to loop but I don't really need it playing all night.",

Twisted the volume ring, played music OK, then just about blew out the windows when I asked what the time was.\n\nUsing the Echo as a speaker pretty much doesn't work by any sane standard.\n\nHas anybody talked to anyone at Amazon about any technical issues, at all? I've had no luck (so much for my Prime money).\n\nYou'd think they'd stop advertising these as Bluetooth speakers until/if this was fixed...   but they don't seem to be interested in fixing it.\n\n**Edit:**  For some reason my iPhone volume went from 100% to maybe 30% when I first paired it to the Echo...  when I put it back to 100% using the buttons on the phone it started to work just fine.",

  "My Echo remote finally arrived yesterday (I had ordered it March 24th)\n\nSeems to do everything exactly as advertised.  I like the magnetic mount that was included, and pairing was simple.\n\nI did have one issue.  After installing the included \"Amazon Basics\" AAA batteries, the remote initially didn't work.  I grabbed some other batteries I had sitting on the shelf and it started working right away.\n\nI tested the Amazon batteries with a voltmeter, and they were fine.  After messing with it a little more, I got the Amazon batteries to work.\n\nI think that the issue is that the Amazon batteries fit very tightly in the battery compartment, and there was too much resistance for the spring loaded contact in the bottom of the compartment to push the batteries together and make a good contact.\n\nI installed the original batteries again, making sure to manually push both batteries towards the top of the remote, and it worked fine.",

  "So my Echo recently started randomly pushing ads on me and mine, based on the conversations we are having. \n\n\nWe will be talking about fishing let's say, and without being prompted by anyone, the Echo will come to life and spew fishing related advertisement at us. \n\n\nThis is really enerving and makes the perma-recording-speaker uncomfortably obvious. \n\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this?",
  "Every time one of those damn commercials come on it uses 2-3 megs of my limited data, more if it starts to read the news headlines. Towards the end of the billing cycle every meg that I have is valuable and can't be wasted on things like this. It's bad enough that she stutters due to the satellite connection and takes 10-15 seconds just to tell me the time.  Does anyone else have this issue? Wish there was a way to control which voice she responds to. Or, maybe Amazon can integrate an inaudible code that tells the Echo to ignore what comes next when she hears a commercial.",
  "I had a thought while watching Hulu when the Echo ad with Alec Baldwin came on. Is it possible that when the ad activates Alexa but she drops it with no comment about not understanding that Amazon is using that to track the ad placement?

  "My wife and I have a 3 year old tough sleeper. For the past 6 months ths we have used our echos to \"drop-in\" when he wakes up at night and help him go back to sleep without going into his room.

  "Yes I've changed all the settings that can be changed and they do nothing.  I know this is an old problem.

I kept using the laptop for business and general stuff but my Bluetooth has been going bad as well, so I switched the speaker to the desktop.

When I got my 4th gen Echo two Christmas's ago I (and everyone else in my household) was absolutely blown away by the fact that even though it was setup in the livingroom, it could hear me \\*\\*whisper\\*\\* from the kitchen and still accurately deduce what I was saying 99% of the time. \n\nShe always answered questions well and was genuinely helpful, *and now that's all changed lmao.*\n\nToday, not only can the echo not pick up my voice from the kitchen unless I shout, literally at least 30% of the time she hears something completely different than what I've said *even if I'm sitting 3 feet away!* As well, half the responses are \"an Alexa contributors answer blah blah blah....\", which would be absolutely ok if she actually heard what I said in the first place. \n\nOn top of that she frequently has connection issues, babbles strange crap out of nowhere (did anyone else get that weird 'laughing' bug, where she started laughing like a maniac for no reason out of nowhere??) and I often look over while watching a show or something to see her ring turning on and staying on for minutes at a time, making me feel like she really is just there to spy on people for the corporate entity that is Scamazon.\n\nAnyhow, well there's my rant. I do get some comedy out of the whole thing and it's a great conversation-piece for how funny it is that we live in a world that is absolutely intrinsically linked with all of this amazing technology *that never really properly works all of the time* but we just keep on using it anyhow hahaha.\n\nWell, thanks for listening. Just changed my lights from blue to red as I get ready for sleep and I'm happy it worked because just a couple of minutes ago I was getting the 'I am unable to connect to the internet right now' error, or whatever it is that she says.\n\nToodles.",

  "I've been fiending for this update for months since it was announced. I got a Show 15 right away, assuming that it actually WAS a sort of reskinned FireTV and was disappointed to find out how limited it was in that regard. Was DELIGHTED when they announced the update and have been checking frequently ever since. Last week as it started to roll out, I started an obsessive compulsive update check regime, then realized that not only wasn't I getting it, I wasn't even on the same OS version as normies.\n\n\nEveryone I've sen getting the update online either had 7.5.5.5 - or didn't know and just discovered they were now on (confusingly!) 7.5.0.1 (is it normal for Amazon OS versions to regress numerically?) and magically had FireTV.\n\n\nI just got off Amazon help chat with \"Taeed\" who was actually zillions of times more on the ball than \"Matt\" who escalated for me, but also in a surprisingly nimble, helpful way. I lucked out. Here's what Taeed told me:\n\nIt's rolling out in waves, obviously.\nHe doesn't know the specific criteria, but he says it doesn't appear to be solely regional or geographical.\nThere are minor hardware variants between Show 15s, possibly just manufacturing batches with zero differences.\nThere are a couple of current OS versions, and it's possible that incremental updates got paused for this rollout - that would explain the inability to go from 7.5.5.4 to 7.5.5.5\nHe has been told that everyone with a properly working device in a region it's available should get it (hopefully) any time from now to no more than two weeks from now.\n\n\nHe caveats that he's simply telling me what he's been told, but that 7.5.5.4 people are not alone, and are probably more intelligent and attractive than 7.5.5.5 jerks. I may be editorializing a bit there.\n\nAlso, since I'm here handing out useless advice, here's some useful advice maybe....\n\nIf you don't want to spend absurd amounts on the official Amazon Show 15 table stand, just buy a tabletop picture stand. I got a pack of three for like ten bucks from Amazon and when in use, the stand itself is almost completely invisible and adjustable enough to sit at any angle from vertical back.\n\nI got my show 15 to connect with two Echo Studios and an Echo Subwoofer by first pairing them as a speaker group, then making a new DEVICES group featuring just them, then making them the default speakers using \"let Alexa choose\" option from the  iOS app (vs selecting speakers manually) -- I'm curious to know if that setup will support Atmos as it does via Fire TV 4k Max stick (and that setup now also handles eArc meaning I can use it as default Atmos for consoles etc via my receiver).",

  "Hi there :)\n\nI recently bought a new TV and connected an Echo dot 3 with it via Bluetooth.\n\nThe problem is - the audio is so delayed that i can't use it.

  "I bought a centralite Zigby contact sensor and it\u2019s now connected to my Amazon echo 4. My plan is to install the sensor at my parents home on my mother\u2019s stair lift. When the stair lift is down then I want to send an email to let me know that she has arrived downstairs to start her morning. One part of the sensor will be attached to the chair and the other will be attached to the bottom of the stair lift rail. When the chair is all the way down then it will be next to the other half of the sensor and will trigger the closed event.\n\nThe problem is that Alexa does not provide an action that sends an email. I found a work around where IFTTT can monitor the Alexa to-do list and send an email when an item is added to that list. So I\u2019ve set up an action where alexa adds a \u201cswitch closed\u201d item to the to-do list whenever the contact sensor closes. That causes IFTTT to then send a \u201cswitch closed\u201d email.\n\nHowever this does not really work because the second time the switch closes Alexa tries to add another \u201cswitch closed\u201d item to the to do list which it cannot do because it\u2019s trying to add the same item twice.\n\nI tried creating a routine where it would first delete the \u201cswitch closed\u201c entry from the to do-list and then add it back again. That didn\u2019t work because it was not possible to have two custom actions in a routine. A custom action is needed in order to add or remove entries from the to-do list.\n \nI then tried creating two separate routines which both trigger when the switch is closed. One routine will immediately delete the \u201cswitch closed\u201centry from the to do-list. The second routine will wait 10 seconds and then ADD  the \u201cswitched closed\u201c item to the to-do list. This did not work. It seemed that two routines could not be triggered at the same time. \n\nMy conclusion is that I have run into a limitation of Alexa and that there is really no way around this. I\u2019m thinking maybe I could get a Zigbee hub which would then be able to detect the switch being opened or closed and then hopefully have the capability to send an email.  This has sure turned out to be a lot of work for what I thought  going to be a simple scenario. Does anyone have any . other ideas that I might try out? Thank you",

  "Okay, this one is going to be annoying I think.\n\nBackground: I used Wink for about 7 years for smart home automation/voice control via Alexa (this started way before Echos had radios for this stuff) and since Wink has been slowly dying and having had occasions where Wink was out for long periods of time I decided to just migrate to having Alexa/Echo handle my devices.\n\nMigrating over went pretty smoothly, there were a few z-wave devices I had to replace but about two weeks ago I finished moving everything over and things seemed to be working pretty well. There were a few occasions where lights would show as offline but often if I tried to actually work them they would work. I have one light (very very old GE bulb) that I've had to turn off and on a few times to get it to be happy again, but these bulbs were also ones that would occasionally drop off Wink altogether and have to be paired again. (If it keeps up I'll probably replace the bulb. But it's not a huge deal based on where it in and how often it's happened.)\n\nSo now we make it to last night, and I come home and notice that a lot of the outdoor lights didn't turn on on schedule. After taking an inventory of what was working vs what wasn't it became clear that the devices not working were all connected to one of my Echos (Kitchen) and the devices connected to a different Echo (Living Room) seemed to still be working.\n\nI rebooted the Kitchen Echo (it was potentially acting a little strange in other ways, but I didn't troubleshoot anything else before the reboot) and these devices still didn't work.\n\nI did some Googling and didn't find anything terribly helpful. The Echo in question is clearly on the Internet and can play music and control the devices that are still working. Waiting a few hours didn't fix anything and things were still not working this morning. One interesting aspect is that the non-working devices are a mix of Zigbee and Bluetooth (and the devices working from the other Echo include both Zigbee and Bluetooth) so it doesn't seem like it's a likely problem with a weak mesh, etc.\n\nI haven't attempted to reset any of the devices and see what happens if I rediscover them, but that's likely what I'll do this evening for the more important devices.\n\nSo ahead of calling Amazon's support which seems to be where I think I'm at, are the any potential common fixes that I might have overlooked? There doesn't seem to be a lot of control or diagnostics available about what is happening.\n\nI suspect I'll have to reset the unit (and reconfigure all the devices connected to it, I'm assuming?) to determine if the Echo is actually broken or just malfunctioning. So I'm expecting to do that eventually.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.",
  "It was working fine last night, but today when I tried to use it, Alexa tells me \"server unresponsive.\" So I try to reset the bulb with serial number on the app. No go. Then I factory reset Alexa. Nothing. I deleted the device and tried to re-pair it. No device found. I kept trying. No luck. Read this is an issue people are having online since update. Tried all the ways online and still no luck. We connect via Zigbee, no Philips Hue Bridge. Once again, this worked fine yesterday when I came home for work.

  "So just tried to setup a spare echo dot at the other end of the house and had some issues due to using a Google Mesh network and this new dot was connecting to a different node/AP. Did some research and couldn\u2019t find much info so figured I\u2019d post the fix here to hopefully help someone in the future. \n\nThe Fix:\nIf you\u2019ve already tried setting up the device, forget your profile from the device. Then re-setup the device in a room that it will connect to the same node/AP as all the other speakers, once this is done you can now add it to whatever groups you want. Now if you unplug the echo and put it back where you originally wanted it, it should stay in that group and work with multi-room music.  \n\nHopefully this can help a few people. Dumb that we have to do these sort of workarounds though.",

  "EDIT: For everyone reading the title and ignoring the post, I have 2 Echo dots that have the timers.\n\nSo I set timers a lot and I saw the echo wall clock which seems like a great idea. The problem is that I have a long apartment with a more open floor plan so I have 2 echo dots in the same area like 40 feet apart. It was hard for the echo to hear me in my living room so I got the second. It also helps when meshing speakers. \n\nI saw that the clock can only connect to one echo dot at a time, which is a problem because I set times on both echoes depending where I am, but I can hear both. Is it possible to send all timers to one echo? Is there a command? I know there is an option for missed timers, but I heard there was a 30 second delay, which won't match well with the timer on the clock.\n\nBut most importantly, is it a good product?",
  "I had an odd situation yesterday, an Echo Show 8 I've got in the kitchen started playing videos, and no one else in the house (or that has access to the account from apps) started them.  I was in another room and just barked \"Alexa, stop\" and that seemed to kill it.  But it'd come back a while later.\n\nI finally took a look at the device and it appeared to be streaming using the silk browser?  Took some effort poking the X to stop button, as it wasn't very responsive.\n\nNothing on the device looks like it'll show me the history for silk.  Is it possible to find this?\n\nWhen checking the device in the Alexa app there was nothing shown 'playing' for this or any other Echo devices in my account.  Nor is there anything listed as paired to this device via bluetooth.\n\nI checked my wifi network DHCP tables and there are no new devices connected to the network.  \n\nSo it seems like 'something' kicked the silk browser into action, to make it start playing videos?  How do I figure out what, and more importantly, how do I stop it from doing it again?",

  "hi team, need some community help here, as I'm not sure how to achieve what I'm hoping for.  \n\nSo in a recent kitchen renovation, I had some wired ceiling speakers installed, which are being fed by a small bluetooth amplifier hidden away in a cabinet above the fridge.  We have the Show 15 mounted on a wall acting as a home hub and to play music in the kitchen, connected via bluetooth to the amp.  \n\nI recently thought it would be great if I could create a speaker group called \"downstairs\", especially with upcoming Christmas, we'd love for the music to be played throughout the lower level.  What I didn't realize is that when you create this group, the Show 15 won't play the audio through bluetooth, rather only comes out of the device.  Further research makes sense why; there could be an audio lag with the Show doing bluetooth compared to the other actual Echo's playing the same music, therefore the kitchen would be \"off\" from the rest of the speakers.  I was also surprised to find out the Show 15 does NOT have an audio out so I could actually run a cord from the show to the amp, which would make this group work, but allas, I cannot even pull that off if I wanted to.  \n\nSOooooo, what I'm wondering is, could I hide a small Echo in this same cabinet as the amp, and run that Echo to the amp with a small 1/8\" cord, then I could have the whole 1st floor be a group, but how would I set that up with the Show?  I'd still prefer the Show to actually show what is being played, and still be used as the main hub, but is there some sort of trigger that could be setup that will engage the hidden Echo Dot to actually be playing the music?  I suppose I could easily add the hidden Dot to be part of the group, but then wouldn't the Show 15 be playing the music out of its onboard speakers too?  That's probably not a huge deal, but I feel like that might sound kinda weird?  \n\nThe above is probably what I'll try, but just figured I'd ask if anyone knows of a better way.  Again, have the Show 15 still show all music and interactions on it's screen, but have the Dot actually be feeding the amplifier the audio.",

  "I had 2 Echo Studios and a sub I had been running as a home theater paired with a Firestick (Fire TV) 4K MAX for about a year. Now I don't. I can't believe I didn't kick them to the curb by the time I was two months in.\n\nThey were always dropping connection in their special little virtual network with a funky name created by Alexa. This requiring unpairing, restart, and repairing. I kept telling myself it wasn't a big deal since after a couple of times I could do it pretty quickly. It was a big deal.\n\nAlso a big deal was the fact that at least 60-70 percent of the time when I would switch to a different input there would be zero sound. This required fiddling around and trying this, that, and the other until I mysteriously had sound again.\n\nThey also did not play nice with my 4K Blu-ray player if the source was DTS Master or DTS-X. Many was the time I would start playing a 4K disc and have no sound. I would have to open the player's main menu, then settings, then audio, and finally change output to PCM only. Then restart the movie. It was ludicrous.\n\nSo what was the final straw? I bought a Fire TV Cube because I wanted more memory, a better processor, and dedicated Graphics Processing.  So can you guess what happened the first time I tried to connect the Studios and Sub to it? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.\n\nSo then I realized maybe it's an update issue and brought the Cube current with several updates. Tried again. Now only 1 Studio and Sub had sound no matter what I tried (and I tried EVERYTHING). That was it, I was done.\n\nThe ONLY reason I bought the Studios and Sub was because it was the cheapest Atmos system I could find and I had a 4K Max so I thought \"What could go wrong?\". Turns out a lot could go wrong.\n\nFortunately I had 4 year Replacement plans on all 3 and wouldn't you know it the same day I hit my limit the retailer I bought them from had a 24 hour Flash Sale on a Samsung 5.1.2 setup with wireless Sub AND wireless rear surrounds. It was over $100 less than the Studios and Sub cost me. I have never been happier to eat the $100 I dropped on replacement plans.\n\nThis system sounds a million times better, gets WAY louder, and you can actually adjust levels including Top front and rear. Atmos, DTS (ALL formats), you name it. And the best part? You know what happens when I turn it on? I have sound. You know what happens when I switch inputs? I have sound. It is glorious. \n\nIf you're thinking of going the Studios + Sub route I implore you to think deeply about it. Let your smart devices (Echos, Dots, Shows) handle smart device work and get an actual theater system. If this saves even one person from the headaches I had the time spent writing this will have been more than worth it.",

  "Does anyone have this TV and use YouTube on it with an external AVR attached through HDMI?\nMy LG C1 has done anything and everything I asked of it over the last couple months, from playing and decoding demanding audio to all sorts of modern HDCP shenanigans, and so on.

But the speaker can only handle one bluetooth connection at the same time and I dont always want to disconnect and reconnect the two devices. Is it possible to have the FireTV and the Echo both use the Bluetooth Speaker? I did already set up the entertainment system thing in the Alexa App where sound from the FireTV is being streamed through the Echo. That works, I can have the FireTV sound coming from the Echo. So now I thought I was clever and connect the Echo to the Bluetooth Speaker so we should have the sound go like: FireTV -> Echo -> Speaker. But somehow that setup doesnt produce any sound at all. Only if I disconnect the speaker from the Echo again will I hear the sound coming from the Echo again. And yes the lone connection of Echo and Speaker also produces normal sound. Anybody any ideas?",

  "I have several Amazon Echo devices - Echo Show (original 7\"), Echo Show 8 (1st gen), Echo Spot, and a Fire TV Cube.

Do the Echo Dots connect to 5 ghz wifi networks (that's what I have my Fire TV Cube and Echo Shows on), or must they be on 2.4 ghz? Assuming the Echo Dots can connect to the 5 ghz wifi network, can I start streaming Amazon Music on one of those devices and then tell those devices to stream the same media to the Echo Dots? If they can only connect to 2.4 ghz, can I still send the media from a device on the 5 ghz network to them? Does the audio match up really well across the devices, or is there a lag sometimes?

  "When echo dot communicates to a device like e.g. a WiFi socket, does echo send the on/off command directly to the socket in the same WLAN home network, or does all communication go via the internet and I need an account at the socket manufacturer?\n\n----\n\nUpdate: Answer: It depends on which socket (smart plug) I have!\n\n_**Bad example:**_      \nE.g. a Tapo socket (P100 for example) requires you to first install the Tapo app on your smartphone and open an account in the Tapo cloud with your email. Then any switch on/off command that you invoke via Alexa speech command involves not only the Amazon cloud but also the Tapo cloud, which communicates directly with your Tapo P100 smart plug (socket).\n\n_**Good example:**_        \nSmart plugs with **Tasmota** firmware (e.g. DeLock 11826, or Currymaster) support MQTT protocol and CAN an DO communicate directly to my Amazon echo dot!\n\nOn the one hand I can switch them on/off directly via a simple local URL get command, e.g. by typing in my web browser:\n\n* http://192.168.178.99/cm?cmnd=Power%20toggle\n\n* http://192.168.178.99/cm?cmnd=Power%20on\n\n* http://192.168.178.99/cm?cmnd=Power%20off\n\n(if the local IP of my WLAN smart plug is 192.168.178.99)\n\nBut on the other hand I can also control them directly by my Amazon echo dot device (echo dot 4 in my case) after only once initiating a search for devices in my WLAN from the Alexa app (Android 10 smartphone in my case).\n\nMy WLAN router (fritz!box) is and always was configured to block ANY internet traffic for my delock sockets (delock smart plugs), so they can only communicate locally within my home network (WLAN).\n\nThis is the way it should be - no unnecessary 3rd party cloud or 3rd party account is needed.\n\n----\n\n*Statements by other users in this thread saying that a direct communication (in the WLAN) between Amazon echo dot and smart plug are \"not possible (because Alexa is not designed to work this way)\" are hence provably incorrect (probably due to incomplete knowledge of these commenters as to what Alexa Echo's different modes of operation are).*",

  "Hello,\n\nI just bought 2 new echo's and will be adding a third.  A couple of issues I hope someone can help me with:\n\nMy TV is listed under devices 3 times but the icons for them are all different.

But which ones to delete?\n\nI have an echo in my office which is right next to my son's room and his echo.  He has kids enabled on his.  Today he asked alexa to play a song and she wouldn't play it on his due to explicit content filter but she did play it on my echo in the adjacent room.  They are not part of a group.

Then re-setup the device in a room that it will connect to the same node/AP as all the other speakers, once this is done you can now add it to whatever groups you want.

  "I had a discussion that got me thinking about the Eero setup again and of course I dove down a rabbit hole. My current modem/router is currently included with my internet plan but that ends in January. After that they're going to charge me $14 a month (at least) and no way that's happening.\n\nThere are some benefits to the Eero router if you're looking to future proof. If you get an Eero 6+ or Pro 6E you'll have wifi 6 in case you get a faster plan in the future (even if you don't from everything I've read it will improve your current stability and latency). You will need a modem capable of up to a gbps.\n\nIf you're looking to stay below or near 1 gbps you can get a DOCSIS 3.0 modem and an Eero 6+ router reasonably cheap. If you think at some point you'll want to exceed 1 gbps and take advantage of the new 160mhz spectrum offered by the Pro 6E (double the bandwidth) it's on sale right now for 40% off. So is the 6+, prices are $179 for 6E and $90 for 6+. 6+ is capable of handling up to 75 devices and 6E can handle 100 or more.\n\nSo here's the part I think you'll find really interesting, I know I did. The 5th Gen Echos are rolling out right now. You can pre-order no clock (49.99) and clock (59.99). BOTH will act as Eero wifi extenders. Not only that but the 5th Gen from what I have read will also have better sound quality AND temperature sensors.\n\nTo further entice you you can get 25% off for EACH new echo by trading in your current Echos. So I guess you know what route I'm taking. Currently I only have 2 phones that will run wifi 6E but we both that will be changing in the near future. The 6E is also a tri-band (2.4, 5, and 6G) router.\n\nI know that's a lot to consider but you were asking if there would be benefits going Eero and it turns out there are several. Hope you find this info helpful.",

  "It's been about 5 months since having my first Alexa in home use, it is on a Samsung fridge hub and I got hooked and it's kinda why I picked the fridge lol, so now I have 3 echo's A ecobee thermostat, Kwikset smart lock, 4 Kasa plugs and 3 motion light switches, a LG 4000k smart TV and 2 security flood lights by UME controlled thru a Tuya app. \n\nAll these units I have with their apps I have given Alexa 3rd party over and use her to control and love the rooms I can create and love the routines as well. For me the Alexa is easier to use and figure out how to use,  It's all working except these dang UME security lights BLE-WIFI, they basically will lose motion sensor until I open the TUYA app and then they turn the motion sensors back on. Frustrating being they had a great positive feed back and priced at 60 bucks each\n\nI have asked about these UME lights but I guess not very popular because feed back is like 2 people.\n\nI downloaded smart life/ or things what ever its called onto the hub on the fridge in hope to download TUYA to operate these UME security lights and the Smart app will not do this, I was hoping to get signal of the app closer to the UME lights in hopes of not losing the signal (which I'm guessing this is what is going on with them) to these units for motion to stay operating but a no go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn doing this I have like 5 apps for the devises and now Smart life and Alexa, who should be running who?

  "I started an Amazon Music family subscription yesterday and there's a weird but very annoying glitch affecting my paired Echo Studio speakers. I have done a lot of trial and error to narrow down what the issue is.\n\nBasically, when I ask Alexa to play a song, if that song turns out to be in the \"Ultra HD 360\" or \"Ultra HD Atmos\" format (which you can check in the song history on the Amazon Music app) then it will either repeat the song on an infinite loop or play it once but cut off the last 10 seconds of the song. My daughter is big into Harry Styles and every song on his new album is in one of these format, so if she asks Alexa to play \"As It Was\" it will literally keep playing it until the end of time.\n\nI have tried everything I can think of - reverting the Studios to factory settings, turning the router on/off, changing the wifi network, tweaking/disabling various audio settings on the Music app inc the spatial and Atmos options, I also have a third Studio that is kept in the bedroom that I swapped with one of the paired sitting room ones. The issue persists. The only thing I can do to fix the problem is to unpair the Studios, but it's not the solution I want because they sit on different sides of the same room and we want them both firing out music simultaneously.\n\nI am just off a chat with Amazon customer service and they had no other suggestions other than escalating the matter to their back end, which they said they'd do.\n\nIn the meantime, just to help me determine if this glitch is specific to me or not, does anyone else have paired Studios and an Amazon Music subscription that they could try playing \"Harry Styles - As It Was\" on and see if it repeats on a loop?\n\nOr if anyone has an ideas of what I can try to fix it they will be very gratefully received because I have spent hours trying everything without success!",
  "I've been using this Echo Dot on my network without issue for nearly 3 years. Recently another device led me to split my network into discrete 5- and 2.4 GHz SSIDs. I'm using Unifi equipment (USG Pro 4 and UAP-AC-PRO) and was able to create another SSID without changing my old mixed WiFi network.\n\nI put the device into setup mode and connected it to the new 5 GHz only SSID. It connected, and the Unifi network app showed that it had a connection on the 5 GHz wifi. Later it switched itself back to the original wifi, likely due to saved wifi passwords.\n\nI deleted saved wifi passwords from Amazon and setup the Echo Dot again on my new 5 GHz network. It reported the wifi connection isn't setup multiple times even though I could see it in the Unifi network app and verify that it had been assigned an IP address.\n\nAfter multiple failures I decided to send it back to the original network. Once again Unifi verified that it had an IP address on the old wifi network, but the Echo Dot and Alexa app both reported connection failure. Sometimes it would report incorrect password--even when it was definitely correct--while the Unifi controller showed a good connection and IP address.\n\nI've now factory reset the Echo Dot multiple times and deregistered it from my Amazon account. When I get to setup I can connect to the Echo's hotspot (why it's not connecting by bluetooth is unclear), but wifi setup fails no matter which network I select. As before, the Unifi controller is reporting a good connection, but the Echo Dot and Alexa app both report failure to setup wifi or a bad password even when the password is good.\n\nAll other devices on the network are working fine and are able to access the internet, no matter which SSID they connect to. The Echo is the only one experiencing trouble. It's almost as if it's unable to reach a specific Amazon server that makes it think it has no internet access even through it does. I'm not sure if there's a way to check that. I do have a pihole that has been working fine in conjunction with the Dot for 3 years, but just to be sure I disabled it during setup. No change to the errors.\n\nIs there anything else I can try to make my Echo Dot (re)connect to my network?",

  "So this is kinda a weird problem. I have a, I thing 2nd or 3rd gen Echo Dot? Not the most recent one but not the first one. I live in a rural area and they're supposedly upgrading the Internet cables to fiber optic so there's been frequent WiFi outages several times a day, lasting from a few seconds to 15 minutes, for the past few months. However, everything was fine until recently. My Echo Dot got stuck trying to install an update and I left it for 24 hours and it still had the orange spinning light. I unplugged it and replugged it, which usually sets things back to normal, but it refused to connect to the Internet at all because I happened to plug it in during a WiFi outage. I tried entering setup mode on my phone later and seemed to have successfully set it up, but then it told me it was updating and has now been on the spinning orange light for 30 minutes. My phone tells me it's offline. This is incredibly frustrating as I have smart lights that I now have to go in and manually turn on and off individually. My Alexa is still running routines but I can't turn off alarms or reset my lights after they turn orange at sunset. Is it bricked? Is Jeff Bezos trying to get me to buy the latest model or something?

I can get them to connect to wifi but then registration fails. Strangely two echo gen 1 'cans' are still working fine (same network). The devices that no longer connect are three echo dots an echo Link and a gen 1 echo show. All were bought new, some in the U.S. and are registered to me and my account. Nothing has changed on my account, even the password is the same. Working and non-working echos are on the same wifi network so I know it's not my wifi (have tried other networks too, same issue). Amazon support has been next to useless. Anyone have anything similar happen or troubleshootinh ideas? It's driving me nutty!!",
  "So I have both a gen 2 echo dot and a gen 4 and I am a college student and I live in the dorms. In order to connect a device to my school's wifi you get on the open network and it takes you to the website to sign in and register your device. So when I first moved in I only had my gen 2 dot and I managed to get it connected, but i don't remember exactly what I did. I got the gen 4 for Christmas and have been trying to set it up. When I do it the regular way it doesn't pull up my school's sign in page. So I go in to the manual set up mode and connect my phone to the echo dot's own wifi and then it has me pick a network. I pick my school's network and it starts to take me to the site but then it fails to load because I don't have a network connection because I'm connected to the Echo Dot's wifi. Can someone help me with this??? Sorry if I worded this poorly. I'll be happy to provide more info if needed.",
  "Hello,\nI've been looking for a doorbell and possibility of a door lock for my house. I really dislike the idea of subscription services, so I'm looking at the Eufy 2k wired doorbell(T8200), Blink with the local storage module, and Lorex 2K doorbell right now. Are those the only options available? \n\nMain concern I've seen from my research is the time it takes for the Echo Show to load the doorbell's live feed.\n\nFor the door lock I was thinking August Smart Lock Pro 3rd gen with the wifi module, since I heard the 4th gen had pretty poor battery life. Would this be a good decision, or should I just accept the poor battery life and have the newer lock?\n\nLooking into Lutron Caseta, garage door opener (Tailwind?) - since MyQ (what I have) won't support Alexa, and other options in the future as well.",

  "Hi everyone. Just got a 4th gen Echo dot. I originally set it up in my kitchen without any problems, and then decided to move it to a different room. Now, I cannot for the life of me get it connected again. After I connect to the Amazon wifi, it has me choose a wifi network for it to be attached to. I choose my wifi in the Alexa app and it tell me to connect to the Amazon wifi (which I'm still attached to), and then asks me to choose the wifi network again, and again, and again.\n\nI've tried restarting/resetting the Dot and my phone. I've turned on airplane mode. I've made it so that my phone won't automatically switch back to my standard wifi. Nothing is wrong with my modem/network. I've tried setting it up on my computer. I've moved the Dot to be within 5 ft of my router. I've tried using my partners phone to set it up (both iPhone and Android). Nothing is working and I'm about to throw this thing at a wall. The first time I set it up it didn't even ask me to connect to the Amazon wifi. Any new ideas other than hitting it with a hammer?",
  "Hi,\n\nI'm trying to setup an Amazon echo dot with clock and an larger round echo in a home theater group with my fire tv stick. When I select one of the echos is greys out the other one saying it's not compatible. Both echos are on the exact same wifi network. Any help would be appreciated",
  "I'll try to include as much info as possible so it will be a little long but here goes. 6 dots and and an Echo Show have been working fine for about 2 months now. Actually, that's not totally true, one of the dots lost it's connection to the wifi after about 2 weeks and after trying every possible setting (with an online Amazon assistant), they agreed to replace it. The replacement worked fine up until yesterday.\n\nThere was a storm last night and a lightning strike fairly close to home which often knocks out the power in the local area but this time there was nothing more than a flicker and all the usual stuff that would power off or lose their clocks (PCs, oven, alarm clock) all stayed on. I mention this because one day everything is fine, the next morning after a storm, 4 dots are offline and can't connect to the wifi.\n\nThe fact that 2 dots and the Show still connect fine is the first puzzling thing. If the router was fried it would be fried for all of them but I have been having a few issues with my phone lately where I keep seeing my wifi connection saying \"connected, no internet\" but after going into the settings, it seems to come back to life and it's then \"connected\". So the router has been playing up recently which does lead me to the possibility that there's something wrong with the router but nothing catastrophic, just something a little odd.\n\nThings I've tried with the dots:\n\nStandard set up mode (5 seconds hold on the dot button). Connects to Amazon-ABC in the wifi options but then fails to connect to the router wifi\n\nReset mode (15 seconds hold on the dot button), won't connect to the wifi.\n\nChanging the router channel from 11 to 6\n\nChanging the wifi connection from 2.4GHz to 5GHz\n\nTried connecting to wifi 8 times in a row waiting for \"App Suggests Another Method>Connect SmartPhone To Amazon Server>Amazon Will Connect Echo To Home Network\" (from another post, it didn't give me the option, just kept failing).\n\nAll of these failed to connect to the wifi with either a timeout and back to the previous page to \"try again\" or just straight back to a page with the heading \"Connect your phone to your Echo Dot\" where the only option is to click on the link \"Don't see an orange light?\" even though I do see an orange light, (nice one guys).\n\nThe only thing that does work is if I connect the dot to my phone's hotspot which would suggest there's nothing wrong with the dots (from the lightening strike) so there must be something wrong with my router, yes?\n\nI've pulled the plug on the modem and router as well as on the dots but \"have you tried turning them off and on again\" hasn't fixed it this time.\n\nI've also read that leaving the dot connected through the Hotspot (with it muted) will allow for the firmware to be updated but I've checked one of the dots that's working and one of the ones that isn't  and they have the same software version, no mention of firmware anywhere, which is 6409852036.\n\nAnyone got any ideas on what else I can try before I contact Amazon?",

  "I'm hoping to get some feedback as to the user experience with Amazon's Echo devices, as I re-evaluate my smart home choices.  I know that this is the official subreddit for these devices, so I'm expecting a heavy bias, but I'm ok with that :)  How do two paired Echo's sound compared to a Echo Studio?  Is the studio worth the premium and does it ever go on sale?  How is the audio on the shows, compared to the echos and is the 10\" worth the premium (if I don't care about the moving monitor)?  \n\n\nLong story short, I have very little brand loyalty and simply use the best device for my application.  In my home, that means iOS for phones & tablets, Windows Desktops, Linux Servers, etc.  I had originally started down the Google Home route due to a couple of free give-aways and my investment in the Google eco-system.  For the last few years, I've been satisfied with them, but as of late I've been reevaluating my smart home decisions... which leads to point 2.  \n\n\nIn the last few months, I've made the time to start investing in setting up a smart home, specifically by using Home Assistant.  Previous to that, I had no plan and would just buy what was best suited to resolving my needs at that time (TP-Link Wifi plugs/switches, Caseta Dimmers, August Locks, and Nest Cams/Thermostats).  Now I'm trying to focus on the big picture as to what will integrate the best with Home Assistant, and is the most cost effective... which Google/Nest tends not to be.  \n\n\nAnyways, while I know both Assistants have their issues, my priorities are something that responds reliably, makes a good photo frame (the kids love it), and has good audio quality.  Nice to haves would be equivalents to Google's \"Animal of the Day\" for the kids, but this is not a deal breaker.  It would also be nice to be able to create speaker groups, and \"cast\" (or equivalent) to the devices.  At the present time, I'm using a Nest Thermostat (and likely will continue to do so), and Nest Cams.  Can these work with Echo?  The cameras will likely be replaced in the next few months, but for WAF, it would be nice if they were supported.  \n\n\nFinally, under the nice to haves.  I use a Shield as my primary playback device, and am wondering if it's possible to hardwire it into an Amazon Studio, or pair it with a set of Echo's?   \n\n\nAnyways, apologies for the long windedness and all the questions.  I look forward to jumping into the \"echo\" chamber here.",

You don't get to share Amazon Music (from Prime, not the full version) directly, but she's always signed into my account on her device (\"A\\*\\*\\*a, switch accounts').\n\nThis always allowed her to use Prime Music as I would, though the 1-device-at-a-time restriction was still in effect.  I built a huge library of custom playlists for her.  They always worked fine. \n\nNow, whenever she asks for specific music (and I tested this), she gets \"Here's a station you might like\", which, of course, is riddled with ads every song-and-a-half.  Even \"A\\*\\*\\*a, play/shuffle my playlist \\[exact name of playlist\\]\", said *in my voice*, while signed into my account, on that device produces \"Here's a station you might like\", when on devices registered to me produces the actual playlist.\n\nEvery request for music, no matter how you word it - and I have tried every permutation of \"music\", \"playlist\", \"play\", \"shuffle\", \"library\", \"Amazon Music\" - results in \"Here's a station\", on that device only, where the same command (from the same voice, to the same account) on another device works as expected.\n\nDid something change?

I have completely upgraded my home with WiFi switches controlling every switched device in the house and have great routines setup to automatically shut off the entire house lights and lock up the house once the kids leave for school every weekday along with bedtime routines.  Both our bathroom vents are on these switches as well and I am looking for a routine that I can setup that will automatically shut the bathroom vents off after 20 minutes anytime they are turned on.  Too many times I have woken up to vents on because either the wife or the kids have been up in the middle of the night and failed to shut the vent off.  Not a big deal right now but a bigger deal in the summer and winter when the HVAC is running.  If anyone has some help with a routine that would do this I would be very appreciative.",

I had changed my router/wifi information & I couldn't get it to reconnect. It sat idle for awhile and I finally had some time to try to get it going again. It wasn't listed in my account any longer, so I tried to readd it via the app (iPhone & android), but that pointed me to the [alexa.amazon.com](https://alexa.amazon.com) page for configuration.

I am even able to set my desktop's wireless nic to a static IP on the Amazon-### wireless network for the Connect, ping it, but I just can't get it to work. Amazon support (numerous disconnections) manually added it to my account, had me run through all sorts of troubleshooting, but still no luck. I know the Connect is discontinued at this point, but it shows up in the Alexa app/site as something you should be able to add.

  "Hello everyone:\n\nI recently bought a second Echo for my house. It is an Amazon Echo 4th Gen. I bought it mainly for two reasons: better speakers and the built-in Zigbee hub. I've been trying to make it work with a Zigbee Ewelink wireless temperature and humidity detector. It works for a while (although only the temperature can be requested through voice commands) but it disconnects after 30 o 60 minutes. This happens even if I left the detector next to the Echo. If I reset the detector it will connect again but the connection again, only lasts for some minutes.\n\n\u00bfWhat could be the reason if this behaviour? \u00bfIs it the built-in zigbee hub just low quality and I should get an independent one? \u00bfOr maybe the detector is faulty? I was thinking that could be due to a noisy 2.4ghz spectrum as I also have wifi near.\n\nAny help or experience will be much preciatted.\n\nThanks.",

  "So I've been using a 1st Gen Echo Dot in my car for a few years to play music. It's connected via the headphone socket (my head unit doesn't have BlueTooth) to the car's audio system and via my phone's WiFi hotspot to the internet. It all works mostly OK and fits perfectly into the car's cup holder.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that it doesn't have very much of a buffer. Every time I drive to work my phone's data cuts out for a second or so in certain locations. When this happens the audio cuts out too.\n\nNow this needn't be the case if it had better buffering. For example, my kid's tablets (when they're in the car) continue to stream YouTube or Disney+ without interruption in the same locations.\n\nDoes anyone know for certain if the Echo Auto has a bigger audio buffer than other Echos? Are there any other big advantages of the Echo Auto over a traditional Echo?",

  "Has anyone else noticed an issue with multi-room audio recently, that when music is playing on two or more devices it just randomly cuts out (often tracks are labelled as \"HD\")?  I'm subscribed to Music Unlimited and this seems to have only started happening in the last month or two (if I play music on a single device only, it works just fine btw).\n\nFor info, all the devices are on the same 5GHz network, a firmware check on each also tells me they're up to date.  I've used a WiFi analyser app to check if there's any signal contention with nearby networks and there is none, I've also measured signal strength at each of the devices and in all cases it shows as strong to excellent.  Also, I'm on a 200mbps internet connection.\n\nThere are a few troubleshooting articles I've seen online suggesting deleting the multi-room group, then unplugging every Alexa device, then unplug the router, leave it all for a few minutes, power up the router and leave it for a few more minutes for the network to come back up, plug all the Alexas back in and create a new multi-room group after re-scanning and ensuring they're all back on the same network...

I could try switching to Spotify, but as I've paid for a year's music unlimited already, I'm not keen to try it only to find its an issue with the Alexas themselves (possibly due to one of their firmware update).  \n\nI'd also rather not go through the hassle of factory re-setting each one only to find that doesn't work either but I guess I may have to just to eliminate it as a variable.",

She still wouldn't answer him in anything other than that one phrase. \n\nSo, we contact Amazon. Follow their instructions, delete his voice ID. Once deleted, Alexa responds to whatever he asks without problem. So suggestion was to set up his voice ID again in the Alexa app (kids account has to be done in the app according to the app). Except this time, the app won't even register that he's saying anything. At all. \n\nOur issue is being reported to the developers and we await instructions and update on a fix.

  "I bought a FireTV on sale a while ago and it came with an Echo Show.  I did not want one, but I wasn't going to turn that down.  Just the other day I decided to give it shot.  I really only want to use it to control my TV.\n\nI have an old-school, basic S/PDIF surround sound receiver hooked up to my FireTV.  This is the only speaker I am interested in using.\n\nAfter some screwing around I was able to get my Echo to control my TV (More or less), though it is pretty terrible.\n\n\nMy main issue is that when I ask Alexa to do something it will mute my receiver part-way through responding.  I can't determine a reason.  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  It basically makes the entire thing useless because I have to unmute the receiver, and I can't really ask the Echo for any information because it just cuts itself off.\n\n\nMy Echo also does not turn on my receiver when I ask it to to turn on the TV.  This is not an IR issue, as I am aware that the receiver controls are being emitted from the FireTV remote.  It still doesn't work regardless of if the remote is pointed at the receiver or not.  I don't know if this is solvable, but it also makes it pretty useless.  No sound means no music.  I don't really see why this is the way it is.  If I ask Alexa to change the volume it controls the receiver just fine.\n\n\nA third issue is actually playing music.  I use Pandora as my default music service.  When I do already have my TV on AND ask Alexa to play music AND it doesn't mute itself, it doesn't actually open Pandora on the TV.  I don't know how to explain what it does, but it is buggy to say the least.  Sometimes it'll show a fullscreen display with the song, or something it'll show a fullscreen display of the last song and never change, or sometimes it'll just play in the background with no way to interact with it on the TV.  I also can't find any effective way to change my Pandora station to one of my custom stations.\n\n\nSorry for the wall of unformatted garbage, but I think unformatted garbage is an accurate description of my experiences with the Alexa so far.  It's a real damn shame since stand-alone, the Echo Show worked great.  Considering it came with the TV, I thought it would interact better with it.\n\n\nTLDR; My Echo keeps muting itself mid-sentence for no reason, and fails at every other task.  Please let me know if there is a fix to the above issues.  Thanks.",

  "Wondering if anyone else has had this issue or maybe a solution.\n\nWife and I have had several Alexa devices in the house for years, app on our phones, etc. etc. with no problems. Main usage is music, timers, and a grocery list.\n\nOver the past few months, with nothing changing on our end, our shopping list is a mess. I believe I've narrowed it down to this: If an item is added via voice to any of our devices, our shopping list has the item added and the sync appears immediately across our phones. Any changes made *locally* however, to the list on either of our phones (typing in an item, crossing off the list as we shop) is *not* synced.\n\nI made our list today by hand since I can't talk due to throat surgery. Cleared the 90+ items that were sitting there since crossing them off as we shop doesn't sync (I don't want to say I've gotten used to that but...) and proceeded to type everything out. 40ish items later, done, wife gets to the store and asks if I've made the list yet - she had a blank slate (since she crossed off the previous shopping trips as she shopped) but nothing I had added. I ended up sending her screenshots of the list rather than type it out again. Kinda ridiculous (And first world problem, I know, but still)\n\nAgain, nothing has changed on our end, but I did the usual song and dance of signing out and in on each phone, clearing caches, un/reinstalling, and every combination thereof, and nothing.

Still got an audible delay.\n\nNext I tried the headphone jack on my monitor, connected to the PC via DisplayPort. Nope.\n\nFiguring the issue was with the virtual mixer not being able to sync the outputs, I tried a physical mixer, main speakers on the main mix and the Studio connected to the headphone out. STILL getting a delay on the Studio's output. It's not enough that you'd notice it as the only audio device (still synced to lips on the screen etc) but you definitely notice it with both outputs up, as speech sounds (no pun intended) Echo-y.\n\nHas anyone noticed this before on a Studio? I got it to do an update straight out of the box, so there's no issue there. My use case is probably not too common so maybe it hasn't been run into before, but I thought I'd ask.

  "Just like the title says, Echo is becoming worse and worse by the day.Our home has had at least 3 of them (a fourth we don't use as often when we want to be able to control the bathroom lights from the bath with voice) and every year we would excitedly buy one of the new models and marvel over how insanely accurate and helpful it was. When I got my 4th gen Echo two Christmas's ago I (and everyone else in my household) was absolutely blown away by the fact that even though it was setup in the livingroom, it could hear me \\*\\*whisper\\*\\* from the kitchen and still accurately deduce what I was saying 99% of the time. \n\nShe always answered questions well and was genuinely helpful, *and now that's all changed lmao.*\n\nToday, not only can the echo not pick up my voice from the kitchen unless I shout, literally at least 30% of the time she hears something completely different than what I've said *even if I'm sitting 3 feet away!* As well, half the responses are \"an Alexa contributors answer blah blah blah....\", which would be absolutely ok if she actually heard what I said in the first place. \n\nOn top of that she frequently has connection issues, babbles strange crap out of nowhere (did anyone else get that weird 'laughing' bug, where she started laughing like a maniac for no reason out of nowhere??) and I often look over while watching a show or something to see her ring turning on and staying on for minutes at a time, making me feel like she really is just there to spy on people for the corporate entity that is Scamazon.\n\nAnyhow, well there's my rant.

Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue. Some comments claim to confirm the issue was fixed, but it most certainly was not.",

  "After months of not asking for help and trying to figure this out on my own, I am here with a very important question that I can hopefully get answered. \n\nAfter reading raving reviews this past summer, I spent just a little over $220 on a pair of echo gen 4's.\n\nThe sound quality is excellent and I am very pleased. But ...........\n\nHowever, I just can't enjoy them. Why? In my art studio, I have limited space. One speaker is closer to me than the other. I knew this going in. In the past, this has never been an issue with other speakers / stereo amps, etc because I could always adjust the speaker furthest from my ear to make up the distance it was from me. I did this by simply increasing volume on that speaker to equalize / balance the pair for maximum stereo enjoyment between the pair.\n\nCan someone please carefully explain to me how to do this with my Amazon Echo Gen 4s? I have one dominating speaker that is over-powering the other that is a bit further away from me. No, I cannot move the furthest speaker to make it closer to me. There's a reason why it's a bit further from me than the closest speaker.\n\nI've resisted selling these and moving to a more flexible speaker system, but thought I should ask this one final question before making that decision. if I do not truly have control over my very expensive high-tech Alexa enabled speakers, they are gone. I have never truly enjoyed them in my current space as I've never had true stereo.\n\nThanks in advance.",
  "I haven't been able to add or remove time to an existing timer on my echo wall clock. The attached echo dot (4th gen) confirms the time that I want to add or remove, and the timer changes in the app but the time doesn't change on the clock.

  "I bought an echo studio back in October 2020 and it has been an amazing purchase for the years I have had it. Recently however, I noticed a burning smell emanating from the base of the device, specifically within the crevice where sound is amplified. The smell was of burning rubber seemingly due to the overheating of whatever components are beneath it. \n\nGenerally, I have the device on at night for ambient noise (subscribed to ambient sounds). I have never had an issue up to today and am not sure how to go about resolving it. Unfortunately, my warranty expired in October 2022 and tech support was strict on keeping this policy. They were kind enough to offer a trade-in, with about a 15% discount. However, I feel this issue was not my fault as I have been running the device the same way for two years. Additionally, I feel this is a defect of the manufacturer's product, which not only may render the device useless, but also poses a critical safety hazard, with burning rubber leading to carcinogenic symptoms.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue with any of their echo studio/other devices?",

  "I got my 4th-gen Echo last week, and it seemed to work fine apart from a few software bugs that were fixed by restarting the device. I also set it up with my Fire TV Stick 4K Max, watched the Dolby demo video and I didn't notice anything wrong.\n\nTwo days ago, I noticed that when using the AUX input with my PC, the left and right channels were swapped, but I didn't think too much of it.  \nYesterday, I updated my TV Stick and set up Home Theater again (which took several attempts), but as I was watching a film on Prime Video, I noticed that the stereo sound was weird. Later, I had to set up Home Theater again; this time I paid more attention to the audio in the Dolby demo and indeed, it did sound like the leaf was in the opposite direction than what was shown in the video.  \nI then played many L/R sound test videos on YouTube on my TV Stick and they were all swapped. I did the same on my phone and laptop via Bluetooth and they were still swapped.  \nI tried the AUX output with my headphones while playing a test video via Bluetooth and it works fine, it's not swapped.\n\nThe Echo is in front of me (it outputs the left channel to its left, which is my right, and vice versa).  \nAlexa says the software is up-to-date, specifically on version 8289068676 (according to the app).  \nI have already tried resetting it several times and even setting it up using another account on a different phone.\n\nNow I'm not sure if it's a software issue, like a broken update or a setting I missed that somehow persists after resetting the device, or if the drivers are physically swapped or wired incorrectly and I hadn't noticed.  \nBefore contacting Amazon and potentially get it exchanged, I'd like to make sure it's just my Echo, but unfortunately, it's the only one I have and I don't know anyone who has the same model.  \nIf anyone could do the same left/right channel test and check the software version, I would really appreciate it.",

But which ones to delete?\n\nI have an echo in my office which is right next to my son's room and his echo.  He has kids enabled on his.  Today he asked alexa to play a song and she wouldn't play it on his due to explicit content filter but she did play it on my echo in the adjacent room.  They are not part of a group.  How can I prevent my Echo from responding to my kid and vice versa?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",
  "Our family account is defaulted to Spotify and has worked fine forever. About a week ago, my son created a routine where any time my wife said, \u201cAlexa play Christmas music\u201d Alexa replied, \u201cPlaying Christmas songs by Johnny Cash\u201d then played a regular Christmas list. \n\nWe deleted that routine about 15 minutes later. Now, when my wife asks Alexa to play Christmas music by [specific artist] it defaults to the generic playlist. My wife is convinced my son broke it and is on a rampage. Any steps to troubleshoot this issue will not only be greatly appreciated, it may actually save lives before Christmas.",

Support wouldn't help, they said I could not use my own product until I agreed to 15 legal agreements for services I did not request. hen I got an email that I had ordered Tubi and Redbull TV, which I had not. We have to stop putting up with this; there needs to be boundaries on property and consumer rights.. I would have agreed to Echo updated terms, since Alexa is also a service, (though even that is an issue, if you think about it).   \nThey shouldn't be able to hold your property hostage until you enter a new legal agreement.

  "Hi there :)\n\nI recently bought a new TV and connected an Echo dot 3 with it via Bluetooth.\n\nThe problem is - the audio is so delayed that i can't use it. Games and even the TV Menu sounds like they have a 1 Second delay from action on screen to the audio playback.\n\nThe new TV has no headphone jack(Samsung Q95T) and my speakers(Bose Companion, Logitech and so on), all have 3.5mm connections.\n\nI tried a DA converter from optical to analog, but i can't change the volum with that(only on the speakers directly and not like i used to do it - with the TV remote).  \n\n\nNow i used the Echo Dot 3, but with that delay and i can't use it.  \nTh TV has a setting to offset the delay, but it seems that only applies to HDMI eARC and optical output, as it does nothing with the dot.\n\nThe dot is placed \\~ 10cm away from the Tv in direct line of sight. Distance also doesn't matter, the delay always remains constant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat can i do? Do the newer Dots have another BT protocol to solve this, or is it always the same?",

  "I\u2019m in the UK and I thought I\u2019d get the 5th gen Echo while it was on Black Friday sale. All set up without a problem, but when I ask to open BBC Sounds, it says (and I quote) \u201cok here\u2019s Nama R C B. Here is one of the songs dedicated to our CB fans.\u201d And then it plays some foreign song - not via Spotify though.\n\nWhen I then try to play something/anything else (another radio station or Spotify for example), it says \u201cSay start, to hear more song for our CB\u201d and waits for me to say something else. I need to say \u201cAlexa, stop\u201d for it to snap out of its weird CB fans obsession. It then signs off with (and this sentence doesn\u2019t have any mistakes, despite it not being a full sentence) \u201cTo come back to hear more songs on our CB\u201d\n\nI\u2019m honestly baffled. Have I got a defective Echo or does anyone else have this problem?\n\nI\u2019ve got a 4th gen Echo in the kitchen and it\u2019s been great for pretty much everything - timers, recipes, music on Spotify and BBC Sounds etc - which is why I assumed the 5th gen would be at least just as good\n\nEdit 1: Also, worth noting that my 5th gen Echo doesn\u2019t appear in my Alexa app for opening skills or the quick actions menu. Only way I can find it is if I tap Echo Devices and find it there. 5th gen model feels like it\u2019s still in beta at this stage\n\nEdit 2: still no solution, but I did figure out that it had enabled the Namma R. C. B. skill despite recognising that I asked for BBC Sounds.\n\nEdit 3: Fixed! I deregistered my Echo Dot and went through the set up process again. Now it\u2019s working without issue.

  "I have an alarm set for every day at the same time with a routine that goes on after I dismiss it. I've used this alarm for over a year and never had any issues with it. I had a 4th gen echo dot that I replaced with a 5th gen after it was released\n\nOn Thursday my alarm just didn't go off. I woke up two hours later than I normally do, and checked it on the app to see if maybe I had turned it off or changed it accidentally, but it was set up the same as it always is. I know I didn't snooze it. It worked as normal until this morning, when I woke up a few minutes before it was set to go off and it didn't, again. I set it to half an hour later and that time it did go off. There was no internet or power outage, nothing I can think of that would interfere with it\n\nI rebooted the echo dot by leaving it unplugged for a minute before plugging it back in, but is a sporadic alarm something I have to watch out for now?

But the bulbs never show in the groups.\n\nPlot twist: I can also still verbally control the groups with the bulbs in just fine.

I\u2019ve had it for years and never had problems.\n\nWhen I tried connecting my Echo Dot gen 2, I get an error message stating that I\u2019m trying to connect thru a captive portal.\n\nThe extender creates a second network named \u201cmy WiFi name_24EXT\u201d or similar, but I\u2019ve never encountered a login page when connecting other devices before. So I don\u2019t see where a captive portal is being created.\n\nShould I look for an extender that doesn\u2019t create a separate network, or is there a work-around I\u2019m missing?  I\u2019ve seen where I could name the new network the same as the main network, but I\u2019ve also read this can cause issues.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",
  "I've had my Alexa thermostats for a couple of weeks now and I really like them.  I have them running on a schedule. On Saturday I was feeling a little chilly so I manually upped the temperature a couple of degrees in the app figuring that the next time it hit the schedule point it would go back to schedule. \n\n\nSo the past couple of nights had been really overly warm and I checked my app and found out that it did not go back to the schedule and had kept the temp that I thought would go away for the past 2 days.\n\n\nIs they're a way to make a temporary temperature change? If I had said to Alexa \"raise the temp 2\u00b0 for 2 hours\" would that have worked?\n\n\nThank you.",

  "I had 2 Echo Studios and a sub I had been running as a home theater paired with a Firestick (Fire TV) 4K MAX for about a year. Now I don't. I can't believe I didn't kick them to the curb by the time I was two months in.\n\nThey were always dropping connection in their special little virtual network with a funky name created by Alexa. This requiring unpairing, restart, and repairing. I kept telling myself it wasn't a big deal since after a couple of times I could do it pretty quickly. It was a big deal.\n\nAlso a big deal was the fact that at least 60-70 percent of the time when I would switch to a different input there would be zero sound. This required fiddling around and trying this, that, and the other until I mysteriously had sound again.\n\nThey also did not play nice with my 4K Blu-ray player if the source was DTS Master or DTS-X. Many was the time I would start playing a 4K disc and have no sound. I would have to open the player's main menu, then settings, then audio, and finally change output to PCM only. Then restart the movie. It was ludicrous.\n\nSo what was the final straw? I bought a Fire TV Cube because I wanted more memory, a better processor, and dedicated Graphics Processing.  So can you guess what happened the first time I tried to connect the Studios and Sub to it? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.\n\nSo then I realized maybe it's an update issue and brought the Cube current with several updates. Tried again. Now only 1 Studio and Sub had sound no matter what I tried (and I tried EVERYTHING). That was it, I was done.\n\nThe ONLY reason I bought the Studios and Sub was because it was the cheapest Atmos system I could find and I had a 4K Max so I thought \"What could go wrong?\". Turns out a lot could go wrong.\n\nFortunately I had 4 year Replacement plans on all 3 and wouldn't you know it the same day I hit my limit the retailer I bought them from had a 24 hour Flash Sale on a Samsung 5.1.2 setup with wireless Sub AND wireless rear surrounds. It was over $100 less than the Studios and Sub cost me. I have never been happier to eat the $100 I dropped on replacement plans.\n\nThis system sounds a million times better, gets WAY louder, and you can actually adjust levels including Top front and rear. Atmos, DTS (ALL formats), you name it. And the best part? You know what happens when I turn it on? I have sound. You know what happens when I switch inputs? I have sound. It is glorious. \n\nIf you're thinking of going the Studios + Sub route I implore you to think deeply about it. Let your smart devices (Echos, Dots, Shows) handle smart device work and get an actual theater system. If this saves even one person from the headaches I had the time spent writing this will have been more than worth it.",
  "We have had the Echo Show (1st gen) in our kitchen since it came out and while I love the visual aspect of the Show, especially for multiple timers while cooking, it's not the best sound quality for listening to music while preparing or eating dinner. I recently picked up an Echo Studio and an Echo Sub to put in the adjacent dining area just for better quality music. I made a speaker pair with the Studio and the Sub and grouped them in the \"Dining Room\" on the Alexa app. My issue is **(and I fully recognize this as a first world problem**), I have to continually add \"in the dining room\" to any music request otherwise it plays on the Kitchen Show.\n\nIs there any way, short of getting rid of the Show, to get it to stop thinking I want the worst speaker in my house to play music instead of the $350 speakers I just bought to do that one task? I am even up for purchasing a new version of the Show if a newer one has some type of ability to make this (albeit minor) annoyance go away.\n\nI have also tried just using the Studio / Sub group as a Bluetooth speaker from my iPhone but it seems like Bluetooth pairing doesn't support speaker groups and the Studio doesn't know to hand off the lower ranges to the Sub so it's not only inconvenient but also worse than using Alexa to play the music \"in the dining room\".\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance!",

  "Hi,\n\nI've got a weird one here - hoping you good folks might be able to shed some light or confirm if this has happened to you...\n\nI've got an Echo Dot 3rd gen & an Echo Show 10 2nd Gen in two nearby rooms and use a multi room audio group and it works just fine.

  "Hey folks hopefully some of you can help me out here. I have a 3rd gen Dot and for some reason and this has only really started happening the last few months, the Dot will get wrong at least the first two times I request a specific music choice that I have been playing for almost a year now. For context I listen on repeat a station called Native American Flute Music I wanna say its a part of a relaxing sounds app. Instead of playing the station that the Dot has literally been playing for over a year without issue it will give me 'Here something similar based on your listening history(FK I wish I knew how to turn that off) or 'Platina radio' whatever the hell that is. This only happens with this specific request so far that I have noticed but when I have to repeat myself 3 times to get it to select the only proper choice is frustrating.

  "So I know very little about voice assistant/smart devices in general so I\u2019ve been trying to help figure out some of the problems we\u2019ve had with our Echo Dots and Show (side not, they might as well have named it an Echo Slow, because it\u2019s a pos). \n\nFirstly, I noticed a massive amount of connections to my wireless access point in the house. Like, all together my household has roughly 10 devices connected to the wireless, and only 1 wired in via Ethernet, yet my router reports a whopping 67 devices connected, granted some of those show offline. Anyway, most of these entries are to the effect of: \u201camazon-e1a9f870b\u201d, with of course variety in the ending portions. Also, and curiously, some will show as connected via the 2.4 band, 5, and even some show as Ethernet somehow lol. Is this normal for the Alexa devices to create multiple connections for some reason? Is something maybe messed up with their hardware that they aren\u2019t reporting the right information to the router maybe? Is it a setup issue on the devices?\n\nMy other question: are these devices limited to just one person\u2019s account for various skills and such? For instance, all of our 3 Dots have to share the same Spotify account my wife used when she set them up so we can\u2019t access our own playlists and such, and, for example, If I\u2019m listening to something and someone else tells their Dot to play something, it kicks mine off. Is this a device limitation, or maybe the Alexa app limitation (I\u2019m pretty sure my wife has explained to me that the Alexa app is what controls the devices and allows various interactions)? Is there any other way for a central control and an ability to set each device up a certain way?\n\nThanks to anyone who gives this a look and I hope I made enough sense!",
  "So, I'm really beyond frustrated with the Alexa app/Echo/Amazon Music app. My biggest issue is all 5 of the Echo devices in the house play from my account on our Family Music Plan even though voice recognition is setup. Imagine opening Amazon Music app to play your style music only for it to contain music played by your teenager, it sucks in case your are wondering.\n\nThe latest issue is while I have my echo devices connected to a separate IoT network that can't see my other networks, but I can see it from the main network, won't play via Everywhere. I can connect to an individual device and it plays and stops. When I connected my phone to the IoT network I was able to connect to the Everywhere group (this is being done by connecting to the casting button in Amazon Music) and it started playing. The issue then became the device wouldn't respond to the stop command nor any of the apps stopping the music. The only way I could stop it was to disconnect Everywhere from the app, then connect to that device, then I could stop it. I then had to do to every other device playing in the group. I really can't believe this is an IoT network issue as I can connect to an individual device while on separate networks. Anyone else have similar setup and experiencing what I am?",
  "Hi all.  Just got off the phone with Amazon tech support for the last hour and half and I don't have much faith that my bizarre issue will be fixed so I'm asking here.  I often use Alexa reminders (I have 5 or so dots around the house and the Alexa app on my Pixel 6).  I had a non-repeating reminder set for last night about the kids back to school night and I received the text message (I have Alexa reminders send texts).  This morning I started getting the same Alexa reminder via text message from last night.  It comes from the number 58875 and it just says \"Reminder from Alexa: Back to school night\".  I've received about 100 of these same texts today at varying intervals.  Even more bizarre is that when I try to login to my Amazon account (via web, phone shopping app, alexa app) and I request a 2FA code via text, it sends the same reminder instead of the code.\n\nThings I've tried to fix it include, deleting all my Alexa reminders entirely (Alexa confirms I have none). Turning off/on Alexa text messages/notifications. Deleting the app from my phone, relogging into all amazon related applications, turning off 2FA from my Amazon account.  At this point I'm stumped.  Is there a way to reset all my dots/Alexa apps?\n\nI'd appreciate any suggestions...at this point I'm pulling my hair out with all the reminders Alexa keeps texting me.  At this point I can't even turn 2FA back on again because I can't get the code...just keep getting the back to school night reminder.\n\nThanks in advance!",

  "I have an echo dot device in my bathroom and a Sonos roam in my bedroom.  I\u2019ve never connected these two devices in a group.

  "So your Alexa devices are tied to a primary Amazon account, and you can teach it (voice/visually) to recognise your own voice/face.\n\nBut you can also teach it to recognise others - in practise what benefits does this bring? Any pitfalls? Specially I'm thinking of behaviour surrounding calendars, lists, Spotify account, general home automation skills.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n* I'd want the home automation skills (eg. controlling lights etc) I've installed to continue to work for everyone.\n* Presumably different calendars (ie. configured third-party) are read or displayed to different people. How does this then work with the household calendar - are these mixed in with the individual calendars?  What would the syntax be to add to either calendar?\n* Same with lists - I'd want at least the Shopping List to be shared, is this the case?\n* What about music? Would a separate 3rd party music account be needed for a separate profile (eg. in addition to the Spotify Premium I have associated with my account)? I see pro's and con's to this - not mixing music tastes but maybe an additional subscription required. Then what happens when guests (other people it doesn't recognise) ask to play music, which account would it use?\n* If the \"secondary\" person/profile also has an Alexa setup at a separate house (ie. at their own home and using their own Amazon account as the primary account) would there be any link or association between the two homes/setups (other than say via third party calendar services)?\n* Thinking wider, how does \"Amazon Households\" impact on all of this, ie. when the \"secondary\" person/profile has their own Amazon account which is also a member of the household of the primary account?\n\nAll in all trying to get my head around whether this is worth setting up or not! Currently my only bugbears are: Alexa or rather Spotify thinking my music taste is wide-ranging (!), shopping list only displays my name next to the items I add and blank for others (massive issue I know!), also I don't connect my work calendar to Alexa as others have no interest in this.. but could possibly could be handy for me what with working from home more.\n\nAll pointers and experience gratefully received. Thanks.",

  "I have added a outdoor UME WI-FI Smart motion Flood light.\n\nI gave Alexa permission and have created routines thru Alexa and they work.\n\nI noticed a issue I can't figure out.\n\nThe motion sensor will stop working and appears it's not a wi-fi issue to me. \n\nI open up the Tuya App needed when installing this UME smart light, once I open the app up it shows the flood light off line and then it powers back on and it reconnects and shows the sensor is working.\n\nSo basically yes if I'm gone from home with the phone the motion sensor seems will not work, I have looked into it and nothing is coming close explaining how to address this issue.\n\nHas anyone had or have this issue and has fixed it? Is it a phone permission issue button somewhere I need to find?  \n\nThe Alexa routines still works during this bug issue.\n\nThe light is on 2-4GHz as well as my phone\n\nOnly thing I can think of is give up on this and just have a dummy phone at home with this app on it for the sensor to stay operating?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow's that?",
  "Firstly, I just want to say how much I love that Amazon Music gives access to so much stuff that's out there. The only frustrating thing is that I'm hearing a tiny fraction of that music because Alexa can't seem to shuffle properly. I'm getting so sick of the same tracks over and over!\n\nI can understand favoring the top hits when asking for the entire discography of one artist, but weighting tracks on a user-made playlist doesn't make sense to me. My taste in music is really eclectic, and I don't like much mainstream stuff, so I definitely don't want to hear the most popular / highest-paying artists first. If anything, I'd rather Alexa weighted tracks based on the stuff I *haven't* heard in a while.\n\nTo give you more context, I have a favorites playlist where I constantly add new songs as I find them. It has hours upon hours of music, but the sad part is how most of it will never see the light of day. Meanwhile, one of the four Beatles tracks I added years ago is almost guaranteed to play within the first five songs. I've actually started removing songs I've heard too many times in an effort to even things out.\n\nI wish there were commands like \"Alexa, shuffle my favorites playlist randomly\", or \"shuffle my favorites playlist by popularity\", or even \"play my favorites playlist in reverse order\" (that way I could at least hear the new stuff).\n\nDoes anyone know a way to solve this issue? Is it worth switching to another service that has a better algorithm?",
  "So about 8 months ago I bought the Gen 2 Echo Buds to start using at the gym and for casually listening to music and game audio on my computer instead of using my bulky headset and mic. So far so good. Fast forward to the last two weeks where my headsets earpiece started to crack and break off I decided to use the Echo Buds as my main driver for PC discord and gaming to talk with my friends and play War Thunder etc. But that is the thing. I have been at this for days, trying to get my echo buds mic to work on my PC. It says unmute to speak. Googled that and scoured the internet. Nothing. Zero. Nothing to help me with this one thing my buds keep telling me. So I go into the phone app and what do you know it's muted and I can tap an easy button to fix my problem. I can talk to Alexa and ask it questions and it responds. So we are good now right? Well I reconnect it to my Bluetooth on my PC and it's back to being muted. I can't get it to register my voice at all in sound recording options. Disabled all the other mics listed besides it. Set it to default etc etc. I go into the amazon (absolutely abysmal and terrible PC Alexa app that has 25% of the functionality as the mobile app version because that makes sense) app praying that there is just an obvious function I have overlooked like my phone had that had the mic muted that I could just click off and facepalm and fix it and it be super simple. But nope. It tells me when I go to Smart home and communicate I need to add the devices on mobile. Even though my echo buds are playing audio from my PC just fine and are connected. There is no way to access them that I can see from my PC to unmute them or see what the issue is. The very obvious mobile app location for my echo buds is non existent on PC. I see nothing but praise for these earbuds and I am assuming I am not the target audience. I imagine most people that buy these are gym rats or business people that use them on the go and use them as an extension of your phone universally rather than on PC for gaming or socializing through 3rd party apps that aren't strictly a phone call. I have been pounding aspirin all morning trying to find a solution to my problem but I have finally admitted defeat. If I had known that these things were gonna need malware on my computer and phone to make them not a paperweight and then not do a simple basic function of allowing me to communicate with my friends on Discord I would have shelled out another 20-30$ for the galaxy pro buds. But since it's past the return date is there anyone here who can offer me some advice to fix this? Am I even allowed to use these on PC for something besides direct calling microphone wise? Sorry for the ranting... but just to have a multibillion dollar company make their UI and product so unfriendly and offer no support or troubleshooting for a specific issue like this is crazy.",

  "Often my alexa can't understand what I'm saying when asking for spelling, no matter how hard I try to pronounce a word, it gives a different word.\n\nSimple example, I was having a brain fart over the word \"were\" (I think because I was capitalizing it and it looked off). I tried like 5 times to clearly say wwweeeerrrr with no \"d\" sound, yet every time it spelled out \"word\".\n\nIs there some kind of voice training or another way to ask (like, can I spell out what I think a word is and get a list of suggestions?)\n\nAlso, btw, searching for issues about \"understanding me\" on google gave results about my alexa not connecting. This isn't that. My alexa is connected and working fine otherwise.\n\nFwiw, I found it annoying that trying to search about \"understanding me\" yielded so many responses that had nothing to do with understanding, but rather connectivity. Imho, having alexa say it can't \"understand\" when it can't \"connect\" was just a bad choice of words.",

  "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently tried out the 'Show Mode' on a spare Fire HD8 tablet lying around, and was so impressed by it that I got a bunch of Echo Show devices to replace our ageing Echo Dots. However, it took me about 24 hours to get all the features up and running, which was a lot of work. I'm sharing my lessons-learnt setting up the devices below, in the hope that it might help anyone setting theirs up. (Any maybe, an Echo product manager would see this and fix them? lol).\n\n1. Do not name two devices similarly, this causes issues in the Amazon Alexa app\n2. Do not name two Amazon Photos albums the same, this breaks something in the backend and the photos won't be shown from either album...\n3. If the camera/Live-view function of the Echo Show does not work with the app, ***try reinstalling the app on your phone*** \\- I updated firmware, unplugged for a few minutes, deregistered the Echo Show, to no avail. Reinstalling the app fixed it for me instantly, and I wish I had known this at the start.\n4. The Echo Shows are much better than the Echo Show mode on the Fire tablets. The Show Mode is super buggy unfortunately (for example, the home content selections won't be respected at all. I turned of ALL except photo highlights, and am currently staring at weather forecast, stocks, Popular Questions and notification. UGH). They also don't have the ability to behave purely as a photo wall.\n5. Be VERY careful with language or location settings. Double and triple check if they are all correct. And make sure EVERY single place in your amazon account has the right country. I had Germany in an obscure setting somewhere, and it broke everything. I couldn't have access to Amazon photos, no Luna, no weather updates, nothing. When nothing works, ditch your amazon account and create a new one - trust me, it'll save you a lot of time and energy.\n6. Prime video app on Echo Show 10 does not support profiles. Unbelievable, but true. Note that the Netflix app on the same device does support profiles..\n\nAmazon should really invest a lot of time and effort into cleaning the entire user experience of Echo devices up.

  "I've had many Echo devices starting with my first when I was invited to buy a 1st gen before they went to market. I currently have 2 Echo Shows, 2 4th gen Echos, 2 Echo Dots and an Echo Auto. We've always like the Echo products...until recently. About a month ago, we went to bed and as usual  told Alexa to play our SleepyTime playlist. Sometime in the night, she stopped playing and when we tried to get the playlist going again she said she couldn't reach the internet. When I woke up the next morning, I found our internet was fine so I tried reconnecting the Echo. No matter what I tried, she would not connect. If I asked her a question, she would just reply with \"I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. The internet is not reachable. \"I even did a factory reset - still no good. Thinking it was bad, I went to Best Buy and bought another 4th gen Echo. It too too would not connect. I tried over and over - no good.  So, for kicks, I decided to use my wife's phone and her Amazon account and in the first attempt the device connected. To eliminate my phone as a problem. I opened a brand new Fire Tablet registered to me. I first updated the Alexa app and attempted to connect the 4th gen Echo to my account - no good. We've done countless resets, but nothing works with my account. Her account, no problem. I have taken the Echo to my work and it does the same thing there as well. The problem with using my wife's account is that all of the other devices, Kasa plugs, Hue lights etc., are attached to my account. I had bought a pack of 4 Kasa plugs and they cannot attach to my account either. I can use them within the Kasa app, but cannot attach them to my Alexa account. Basically, my account is somehow damaged. I called tech support after about 10 days of trying to fix this myself. I was hung-up on twice, but eventually got someone in Echo tech support. After trying many things, even screen sharing from the new Fire tablet, the technician said that this was very unusual and should not be behaving like this. The devices register on my account, but they just won't work. She told me she and her team would need time to  investigate this issue and asked me for a good callback time for the next day. I said 5:30pm would be good. I never got the call and my devices still are not working. Through my efforts, I have eliminated my network, my phone, my tablet, the Alexa app, the Echo devices- everything but my Alexa account.",

  "So now the photo display background fades out and in once every 14 seconds when there is only 1 photo to display.  This is new, as I have had  a custom clock face image setup on the Echo Spot for a couple of years. It never used to play like a slide show when the selected album contains only a single image.\n  \nEcho Spot has been offline for a while (screen flickers when ambient is above 75\u00b0F) - maybe 2 months.  Got it up and running again and I see that the children came up with yet another \"brilliant\" idea.  All Home Content is turned off, software is up-to-date, reset device 2x, and changed image and album several times trying to get back to previous behavior.  \n  \nI have a new 3rd-party AC Adapter coming in a couple of days and am hoping that eliminates the flicker once and for all.  I love the form factor of the Spot, and for 10 months out of the year there isn't a flicker issue.  Five summers of this have proved that my problem is temperature-related.

  "Hi all,\n\nFor the past few years I've have 4 different Smartlife bulbs connected to my Amazon echo and they've worked fine.

I am able to control them through the Smartlife app, though. I've tried both re-pairing them through the Alexa app and the Smartlife app, and nothing seems to work. Any ideas?",
  "Since I bought an Echo Auto last year I've noticed that it is even less adept at its job than the three 3rd gen Dots I have. When I bought it I was just as enamored with it as I was the Dots due to them being my first pieces of smart tech. \n\nThat has drastically changed.\n\nAlexa is not nearly as robust as she should be and it really shows with the Auto. Home devices aside, I've never experienced such an unpredictable, unreliable and annoying smart assistant. I don't even use it for voice commands anymore because it understands maybe a fourth of what a Dot can at any given time. So I've resorted to using it as a glorified Bluetooth connection since my car doesn't have it on its own.\n\nBut of course, the problems didn't stop there.\n\nWhy, Alexa, must you send me a flury of notifications saying you are connected to my phone, when music is already playing without issue?\n\nAnd when you finally stop spamming me with connection notifications, why does your connection only then start to stutter at the worst possible times?\n\nIf it weren't for the fun that is fluctuating finances, I would have switched to Google already. Their assistant has never been this bad on my phone.\n\n(Disclaimer: I'm a former Amazon employee who is not only pissed with their products but was also treated poorly as many others have been, so that may be affecting my experience)",
  "I've been having this issue for months but ive got two echo studios and an echo sub hooked up as a stereo pair but they always default back to my guest network and loose internet.. when they default to my guest network they won't connect because i didn't enter the password to get a connection... When they loose my main network they become unpaired and after connecting to my main wifi when going to setup the pair again I can only select one speaker and the subwoofer.. if i select the other speakers then the sub and the other speaker won't pair... Even says they are on the same network and changing the network won't get all 3 to pair anymore... And in the very rare case when all 3 work then they will automatically loose wifi overnight and the hour long or longer battle to get them all paired is back on the table again... How can i get them to stop connecting to my guest wifi so I can not have to spend hours setting them up again?

  "Yes I've changed all the settings that can be changed and they do nothing.  I know this is an old problem.  I began to use my 4th Gen Echo Dot with my laptop when those speakers went bad, and when I searched the problem then, I found a program Anti Alexa which made the announcement only happen when I start my computer.\n\nMy laptop has been going downhill and I bought a better desktop for running my CNC plasma program and Fusion 360.  I kept using the laptop for business and general stuff but my Bluetooth has been going bad as well, so I switched the speaker to the desktop.  Problem is, after sitting idle it disconnects and reconnects to Alexa and announces all the time then.  The Anti Alexa I had installed seems hard to find, and when I tried to send the zip file to myself through Gmail, it says it contains a virus.\n\nI came up with the idea of finding a white noise background video on YouTube, and turning the volume down as low as possible.  Not ideal fix, but it got me wondering if there was a program that isn't a virus that makes a background noise without actually making noise to keep Alexa connected. Kind of like how a mouse jiggler keeps a computer awake. \n\nI don't want to hook a aux cord up if possible because I move this computer into my shop to hook up to my CNC plasma table and it's one less thing I need to deal with.",

But I also can't configure the Show 15 to use the Echo as the default speaker, because Amazon won't allow that.

  "I bought a FireTV on sale a while ago and it came with an Echo Show.  I did not want one, but I wasn't going to turn that down.  Just the other day I decided to give it shot.  I really only want to use it to control my TV.\n\nI have an old-school, basic S/PDIF surround sound receiver hooked up to my FireTV.  This is the only speaker I am interested in using.\n\nAfter some screwing around I was able to get my Echo to control my TV (More or less), though it is pretty terrible.\n\n\nMy main issue is that when I ask Alexa to do something it will mute my receiver part-way through responding.  I can't determine a reason.  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  It basically makes the entire thing useless because I have to unmute the receiver, and I can't really ask the Echo for any information because it just cuts itself off.\n\n\nMy Echo also does not turn on my receiver when I ask it to to turn on the TV.  This is not an IR issue, as I am aware that the receiver controls are being emitted from the FireTV remote.  It still doesn't work regardless of if the remote is pointed at the receiver or not.  I don't know if this is solvable, but it also makes it pretty useless.  No sound means no music.  I don't really see why this is the way it is.  If I ask Alexa to change the volume it controls the receiver just fine.\n\n\nA third issue is actually playing music.  I use Pandora as my default music service.  When I do already have my TV on AND ask Alexa to play music AND it doesn't mute itself, it doesn't actually open Pandora on the TV.  I don't know how to explain what it does, but it is buggy to say the least.  Sometimes it'll show a fullscreen display with the song, or something it'll show a fullscreen display of the last song and never change, or sometimes it'll just play in the background with no way to interact with it on the TV.  I also can't find any effective way to change my Pandora station to one of my custom stations.\n\n\nSorry for the wall of unformatted garbage, but I think unformatted garbage is an accurate description of my experiences with the Alexa so far.  It's a real damn shame since stand-alone, the Echo Show worked great.  Considering it came with the TV, I thought it would interact better with it.\n\n\nTLDR; My Echo keeps muting itself mid-sentence for no reason, and fails at every other task.  Please let me know if there is a fix to the above issues.  Thanks.",

Still got an audible delay.\n\nNext I tried the headphone jack on my monitor, connected to the PC via DisplayPort. Nope.\n\nFiguring the issue was with the virtual mixer not being able to sync the outputs, I tried a physical mixer, main speakers on the main mix and the Studio connected to the headphone out.

  "After months of not asking for help and trying to figure this out on my own, I am here with a very important question that I can hopefully get answered. \n\nAfter reading raving reviews this past summer, I spent just a little over $220 on a pair of echo gen 4's.\n\nThe sound quality is excellent and I am very pleased. But ...........\n\nHowever, I just can't enjoy them. Why? In my art studio, I have limited space. One speaker is closer to me than the other. I knew this going in. In the past, this has never been an issue with other speakers / stereo amps, etc because I could always adjust the speaker furthest from my ear to make up the distance it was from me. I did this by simply increasing volume on that speaker to equalize / balance the pair for maximum stereo enjoyment between the pair.\n\nCan someone please carefully explain to me how to do this with my Amazon Echo Gen 4s? I have one dominating speaker that is over-powering the other that is a bit further away from me. No, I cannot move the furthest speaker to make it closer to me. There's a reason why it's a bit further from me than the closest speaker.\n\nI've resisted selling these and moving to a more flexible speaker system, but thought I should ask this one final question before making that decision. if I do not truly have control over my very expensive high-tech Alexa enabled speakers, they are gone.

Which includes several Echo Dots (2nd and 3rd generation), Echo Inputs, and Echo Shows (Show 1st generation, Show 2nd generation and Show 5 1st generation).\n\nSince the devices all state to power my router and each affected device, the first time this happened I power cycled my three wireless access points and each of the affected devices.

  "I have Echo Dors in each of my kids bedrooms. They're mostly just used for ambient background music aimed at lulling them to sleep and to keep them asleep, and were mostly pleased with the them. I have a few routines centered around starting this music and setting the volumes which work almost perfectly for our intentions.\n\nHere's where I need some help:\n\nIn the room shared by our 4 and 5yo boys, they have discovered that Alexa will start up an audio-only, INTERACTIVE version of Blue's Clues, in which my kids are able to actively respond. I have no idea how they found this, but it seems alright (in moderation) and we don't seem to mind it too much EXCEPT on the nights we are finding them playing this well over an hour past when we put them to bed. Much later than we'd rather them be awake. \n\nHere's the real kicker about it; I can't get Blue's Clues to turn off. Since it's like the show, or like a game, the Dot (or is it Alexa during this time) thinks when I say \"Alexa, stop\" or ,\"Alexa stop Blue's Clues\", that I'm responding to Blue's Clues and giving an actual command to stop. I have to unplug it to get it to stop. \n\nDoes any here have any similar experiences to this and also offer any suggestions on how I can create a routine to turn it off at a particular time?\n\nFurthermore, is there a setting or routine where I can disable and also override the mic mute button over a particular time period?",

I already tested using it as a normal speaker but I had no results  \n\n\n(By the way, I don't recommend buying the fourth generation if you already have the third.

After a couple hours of setting everything up (I had some problems with the sub), everything worked fine or it seemed it worked fine, however today I started feeling a difference in volume between the two echos, is that possible? Could the reason be the difference of generations?

  "Hey, all!\n\nI've got a stereo pair of dots, an Echo plus, and now an Echo Studio that I'd like to be able to adjust the volume on all at once. As difficult as that may be to do, I also want to be able to set them to DIFFERENT volumes. For example, let's say when I say \"quiet volume\" I want the stereo pair set to 2, the Studio set to 1 and the Plus set to 1.\n\nUntil I added the Studio today I had just created a routine that changed the volume of the device I was speaking to, and at the end of the routine had a custom line for it to change the volume of the stereo pair also. Now that I have a third in the mix though, and routines only let you have one custom line, I'm not sure how to go about doing this. I'm not above doing it in some convoluted set-up if necessary, I just need to know what that way would be, haha\n\nAny ideas? Thanks in advance!",

I have echo devices)\n\nI used to be able to set speaker groups volume in routines in the custom command field either by themselves or in a string with other commands with AND separating the commands\n\n**These for example, all used to work:**\n\n**5AM routine:\"set all speakers to volume 2\"**\n\n**Good morning routine:**\n\n**\"set all speakers to volume 2 and play 80s pop music on all speakers\"**\n\n**Good night routine:**\n\n**\"set all speakers to volume 2 and set volume 3 and ask sleep sounds to play brown noise\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow literally none of those work. rather, the commands work so long as the volume set commands are omitted.I can SPEAK these commands to the device and the speaker group volume sets. but it cant be in a routine.\n\nAnyone know of a trick or hack to automatically set speaker group volumes now that they've seemingly removed it? it's quite irritating having to speak the command after waking up, or speak the command before or after bedtime etc.",
  "I almost never use the Echo for voice requests because the sound quality is so bad that it can be hard to understand. It sounds very muffled and bass-y. I\u2019ve tried to adjust it to no avail, and obviously I\u2019ve tried turning the volume up. \n\nMy tiny Google Home devices sound so much more clear. If I want to know the weather, I ask Google even though the little Google Home puck is across the room and the Echo is closer.",
  "I've had my echo buds 2nd generation since March and recently my left earbud started making a loud high pitch noise and now the volume is low on it. Ive factory reset them and it didn't fix them. Has this happened to anyone and if so is there a solution?",
  "Hiya\n\n**Alexa Echo voice control of Samsung TV volume doesn't work for HDMI ARC connected devices (soundbar/av amp.)?**\n\n- Other voice commands work fine, including muting.  \n- Voice volume control works fine if the output is set to TV Speaker \n- Volume control of HDMI ARC connected devices works fine using the TV remote.\n- Volume control of HDMI ARC connected devices also works fine within the SmartThings app.\n\nI see this on **two completely independent Samsung TVs** (our 2021 model Samsung TV and my parents 2018 model Samsung TVs - connected via SmartThings, in separate homes, using separate accounts, etc.)\n\n*Anyone else see this issue?*\n\n*Does anyone else know of a fix or workaround?*",
  "I've had my Echo for about a year now, when i got it I should say 'Alexa, 50% volume' or something along those lines and it would accept my command and change volume to 5. After a few months, it changed and I could no longer say that, it weirded me out but I got over it and accept using 'Alexa, volume X.'\n\nI have a routine set up where if I say 'Alexa, Music' it plays and shuffles my spotify playlist I made. Yesterday, I could use simple words such as 'next' and 'skip' to change the song forwards. Today, I went to have a shower and whenever I said these words, it said that it didn't understand, but understood when I said 'next/skip song'.\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy as the past like 4 months have had me stressed out with school that I've had lapses in memory, so I could just be remembering things wrong and wanted to get other opinions on it in case it did just spontaneously change.",
  "I cannot figure this out. I was listening to Audible one day and turned it down with voice - Echo asked me if I wanted it reset to 3 each day automatically, and I said sure, not thinking how low that was. Since then daily the sound is so low I keep having to tell it repeatably each day to raise, or do manually, and it's annoying\n\nI have asked it to stop resetting and tried to find the settings for this in the alexa app, but cannot figure it out. Where can I change/erase this setting?",
  "Edit. Solved. Reboot the device fixed it. \n\nAs the question really. My old man has an echo studio in his kitchen. It pretty much permanently plays either the radio or Spotify all day long. \n\nWhen he asks it a question, it replies with the audio still playing in the background but he struggles to hear the reply due to the audio being so loud. \n\nI\u2019ve had a look at settings but don\u2019t see anything jump out. Cheers.",
  "Hi, I'm thinking of getting an Echo amp for my living room setup. I want to play either Spotify via Alexa (integrated in different multiroom groups with other echos) or use it as power amp for my surround receiver, but only the stereo channels. That means I would need it to have the exact same volume set up whenever the receiver is selected as input. \n\nI couldn't find any info on the default volume that is set when the sources are changed. Will it keep the volume set via the connected echo or can this somehow be configured?",
  "After the announcement that Amazon was allowing adverts, I jumped ship to google/nest. After having it for the past week, I thought it was a good time to do as asked and say what I think.\n\nFirst is the Nest mini Vs the Echo Dot.\n\nThis is the easy one. The mini, can do everything the echo can, except track your Amazon deliveries. You can still make calls (using Duo) set reminders and alarms, all the routines etc. I've only had one \"by the way\" so far from the Nest, and that was after I asked it to make an announcement, and it was to tell me that it now also sends notifications to the families phones. In terms of sound, the Echo wins, it can go louder, and has more bottom end. I would say that they stack up pretty much evenly, so it's not worth jumping ship for if you've already got one. I haven't noticed any difference in either hearing or responding to commands.\n\nI find it a bit more awkward saying \"hey/OK Google\" compared to \"Alexa\" and you can't change the wake word. I do prefer the Echo for that bit. There are more assistant voice options on the Nest.\n\nIf you mainly want it for music, Echo wins. The mini can't stack up to what the 4th gen dot can pump out sound wise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNest Hub 2, V's Echo Show\n\nThis is where Google wins big time for me. The screen does what you want it to, and pushes nothing on you compared to the Echo. It gives you a choice of artwork, a clock, or your photo's as a screensaver, and unless you tell it otherwise, that is all it will show until you interact with it. No dog facts, no recipes you'll never try, or \"things to try\" just what you set it to, and nothing else.\n\nLighting is far easier to control, tell it to turn on a smart light, and you get a menu that lets you control the colour and brightness, which goes back to screensaver after a minute of not being interacted with.\n\nMusic, the volume and sound quality are on par with the Echo, the Hub is slightly louder. When playing from Spotify (I haven't tried other services) it gives you a full screen media player, only going away if you request something else like a timer. \n\nSpeaking of which, if you set a timer, it goes full screen, so you don't need to keep asking how long is left. Amazon does slightly better with timers though in one regard, it will let you know how long is left on a timer on another device if you ask, but the Nest won't.\n\nMenus for smart home devices, reminders, and media can be swiped through, or away back to the screensaver. You can also leave on screen sticky notes for other family members.\n\nCamera, echo wins this one, only the Hub max has a camera.\n\nVideo, obviously YouTube is native to the Nest, but you can still get it on the Echo, and I can't imagine many people will be using either to watch Netflix or Disney plus so it's not really a plus or minus for either. I do prefer the Nest screen though. It's a flatter and less reflective, with a more natural balance, it also adapts far better to the ambient light.\n\nI've found that the Hub can hear me far better than the Show, I've only had it miss one command so far, and that was because I was blasting music while I was cooking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe app(s)\n\nThis one is pure preference. I find the Echo app a bit messy and a bit less user-friendly. Not a big deal for the tech-savvy among us, but I think the Google home app is probably better for the older crowd, most of what you need is on a single page. Voice training is like for like, both have been able to tell the differences between family members.",
  "Edit: I bought a very inexpensive iCan mini USB microphone for $8 CDN just to satisfy the Alexa Win 10 App microphone installation requirement for my desktop PC.\n\nVolume slider in the Win 10 App enables finer volume control than possible with the normal Echo voice volume command. Pleased with the result!\n\nTo access the volume slider => Smart Home, Devices (top right corner), select one of the 2 paired Echo(s), adjusted slider using mouse.\n\n===========\n\nI have paired Echo(s) on either side of my desktop monitor but do not have a microphone connected to my computer in order to install the windows 10 Alexa app.\n\nWill the windows 10 version of the Alexa application permit me to use the apps own volume slider for fine volume adjustment for just these 2 Echo(s) or is the volume slider for all echo devices in your home?\n\nI am aware this works with the Alexa app on iPhone or iPad when playing my Apple Music.  \n\nPerformed lots of online searches for a definitive answer for this scenario without any success.",
  "I just bought a Amazon Echo Show 5 since it was on sale at Best Buy. I tried using a vocal command to set an alarm to play a song from Spotify, and it will play the song I requested BUT anytime the Spotify alarm  goes off (regardless of it being the initial set alarm or a secondary snoozed alarm), it will BEEP. EVERY TIME. Just one distinct, conspicuous, audible, annoying beep- the same beep you hear when you change the volume on the clock, except I'm not manually changing the volume or have a routine that changes it and I have the gradual increase alarm setting off.\n\nI thought a software update would help, but the beep persisted even still. Also tried deleting the alarm and recreating it, but that didn't fix it either. Even tried changing the song just to see if that would make a difference, but NOPE. \n\nDoes this happen to anyone else??? Is this by design???",
  "I recently acquired my 2nd 4th gen Echo on prime day. I was really happy with the audio coming from just one echo, I had to try the pair. I exclusively use them to stream Spotify, I will play music on the Spotify app on my phone, then select to stream through the pair or, \"Everywhere\", which streams through the pair and the fire stick. \n\nSo far this new set up has been somewhat of a disappointment, my biggest issue is when adjusting the volume on my phone, the Echo's will respond in a really odd way. The volume will begin to adjust and then I will lose volume on one of the Echo's, the volume will come back but then the other echo will lose volume, then raise the volume, and the cycle starts, before you know it the pair will be playing a game of tug-of-war with the volume. Loud volume on one, and low volume on the other, and back and forth they go, raising and lowering the volume until I stop it or eventually they crap out and stop playing music. \n\nConnection times from the Spotify app to the Echo's have increased as well since the addition of the 2nd echo, something I could deal with if it weren't for this volume issue I am having. I would be interested to know if anyone has come across this issue and if you've found a fix.",
  "To make a long story short ever since I've purchased an Amazon TV. I get these random alarm emergency and volume blast up to a hundred and always have to fight with it, this started when I connected my ring doorbell but even when nothing approaches my door my alarm still randomly goes off even in the middle of night, plz how do I resolve this cause get tired having to wake up to a heart attack and my kids running around in fear",
  "My dad is in the early/mid stages of dementia and needs stimulation. Since his kids live far away, we can't visit as often as he and we would like, so he tends to withdraw from the world. I thought that a photo frame running a slide show of his life, including photos of his early life on the farm, life with mom (who has passed) and kids, travel photos, and outdoor photo would provide some stimulation.  With his memory loss, a large number of photos would provide \"new\" stimulation regularly.  \n\nThen I saw an ad for an Amazon-refurbished 2nd gen Echo Show 5 and realized it was cheaper and had more features than the photo frames I was researching.  The Echo Show had more features like scrolling the weather, announcing upcoming games, and more.  We won't use voice interaction because he'd need the volume much too high for the comfort of others.  Importantly, I could filter out all of the \"Try this!\" pages that would probably frustrate or confuse him.\n\nIt has worked great, and he really likes seeing the photos.  The 250 photos keep him stimulated, though he remembers more than I had anticipated, which is actually good!  The downside is that it's small and hard to see from his bed or chair.  (Few options for placement.)\n\nSo I tried a refurbished Echo Show 11 (2nd gen?  square/triangle shape) for a much larger image.  It works well for this, but has loads of the self-advertising \"Try this!\" pages that the Show 5 filtered out.  The Alexa app doesn't control the Show 11 in the same way, so this is less than optimal.\n\nIs there a way to limit the self-advertising \"Try this!\" slides in Echo Shows outside of the app or in setup on the unit itself?  \n\nIs there a larger (10-11\") Show that has better controls to limit the extraneous self-advertising prompts?\n\nThanks!",
  "Me: \"Alexa, turn up the volume.\"\n\nAlexa, immediately, without actually playing anything at the new volume: \"Do you want the volume turned up more?\"\n\n\nThis is so frustrating to experience. I cannot understand why Alexa would turn the volume up one, then ask if I wanted the volume higher without playing anything. I wouldn't even want ANY feedback, just increase the volume a step like you've been doing for 7 years. It even happens if I say \"Alexa, volume 4.\"\n\nAnyone experiencing this nonsense?!",
  "I\u2019m not sure what is going on with my echos. I have 2 in my bedroom and 1 in the bathroom that I have set up as a group. I ask Alexa to play music on the group. She says she is starting the music and then does nothing. If I ask one of the other echos in the room to play, she says music is already streaming on another device and asks if I want to switch to that device. If I say yes it will begin playing on that device only. No matter what, it won\u2019t play on the group. If I go into the alexa app it shows a completely different song is paused on the device that is currently playing music. But it won\u2019t let me hit play on that song. I have unpaired and repaired the speakers as well as confirmed that the volume is turned up loud enough to hear. What gives?",

  "3 times today, when listening to Spotify via my Echo Studio, all of a sudden, the volume got *very* loud.

  "I have an original Echo that came with a remote control. I like using the remote control at night, when I'm reading in bed and my wife is sleeping, so I can change the volume or stop the music without talking to Alexa. With the Echo, it's great - using the remote control is quiet, and does not risk waking up my wife.\n\nThe original Echo has been great, but lately a little wonky on its connectivity, which I can expect from such an old device. So, I moved one of my 3rd generation Echo Dots into the bedroom instead, and paired the remote control to it. However, now when I use the remote, the Echo says \"now paired to bluetooth\" when I first press a button. Some time later, after not using it for a while, the Echo makes a noise indicating it's lost bluetooth connectivity and if I use the remote again, I get that message.\n\nAm I doing something wrong with pairing the old remote to the Echo Dot 3rd gen? Or is that just the way remotes work with newer devices (in which case I will retrieve the original Echo from the spare bedroom!). Any help would be appreciated!",

  "So like the title says, my axon echo dot keeps setting my alarms to the lowest volume. I used to use it for my morning alarm and now I sleep through it. I don't have any routines set for this, but I did a couple months ago.\n\nI went away for a weekend and forgot to unplug my Echo, so my alarm went off when I wasn't home and didn't stop going off. My neighbor left me a very angry note about how they couldn't sleep in on their day off because my alarm was blaring with no one to turn it off. I felt awful, so in addition to promising to remember to unplug it, I also set my volume to stay at 2 or 3 so if I did forget it wouldn't be that loud. I have since removed these instructions and cannot find them anywhere in my Amazon echo app on my phone.\n\nBut for some reason, my alarms are now barely audible. The only reason I wake up at all is because we also use the echo to play white noise while we sleep and the white noise stops when the alarm goes off. So the sudden change in noise will wake me up sometimes but it's not dependable as a real means of wakeup.

  "Hi.  I like my Echo Auto, but the one that that drove me nuts was when I wanted to talk to Alexa, I'd have to turn my car's stereo to Bluetooth audio to hear her.  I'm almost *never* listening to music from my phone; it's usually my USB stick or the satellite radio.  So I was in Best Buy recently and wandering about bored and saw they sell a [$20 Bluetooth powered speaker with 3.5mm input](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/insignia-rugged-portable-bluetooth-speaker-black/5204300.p?skuId=5204300).  Nice thing is, it's fairly compact too *(at least in relation to the other options BB had)*.  I bought that and some [Scotch brand 10# velcro](https://www.amazon.com/SCOTCH-Fasteners-Extremely-Strong-Holds/dp/B07M6Z4SVN/ref=sr_1_12) *(I like it because it's not fuzzy velcro, it's hard plastic and reassuringly \"clicks\" into place)* and a [10' right angled 3.5mm cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WS1NFA6?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details).  I mounted the speaker on the side of my center console, ran the 3.5mm cable to the Echo and ran a micro USB from the speaker to a switched USB I had installed *(my regular cig lighter ports stay hot when the key is out...  didn't want to drain my battery so I had a dual type A female USB port installed)*.  It worked, but had a static whine.  I assumed it was a ground loop, so I bought a [cheap ground loop isolator](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BRSQ7JY?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) and put that inline and voila, sounds great now.\n\nSo now any time I talk to Alexa, I can hear her reply regardless of what my car stereo is doing.  I do have to turn it down sometimes because it's not super loud but that's much less hassle than changing inputs.  Mounting it facing me instead of facing away and down at foot level I'm sure would help that, lol, but for my car this was the most practical location.  I also found that having the Echo on vol level 10 with the speaker on max volume isn't a good idea, sounds harsh.  Echo vol 9 though sounds fine.\n\nI am sure someone already has posted something like this in the past, but figured I'd share as well just in case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08fttz5e1by81.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bab3605926074324f5cf7391c202953c47e101b4\n\nRight angle cables FTW lol:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6wqm9y0pcy81.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a6e113327855169a72bc647bb43965442fa8568",
  "Whatever update I got recently... I hate it.  I use an Echo Show 8 as a bedside alarm and I don't use voice to snooze, but rather tap the screen to snooze or swipe up to dismiss (still hate I can't tap the top like the Show 5).  It recently started showing a banner on the screen saying that my alarm was ringing, even after snoozing with a \"dismiss\" button.  I tend to snooze a few times on the mornings I work from home and with whatever update happened recently, after the first snooze \"tap\" on the screen, another tap when it goes off again simply dismisses the alarm.  No second or third snooze.  I even woke up early this morning because it had been annoying me with this behavior and carefully tapped the screen, NOT on the banner or the dismiss button, and sure enough, after the first snooze, the alarm went off 9 minutes later and I tapped to snooze and it just dismissed.  \n\nSide note, I also frequently have the issue where the alarm goes off, I tap the screen OR tell it to snooze and it says \"Snoozing...\" then continues to go off at full volume.

  "Hope you are well. I don't have a subscription to amazon music, nor plan to. I want to listen  the baseball game and do stuff around the house.

Any info you could provide would be appreciated. I'm not much of a technology person. Thanks :)",
  "I have currently a Yamaha soundbar in my living room. It's not bad, but I have to crank the volume pretty loud to really get the 3D sound out of it. I decided to replace it with the 2 Echo Studios I already have in the room. \n\nI bought a 4k Fire Stick to connect it to my LG TV. It did a short demo that sounded amazing but when I switched to an NBA game the sound was very thin. I flipped through channels and was underwhelmed.\n\nMy first instinct is to pair it with the Echo subwoofer, but then I started wondering if a Fire TV Cube would help.\n\nI also want to get a turntable eventually and I'm hearing that I can only stream to a single Studio. That might not be a deal breaker as a single Studio still sounds good, but just seems wasteful to have a setup I can't always use to its full potential. \n\nAnyone else had a similar experience?",

  "I'm looking into replacing my Bose 500 with a Echo Studio. One thing that is nice about the Bose is the volume can be adjust by 1 percent at a time via voice commands. Does the Studio also allow for fine tune volume control via voice, or it is like the regular Echos and only adjust by 1s between 0 to 10. With our Echo gen 2 that always seemed to be an issue, it was either too quiet or too loud. Thanks for the input!",

  "I have a daily alarm set on my Echo to go off at the same time and play music from a particular artist.  Randomly the alarm goes off but has no volume at all.

  "Hello all,\n\nI have about a dozen Alexa enabled devices. The issue I am having is with a stereo pair of third generation Echo dots. They are tied to a Firestick, and serve as TV speakers for content from the stick.\n\nFirst, when I ask Alexa a question the first time it always cuts off.\n\n>\"Alexa, what time is it?\"\n\n>\"It is 1...\"\n\n>\"Alexa, what time is it?\"\n\n>\"It is 1:30pm\".\n\nor\n\n>\"Alexa, what is the weather?\"\n\n>\"It is currently ...\"\n\n>\"Alexa, what is the weather?\"\n\n>\"It is currently cloudy and the temperature is (etc.)\"\n\n[Two other users had the same issue, but never seemed to identify a solution.](https://old.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/p25sox/responses_cut_off_on_one_echo_device/)\n\nThe second issue is if I tell Alexa to set the volume to 2, it seems to set it to volume 1, then 10-30 seconds later it jumps up to what is 2. If I say set the volume to 3, it seems to be set to 2, then jumps to 3 about 20 seconds later. That happens at any volume level or request, even using routines to adjust the volume causes this to happen. I found by asking Alexa to repeat something, it adjusts the volume immediately to reply. If I have music already playing and try to change the volume, it stays at the lower volume for a bit then gets louder.\n\nSo if music is playing I will do this:\n\n>\"Alexa, set the volume to 3, and say 'thank you'\"\n\n>*The dots change to volume 2, you can tell by the music.*\n\n>*Music gets muted, it says thank you at volume 3*\n\n>*Now music is volume 3*\n\nAny ideas from anyone on what I could check or do?\n\nThe firmware is update to on both speakers in the speaker pair.

  "Hi, got my first echo dot speaker today and have been playing with it all day. While the smart speaker features are cool, one thing that has really annoyed me is how much the volume changes. For e.g. If I am listening to songs on amazon music, every time the song changes, I have to crank the volume up or down. While watching a movie in Fire TV & keeping echo dot as a speaker, I have to crank up the volume during dialogue, but then the background audio becomes too loud. All this has led me to do more fiddling with the volume than I have done in the past month. Is there any solution to this? I can't deal with so much volume fiddling.\n\nPS:\n1) I'm aware of equalizer, but I don't want to play around with treble, bass & all that stuff. I just want volume normalized.\n2) I do have volume normalization On in Fire TV, but that still doesn't help. Especially not with amazon music which requires no Fire TV.",

  "Hey Y'all, wondering if anybody else has had weird noise problems with Echo Dot 4th gen models. \n\nThe first, most common thing that happens is I'll hear a high-pitched whine, coming from any motion-detecting Echo. It's random but very obvious. The reason  I suspect it has to do with motion detection is when I walk up to it or near it, it goes away. I've got 1 in each room of the house, and they all do this. \n\nThe 2nd (I think unrelated) problem I've had is 2 times in the past 2 weeks, I've had 2 different Echo Dots make the most horrifying static/screeching noise at what seems full volume until I unplug and replug it. Looking into the logs, nothing triggered or caused this directly. Scares the living shit out of me.\n\nBetween these weird issues and other Echo annoyances like \"by the way\", I'm about to hop ship to HomePod minis, but would like to keep my sanity for the meantime. \n\nYes, I've reported it to Amazon already.\n\nThanks <3",

  "Alexa's voice is sometimes annoyingly loud. Here's a fix:\n\ni found out a way after a lot of struggle. this works in all cases whether you want to play songs from a particular playlist or a particular song or simply anything. \nstep1:create a routine and add an action to set the device volume to whatever you want the music to be at.\nstep2:add the music/playlist you want to play. for playlists try using custom commmand action which says something like 'shuffle my 'playlist name' playlist.\nstep 3 :save this routine and add another routine with the voice action 'alexa,stop playing'. in this new routine set device volume(alexa's volume now that the music will stop) to your preferred alexa volume. then simply add a custom command action with the words' alexa stop music' or anything similar.\n\nwhat this will do is stop the music and automatically set your alexa volume from say 5(your music preffered volume) to 3( your preferred alexa volume)\n\nthe key here is to create two routines and use custom commands.\n\nfeel free to ask anything regarding the same!",

  "Soooooo I\u2019ve actually had a set up working for a few months now that lets me cast anything with the Apple airplay function to any/all of my Echo multiroom groups. I debated putting the info out there for fear of Jeff B locking it up with a patch but fuck it. A few other posts questioned (and incorrectly were told no) if the Amazon link device could provide the solution a lot of us *cough* SoundCloud users *cough* we\u2019re looking for. I\u2019m here to tell you it is! But you also need a few more things and to launch your music session in a specific order. \n\nWhat you need:\n\u2022echo link (the link amp should work too but I haven\u2019t tested it)\n\u2022Belkin SoundForm Connect AirPlay 2 (in theory any box that lets you connect to it as an airplay 2 device and has a digital audio out port should work, this is just the one I used)\n\u2022optical audio cable (1)\n\nSteps:\n1) Set up the airplay box of your choice, making sure it is set to push audio out via the digital audio port. Make sure to add it to your Apple home. \n\n2) connect the airplay box to the Amazon link via the optical audio cable. Don\u2019t forget to remove protective the caps on the ends of the cables. \n\n3) set up the Amazon link like any other new echo device\n\n4) make a new multiroom music group. You MUST include the link in this group for this to work\n\n5) go to the settings for the Amazon link. Change \u201cline in distribution\u201d to the name of the multi speaker group you just made \n\n6) Make Alexa to play music from an approved service to this new group. Doesn\u2019t matter what you ask her to play but you can\u2019t skip this step. You can let it keep playing as you move to step seven or stop the music. But you have to prime the system this way. \n\n7) Now, magic time. Start playing something on your iPhone, swipe down from the top right to chose the alternative airplay distribution source. Pick the one you just set up. You should now have your echo multi room group playing music cast via airplay 2\n\nBugs/caveats:\n\u202230 second delay on absolutely every action with this set up. It\u2019s possibly the converter box I\u2019m using but I suspect the Amazon link is slow. So when you first try this, wait a minute before writing the thing off as not working. \n\u2022make sure to start off with the volume low, because, again, it will be 30 seconds before your volume down command takes effect.  \n\u2022number one reset procedure is to repeat step 6. For whatever reason having the echos play multiroom music using a proper streaming set up seems to fix it. \n\u2022things gets messy if your devices are operating on different bands of your Wi-Fi router. But you\u2019re probably used to that since it happens with sanctioned multiroom music streaming too. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions. Hopefully this helps someone else out and keeps them from forking over for a new Sonos set up (they honestly drop the link as much). \n\nIf Amazon ever patches this I\u2019m selling off the entire system and switching to wired speakers. I really hope they just come to terms with Apple soon and make this whole set up useless. This would be a tragedy worthy of a go fund me, right?",

  "I have 4 morning routines to keep my ADHD kid on track and reduce my impulse to nag.  Each one of those routines involves playing Disney Radio on Pandora.  \n\n\nSo, the 7:45 am routine connects to a BlueTooth speaker by his bedroom.  It plays a Good Morning message, the time, \\[used to announce weather\\], tells him the tasks he needs to accomplish by 8 am, then used to play music for 15 minutes.  After that, the routine has Alexa ask him if he's succeeded and reminds him to check in with me.  This used to be run through the Show 5, but is now run through an Echo Dot, since I relocated the Show 5 too far away from the BT speaker.  For the past week or so, the tasks are announced and then the routine goes silent.  No music.  After 15 minutes, it doesn't run the final part of the routine, either.    \n\n\nIt does work when I test the routine, just not when it triggers.  It also tends to trigger 1 to 4 minutes late.  \n\n\nThe other 3 routines run on the tall Echo, my oldest device.  The music streaming will trigger, though sometimes it randomly selects Disney Radio Chile(??) on the first Breakfast Routine.  It also fails to reset the volume to 5 once the music starts.  The second Breakfast Routine never selects DR Chile and I have that structured to break every 5 minutes for a reminder about how much time is left for Breakfast.  I don't like having 2 Breakfast Routines, but fusing them didn't work for some reason.  Finally, the Morning Clean-up/Get Ready for School Routine activates, changes to Kids Bop (ugh) and runs through perfectly.  Always on time.  No BT speaker for any of these Routines.  \n\n\nI don't feel like this is a problem with the BT speaker connection.  It will play music from Spotify, Pandora, and iHeart Radio from the Echo Dot at any other time of the day.  If I test the Routine, the BT speaker plays Disney Radio on Pandora.  \n\n\nI think the routine broke the same time I switched Alexa's default weather to Big Sky.  I deleted playing the weather from the routine, since the music wouldn't play afterwards.  Do I just need to re-write the Routine altogether instead of editing it?    \n\n\nIf anyone has any good Routines that help you or your family with ADHD challenges, please share!",
  "Recently I've been looking for a way to trigger a routine before my alarm (lights fading in/diffuser coming on) my wake schedule isn't always the same so I couldn't use schedules to accomplish it so I've been looking for a way to automate it.\n\nI know certain bridges can accomish this but didn't want to buy another so I figured out a workaround that I wanted to share. I'm using:\n1. My echo dot\n2. IFTTT\n3. Voice monkey skill\n\nIt's fairly easy to set up but somewhat convoluted \n\n1. Create a voice monkey trigger that will trigger the alarm routine (this will be integrated through ifttt) \n2. Create an ifttt applet that begins with alexas alarm going off and then triggers the Monkey you're choosing for the routine \n\n3. The basic part is done, you can create a routine that will begin when the alarm goes off instead of when you dismiss it \n\n4. The beauty of this setup is the same monkey can  be used to trigger multiple routines \n\n5. In one of the triggered routines you can have 'wait x amount of time' followed by 'customised' \"set timer volume to (any value larger than 1) \n\n6. Combine this with a nighttime routine that sets timer volume to 0 \n\nVoil\u00e0, when your alarm goes off it will be silent but can trigger whatever you want then when the wait command finishes the alarm will be given volume and can be dismissed tried it out this morning and it worked a treat \n\nThe one downside is alexa announces the new alarm volume, but it's an OK tradeoff for the gentle waking up I got \n\nApologies if this has been posted before I was just excited when I figured it out and wanted to share",
  "I've just installed 2 new dots to stereo pair them to replace my old single echo dot.

I want to tell my Show to play music as I go to get in the shower.  \n\nTo get to my 4th gen you have to go out of my bathroom, out of my computer room and turn a corner in the kitchen, through the dining room, around another corner into my living room, and the 4th gen is on the wall furthest away.  Now *granted* this is all open concept, but still.  \n\nSomehow my Show doesn't hear me saying \"Alexa\" from 10 feet away, but my 4th gen hears me  4 rooms and 150ish feet, speaking in a normal voice.  \n\nDespite the fact I have to scream at it like a madman with music playing from two feet away these days.  \n\n\nI don't know if my device just started to suck itself, or if software updates have made this stuff worse.  \n\nBut I was so impressed with it a year ago, and now it's just a pain in the ass most of the time.",

  "So I\u2019m in the kitchen listening to music on echo show quietly while making dinner and my kid is drawing at the table.\n\nEvery now and then, the volume just LEAPS exponentially to a deafening volume. For no reason. It\u2019s so bad I had to turn it completely off. \n\nAny ideas?",
  "Has anyone disassembled an echo and messed with its guts? \ud83e\udd23 Sounds horrible I know but hear me out. \n\nFirst off, to avoid a TL;DR, I was wondering if anyone either knew how to disassemble a Dot v3 without it becoming a hack job and also if anyone happened to have a set of schematics for one? I figured I\u2019d put my question and request first, so if you want to know more or what I need that for, read on!\n\nI bought a used Echo Dot v3 off of eBay. I got a great deal because it didn\u2019t have a power supply (dunno why). I\u2019ve got a bit of a Frankenstein creation I\u2019m working on and the Dot will play a vital role in my project. I have a SpeakerCraft CS3 which is a heavy low profile speaker system in a cabinet that is designed to sit under a TV as it is only about 4-5\u201d tall. Where it is about as wide as a 32\u201d flat screen and about 2\u2019 deep, because it has a built-in subwoofer along with 6 speakers across the front, it is also made out of MDF so it is both really heavy and the cabinet is sonically quiet aka no rattling. I got the CS3 back in 2011 and it has served me well with inputs for analog audio, both coax and optical audio inputs, as well as having Bluetooth capability. The sound quality out of this thing has been nothing short of amazing though. Recently, the amp of this blew out and when I contacted the company, they told me that they don\u2019t make that device anymore nor do they do repairs on it, so basically I\u2019ve got a cabinet with great speakers in it and that\u2019s about it. \n\nMy idea is using the cabinet and speakers as they were intended to be used (under a tv), I am going to remove the PCB and remove the rear panel to be reused as much as possible for this build. I have a 100W 2 channel amp that I will be using to power the 6 speakers and subwoofer in the cabinet which is almost a perfect match because the factory amp provided 80W. I hope to be able to isolate, remove, and reuse the crossover circuitry from the PCM between the amp and speakers, but that is a secondary concern right now. \n\nI am wanting to use this Echo Dot v3 I bought for $5 as the brains of the operation as it will not only provide control, streaming audio, and Bluetooth capabilities, it will also have the ability to handle the TV audio thru the use of the Audio In jack on it. Since the amp and the majority of the Dot will be housed inside the speaker cabinet, I know I will have to remove the microphone from the PCB, extend the leads for it, and modify the front of the cabinet in order to mount the microphone(s) in a location where it will be able to pick up voice commands. Depending on what I find when I get into the internals of the Dot, I\u2019ll make a decision then and there whether or not moving the volume, dnd, and action buttons to the front as well would be a good idea or if it is even necessary since I\u2019d have both voice and app control of it already. Where the dot didn\u2019t come with a power supply and that I will need power for both the Dot and the amplifier, I am going to reuse the power plug already on the jack pack (as well as the audio in for the tv) to supply power to both the amp as well as a 12v 1.25a transformer which will be housed internally within the cabinet to keep the overall appearance of it clean. \n\nI have been a professional AV systems integrator now for 25 years so something along the lines of this isn\u2019t uncharted waters for me. I do think it would be helpful to have the schematics for the Dot as well as the trick to opening the case without damaging it, but neither are vital for me to proceed. If anyone wants updates about my progress and whether or not I succeed, let me know. Thanks in advance",

  "Hi all - I have an Echo Auto, and I like it a lot, except for the huge difference between media and calls/Siri volume level. I've used it with both Apple iPhone 11 and 13, with no change. I'm going Bluetooth from phone to Echo Auto, aux in from Echo Auto to car (2009 Altima w/ OEM Bose head unit - which has Bluetooth for headset only, not A2DP, hence the aux in.)\n\nAs near as I can tell, this is what's happening:\n\nWhen you use Alexa or play media the volume is quite normal - phone output is set to 100%, Echo Auto is set to 90%, and car stereo is set to \"12\" and all is well. I believe in this case the Alexa app is using an A2DP profile to talk to the Echo Auto over Bluetooth.\n\nHowever, if I ask Siri for something, or a phone call comes in, the phone switches to a headset/car kit profile so the mic works, and the volume is nightmarishly loud. I've tried asking Siri to speak softer, and even at the lowest level, it blows me out of the car if the phone rings or Siri is talking.\n\nThis seems to be an iOS issue - the output on the headset profile is just much louder than for A2DP audio profile, but it seems like a common issue, and Amazon could deal with it in the firmware for the Echo Auto and it doesn't.\n\nIs there something I'm missing? Is there some way to get the Echo to compensate for this? I almost wonder if I should try using my old HTC bluetooth adapter in the stereo and go wireless from phone to Echo Auto and from Echo Auto to car stereo aux in.\n\nAny thoughts?

  "You know how your mobile has seperate volume levels for \"phone call\", \"alarm\", \"media\" etc, I think there should be same feature in Alexa echo.\n\nI like my music at a lower volume (~30%), but then when i querry something to Alexa, I just can't hear Alexa's response. \n\nI have to pause the music, then change to volume 100% then ask query again, then change the volume back to 30% and then resume the music.\n\nIs there something already there??

  "I have 2 Autistic sons and am ASD/ADHD myself, Alexa is our saviour (reminders, timers are going off constantly from every device and I rely on it heavily for 'mood/sensory regulation') my youngest (6) has only recently started 'using' his own dot and finds he struggles to get Alexa to respond as he pronounces it \"Berlessa\".\n\nI have tried switching Wakewords and he can say \"Echo\" very clearly but it seems noticeable that \"Echo\" needs to be said VERY loudly almost shouted.\n\nStrangely the device understands ALL other commands at the normal speaking volume.  It's just the wakeword that needs shouting.\n\nIt's putting my son off using it as when he's listening to his chill out sounds at bedtime, having to shout \"ECHO ECHO ECHO stop please good night\" is a bit of a mood killer.\n\nIS there a setting I can fiddle with to sort this?",
  "I have an Echo 3rd gen in the bathroom with a connected wonderboom in the shower to listen to the news/talk radio.

Now, at full wonderboom volume, it's hardly noticeable. To make it work I have to set the echo volume to 7  before getting into the shower. \n\nIs there a way to get back to what I had before?",

My original gen 1 Show did (and still does in my laundry room) a perfect job recognizing \"Alexa\" at normal speaking volume. Though I've enjoyed the richer sound quality from the Show 8, it misses what I say so often it's actually become more of a nuisance than an assistant.  \n\n\nDo any of you have a Show that does a terrific job of hearing you? Please give me your suggestions.  If I have to get a refurbished first Gen Show and put up with sub-optimal audio, so be it.

I tried starting it with a factory reset, you can see the \"factory reset\" text at the bottom of the screen, but it only gets as far as the screen with the \"Amazon\" logo.   \n\n\nPlugging in and out, and restarting etc, doesn't have any impact. My Ring doorbell has recently bricked as well, it feels a bit like planned obsolescence to me. I think rather than replacing them, I might try Home Assistant instead  \n\n\nthanks!",

Most (but not all) nights, the echo will just abruptly stop somewhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours into the night, waking me up. \n\n* Skills: I have used various free 10+ hour noise skills, a brown noise file playing over a Plex server, and a brown noise file playing from a Google drive link using the My Pod skill. I get the same problem with all of them.\n\n* Devices: I orginally used an echo show 5, and because I thought it might be a device specific problem I just got a 5th gen dot. I get the same problem.\n\n* Network: My home uses a TP-Link 2.4/5ghz ac mesh system. Network diagnostics show a lot of other networks in the neighborhood, but my channels are significantly stronger than any others and there is actually very little congestion. There are typically 16-20 devices on the network at the time, the majority of which are echos, smart plugs, doorbells, door locks, and other very low traffic devices. There is almost no active network traffic during the night besides the stupid echo I am trying to use as a sound machine.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas about other things to try, I would be grateful to hear them.

When it comes to audio devices, I have chosen to place 3 Echo's and one Echo Studio in a type of surround sound configuration. The three Echo's were purchased first and then the Studio was my latest acquisition.\n\nHonestly, I am not impressed. While the Studio certainly produces more bass than the regular Echo devices, it falls short when it comes to clarity of sound.\n\nAmazon advertised a type of immersive experience, a enveloping 360\u00b0 sound experience, which I have yet to figure out how to configure. I do understand that only certain songs have been recorded in this fashion, and I have tried listening to them, but I really can't hear what all the hype is about?\n\nNow I'm not trying to completely dis Amazon's devices, as the Echo is a phenomenal speaker for the price. However, for the amount of money that the Echo Studio costs, I anticipated a higher quality product, with MUCH better sound. \n\nMaybe I got a bad device? \n\nMy questions to the group are (if you have an echo studio, or have listened to one), do you have the same complaints, and if so are there specific settings I should try to improve the sound quality? Also, what is your opinion of this speaker, and what would you recommend Amazon change in their next version?\n\nHope Amazon doesn't blacklist me for this post! lol But I was really hoping to get something incredible when I purchased the Studio, and so far my experience has been really disappointing.\n\nThank you for commenting, and sharing any recommendations and or experiences you've had with the Echo Studio!\n\n\n\nJ.

  "Prior to the update of the echo show now being able to have Fire TV like capabilities, I was able to say \u201cecho watch <show>on Hulu and it would turn on the Fire TV in the bedroom and play the show as the devices were paired in the Alexa app.\n\nEver since fire TV type capabilities came to the Echo Show, this broke. Now I just get some crap message about being able to watch Hulu on the Echo show itself and it\u2019s infuriating. Unpairing and repairing does nothing. \n\nIt seems if you have an eligible echo device to watch fire TV apps on, you can no longer control a paired fire TV device.\n\nAnyone run into this and come up with a fix?",

  "Do you guys know if your Amazon account can potentially be compromised if someone steals the Echo Auto 2nd gen from your car? Specifically, does it contain your authentication credentials or some session/security token to \"login as you\" to Amazon? For example, if someone steals the Echo Auto, can they do stuff on your Amazon account as if they had physical access to one of your other Echo devices.

I have about 6 displays including the 15\" in my kitchen of course.\n\nAlexa has gotten worse over the years, the extra talking (\"by the way\"), a decrease in understanding random questions and even cities for weather.  The only improvement was the addition of multiple named timers.  \n\nBut the final straw was what they just did to music.

Do the Echo Dots connect to 5 ghz wifi networks (that's what I have my Fire TV Cube and Echo Shows on), or must they be on 2.4 ghz? Assuming the Echo Dots can connect to the 5 ghz wifi network, can I start streaming Amazon Music on one of those devices and then tell those devices to stream the same media to the Echo Dots? If they can only connect to 2.4 ghz, can I still send the media from a device on the 5 ghz network to them? Does the audio match up really well across the devices, or is there a lag sometimes?

  "When echo dot communicates to a device like e.g. a WiFi socket, does echo send the on/off command directly to the socket in the same WLAN home network, or does all communication go via the internet and I need an account at the socket manufacturer?\n\n----\n\nUpdate: Answer: It depends on which socket (smart plug) I have!\n\n_**Bad example:**_      \nE.g. a Tapo socket (P100 for example) requires you to first install the Tapo app on your smartphone and open an account in the Tapo cloud with your email. Then any switch on/off command that you invoke via Alexa speech command involves not only the Amazon cloud but also the Tapo cloud, which communicates directly with your Tapo P100 smart plug (socket).\n\n_**Good example:**_        \nSmart plugs with **Tasmota** firmware (e.g. DeLock 11826, or Currymaster) support MQTT protocol and CAN an DO communicate directly to my Amazon echo dot!\n\nOn the one hand I can switch them on/off directly via a simple local URL get command, e.g. by typing in my web browser:\n\n* http://192.168.178.99/cm?cmnd=Power%20toggle\n\n* http://192.168.178.99/cm?cmnd=Power%20on\n\n* http://192.168.178.99/cm?cmnd=Power%20off\n\n(if the local IP of my WLAN smart plug is 192.168.178.99)\n\nBut on the other hand I can also control them directly by my Amazon echo dot device (echo dot 4 in my case) after only once initiating a search for devices in my WLAN from the Alexa app (Android 10 smartphone in my case).\n\nMy WLAN router (fritz!box) is and always was configured to block ANY internet traffic for my delock sockets (delock smart plugs), so they can only communicate locally within my home network (WLAN).\n\nThis is the way it should be - no unnecessary 3rd party cloud or 3rd party account is needed.\n\n----\n\n*Statements by other users in this thread saying that a direct communication (in the WLAN) between Amazon echo dot and smart plug are \"not possible (because Alexa is not designed to work this way)\" are hence provably incorrect (probably due to incomplete knowledge of these commenters as to what Alexa Echo's different modes of operation are).*",

Main usage is music, timers, and a grocery list.\n\nOver the past few months, with nothing changing on our end, our shopping list is a mess.

Any changes made *locally* however, to the list on either of our phones (typing in an item, crossing off the list as we shop) is *not* synced.\n\nI made our list today by hand since I can't talk due to throat surgery. Cleared the 90+ items that were sitting there since crossing them off as we shop doesn't sync (I don't want to say I've gotten used to that but...) and proceeded to type everything out. 40ish items later, done, wife gets to the store and asks if I've made the list yet - she had a blank slate (since she crossed off the previous shopping trips as she shopped) but nothing I had added. I ended up sending her screenshots of the list rather than type it out again. Kinda ridiculous (And first world problem, I know, but still)\n\nAgain, nothing has changed on our end, but I did the usual song and dance of signing out and in on each phone, clearing caches, un/reinstalling, and every combination thereof, and nothing.

  "I've had my eye on a Studio for some time and thanks to the sale, a trade-in deal and Xmas voucher, bought myself one for a total of \u00a365 - not too bad.\n\nIn my setup I want to both stream music in a multi-speaker group (this works fine) but also have it as an auxiliary speaker for my PC, to boost the volume when I'm playing MP3s, Youtube etc.\n\nI'm having trouble with this second option. On my PC I have a virtual mixer, and initially set a 2nd output to be an optical cable running to the studio. Not synced at all.\n\nNext I tried a USB soundcard, with RCA to the 3.5mm jack. Still got an audible delay.\n\nNext I tried the headphone jack on my monitor, connected to the PC via DisplayPort. Nope.\n\nFiguring the issue was with the virtual mixer not being able to sync the outputs, I tried a physical mixer, main speakers on the main mix and the Studio connected to the headphone out. STILL getting a delay on the Studio's output. It's not enough that you'd notice it as the only audio device (still synced to lips on the screen etc) but you definitely notice it with both outputs up, as speech sounds (no pun intended) Echo-y.\n\nHas anyone noticed this before on a Studio? I got it to do an update straight out of the box, so there's no issue there. My use case is probably not too common so maybe it hasn't been run into before, but I thought I'd ask. If this is just \"how they are\" then I'm sure I can still find a use for it, but it's annoying as I had a grand idea of adding a stereo pair into a home cinema setup, but can't if they don't play nice with other cabled speakers.",
  "I have a few devices that can trigger an echo notification like blink cameras. I want to receive notifications on the echo in some rooms but I don't want it coming over say the one in my TV room, but I do want notifications on that echo for other apps.

  "**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called \"Everywhere Turntable\" specifically for that purpose, that includes the Link. Now I can use the \"Everywhere\" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue. Some comments claim to confirm the issue was fixed, but it most certainly was not.",

  "I bought an echo studio back in October 2020 and it has been an amazing purchase for the years I have had it. Recently however, I noticed a burning smell emanating from the base of the device, specifically within the crevice where sound is amplified. The smell was of burning rubber seemingly due to the overheating of whatever components are beneath it. \n\nGenerally, I have the device on at night for ambient noise (subscribed to ambient sounds). I have never had an issue up to today and am not sure how to go about resolving it. Unfortunately, my warranty expired in October 2022 and tech support was strict on keeping this policy. They were kind enough to offer a trade-in, with about a 15% discount. However, I feel this issue was not my fault as I have been running the device the same way for two years. Additionally, I feel this is a defect of the manufacturer's product, which not only may render the device useless, but also poses a critical safety hazard, with burning rubber leading to carcinogenic symptoms.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue with any of their echo studio/other devices?",

What is even more odd is it happens with my Echo Dots, Echo Show, and Fire TV Cube, but it does NOT happen through Amazon Astro.  I can't find any settings in either Kasa or Alexa that would be causing this.  The sound is like a quick little Asian-themed flute sound effect or something.  Very odd... never heard it before.

  "I got my 4th-gen Echo last week, and it seemed to work fine apart from a few software bugs that were fixed by restarting the device. I also set it up with my Fire TV Stick 4K Max, watched the Dolby demo video and I didn't notice anything wrong.\n\nTwo days ago, I noticed that when using the AUX input with my PC, the left and right channels were swapped, but I didn't think too much of it.  \nYesterday, I updated my TV Stick and set up Home Theater again (which took several attempts), but as I was watching a film on Prime Video, I noticed that the stereo sound was weird. Later, I had to set up Home Theater again; this time I paid more attention to the audio in the Dolby demo and indeed, it did sound like the leaf was in the opposite direction than what was shown in the video.  \nI then played many L/R sound test videos on YouTube on my TV Stick and they were all swapped. I did the same on my phone and laptop via Bluetooth and they were still swapped.  \nI tried the AUX output with my headphones while playing a test video via Bluetooth and it works fine, it's not swapped.\n\nThe Echo is in front of me (it outputs the left channel to its left, which is my right, and vice versa).  \nAlexa says the software is up-to-date, specifically on version 8289068676 (according to the app).  \nI have already tried resetting it several times and even setting it up using another account on a different phone.\n\nNow I'm not sure if it's a software issue, like a broken update or a setting I missed that somehow persists after resetting the device, or if the drivers are physically swapped or wired incorrectly and I hadn't noticed.  \nBefore contacting Amazon and potentially get it exchanged, I'd like to make sure it's just my Echo, but unfortunately, it's the only one I have and I don't know anyone who has the same model.  \nIf anyone could do the same left/right channel test and check the software version, I would really appreciate it.",

In the meantime, I'm boycotting media on the ES15 for the forseeable future.",
  "I have an amazon echo and echo show in my house hold. It started to play music randomly via spotify, even when i muted the voice option.

  "Alright so, my parents needed me to set up 2 ecobee thermostats to the house.\n\nI downloaded the app as instructed and connected both thermostats in a \u201cHome\u201d for the app. I then linked/integrated Amazon Alexa and connected the two, even downloading the required skills to use it. However, it doesn\u2019t seem to find/connect to the thermostat I have in the hallway - it only connects to the one in the kitchen.\n\nSo whenever I ask an actual Alexa or either of the two Ecobee thermostats to change the temperature/fan speed, it will only change it for the ecobee in the kitchen. It will not change it for both or for the hallway on its own. I\u2019ll ask the hallway thermostat to change itself to 73\u00b0F, and the separate air conditioning system I have in my house will prepare it for 73\u00b0F on the side of the house with the kitchen, not the hallway.\n\nTLDR; I start device discovery and only picks up one of the two thermostats, even when I have the thermostat app directly connected to Alexa. If I ask for a temperature change from either of the 2, only one of them will change but not the other. The thermostats seem to be connected by will not work together.\n\nAnyone know what I\u2019m doing wrong?",

  "My mother in law gifted us an Echo Show 8 so she can video chat with our kids (11 and 9). However, I\u2019ve never been interested in getting any sort of smart assistant or smart anything other than my phone for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that my kids have an incredibly hard time keeping their hands off of screens and tech left within their reach. I\u2019m concerned that they\u2019ll start randomly calling or messaging people, set random alarms to go off in the middle of the night, or order things from Amazon through the Echo.

  "I've been fiending for this update for months since it was announced. I got a Show 15 right away, assuming that it actually WAS a sort of reskinned FireTV and was disappointed to find out how limited it was in that regard. Was DELIGHTED when they announced the update and have been checking frequently ever since. Last week as it started to roll out, I started an obsessive compulsive update check regime, then realized that not only wasn't I getting it, I wasn't even on the same OS version as normies.\n\n\nEveryone I've sen getting the update online either had 7.5.5.5 - or didn't know and just discovered they were now on (confusingly!) 7.5.0.1 (is it normal for Amazon OS versions to regress numerically?) and magically had FireTV.\n\n\nI just got off Amazon help chat with \"Taeed\" who was actually zillions of times more on the ball than \"Matt\" who escalated for me, but also in a surprisingly nimble, helpful way. I lucked out. Here's what Taeed told me:\n\nIt's rolling out in waves, obviously.\nHe doesn't know the specific criteria, but he says it doesn't appear to be solely regional or geographical.\nThere are minor hardware variants between Show 15s, possibly just manufacturing batches with zero differences.\nThere are a couple of current OS versions, and it's possible that incremental updates got paused for this rollout - that would explain the inability to go from 7.5.5.4 to 7.5.5.5\nHe has been told that everyone with a properly working device in a region it's available should get it (hopefully) any time from now to no more than two weeks from now.\n\n\nHe caveats that he's simply telling me what he's been told, but that 7.5.5.4 people are not alone, and are probably more intelligent and attractive than 7.5.5.5 jerks. I may be editorializing a bit there.\n\nAlso, since I'm here handing out useless advice, here's some useful advice maybe....\n\nIf you don't want to spend absurd amounts on the official Amazon Show 15 table stand, just buy a tabletop picture stand. I got a pack of three for like ten bucks from Amazon and when in use, the stand itself is almost completely invisible and adjustable enough to sit at any angle from vertical back.\n\nI got my show 15 to connect with two Echo Studios and an Echo Subwoofer by first pairing them as a speaker group, then making a new DEVICES group featuring just them, then making them the default speakers using \"let Alexa choose\" option from the  iOS app (vs selecting speakers manually) -- I'm curious to know if that setup will support Atmos as it does via Fire TV 4k Max stick (and that setup now also handles eArc meaning I can use it as default Atmos for consoles etc via my receiver).",

I've tried playing longer music videos on YouTube and those don't seem to stay on the whole time either, although tbh I have not done as much experimentation with YouTube because it's more work to find those long  videos.

  "My aunt has very limited use of her hands and can't use TV remotes. She uses Amazon Echos, so I'm setting her up to be able to control her TV via Alexa, and everything is working other than volume control.\n\nSetup:\nTV - new TCL r655\nDongle - Firestick 4k\nAmazon Echo - normal cylinder one, not a dot, not sure what specific model/gen\n\nIn the Alexa app the TV itself is named TCL TV, the Firestick is named Living Room TV, and those 2 and the Echo are all set to the same room group. The Echo is set as the control device for the Firestick. HDMI CEC is turned on, and we can control TV on/off with Alexa through the Echo and control everything in the FireTV interface and apps so seems like CEC control isn't the issue. \n\nWe've tried basically every command combo we can think of for volume control and the Echo either doesn't respond at all or says the TV doesn't support that. I believe two times (one right after the other) the entire evening it did actually seem to work but we couldn't replicate it. Any ideas how we might be able to get this volume control to work?",

Located in Aus, unsure if bigger problem or just us. \n\nI first set up a profile for my son on Christmas day, enabled Amazon kids. Took over an hour and many attempts to set up his voice ID through the Alexa app. Once we did, all was good. A couple learning hiccups, but no problems. Until today. \n\nThis morning, Alexa broke. Every echo dot in our house stopped working for my son. We have six echo dots and all were giving him the same message every time: \"I'm having trouble, please try again in a little while\". Except Alexa still answers me with no problems.\n\nStandard troubleshooting; turn modem off and back on, then unplug dots one at a time, plug back in and let it reload. No success. She still wouldn't answer him in anything other than that one phrase. \n\nSo, we contact Amazon. Follow their instructions, delete his voice ID. Once deleted, Alexa responds to whatever he asks without problem. So suggestion was to set up his voice ID again in the Alexa app (kids account has to be done in the app according to the app). Except this time, the app won't even register that he's saying anything. At all. \n\nOur issue is being reported to the developers and we await instructions and update on a fix. In the meantime so that we have particular functions, I added an adult profile with his voice ID which works fine.\n\nAnyone elses Amazon kids voice ID broken? What country?",

But which ones to delete?\n\nI have an echo in my office which is right next to my son's room and his echo.  He has kids enabled on his.  Today he asked alexa to play a song and she wouldn't play it on his due to explicit content filter but she did play it on my echo in the adjacent room.  They are not part of a group.

  "I have bedtime playlists with songs I have uploaded or purchased via Amazon. There are some songs that were available for free on prime that would help the kids get their wiggles out. This is played on a device in \"kids mode\" which is supposed to give parents control of what kids can do or hear, and remove advertisements or suggestions. The routine used to be:\n\n1. Kids ask Alexa to play wiggle songs. **Result:** They hear some songs they really like and dance around like crazy while giggling.\n2. Parent asks Alexa to play one of the bedtime playlists for a set amount of time, then mute the mic so kids can't change what is playing. **Result:** The kids calm down to familiar music and drift off to sleep.  \n\n\nNow what happens:\n\n1. Kids ask Alexa to play wiggle songs. Alexa talks about how great it is that we can hear more songs now (an advertisement or suggestion) and decides to play something else it thinks they will like. They of course do not like it. **Result:** Kids get frustrated with Alexa and keep asking it to play the song they want. Parents shut it off because it there is no convincing Alexa to play the song they want to hear.\n2. Parents ask Alexa to play bedtime playlist. Alexa says it will play, shuffled with other songs it thinks we will like (an advertisement or suggestion). **Result:** Kids wake up in the middle of the night calling out for parents - either excited about a song that is not at all calm, or in protest of the song.  \n\n\nTech support says that they acknowledge that this is a bug. I don't think it should be playing any suggestions or advertising features in kids mode. I hope this is fixed or else I'm going to have to start using something like an old CD player for bedtime.",
  "Short background: we recently had to have a chat with our four-year-old about certain words you shouldn't use at preschool because a friend of theirs thought it was really funny how the teacher reacted when they started dropping F-bombs and other assorted swear words during class.\n\nThe story:\n\nThis morning while I was getting ready for work, my two-year-old was sad that I couldn't play. My four-year-old (trying to help out) took them to the other room and tried to play some of the two-year-olds favorite songs (they love to dance, especially to upbeat Latin music like salsa, reggeaton, etc.). \n\nThe next thing I know, I hear 4yo yelling \"Alexa stop\" several times before running into their room and slamming the door. 2yo starts crying because they were left alone, and I rushed out to see what was going on. The echo was playing some very explicit hip-hop that apparently is similar to the song the 4yo asked for.\n\nI got the song turned off, and found my 4-year-old hiding in their favorite \"I don't want to get in trouble\" spot, in tears. Thankfully, we were able to have a good chat about how it wasn't their fault, they were just trying to help, etc., and got them calmed down again. \n\nSo Amazon, thanks for freaking my kid out AND making it so I had to answer the question of why a song would both have bad words and talk so much about the \\*letter\\* D at the same time.  That's exactly what I wanted to do this morning instead of getting ready for work.",

  " In the era when people wish even their toddlers to be smarter than their neighbors, technology is aiming to fulfill every wish of the parents. And I think Snorble is one such device, aimed to make your kids smarter by teaching them a few things with time. \n\nSo Snorble is a kind of smart device that is meant for preschool kids and this is a kind of robot that comes with some powerful features. Powered by the MediaTek Genio 350 processor, this smart device has features divided according to the time of the day and if you switch to daytime mode, it would serve functions such as helping your kids perform countings and identifying colors.\n\nBesides, this smart device can initiate well-being practices such as yoga and meditation, and can also hold dance parties, play air guitar, create a fish face and also tell stories on demands by your kids.\n\nWhen you switch to night mode, your kid could get access to night lights. Soundscapes, can inform about breathing exercises and also tell bedtime stories. When in bedtime mode, it can offer reminders about wearing pajamas, brushing the teeth, taking a bath, saying prayers, etc.\n\nAnd when it\u2019s time to wake up, it would gently play an alarm and ask your kid to wake up. \n\nWell, this sounds so interesting that even though I do not have a kid, I wish to buy it and use it myself. Why did they not have such things when I was a kid? Anyways, parents must be worried about their kids using Snorble a bit too much and this is why it comes with a smartphone app that can help you control the usage of the device by your kids. \n\nOf course, kids will get fascinated by it and they might stay awake at night, trying to use it more. But as a parent, you can definitely control the activities. Do you think this will work for your kid?",

Recently he sent our child an Amazon Glow device to talk to him because we live in different states. I don't want to keep the device turned on at all times because it takes up a lot of space, I'm afraid it'll get broken due to having small children, and also he for years has instilled in me a concern about this sort of device. He sent us the Glow already set up and logged in to his account so I have never even seen what the interface looks like from the owner's standpoint aside from what my child uses. I always take it down and plug it in to let the kids call him, but recently he has become extremely persistent that he bought it as a gift and I need to keep it plugged in *at all times* even if I put it out of reach of the children, it needs to be plugged in. \n\nGiven his area of expertise, and all I know about him in general, this level of persistence to keep this device on all the time is extremely sus to me.

Well, is it possible to view the Amazon Music (AM) interface to browse music, save albums and songs to a library, create playlists?  From what I am seeing, is that this device does not do that.  We can talk to it and ask to play a particular artist or song.  The only browse capability are these stupid boxes that show generic stations or playlists. That is useless.  The kid is starting with a completely blank slate; he needs a way to browse and save stuff into his own library.  I can't even get him logged into the PC AM app because it won't let him.  He needs an account for those 13 and over and I can't create that because he needs a phone number to verify...which he does not have and I can't use mine because its connected to my account.

  "Hi all.  Just got off the phone with Amazon tech support for the last hour and half and I don't have much faith that my bizarre issue will be fixed so I'm asking here.  I often use Alexa reminders (I have 5 or so dots around the house and the Alexa app on my Pixel 6).  I had a non-repeating reminder set for last night about the kids back to school night and I received the text message (I have Alexa reminders send texts).  This morning I started getting the same Alexa reminder via text message from last night.  It comes from the number 58875 and it just says \"Reminder from Alexa: Back to school night\".  I've received about 100 of these same texts today at varying intervals.  Even more bizarre is that when I try to login to my Amazon account (via web, phone shopping app, alexa app) and I request a 2FA code via text, it sends the same reminder instead of the code.\n\nThings I've tried to fix it include, deleting all my Alexa reminders entirely (Alexa confirms I have none). Turning off/on Alexa text messages/notifications. Deleting the app from my phone, relogging into all amazon related applications, turning off 2FA from my Amazon account.  At this point I'm stumped.  Is there a way to reset all my dots/Alexa apps?\n\nI'd appreciate any suggestions...at this point I'm pulling my hair out with all the reminders Alexa keeps texting me.

  "My dad is in the early/mid stages of dementia and needs stimulation. Since his kids live far away, we can't visit as often as he and we would like, so he tends to withdraw from the world. I thought that a photo frame running a slide show of his life, including photos of his early life on the farm, life with mom (who has passed) and kids, travel photos, and outdoor photo would provide some stimulation.  With his memory loss, a large number of photos would provide \"new\" stimulation regularly.  \n\nThen I saw an ad for an Amazon-refurbished 2nd gen Echo Show 5 and realized it was cheaper and had more features than the photo frames I was researching.  The Echo Show had more features like scrolling the weather, announcing upcoming games, and more.  We won't use voice interaction because he'd need the volume much too high for the comfort of others.  Importantly, I could filter out all of the \"Try this!\" pages that would probably frustrate or confuse him.\n\nIt has worked great, and he really likes seeing the photos.  The 250 photos keep him stimulated, though he remembers more than I had anticipated, which is actually good!  The downside is that it's small and hard to see from his bed or chair.  (Few options for placement.)\n\nSo I tried a refurbished Echo Show 11 (2nd gen?  square/triangle shape) for a much larger image.  It works well for this, but has loads of the self-advertising \"Try this!\" pages that the Show 5 filtered out.  The Alexa app doesn't control the Show 11 in the same way, so this is less than optimal.\n\nIs there a way to limit the self-advertising \"Try this!\" slides in Echo Shows outside of the app or in setup on the unit itself?  \n\nIs there a larger (10-11\") Show that has better controls to limit the extraneous self-advertising prompts?\n\nThanks!",

The problem I ran into was, that a lot of the highly reviewed cameras on Amazon only display live view for 5 to 10 minutes. So out of frustration I ordered nearly 10 different brands, to test them, and see which would show an extended live view all night long. I tried googling to narrow down the brands, it seemed to be a common issue with very few solutions recommended. So I figured I would share my findings to hopefully help the next person with the same issue.\n\nCameras that displayed all night.\n\n* Lollipop baby monitor (my choice)\n* Wyze Cam v3\n* Wyze Pan/Tilt V2\n* Nooie 360 cam\n* Blurams Dome Lite 2k\n\nCamera that time out after 5-30 minutes. \n\n* Kasa Indoor Pan/Tilt\n* Blink Mini\n* Ring Stick Up Cam\n* Reolink E1\n* Eufy Pan/Tilt\n\nI've got a Yi Tilt/Pan still on the way. \n\nSo far I'm leaning towards just using the Wyze v3.

  "Dear Jeff Bezos,\n\nWhile in Second Life a few days ago (I am waiting for the new FO76 Season to begin, and have to do SOMETHING virtual) I heard a cover version of \"Rebel Rebel\" done by Pussy Riot. (Russian Punk female group--Putin had them locked up for 6 months for insulting him.)\n\nI decided to play it on my Echo, and here is what happened:\n\n***\"Alexa, play Rebel Rebel by Pussy Riot\"***\n\n***\"Playing Rebel Rebel by \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Riot\"***\n\nI kid you not--Alexa will NOT say the name of the group without bleeping out \"Pussy\".\n\nIt will however gladly say:\n\n***\"Playing What's New Pussycat by Tom Jones\"***\n\nAsking it who Pussy Riot is brings back a single chime non-response. Asking it what a pussy willow is brought the single same tone. (Alexa is ashamed to mention a type of tree by name???)\n\nShe will tell you who Dick Tracy is using his name... which seems somewhat Patriarchal to me.\n\nI did eventually get it to say the word \"Pussy\" using the following:\n\n***\"Alexa, play the Pussy Cat Song\"***\n\n***\"Playing the Pussy Cat Song by Asylum Street Spankers\"***\n\nAnd that is REALLY ironic because that song is a not-even veiled reference to the singer's private nether region.\n\nCome on Jeff, Pussy Riot is a name, just like Dick Tracy is a name. Don't auto-program Alexa to go all prude when a word which could be profanity but often isn't is used as a name. I mean, I get why Alexa bleeps out:\n\n***\"Here is You Put the \\*\\*\\*\\* in Country by The Saddle Tramps\"***\n\nI get that one--that one would make sense if I actually had my profanity filter turned on. Outside of Australia, that word is Defcon-1 profanity. It is always trying to be obscene.\n\nBut... Pussy Riot is a name. Just as is pussy willow. Also, Jeff old buddy, the primary meaning of the word \"pussy\" is \"cat\". Seriously, go to Wikipedia if you don't believe me.  (Where you will learn it also can mean rabbits and hares.) The second most common use is for someone who is timid or scared easily, as a variation of \"fraidy cat\".\n\nCome on--get your mind out of the gutter and unbleep \"pussy\" in Alexa's vocabulary.\n\nOr, start bleeping the name Dick when talking about men with that name.\n\nFair enough?\n\nPeace.\n\n**Addendum:** \n\nHave some fun--ask Alexa to spell \"pussy\", then ask it to spell \"dick\".\n\nYou can tell guys wrote these rules...",

  "I have 4 morning routines to keep my ADHD kid on track and reduce my impulse to nag.  Each one of those routines involves playing Disney Radio on Pandora.  \n\n\nSo, the 7:45 am routine connects to a BlueTooth speaker by his bedroom.  It plays a Good Morning message, the time, \\[used to announce weather\\], tells him the tasks he needs to accomplish by 8 am, then used to play music for 15 minutes.  After that, the routine has Alexa ask him if he's succeeded and reminds him to check in with me.  This used to be run through the Show 5, but is now run through an Echo Dot, since I relocated the Show 5 too far away from the BT speaker.  For the past week or so, the tasks are announced and then the routine goes silent.  No music.  After 15 minutes, it doesn't run the final part of the routine, either.    \n\n\nIt does work when I test the routine, just not when it triggers.  It also tends to trigger 1 to 4 minutes late.  \n\n\nThe other 3 routines run on the tall Echo, my oldest device.  The music streaming will trigger, though sometimes it randomly selects Disney Radio Chile(??) on the first Breakfast Routine.  It also fails to reset the volume to 5 once the music starts.  The second Breakfast Routine never selects DR Chile and I have that structured to break every 5 minutes for a reminder about how much time is left for Breakfast.  I don't like having 2 Breakfast Routines, but fusing them didn't work for some reason.  Finally, the Morning Clean-up/Get Ready for School Routine activates, changes to Kids Bop (ugh) and runs through perfectly.  Always on time.  No BT speaker for any of these Routines.  \n\n\nI don't feel like this is a problem with the BT speaker connection.  It will play music from Spotify, Pandora, and iHeart Radio from the Echo Dot at any other time of the day.  If I test the Routine, the BT speaker plays Disney Radio on Pandora.  \n\n\nI think the routine broke the same time I switched Alexa's default weather to Big Sky.  I deleted playing the weather from the routine, since the music wouldn't play afterwards.  Do I just need to re-write the Routine altogether instead of editing it?    \n\n\nIf anyone has any good Routines that help you or your family with ADHD challenges, please share!",
  "So I've had an Echo Show 10 in the kitchen area of my home for a few months now. My wife has had it and wants the show gone. \n\nThe problem is what shows up on the screen and our children. We have a few young children including one that can ready pretty well. (Sorry purposefully trying to be vague because this is the internet.) We keep having problems with things like:\n\n\\-Alexa showed a news headline about a school shooting awhile back. My oldest child read it and let the entire family know about kids shooting others at school and went on and on about it. This was not the way we wanted to inform our young children about these types of situations.\n\n\\-Alexa ad's for TV shows we don't want our kids to ever watch or really even know about\n\n\\-If I take a photo or screenshot something on my phone it's on the Alexa a day later. Which is fun for pictures of the kids. This is less fun when I screenshot a meme that isn't appropriate for children. (This I think I know how to control. But is still part of the problem.)\n\n\\-Kids ask for something benign like, \"show me a video with Dinosaurs\" and Alexas pulls up a video with Dinosaurs that is clearly not appropriate for children.   \n\n\nI haven't tried enabling a \"kids mode\" (I assume there is one) because the Echo is not just for the kids. I want it as a family device.\n\nIs the answer here just that an Echo with a screen cannot serve adults and children at the same time? Maybe the answer to that seems like an obvious \"yes\". But I don't think it is too much to ask to have an option to limit the types of ad's and other things an Echo Show will have up on the screen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - because of children, I would like an option to limit the types of ad's and other things an Echo Show will have up on the screen.

  "I'm hoping to get some feedback as to the user experience with Amazon's Echo devices, as I re-evaluate my smart home choices.  I know that this is the official subreddit for these devices, so I'm expecting a heavy bias, but I'm ok with that :)  How do two paired Echo's sound compared to a Echo Studio?  Is the studio worth the premium and does it ever go on sale?  How is the audio on the shows, compared to the echos and is the 10\" worth the premium (if I don't care about the moving monitor)?  \n\n\nLong story short, I have very little brand loyalty and simply use the best device for my application.  In my home, that means iOS for phones & tablets, Windows Desktops, Linux Servers, etc.  I had originally started down the Google Home route due to a couple of free give-aways and my investment in the Google eco-system.  For the last few years, I've been satisfied with them, but as of late I've been reevaluating my smart home decisions... which leads to point 2.  \n\n\nIn the last few months, I've made the time to start investing in setting up a smart home, specifically by using Home Assistant.  Previous to that, I had no plan and would just buy what was best suited to resolving my needs at that time (TP-Link Wifi plugs/switches, Caseta Dimmers, August Locks, and Nest Cams/Thermostats).  Now I'm trying to focus on the big picture as to what will integrate the best with Home Assistant, and is the most cost effective... which Google/Nest tends not to be.  \n\n\nAnyways, while I know both Assistants have their issues, my priorities are something that responds reliably, makes a good photo frame (the kids love it), and has good audio quality.  Nice to haves would be equivalents to Google's \"Animal of the Day\" for the kids, but this is not a deal breaker.  It would also be nice to be able to create speaker groups, and \"cast\" (or equivalent) to the devices.  At the present time, I'm using a Nest Thermostat (and likely will continue to do so), and Nest Cams.  Can these work with Echo?  The cameras will likely be replaced in the next few months, but for WAF, it would be nice if they were supported.  \n\n\nFinally, under the nice to haves.  I use a Shield as my primary playback device, and am wondering if it's possible to hardwire it into an Amazon Studio, or pair it with a set of Echo's?   \n\n\nAnyways, apologies for the long windedness and all the questions.

Then announce the weather after a while.\n\nI have a show used as a digital photo frame and have it set up to tell me the news as I get home. (Never found much use for the video calling unfortunately).\n\nA couple of standing lamps where not getting any use due to the socket being difficult to reach, so they are added.\n\nWe also use and echo upstairs as a bedtime timer for the kids.\n\nOtherwise the usual stuff, radio, recipes and timers. I have an extra smart plug, so wondering what other uses I could come up with.",

  "For example say, \u201cAlexa, play Girl from Ipanema.\u201d It always replies, \u201cHere\u2019s The Girl From Ipanema by Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim and Frank Sinatra on Amazon music.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all we\u2019ll and good, except that there are dozens if not hundreds of other versions of the song on Amazon music.

I did it like a week or two ago and haven't received a single suggestion (\"By the way, I can bla bla bla bla bla\") since I set everything to Kids Mode.\n\nBUT THEN TODAY all my Echos set to Kid Mode started a weird behavior where they started yelling RANDOM RESPONSES to my commands.  Like I just turned off my living room lights and she yells \"LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\"  Earlier when I told her to turn some lights on she yelled \"ZAPOWWWWW!\"\n\nAnyway, this is an open letter to Amazon:  You can't weird me out into going back into Adults Mode so I have to hear your ads and suggestions.

  "Last year, I bought a Echo Studio for my kids' playroom.  I didn't need anything amazing but wanted something that filled the room and sounded decent as we endlessly listened to toddler songs on loop.   I was able to pick up a Certified Refurbished one on Amazon for $120 and, for me, it has been a good value.  I think it is a pretty solid sounding speaker - enough so that I find myself sometimes going into their room to listen to my own playlists.\n\nUnfortunately, it has also highlighted how anemic the Echo Dot (gen 3) in our living room is.  We listen to music in this room much less often - but with some increasing frequency recently.  And the living room is on the same floor as the playroom, so it is sometimes nice to have some song from Gabby's Playhouse playing in both as the kids run back and forth.\n\nI was thinking about buying another Studio but can't find a new or Refurbished one for the same price.  I am a little hesitant to spend more for a speaker that is now 2 years old and will be used less often.  I was thinking about trying out one of the 4th gen Echos (full, non-dot) but don't have any experience with this spherical generation.  I am also drawn to the idea that, at some point down the road, I could stereo pair the Studios and maybe throw in a Sub.\n\nTL;DR: Would you still buy an Echo Studio today? Do you think it still represents a worthwhile upgrade over the newer generation Echos?",

  "TLDR: Does anyone know of Skills that will perform Announcements to other Amazon accounts not within our Amazon Household?\n\nLike many of you, I have had problems with Spotify and Amazon Household playing nice together. We now have 6 Alexa devices in our home with my wife and 4 kids. Here is the problem: Amazon has 3 kinds of profiles. 1 Normal, 2 Teen, 3 Child. Teen and Child are just profiles that are added to a normal Amazon account and not individual accounts themselves. We have Spotify Premium and each family member has their own account. You can only attach a Spotify account to an Amazon account, not a profile under an account (teen, child). Amazon Household can only contain two \"adult\" accounts. We could create normal ghost amazon accounts for the kids and attach their Spotify so they each can stream different music, but then we lose out out on some of the Amazon Household features, most importantly the Announcement feature (which we use often with a disabled family member using it to communicate messages across multiple device).\n\nThere is an option within Spotify to stream to a device and then add the Alexa as a bluetooth speaker. This is somewhat janky and I have had problems with it. This also makes it so the voice commands for Alexa to play music is not going to work. This option is definitely not very user friendly.\n\nDoes anyone know of Skills that can replicate the Announcement feature to send messages to other Amazon Accounts? This would be the cleanest solution for us as everyone could have their own device with their own Spotify account linked and be able to play different music on their own device at the same time. Thank you very much for your time and assistance.",

  "The situation:\nPreviously owned one Echo and one Nest Hub Max\nMy wife and I each have an Amazon account, we each have a Pixel phone, and we also have kids with Kindle accounts and one Echo for one of the kids. We are/were undecided between smart home systems as they each have positives and negatives.\n\nNow we've moved into a big four story townhome with fiber internet and two extenders, mesh wifi. We need to be able to talk between floors, intercom style, as well as control two different ecobees. Music, with different music on different devices simultaneously would be nice, and things like wake up routines.\n\nI thought we wanted Google Home, mostly because of the headache in having two Amazon accounts not properly combining as a household in the past. (Totally possible this is user error.)\n\nI bought four Nest minis, got frustrated by their limited routine powers, but eventually figured it out. Duo calling between floors, broadcasting between floors, play music, wake up kids routine, everything working.\n\nOn day 2, half the routines broke, some commands stopped working unless initiated from the device it's supposed to run on. Day 3 everything connected to an extender is completely non-functional even talking to the devices directly. Router config shows everything connected, as does Google home app. I tried disabling Ipv6 based on forum comments, but it didn't help.\n\nI'm considering returning the minis, buying four dots instead, and switching to Amazon. But I'm wary of trading one set of problems for another, so I'd like to ask here first.\n\n1. Does the Echo home system handle mesh wifi without breaking constantly?\n2. Can we set it up so two different parent accounts can all have access to all the same routines and devices?\n3. Can I enable child restrictions on the dots in the kids' rooms?\n4. What is going to annoy me that I haven't thought of yet?\n\nThanks in advance for anyone who can shed some light on the benefits of switching or not.",

  "[**\\*Edit: the Alexa help page has now been updated to reflect the new limitations.***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=GHKNDEFH7JCKX4DB)\n\n**TL;DR -** I just confirmed with Amazon Customer Service that soon Alexa-to-phone calling will be restricted to a pre-chosen list of no more than **10 contacts per Alexa user profile**, unless you have and link an AT&T Wireless or Skype account to your Alexa Communications profile.  Making 'Alexa-to-Alexa' calls (calling between Echo devices, the Alexa app, etc.)  will still of course be unlimited but if you want to call a landline or cellular telephone number you will only be able to choose from your set list of ten chosen contacts.  \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Full Details -** Moments ago I used Alexa to make a toll-free (1-800-number) phone call from one of the Echo Dots in my home, something I do daily/multiple times a day.  As soon as I finished my call and asked Alexa to \"hangup\" I was greeted with a \"By the way...\" notification/response from Alexa which told me the number I had just called was automatically added to my list of ten Alexa-to-phone contacts and to see the Alexa app for more information, to edit my list of ten contacts, or to link an account and still be able to make unlimited Alexa-to-phone calling from my Echo devices.  Confused I opened my Alexa app and was greeted with a \"card\" on the home screen telling me the same things/to click there for more info.  I use my Amazon Alexa devices as my primary outgoing house phone and have since 2017 on my 8 Echo Dots, four Fire HD tablets, and on various computers using the \"Alexa for PC\" Windows app.  I am disabled and being able to depend on using Alexa to make phone calls in my home on my numerous Alexa devices is vital and has been a lifesaver for me - literally - as I am occasionally prone to randomly falling asleep/passing out due to my disability.\n\n*(Long tangent example from a couple of years ago:*  *A couple of years ago this happened while I was showering - I woke up and found myself lying down in my shower in standing water with blood everywhere after having apparently blacked out/slammed my head into/cut a giant gash across my forehead on the sharp corner edge of my marble bathroom vanity sink countertop.  I was completely out of it (a CT scan later confirmed a concussion) and had probably been on the floor for 15 or 20 minutes and was too disoriented to get myself up from the floor.  My cell phone was nearby outside of the shower and I was able to pull myself over to it but the battery was dead and I was too weak and dizzy and bloody to get up and find the charger.  Fortunately I had my Echo Dot in there in that bathroom and so I began trying to get a hole of someone who might be able to help me (since you can't dial \"911\" using Alexa) but no one would answer my Alexa-to-Alexa phone calls (because most people I know who have this capability never really use this feature and would probably be totally confused receiving a call from me via it anyway). Fortunately, after calling numerous contacts from my linked mobile phone address book via Alexa I was finally able to get in touch with an old roommate/good friend and they rushed over immediately and raced me to the ER. I definitely called more than 10 contacts before someone answered.)*\n\nAnyway, the Alexa app said I could link my AT&T or Skype accounts if I wanted to still be able to make unlimited Alexa-to-phone phone calls.  Well that's fine and great, but I use Verizon Wireless as my cellular phone service provider and don't have an AT&T wireless mobile phone or account.  I continued reading through the details and \"More Information\" help sections provided in the Alexa App (text content and screenshots provided below) and then called Amazon Customer Support to see if this terrible news was really true.  While on hold I looked online to see if Amazon had made any press releases about these changes or if any news outlets/tech blogs had written anything about the new restrictive changes to making calls with Alexa but found nothing.  The Amazon representative I spoke with also knew nothing of these changes, nor did the developer/engineering team contact he reached out to as I waited on hold with him on the phone.  He looked through various internal channels/systems and couldn't find any information about these changes either and so I offered to send him screenshots of what I was seeing in my Alexa App and he thanked me and asked if I would please send them.  I sent them while on the phone and he shared them with the engineering team contact he had been talking with about this while I waited.  A while later he did confirm that he had found some information about these changes (basically just the same details that are given in the new help section about this in the Alexa App) and said he would try to find out more information and if he does learn any additional details he'll share them with me via phone or email in the next day or so. He said while it's not uncommon for Amazon to be absolutely terrible about sharing information about big changes/new features/various updates with their team members before going public with the info he did think it was odd that there was next to nothing announced about this and that I had already learned about these coming changes from the Alexa app and said that might have possibly been by accident and apologized.\n\nI hate this and wanted to share this with other Amazon Echo device/Alexa users.  I mean, I understand that it was a free service and that Amazon is not making any money (aside from revenue from the initial device purchase) by allowing people to place unlimited, free phone calls from their Alexa devices, but it's super frustrating for a core feature like this to be restricted without any advanced warning or announcement, especially at a time when most communication/telecommunication platforms and companies are adding *more* capabilities and features/free extra data/etc. to be helpful while we're all feeling and dealing with the challenges of living through a global pandemic.  Super upsetting Amazon would suddenly add restrictions.  I am fine with being required to link my cellular phone service provider account to my Alexa Communications profile/account if that's necessary to keep being able to effortlessly make outgoing phone calls using my Alexa/Echo devices, but if that's the case than other service providers that just AT&T need to be added.  Maybe AT&T is the entity here who pushed for these new restrictions, who knows...  ughhhh.  \ud83e\udd2c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Text/Details and** [**Screenshots of Details from the Alexa App**](https://i.imgur.com/4I11wev.jpeg)**:**\n\nAlexa-to-Phone Contacts\n\nThese are the phone numbers you can make unlimited mobile and landline calls to.

  "Ok I have searched and can\u2019t find exactly what I\u2019m looking for so I am coming to the Reddit experts. I have completely upgraded my home with WiFi switches controlling every switched device in the house and have great routines setup to automatically shut off the entire house lights and lock up the house once the kids leave for school every weekday along with bedtime routines.  Both our bathroom vents are on these switches as well and I am looking for a routine that I can setup that will automatically shut the bathroom vents off after 20 minutes anytime they are turned on.  Too many times I have woken up to vents on because either the wife or the kids have been up in the middle of the night and failed to shut the vent off.

  "This started happening last year when we were heavily reliant on reminders for my kids' virtual schooling.  All the reminders were set up in Alexa but they didn't go off consistently.  One might go of at 9am and then the one for 9:30am wouldn't.  If I had the app open, I could literally watch the screen change as the reminder that failed to go off moved to the bottom of the list as though it had.  Now we're down to just a couple of reminders since we're back in school and the morning one waking up my kids isn't going off regularly.  It'll move down the list as if it did but it doesn't, on any device.  It's annoying.  Any ideas?  I've deleted and re-created the reminder.  Doesn't work.

  "I think we may have uncovered a bug, and I'm looking for someone to verify. \n\nHere's the story. \n\nWednesday's are game night at my house. To make the game selection fair, we randomly pick a number between 1-4. The corresponding person gets to decide. \n\nWe used to put the numbers in a hat, but then we realized we could just ask Alexa to pick a random number between 1 and 4. \n\nAfter many tests, we started to realize 4 never gets picked. Now, we understand probability which we first tried to explain to the kids. There can be long stretches of no 4s, but it was really starting to get ridiculous.\n\nSo we lowered the sample set to a random number between 1 and 3, and again, Alexa was not including the higher number in the range when she gave us the result. \n\nNow, if you ask for a random number between 1 and 2, you will get 2, but that seems to be the only set that works. \n\nThe way we phrase it is, \n\n\"Alexa, pick a random number between 1 and 3.\"\n\nOh, and yes, 1 does get selected. It just seems to be the upper limit that is ignored in any set greater than 2.",

We have the same lights and smart switches. Both accounts should have full access or even it should at least remember after a confirmation.",
  "I've been dealing with this for years, but every now and then, I forget which strategies I've tried, and I get caught up in trying to fix it again.  Maybe Spotify and Amazon devs have finally solved mankind's greatest computer science problem of the 21st century.  \n\nSo, I have like 10 echo devices throughout the house.\n\nTwo adults (and some young kids) in the house.\n\nSpotify Family plan\n\nAmazon Household\n\nNow, what I want is for Alexa to utilize 3 different Spotify accounts:  mine, my wife's, and a \"default family\" account.  I want to be able to switch Alexa profiles (either by voice recognition or asking specifically to switch profiles) so I can make Spotify requests from the 3 different accounts.  Most of the time, I'd expect the generic family Spotify account to be active throughout the house, but I also want different people to be able to listen to different music in different rooms.   \n\nIt works fine for my wife (her spotify account linked to her Alexa voice profile and Amazon account in our household).  I have my Amazon/Alexa account linked to the third \"Alexa\" (default home) Spotify account, so that my personal recommendations don't get trashed in Spotify by kid songs and whatnot.  \n\nBut that means I have to manually log out and log in to two separate Spotify accounts on my phone when I want to listen to my stuff (e.g., in the car), and I can't cast my Spotify to Alexa speakers without logging out and logging back in to the Alexa Spotify account (thus losing my own playlists and podcasts and whatnot).\n\nI can't add more than two adults to an Amazon household.\n\nI can't log in to the Alexa app with an Amazon teen account (I tried today to create a teen account and link the third Spotify to that one, no dice).\n\nErgo, I can't manage three Spotify accounts with Alexa seamlessly across all of my devices.  Right?\n\nIt's infuriating.  Amazon, let me have more than 2 adults in a household.  Let me create an Alexa profile for a teen (so I can hack a solution).  Let me create a non-human account/profile for just this purpose.\n\nSpotify, let me link two accounts to Alexa in such a way that I can use Voice or device casting for one, and then I'd be okay with just device casting for the other.  Let me more easily switch among multiple Spotify accounts on my phone.  \n\nI'm not missing anything, right?  There's just no priority on the Product side to solve for this use case.  I know it's an incredibly common request.  There are multiple clear paths to making it work *well enough for my needs*.  smh",
  "New to the echo ecosystem and am setting up some routines and home automation. One of the things I would like to do is have all the speakers in the house begin playing music at 6:30 am each weekday to help set the mood and atmosphere of the house as the kids get ready for school. Kind of like a whole house alarm.\n\nI'm having trouble with setting the routine across all speakers, but that's a separate issue.\n\nOne of the a annoyances is the Respond from Device portion of the routine. I don't want a response. At all. I don't need one of the speakers saying \"OK\" when the routine kicks off.\n\nIs there a way to bypass that portion of the routine? I don't want to enable brief mode because I do like the responses when I am speaking to Alexa. I just don't want it when routines kick off on a schedule.",
  "Realize this is a bit off-topic, feel free to delete if not allowed. \n\nJust like voice and other features of Alexa keep getting watered down, made worse, or \"commercialized\", it feels like the Fire platform is going the same route. Just in the last week, some bright bulb over @ Amazon HQ thought it would be a nifty idea to stop displaying descriptions of Movies and TV shows in their top level UI, in favor of showing a prompt that the media could be \"watched now\"?? Yeah no kidding, you're a streaming device. So instead of being able to browse freely to decide what to watch or rent, we now have to tap into each thumbnail just to see a description (then back out if you decide not to watch it). \n\nAdd insult to injury, a few weeks back they redesigned the entire interface to bury your library - aka things you've decided you want to watch later. Before it was proudly displayed on the home screen, now it's buried two clicks deep. All under the guise of pushing more ads. The upshot of both of these changes is that I haven't rented a movie on the platform in weeks. I'm back to just Netflix, Hulu, or HBO. \n\n*If you make it hard for me to spend my money with you, I won't.*\n\nHonestly 2-3 years ago I was a massive fan of the Fire and the entire Alexa ecosystem. But now? This might be the final straw to get me to start de-Alexifying my setup (in favor of AppleTV/HomeKit, Zigbee, Sonoff, Flic, etc). Anyone else see changes like this? I'm honestly at a loss how Amazon appear to be systematically giving their own customers motivation to look elsewhere. \n\n***/rant***",

  "Need some help here, sorry if this is a repeat.\n\nI have 5 Echo devices, 3 original echoes and 2 dots (We'll call them E1, E2, E3 and D1, D2 as shorthand). I live in a normal sized house with fantastic wifi coverage and internet. I pay for the \"family\" plan b/c I am obsessed with always having music in the area I'm in, and my teenage daughter takes after me, always needing music playing, so we have the family plan to play our different music wherever we are without stepping on each others' toes.\n\nA few months ago, while doing chores and listening to E1, I thought she was playing a prank on me, as she asked to play a song on D1 a few rooms down and suddenly my song stopped and started playing her music. I stopped Alexa on E1, started my music back, only to a few seconds later have daughter's music streaming to my device again. Since I use music to help me zen out, this was extremely jarring and I ended up getting irate at her, only to find out she wasn't trying to play her music as a prank in my room. Whenever she asked D1 to play music, it started playing in E1. So we started doing some troubleshooting.\n\nWhenever any E device is playing, if any OTHER D device asks to play music (NOT on an Everywhere group, and NOT within earshot), it will commandeer the E device. Its entirely possible it works the other way as well, since I tried playing music from E3 right after this happened, only to have NO music come out after Alexa's audio confirmation she was going to play music. I recently found out its every device, as my son started playing music last night from D2 and it interrupted my music in E3 (other ends of the house, absolutely no way one can \"hear\" the other). We no longer have an everywhere group, yet this still happens, Amazon has no help for me. I've unplugged and factory reset all device, yet it continues. Nothing ruins my ability to relax and zone out like a sudden interruption of music only to hear my kids' songs playing in my room.\n\nAnyone have ideas or advice?",

  "Amazon Echo products have gained quite a popularity over the years and it is not just limited to a few certain countries like the developed ones or the ones we would naturally expect to be using such products like here in the US, Europe or the Gulf countries but I have witnessed a larger growth of these Echo products across the globe and it has even penetrated into the markets of countries like India, Japan, China so on and so forth. There are many such products out of the Amazon Echo line that helps make a home, a smart home and a few that one can use even if you do not have a smart home. One common thing that I have witnessed amongst these Echo products is the fact that most of them are powered by Mediatek chipsets therefore it wouldn't be wrong to say that Amazon Echo products and Mediatek does make a great team together. Two of such Amazon echo devices that has impressed me the most would be first of all, the Kids Edition with the Tiger and the Panda prints. It is hard to say if I like it more because of how well it works and how well it is equipped for the use of kids or more because of the prints per se. I like the tiger one. Just saying! The other device would be the Echo Show 10. It has now got a motorized neck which is really cool. Works well for watching movies around the house or for video calls. The camera shutter is a great addition for privacy concerns. The use and practicality of this product is immense. I have one at home and you don't need a smart home to use one of these which increases its productivity and usage a lot more.

  "TL;DR: Elderly father can't hear when there is an incoming Echo Call or active Drop In session. Need a visual cue triggered by an automation (routine).\n\nMy father is in an assisted living facility and doing very well there. The Echo Show 10 we got him has worked wonderfully to keep remote family member, myself included, in touch with him in a very low-friction way. In fact, the \"Drop In\" capabilities allow him to do nothing to converse with us other than knowing that the call is active.\n\nAnd that is sometimes a problem...\n\nLike many people in their 90s, his hearing is mostly shot. So throughout the day he moves closer to the TV to better hear it without blasting the volume throughout the facility. Unfortunately, this moves the Echo Show from his sight line and he doesn't notice when someone drops in. Countless times I've been able to see the back of his head and see him watching the TV while blissfully unaware that I'm calling him.\n\nI understand that a solution would be to move the Echo Show next to the TV, However, this is really a nightstand device for him. He spends more and more time in bed and we've set it up to display a running slideshow of kids photos, old family photos, vacation pics, etc... Moving it across the room, while solving one problem, would diminish the usefulness of the Show for many of its other features.\n\nWhat I would really like is a \"visual cue\" for when there is an incoming Echo Call or when Drop In is active. I can easily put a ZigBee or WiFi enabled bulb in a corner lamp that he could see from anywhere. What I can't find is a trigger to fire the automation (Routine).\n\nThoughts?",

  "We have an Echo dot and an Echo (I\u2019m new to both). My little kids keep the Dot in the basement and often blast the music. I want to be able to turn down the volume on the Dot via the Alexa app. But when I select the Dot in the app and try to move the volume slider, it won\u2019t move. Just stays on whatever current volume they have it set on. Am I missing something? Are there any workarounds?",
  "I know these conversations have been had on here already, but I couldn\u2019t find an answer. Feel free to redirect me if it exists, but we have an Apple Music Family subscription. We have 4 echos dots that are all currently registered to the same Amazon account. MY account. We have four family members, one who is under 13 so can\u2019t have an Amazon account, even on Household. \n\nI see no way to have the Echos link to the Apple Music account for each family member, and I am not sure there is even a good workaround for that. I can set three dots up individually with Amazon accounts for each user, but not all four because one of my kids are under 13, so one would have to share and that mixes up all the music preferences for two people. It also nixes the \u201dannounce\u201d feature which is kind of handy for a family. I know you can drop in, but announce is better for some things. \n\nWould it be easier if we switched to Amazon Music? Would voice profiles work to let us curate and play playlists for each individual family member based on the voice the echo recognizes? I feel like there should be a solution for this by now. It is great that the Echo supports Apple Music, Spotify, etc, but it really only supports it for one user Per device.",
  "So.....\n\nWe have an echo dot in the dining room, and then 3 echo dots in each of the kids bedrooms (they are 7, 8 & 10). They all want to stream their own music at the same time. Am I right in saying the only way around this is to get the Amazon family plan? \n\nFurther to this though, it says you need a separate account for each child and that they should be 13 years or older? Is this really the simplest way to do this? Seems crazy I have to do all this just to play different music. I'd happily pay the 14.99 but I'm not happy about having to set up all those accounts for my kids.\n\nPlease tell me there is another way!",
  "So we've had an echo kids edition for well over a year and just got a second one. We re enrolled in Kids+ (Freetime Unlimited) which includes access for up to 4 echos.\n\nThe problem is in trying to get Alexa to read a book via audible.

The device is currently located wit my grandma - she's super old and not great with tech, so the echo has a great albeit limited purpose - the \"drop in\" feature. It allows all of us (her kids - around the world) to chat with her without her having to really do anyhing (except respond) to activate the call.  It's honestly been a godsend and she absolutely loves it because it makes her less reliant on whoever she's staying with to make / receive calls, and it has been really nice talking to her more often.\n\nRecently, on a few of our phones, in the alexa app, the device now shows as offline. Others are able to drop in just fine. Does anyone know what might be causing this? FWIW we're all logged into the same account the device is registered to on the app to make dropping in easier. I'm hoping theres a easy ish soluton because the device is now at my aunt's where my grandma is staying and she herself isn't great with tech so i fear any extensive troubleshooting might be beyond her.\n\nAny help woul dbe appreciated!",

  " Echo Show requires a smartphone to set it up for voice/video calls, because that's done only through the Alexa app, which is only available for mobile, not desktop. This I discovered after buying 2, one for me and one for my elderly Mom to use for video calling. We (her kids) are all buying them so she, who has been in lockdown in her senior apartments since March, can see her kids, grandkids, and great grandkids. Mom is not computer savvy whatsoever and does not have a smartphone, which is why she can't use FaceTime or Hangouts or whatever. We thought this would be the perfect solution and were fine buying extra hardware just for this purpose.\n\nSo the fact that Mom is supposed to have a smartphone to run the Alexa app to set this up is not mentioned anywhere in the Echo Show promotional and product pix/text on Amazon's page. So so so aggravating.\n\nI have mostly gotten around it by logging out of my Alexa app on my phone and logging in as her (she does have an Amazon account, which I set up too). Still it was a frustrating 2 hrs yesterday afternoon trying to set both up and test the video calling so I could bring hers over as a fait accompli (only need to switch network to her building's wifi). I haven't done that yet, wish me luck. \n\nOne crucial thing during setup was that even logged in as her on the Alexa app, the setup insisted it needed her phone number to send an SMS to, and she needed to report the verification code in the SMS.  Luckily she has a senior phone that can receive SMS's (which she never uses), so I stepped her through finding it and telling me the code they needed. \n\nI'll be putting this in my review on Amazon (fat lot of good that'll do), but does anyone here use the Echo Show for video calling an elderly, non-computer-using relative? Did you discover any secrets or workarounds? My next task is how to set it up so can say \"Alexa, call Zanhoria\" and it'd call my Echo and not my phone. I don't think that's possible. She'll have to say \"Alexa, call Zanhoria's Echo Show device\" per my testing. sigh.",

Am I overlooking some simple error or is this just an \"Alexa thing\" that has no current solution?\n\nPS: I previously had the Sleep Jar \"Rain Sounds\" skill set to play for that routine but for some reason it no longer works, the Alexa lights up like it's processing and then doesn't do anything",
  "I like to hear the hourly news update from NPR from time to time. I would just say \u201cAlexa, play the latest news from NPR\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what would happen. Great for something to hear as you turn off the light and close your eyes to go to sleep. \n\nHowever, they keep changing this behavior. It now plays detailed news stories after the brief. This happened once before and I don\u2019t know what I had to do to get it to go back. \n\nI don\u2019t want the flash briefing because Alexa will add stuff like \u201cthat\u2019s all for now\u201d at the end, and the Alexa voice is louder than the NPR stream... which is jarring if you\u2019re dozing off. \n\nAnyone have any suggestions on how to restore the \u201cold\u201d behavior?",
  "I have 6 echo shows and they haven't updated in months. I try to force the install and it says preparing but after about a minute, goes to the home screen.  After doing this 4 times, it then tells me I'm up to date but nothing was installed. I've factory reset, unplugged, you name it.  Router has been reset and devices are close to the router.\n\nI also have an echo studio that took 3 tries but eventually updated.  Any advice?",
  "Skills where I can either test my knolledge, or I can learn a daily fact\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used too (Still do?), play super quiz of the day, but I'm tired of it now because  the questions just repeat themselves.",
  "I got the Show 5 because it came free with a smart TV (Whole other rant about that). I have it setup, but basically lobotomized. The camera hard cover stays on and the hardware switch for microphone stays red. I went through the settings and turned off everything display wise except Weather.\n\nThing is, Alexa keeps popping up. I don't fucking care about the weekly trivia game. You can't add cookies to my cart because that shit isn't linked. I get my local news from somewhere else.\n\nWhat I want? Time and Weather. That's it. Any way to accomplish this?",
  "There actually used to be a lot of these. Drivetime Trivia, Nine Lives Trivia (previously in the US now only in Canada)...\nNow I only know of Trivia Blast. If we can't have immersive human voices, at least give me music and sounds throughout.\nEspecially games that make me pay a monthly subscription to play unlimited games etc. Nine Lives Trivia had multiple choice, and updated questions every week and that's something I like.\nThanks.",
  "**TL;DR**Say \"Alexa, open Silk\" - then type the following URL into the browser:\n\n[myecho.show](https://myecho.show)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More info:**\n\nI personally don't mind the Echo Show's screen saver however there are some parts that are kind of annoying...such as suggesting I open the \"Cat Trivia\" skill (that I maybe opened 4 years ago), non-stop for over a month now!.....take the hint, I don't want to open it!\n\nHowever....there have been a lot of complaints particularly regarding the \"Alexa For Your Day\" feature. People want more flexibility to be able to customize the screen saver experience.\n\nAfter a lot of research and testing different methods of trying to get a screen to continuously show I realised it was an extremely difficult task to achieve. The Echo Show is very locked down!\n\nI tried creating a Skill which worked but it meant you wouldn't be able to set timers at the same time (because this ends the Skill's session).\n\nIn the end, after a lot of testing the best way was to create a website! To get something up quickly I made a simple interface permanently showing the time and date.\n\nTo try it, ask Alexa to open Silk and then type the following URL into the browser [myecho.show](https://myecho.show)\n\nHint: Bookmark the site for easier access next time :) Using a website means you can still set timers and ask Alexa some other things without the browser closing...however, opening another Skill may make the browser time out and you'll need to open the site again in Silk.\n\nWould love to hear any feedback",
  "Hi all,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeen away from this skill for a few months, but tried to play last night and noticed it no longer works on the Echo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe unique thing about Drivetime is the fact that it has new games everyday, and it's all recorded by human hosts, bypassing the alexa voice all together. Each episode is at least an hour long to correspond with commute drives but is also nice for those of us, say, who are blind and want a unique trivia game to relax to at home on a quiet evening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnybody know of unique trivia games like this, with full, immersive audio? One complaint I have is that they use covers for music introductions for all games, but other than that it's unique in the voice game space.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurious to know if there's demand for more games like this, or whether people are just content with the alexa voice and the games to be primarily text-based.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso looking for more games like Starfinder, where again, full immersion audio is the name of the game. Earplay has dropped the ball on their content :( it looks as though they were going to be the pioneer in the voice game space with Codename Cygnus.",
  "I often use this command in the morning to hear the random news or trivia Alexa offers, but for the past few days she has also included today's weather: current temp, high and low for the day, and the precipitation chance. It's a nice addition!  \n\n\nIs she learning from my frequent requests for the weather or is this simply a new addition to the built-in \"Alexa, Good Morning\" prompt?",

  "Hey everybody.\n\nI've got a new skill coming out on the UK and US Alexa stores.\n\nIt's a football (soccer if you're across the pond) themed trivia quiz, which has been a huge success on the Italian store far. We managed to recreate the football atmosphere with proper sounds, graphics and game mechanics.\n\nEvery day you can challenge another Alexa user to check who knows more about the game \u26bd\n\n[Here's how the skill looks like on the Echo Show.](https://imgur.com/1wG33sh)\n\nI'm currently looking for a few beta testers to get early access to the skill and test the UK / US versions.\n\nWho's interested?",
  "I bought my first ever smart assistant device a week ago, and I went for the Echo Dot because it was considerably cheaper than the Nest Mini (although more than the Google Home mini), and soon after, I purchased a smart LED bulb to control with Alexa.\n\nAlexa is fine at controlling my lights, giving me the weather and my news, but for many other things she seems to fall disappointingly short. I was absolutely shocked to find that she cannot give cycling or public transport directions/information, and far too often I get garbage responses when I ask basic trivia questions. I must say the audio quality for such a cheap and small device is impressive, however.\n\nAfter watching many YouTube demos, I can see that Google Assistant is much better than Alexa in the areas I have listed as problematic above, but I am an iPhone/iPad/Mac/Apple Podcasts user and Amazon seems to play much more nicely with Apple, although here in the UK we still don\u2019t have Apple Podcast support.\n\nAnyway, I guess I\u2019m just looking for reassurance as to whether I\u2019ve made the right choice or not, and whether anyone knows about Amazon looking to introduce richer web search and transport capabilities in the near future.\n\nThanks for your help :)",
  "I have a skill called Popcorn Quiz, which is a movie-based trivia skill that competes you against other Alexa players.\n\nI'm improving the accompanying display to take better advantage of modern, hi-res screens that come with newer Alexa devices.\n\nIf anyone is interested in being a 'beta tester' and having early access to play along, please let me know.

  "I was one of the lucky ones to get an Echo Auto when the glitch was discovered.  I finally got to play with it a bit and I LOVE it.  My car does NOT have Apple Car Play (Nissan said I would have to replace the head unit for around $4,000).  I do have a Bluetooth connection on my car, so setup was less than 5 minutes.  \n\nI found the interface was just as easy as my Echoes at home.  I LOVE being able to easily play songs.  My son had a blast playing Disney song trivia and Hunt the Yeti in the car and the family played a great game of Jeopardy.  We tested how accurate her directions were when we asked for directions to \"the closest Krispy Kreme\" and she easily sent them to my Apple phone/Apple watch navigation.  She was also able to easily send a voice message to contacts in my phone.\n\nThe one issue we has was asking her to place a call.  She would respond with \"I found a contact named 'mom', would you like me to call that contact\" and then respond with \"I'm unable to do this at this time\".  I'm not sure if I don't have a setting enabled, or if there is an issue with making voice calls.\n\nOther than that, for $25, it's the best purchase I've made in a long time!",
  "Podcasts, ebooks, music, newscasts.  You ask, she says \"Playing \\[whatever you asked for\\]\", and then silence.\n\nOver an HOUR later, I get \"Sorry, I'm having trouble playing music\".\n\nInternet connection and wifi 100% operational and stable during this time, in use on other devices including a 1st Gen Dot, which has no problem playing my music or podcasts or anything else right now.\n\nThe Echo itself remains connected to the Internet and provides any content that can be spoken by Alexa.  Weather, trivia games, the time, timers and reminders, all that still work fine.  No other content is available no matter what I do.  Yes, I've unplugged her for a good 20 minutes just to be sure.  Same problem afterwards.\n\nThe last time this happened, I factory reset it.  At which point it adamantly refused to connect to any wifi network for 2 full weeks before miraculously connecting on its own after being set aside for over a week.  I pulled out all the stops on that one - factory resetting and flashing my router, switching channels, even a backup router, the Guest network, taking it to a friend's place, NOTHING would bring that thing back online.  Every attempt purple-ring failed.\n\nThe thing is not a recent order, and refurbished (bought through Woot, which Amazon owns now IIRC).  How do I get them to make this obviously defective thing right?  Or have I just wasted my money?",

  "The original post is by  [u/oh\\_man\\_oh](https://www.reddit.com/user/oh_man_oh) and has been archived. I found it via google. Couldn't even find it via the search on here when I was looking for some awesome Flash Briefings lol. This is the most bad a$$ post I've seen on Flash Briefings so I just had to reshare!!! I apologize in advance if some of the formatting doesn't come out perfectly. 90 Seconds With Slate is no longer available. I know the original post is a year old but I found it 100% relative to me today so I thought it would be to others as well :) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nEver since I've got my Amazon Echo, I've been searching for the ultimate set of Flash Briefing skills. Seasoned Alexa-users are probably aware of some of the best briefings \u2014 NPR, BBC, and Fox News \u2014 and they've probably found a bunch of garbage Flash Briefings; most Flash Briefings are garbage. However, among the swamp of crappy Flash Briefings, I've found a few staples and a few hidden gems.\n\nFor those who are just starting with Alexa and those long-time Alexa users looking for a hidden gem, here's a quick summary:\n\n**The Staples** \\- For those who are new to Amazon Echo and Alexa\n\n1. [NPR Hourly News](https://www.amazon.com/NPR-Hourly-News-Summary/dp/B01K07MU64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) \u2014 Well-produced news with a US focus\n\n[BBC](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-BBC/dp/B01JHLI06S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487536887&sr=1-1&keywords=bbc) \u2014 Smart reporting on world news\n\n3. [Fox News](https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-Channel/dp/B01M5EIW2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) \u2014 Great production value, great news, but suffers from an annoyin ad in the middle.\n\n**The Hidden Gems** \u2014 The best Flash Briefings off the beaten path\n\n1. [Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day) \u2014 A sardonic host explains new words and gives highly entertaining ways of using them in a sentence; great production value, hilarious, and you'll learn some new words. Do yourself a favor and enable Word of the Day.\n2. [90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate) \u2014 Refershing Flash Breifing about the news; the host delivers a very short news summary with panache. You definitely can't sleep through this news report.\n3. [Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up) \u2014 A short Flash Briefing that tells the story of startups; it's consistently solid, and, occassionally, it will give you a story you'll think about for the rest of the day.\n\nFor those of you who are on the lookout for more specific Flash Briefings, I've compiled all my reviews of Flash Briefings by topic below. I generally put better Flash Briefings at the top of each category and the worse ones toward the bottom but there are a few places where I don't quite know how to order the Briefings, so don't take the ordering too seriously. You'll likely notice a theme: The best Flash Briefings have a human host, do not run too long or too short, and do not have ads. I also tend to prefer Flash Briefings that have a bit of personality \u2014 dry deliveries put me to sleep.\n\n***THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO FLASH BRIEFINGS***\n\n**General News**\n\n[NPR Hourly News](https://www.amazon.com/NPR-Hourly-News-Summary/dp/B01K07MU64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is one of the most consistently well produced Flash Briefings. Clocking in at 5 minutes, the news summary is just long enough to be substantial and comprehensive, but not so long as to be annoying. The mix between headline news and summaries is just right, and NPR has left the advertising out of the briefing.\n\n[BBC](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-BBC/dp/B01JHLI06S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487536887&sr=1-1&keywords=bbc)\n\nJust like NPR and Fox News, this Flash Briefing stands out as one of the most well produced. However, what really sets the BBC apart from the other two is that the BBC covers different stories \u2014 often less US-centric stories. If you have multiple US news Flash Briefings, the BBC can be very refreshing and introduce you to some news stories you haven't yet heard about. I'd highly recommend it.\n\n[Fox News](https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-Channel/dp/B01M5EIW2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is among the better news Flash Briefing skills. You'll get a full view of US news from a human presenter. The biggest problem is long, annoying ads they run. BBC and NPR don't run ads and have similar content. The other problem is the volume: it's all over the place. The main host is significantly louder than the correspondents who speak with him. That being said, it's only mildly distracting, especially compared to the ad. In total, if you are trying to figure out which news Flash Briefings to use, give Fox News a shot.\n\n[90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate)\n\nA real human, Mike Pasca, reads 2 or 3 news stories with panache. I really love how the presenter reads the stories; sometimes he'll say something like \"We've got two stories for you today \u2014 one that matters and one that does not.\" You definitely won't sleep through this Flash Briefing. There is an ad at the end, but it's the least annoying ad I've seen in a Flash Briefing so far. Overall, I'd say give this Flash Briefing a try and see if it's for you.\n\n[theSkimm](https://www.amazon.com/theSkimm-Inc/dp/B01JM6TN8M/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537954&sr=1-1&keywords=theSkimm)\n\nFor those who don't know, theSkimm is a daily email that sends you a short news briefing. This Flash Briefing just has Alexa read that email. It's better than most Flash Briefings where Alexa reads the news, but it still is far from the best Flash Briefing. I'd recommend passing on this as NPR and BBC are much better.\n\n[Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Quartz/dp/B01M278ZFA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538052&sr=1-1&keywords=quartz)\n\nAlexa reads the news. The writing is actually pretty good, but without a human reading the news, it's not worth it. There are tons of competitor that were a human host reads the news.\n\n[Refinery29: 8 Things You Need to Know This AM](https://www.amazon.com/Refinery29-Things-Need-Know-This/dp/B01JHR7TK0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537988&sr=1-1&keywords=refinery29)\n\nAlexa reads Refinery29 headlines. It covers a wide swath of topics, from Health to LGBTQ News. Refinery29 does not cover any of these stories in more than a sentence, so the Flash Briefing is short and uninformative. My suggestion is that you should leave Refinery29 out of your morning routine.\n\n[BuzzFeed News](https://www.amazon.com/BuzzFeed-News/dp/B01MQR7Y5D/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538110&sr=1-1&keywords=buzzfeed)\n\nAlexa reads BuzzFeed headlines. This is possibly the worst Flash Briefing made by a large company that I've seen. Isn't BuzzFeed supposed to be better than the average media company at creating content for digital platforms?\n\n**Business News**\n\n[CNBC Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/NBCUniversal-CNBC-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01N7FH24X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is the best business news Flash Briefing. A real human reads the business news headlines with a short explanation. Every day it covers interesting sales numbers, mergers, and trends. The length of the Flash Briefing is about right. I'd highly recommend adding this to your Flash Briefing.\n\n[Motley Fool Stock Watch](https://www.amazon.com/The-Motley-Fool-Stock-Watch/dp/B01KG5YXS8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538317&sr=1-1&keywords=motley+fool)\n\nThis is a very short interview with a stock expert on a recent topic. I find it informative and very digestible \u2014 a good way to learn interesting tidbits about what's going on in different sectors of the economy and the stock market.\n\n[Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is just a short business story read by a human. This generally isn't a headline story, so the stories are somewhat refreshing, and the delivery is pretty good. There are not that many good options for business news in the Amazon Skill store, so if you are in need of more business news, give Level Up a try.\n\n[Econoday U.S. Economic Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-U-S-Economic-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01MEBW3T0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538474&sr=1-1&keywords=econoday)\n\nEconomic news read by Alexa. It's too long, but it isn't one of those Flash Briefings that never end. If you absolutely must have news about the Fed and stock market in your Flash Briefing, Econoday is for you. However, it's not very good, so I'd say pass.\n\n[Econoday Global Market Update](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-Global-Market-Update/dp/B01MDPRG23/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538529&sr=1-2&keywords=econoday)\n\nAlexa reads how the stock, money, and commodity markets changed since the last day and reports basic news. I would not recommend this Flash Briefing to anyone who doesn't have a job in finance (and I wouldn't even recommend it to most financial professionals).\n\n[The Economist](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-The-Economist/dp/B01JHLMNWU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538580&sr=1-1&keywords=economist)\n\nDon't bother including this in your Flash Briefing. This is just an entire Economist podcast, and it's not even a good podcast.\n\n**Tech News**\n\n[Daily Tech Headlines](https://www.amazon.com/DiamondClub-TV-Daily-Tech-Headlines/dp/B01M1B3K5U/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538726&sr=1-1&keywords=Daily+Tech+Headlines)\n\nThis is the best tech news Flash Briefing. It covers a wide expanse of tech news in just the right amount of detail. The host is human, concise, and clear. The only issue with this Flash Briefing is there are too many stories in each Flash Briefing, especially if you're not a tech professional. I'd like to see the makers of this Flash Briefing really cut down the length of their shows. That being said, this is the best tech Flash Briefing I've found, so give it a try.\n\n[TechCruch](https://www.amazon.com/AOL-Inc-TechCrunch/dp/B01L6HQHGQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538760&sr=1-1&keywords=techcrunch)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is weird. A bro reads tech news and talks about what a \"badass\" Elon Musk is (that's a real quote). This bro-host tells a bunch of jokes that aren't all that funny but feel like a stereotype of jokes a Silicon Valley bro would tell. This might be your type of humor, but it's certainly not mine. I'd lightly recommend passing on it, but if off-beat, that's-so-random humor is your thing then give it a try. However, most people seem to hate it.\n\n**Sports News**\n\n[CBS Sports Minute](https://www.amazon.com/CBS-Local-Sports-Minute/dp/B01M9FIFIK/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-3&keywords=sports)\n\nThis is best sports Flash Briefing I've found, but that's not saying much. It covers one sports related story a day, and it doesn't report scores. The host is very energetic, and the stories are interesting. However, you probably won't get a full update on sports scores if that's what you're interested in.\n\n[ESPN SportsCenter Update](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-ESPN-Radio-via/dp/B01JHLKHQ4/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-2&keywords=sports)\n\nThis app has a terribly boring music intro that lasts 30 seconds. Some reviewers have complained about the volume, but I haven't noticed an issue recently. The news itself is pretty good; what you'd expect from SportsCenter. There is an advertisement at the end that drags out. It lasts about 3 minutes.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n[Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day)\n\nThis is my favorite \"hidden gem\" Flash Briefing. Every day, the human host sardonically explains a word of the day and gives examples of how to use the word. It's funny, smart, and a little irreverent. The production quality is top notch, the length of the briefing is just right, and the entertaining examples of how to use the words make it pretty hard to forget the word. The Flash Briefing is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\n[Discovery: DNews](https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Communications-DNews/dp/B01JHK5V6G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539512&sr=1-1&keywords=dnews)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has science news. It's one moderately in-depth story a day, often about refreshing topics not covered by other news sites. The audio is repurposed from YouTube videos, but you probably won't notice because the audio doesn't rely on the visuals. I'd give it a try.\n\n[Complex News](https://www.amazon.com/Complex-News/dp/B01MXXXRLW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538966&sr=1-1&keywords=complex)\n\nThis is the best Flash Briefing for celebrity gossip. It covers just one story a day, but Complex does it in style. It's very punchy and energetic. My guess is that it's repurposed video content, but I quite like it, and I am not one who typically enjoys celebrity news. The entire briefing lasts about 2 minutes.\n\n[Top Reddit Posts Unofficial](https://www.amazon.com/Josh-Jones-Reddit-Posts-Unofficial/dp/B01MTWUMY6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539027&sr=1-1&keywords=top+reddit+post)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has Alexa read the top recent 5 Reddit posts. More specifically, Alexa reads the title of the Reddit post and then 1 comment. Normally, Flash Briefings that have Alexa read the news are terrible. This one is a mild exception. It's good, but it's certainly not great.\n\n[Harvard Business Review: Management Tip](https://www.amazon.com/Harvard-Business-Review-Management-Tip/dp/B01LQM9N8A/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539233&sr=1-1&keywords=harvard)\n\nI don't think that a Flash Briefing is the right place for a management tip. I find that these tips are incredibly forgettable \u2014 these tips are ideas like \"reconsider how you measuring data.\" That's not a particularly useful tip, and I can never remember the minutia of how HBR suggests implementing the tip. However, I know some people love this type of management advice, so if this sounds like the Flash Briefing for you, it probably is.\n\n[eHow](https://www.amazon.com/Demand-Media-eHow/dp/B01M29BSFG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539070&sr=1-1&keywords=ehow)\n\nIf you want an update on what eHow has been publishing recently, then I have the Flash Briefing for you. You'll learn some interesting and pointless things from this Flash Briefing, like the amount of calcium in chia seeds and your dog's separation anxiety. I wouldn't add it to your Flash Briefing, unless you want to know useless trivia or what eHow's been publishing.\n\n[Pulse of the Planet](https://www.amazon.com/Pulse-of-the-Planet/dp/B01K0JWGSY/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539103&sr=1-1&keywords=pulse+of+the+planet)\n\nThis is a weird mix of nature sounds and general interest stories.

  "The freakiest thing happen tonight.  \nWas getting my kids ready for bed, putting on pjs in their room. (My wife was in our bedroom otherwise of the house.). Out of nowhere all 4 Alexas in my house activate at full blasting volume w some creepy ass sounds, whispering voices and cracking static.  Then like 4-5 sec into it you can get a voice whisper through the crackling \u201chelp me...\u201d and the whispers kept up.\nThe kids start freaking out, they are 2 and 4yrs old.  I yell at Alexa a pause command, nothing.  Quickly pulled the plug in the kids\u2019 room one and my wife hearing the same pulled our bedroom plug.  She said she saw the blue listening light on while it was playing, but not responding to her  either. I then Ran into the living room yelling \u201cAlexa Stop!\u201d  It went dead silent.  \nNext I unplugged the living room Sonos w Alexa and Echo view in the kitchen.\nFreaky, but I calmed the boys down, pretended it was nothing and got them to bed.  After they fell asleep I went in the kitchen plugged Alexa back in and asked her to repeat her last command.  She said \u201c I have no previous commands to repeat....\u201d\nI\u2019ve been googling to see if it\u2019s like a hack that people have used to takeover as a joke  via an Alexa skill or something.  I can find nothing like it.\n\nI\u2019m a little on the freaked out side as you can imagine.  Beyond the obvious creepy voices, it played the same thing on all 4 devices, but the Sonos in my living room is not connected to a group w the others, and each device turned its volumes up to 100% for the extra creepy whispering I guess. \n\nI don\u2019t have any weird skills, just news, trivia, ring, etc... and my WiFi password is ridiculously complicated.\n\nHas anyone  heard of anything like this???\n\n I\u2019m leaving them all unplugged for the night. Not sure what else to do for now.\n\n* UPDATE- spoke to Amazon Customer Support, they\u2019ve opened a ticket to look into the matter and said they would get back to me in the next 24hrs.\n\nNot sure on the downvote side of things from people.

  "It\u2019s the new year and a lot of new Alexa users are joining the community. I noticed that there are a lot of questions about Alexa, but there is no extensive resource for the various good skills that you can find and use. I made one in the hope that this list/guide will be helpful for the people in this subreddit.\n\nA quick disclaimer \u2013 I work for the company [labworks.io](https://labworks.io) where we create Alexa skills amongst other stuff. During my time here I\u2019ve tried a lot of skills and here are my thoughts. I tried to include some of the best and underrated (in my opinion) skills, not just the ones that are on the front page with 1000\u2019s of reviews (nor just pushing the ones we made). \n\nAnyway, here is a list of the skills I think are worth your time, will be fun to try out and hopefully add value to the community (let me know if there are more that I should add). \n\n###Entertainment\n\n\n[Earplay](https://www.amazon.com/Earplay/dp/B01K8V6NSI/) - Immersive stories that you can control. It has professional voice-over, which makes the story that much more interesting. Easy to control, it\u2019s very comprehensive and best of all, it makes you feel that you are really part of it.\n\n[Short Bedtime Story](https://www.amazon.com/Webguild-Short-Bedtime-Story/dp/B01DJCJTZ2/) - A cool skill if you have children as it tells a different bedtime story while using their name, so it\u2019s personalised. I\u2019ve tried it a couple of times and got a story with minions for example. \n\n[Chineasy](https://www.amazon.com/Chineasy-Learn-Chinese-With-Ease/dp/B01N6AYBMU/) - A surprising skill that I randomly stumbled upon. Goes together with their app, but you can learn chinese, listen to stories about the language. Not quite sure why, but it left a good impression on me, maybe the stories were of really high quality. \n\n###Knowledge\n\n[Curiosity](https://www.amazon.com/Curiosity-com-Curiosity/dp/B01MT1GPWX) - Gives pretty cool facts about the world where you can learn a lot of new stuff. \n\n[On This Day](https://www.amazon.com/labworks-io-ltd-On-This-Day/dp/B077D9YSRF/) - A skill that tells you facts about what happened on this day in the past. We curate the facts daily, and it takes \u00b11 minute to listen through them all. History, inventions, famous people, etc. We created this thinking that it would be interesting for many of you out here. \n\nI know that there are a lot of other \u201ccat facts\u201d, etc. skills as they\u2019re the simplest to make, but I\u2019m sure you can find any one of them by just searching using simple keywords e.g. Rick and Morty Facts. \n\n\n###Games (Single Player)\n\n[Jeopardy](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Pictures-Television-Jeopardy/dp/B019G0M2WS/) - Great trivia game with excerpts from the show, which makes it feel that you're participating in it. The questions are clear and there are six of them daily (has a paid version now with extra 6 question). I\u2019m sure this is one of the first game that everyone plays once they get their echo device. \n\n[True or False?](https://www.amazon.com/labworks-io-ltd-True-or-False/dp/B073VNDBGC/) - We made a very simple game with the concept of True or False, where you get given questions such as common misconceptions or things that you thought were obviously true (spoiler alert, you\u2019re wrong). It\u2019s got clear and straightforward gameplay (all you need to do is say True or False), understands you all the time and probably best of all, the explanations given are detailed and teach you even more. Also, there\u2019s a multiplayer mode, but more about that later. It's also [available in german!](https://www.amazon.de/labworks-io-ltd-Richtig-oder-Falsch/dp/B073VNDBGC/)\n\n[Yes Sire](https://www.amazon.com/Volley-Inc-Yes-Sire/dp/B071ZR5HKR/) - A pretty good game where you as a knight balance between protecting your kingdom, not dying and not being executed by the king for having too much influence or money. Many storylines, distinct experience, can keep on playing for quite a while. \n\n[The Fake News Game](https://www.amazon.com/labworks-io-ltd-Fake-News-Game/dp/B078J16LF9) - Listen to real news headlines and decipher whether they're fake or news. We made this game to help people think more critically about the news. All the stories were actually published. Some of them are Fake (factually incorrect) and some of them are News (factually correct). \n\n[Deal or no Deal](https://www.amazon.com/Deal-No-Game-unofficial/dp/B0721X9HBF/) - Be part of the famous game show with your Alexa. Choose your briefcase and try to beat the banker to get your million dollars. Interestingly it\u2019s rather immense. \n\n[Holiday Song Quiz](https://www.amazon.com/Volley-Inc-Holiday-Song-Quiz/dp/B077SR7PFY/) - Must be my favourite music quiz game. A song is played and you have to say what song it is. Really one of the better use cases of Alexa skills. Compete against other people somewhere in the world and beat them. \n\n[Millionaire Quiz Game](https://www.amazon.com/Voice-Apps-LLC-Millionaire-Quiz/dp/B073R8BMC4/) - Here it feels as if you're playing in the real game in the studio, especially if you\u2019ve got good speakers or using headphones. Great experience and the extra functions such as call a friend worked pretty well. Not sure how they did it exactly. \n\n[Six Swords](https://www.amazon.com/TsaTsaTzu-6-Swords/dp/B01GVGVSM0/) - Quite an extensive game where you can walk around and fight monsters, build your team, collect items, xp, gold. Quite clear instructions what to do, and if you\u2019re a dungeons and dragons (D&D) this may be the game for you. \n\n[Word of the Day Quiz](https://www.amazon.com/Word-of-the-Day-Quiz/dp/B076B93YT7/) - A lovely and lively game where you learn new words. It has recorded audio, so not Alexa voice, which is a refresher. Was a bit torn whether to put this in knowledge or in games, but I think it\u2019s more of a game. Gives you \u00b14 questions at the end which you answer with yes/no and generally, it\u2019s a pretty good experience. \n\n[BOSCH: A Detective's Case](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Video-BOSCH-Detectives/dp/B06Y2PPQ2C/) - One of those games, where you think: \u201cwow the production on this is pretty darn good\u201d. An immersive experience where you're in the game and you\u2019re the character. The only thing missing is VR. \n\n[Rogue's Choice](https://www.amazon.com/The-Magic-Door-LLC-Rogues/dp/B0732MHQ94/) - Live a medieval life and make your choices as you try to survive through this journey. The descriptions are always very long and informative, if you\u2019re into that - this is for you. \n\n[Escape the Room](https://www.amazon.com/Stoked-Skills-Escape-the-Room/dp/B075J914W2/) - Interesting game where you try to escape some sort of a scenario, a room. In almost every scene there is something you can do. I loved it that it warned you in the very beginning that it is not an easy game, so that you don\u2019t give up straight away. \n\n[Magic Door](https://www.amazon.com/The-Magic-Door-LLC/dp/B01BMUU6JQ/) - A fun game, especially for children where they explore different sceneries, different pathways of the story. The sound effects really help with the gameplay. \n\n**Would you rather(s)** - There are quite a few games for would you rather in the skill store where you choose whether you would do one thing or the other. The most famous one is [Would you rather for family](https://www.amazon.com/Would-You-Rather-For-Family/dp/B06WGV16HR/) which is great for children. There are a couple of other versions, one example is a version we created: [Would You Rather?](https://www.amazon.com/labworks-io-ltd-Would-You-Rather/dp/B06Y13422L/). It has a lot of content and much faster gameplay. Also, we released it in [Germany](https://www.amazon.de/labworks-io-ltd-Would-You-Rather/dp/B06Y13422L/) too.  \n\n###Multiplayer (without buttons)\n\nWhen I was playing and trying out various skills I failed to come across any skills that were properly multiplayer (excluding the new Amazon buttons games that just came out that is). As a response to that we created one where you can compete against others, your friends or your family playing on the same echo device.\n\nThat game is [True or False](https://www.amazon.com/labworks-io-ltd-True-or-False/dp/B073VNDBGC/). You can either play single player or up to 20 people and the game adapts. Available in [german](https://www.amazon.de/labworks-io-ltd-Richtig-oder-Falsch/dp/B073VNDBGC/) as well! \n\n\nPlease let me know if there any other such games where you can play multiplayer on the same device! (excluding buttons\u2026 sorry I\u2019m not a big fan of them yet)\n\n###Useful Skills\n\n[Big Sky](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophical-Creations-Big-Sky/dp/B01GU4MBM4/) - A cool weather app using hyperlocal weather information (from Dark Sky API) and it genuinely works pretty well. Imho better than the original Alexa weather option. \n\n[5-Minute Plank Workout](https://www.amazon.com/cubic-ai-5-Minute-Plank-Workout/dp/B06XHTCB3Z) - Does what it is supposed to do. Get motivated to do a plank workout and get your abs summer-ready (if you\u2019re into that). \n\n[Night Light](https://www.amazon.com/labworks-io-ltd-Night-Light/dp/B0764GDTVG/) - We made a simple skill, which is useful at night, where the top of your echo device lights up, slightly helping you navigate in the dark, without telling you a thing. \n\n[Ask my buddy](https://www.amazon.com/Beach-Dev-Ask-My-Buddy/dp/B017YAF22Y) - For the mobility impaired or just to make sure that your family can always respond if something happens. It\u2019s pretty darn useful as it allows you to connect to your personal alert network and individuals can alert the close ones (hands free) if something happens. \n\n[Anypod](https://www.amazon.com/Harrison-Digital-Media-AnyPod/dp/B072HY3T7Y/) - A functional podcast playing skill, that has thousands of them and keeps adding them. Easy to get started and use.\n\n[The Bartender](https://www.amazon.com/Pylon-ai-The-Bartender/dp/B019D6LR8U/) - If you need a cocktail this is the skill to go to. One issue that I have is that it\u2019d be great to have metric measurements!\n\n[My Valet - Tesla Controller (Unofficial)](https://www.amazon.com/My-Valet-Tesla-Controller-Unofficial/dp/B01N6NDMHX/) - I personally don\u2019t own a Tesla (I wish), but I think it\u2019s pretty darn cool to be able to control it from your Echo device\u2026 \n\n###Random\n\n[Daily Kindness](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Kindness-Spreading-World/dp/B01N9Y7OT6/) - Listen to one nice thing you can do each day. If you carry on with it, you\u2019ll be a much more wholesome person at the end of it. \n\n[Ditty](https://www.amazon.com/Zya-Inc-Ditty/dp/B01M69NTJH) - Say a phrase and Ditty will make it into a song for you (yup, literally.) The only thing is that sharing is darn difficult.\n\n###Relaxation\n\n[Bible](https://www.amazon.com/Spriton-Systems-LLC-The-Bible/dp/B019S6O3LS/) - If you need a bible app to get up to speed with it, or explore it, this may just be the skill for you. \n\n[Zen Sounds - Healing Sounds](https://www.amazon.com/VoiceCities-Pty-Ltd-Zen-Sounds/dp/B0756ZCH4P/) - There are a lot of sound skills and I thought this one was really cool and I guess it wasn\u2019t as popular as the other big ones, so I chose it (but of course there are loads and loads of other ones). \n\nI hope you found this useful I\u2019ll keep updating this little guide, so add your comments and I\u2019ll try to add more good skills. This is all just personal opinion, so it\u2019s completely cool if you disagree with it. Also, credit and thanks to wopdop for the inspiration of this guide. \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TL;DR**(Stuff you should try out in my opinion):\n \n[True or False?](https://www.amazon.com/labworks-io-ltd-True-or-False/dp/B073VNDBGC/) (Single & Multiplayer trivia, *Disclaimer: our creation*), [Bosch: A Detective\u2019s Case](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Video-BOSCH-Detectives/dp/B06Y2PPQ2C/) (amazing production quality), [On This Day](https://www.amazon.com/labworks-io-ltd-On-This-Day/dp/B077D9YSRF/) (Cool facts to learn daily, *Disclaimer: our creation*), [Big Sky](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophical-Creations-Big-Sky/dp/B01GU4MBM4/) (Good weather info), [Short Bedtime Story](https://www.amazon.com/Webguild-Short-Bedtime-Story/dp/B01DJCJTZ2/) (personalised night story for kids), [Holiday Song Quiz](https://www.amazon.com/Volley-Inc-Holiday-Song-Quiz/dp/B077SR7PFY/) (fun song quiz). \n ",
  "I just received an Echo Show as a gift, and I'm having trouble working out what to do with it.  Of course there are thousands of skills, but so many of them are \"Say something from a list of trivia\" or \"Read something off a website\" that it seems like a slog to find anything useful.  \n\nAssuming it's in the same room as a PC, a TV, and a smartphone, what would you do with it?  Or is the idea that it's just supposed to be a \"backup\" version of those things for somewhere else in the house?  ",
  "I just launched a new skill for Amazon Echo called \nScience Bowl\". It is a multiple-choice trivia game that flexes your brain on your scientific knowledge, and you can try different science subjects and difficulty. Please give it a try, I would really appreciate your feedback, and I am trying to reach 100 downloads. This is my first Alexa skill, and I am really excited to see it launched! The link is https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078PHZ3N6/ . Thanks!",
  "I love my Alexa and I love playing jeopardy and a couple other trivia games I have found, but I usually try to avoid trivia games with multiple choice. It takes too long to even get through the question and I like testing myself!\n\nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated! ",
  "Eight months ago, I created the [Ultimate Guide to Flash Briefings](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/5v0rfd/the_ultimate_guide_to_flash_briefings/).  Since then, I've continued searching for the ultimate set of Flash Briefing skills, which is why I've updated this guide.  As seasoned Alexa-users likely know, the best Flash Briefings \u2014 NPR, BBC, and Word of the Day \u2014 are few in numbers and, for the most part, trash abounds the skill store. However, there are still hidden gems among the heaps of flaming garbage in the Amazon Echo skill store.\n\nFor those who are just starting with Alexa and those long-time Alexa users looking for a hidden gem, here's a quick summary:\n\n**The Staples** - For those who are new to Amazon Echo and Alexa\n\n1. [NPR Hourly News](http://bit.ly/redditnpr) \u2014 Well-produced news with a US focus. It has gotten significantly worse recently since it started running ads.\n\n2. \n[BBC](http://bit.ly/redditbbc) \u2014 Smart reporting on world news. This Flash Briefing is rather unchanging and doesn't have ads.  You'll get what you expect.\n\n3. [Word of the Day](http://bit.ly/redditword) \u2014 There is a reason Word of the Day is the **highest rated Flash Briefing:** The quality is spectacular. A sardonic host explains new words and gives highly entertaining ways of using them in a sentence.  Also, the [Word of the Day Quiz](http://bit.ly/redditwordquiz) is one of best skills I've used and a great way to solidify each day's word.\n\n**The Hidden Gems** \u2014 The best Flash Briefings off the beaten path\n\n1. [Daily Dad Joke](http://bit.ly/redditdadjoke) \u2014 A meek host shares legitimately funny dad jokes. Don't believe me? Try it.  It's about as funny as Word of the Day, just without the education.\n\n2. [Ripley's Weird Minute](http://bit.ly/redditripleys) \u2014 Straight up weird facts. They're fun and a human reads each day's fact with some real character.  I'm not sure why Ripley's is making a Flash Briefing, but it's one of the better ones.\n\n3. [Tom Bilyeu](http://bit.ly/redditbilyeu) \u2014 Tom Bilyeu is a motivational speaker/entrepreneur type. Think Tim Ferriss or Gary Vaynerchuk.  He's making good quality content, but it's clearly not for everyone.  If you think you'd be into some daily motivation, give him a try.\n\n\nFor those of you who are on the lookout for more specific Flash Briefings, I've compiled all my reviews of Flash Briefings by topic below.  I generally put better Flash Briefings at the top of each category and the worse ones toward the bottom but there are a few places where I don't quite know how to order the Briefings, so don't take the ordering too seriously.  You'll likely notice a theme: The best Flash Briefings have a human host, do not run too long or too short, and do not have ads.  Oh, and they aren't just recycling content from other areas (e.g., YouTube)\n\n***THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO FLASH BRIEFINGS***\n\n**General News**\n\n[NPR Hourly News](http://bit.ly/redditnpr)\n\nThis is one of the most consistently well produced Flash Briefings.  Clocking in at 5 minutes, the news summary is just long enough to be substantial and comprehensive, but not so long as to be annoying.  The mix between headline news and summaries is just right, but NPR has started to run ads in its Flash Briefing which is a big no-no.\n\n[BBC](http://bit.ly/redditbbc)\n\nJust like NPR and Fox News, this Flash Briefing stands out as one of the most well produced.  However, what really sets the BBC apart from the other two is that the BBC covers different stories \u2014 often less US-centric stories.  If you have multiple US news Flash Briefings, the BBC can be very refreshing and introduce you to some news stories you haven't yet heard about.  I'd highly recommend it.\n\n[Fox News](https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-Channel/dp/B01M5EIW2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is among the better news Flash Briefing skills.  You'll get a full view of US news from a human presenter.  The biggest problem is long, annoying ads they run.  BBC and NPR don't run ads and have similar content.  The other problem is the volume: it's all over the place.  The main host is significantly louder than the correspondents who speak with him.  That being said, it's only mildly distracting, especially compared to the ad.  In total, if you are trying to figure out which news Flash Briefings to use, give Fox News a shot.\n\n[90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has changed **a lot** in the last 8 months... for the worse.  The Flash Briefing is now much longer than 90 seconds and is hosted by a somewhat monotone presenter (Mike Pesca doesn't host it anymore).  I'd give this one a pass, but if you think you'd be into it, try it out.\n\n[Biden's Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/Joe-Biden-Bidens-Flash-Briefing/dp/B073DH274W/)\n\nThis is a frustrating Flash Briefing. I initially enabled this Flash Briefing because I thought once in a while Biden would share his opinions on interesting issues through the Flash Briefing. Oh, how wrong I was! Every day, I hear the same Biden recording about how he \"hand picks relevant stories\" and then a woman reads an article.  I would only give this a try if you are the biggest Biden fan.\n\n[theSkimm](https://www.amazon.com/theSkimm-Inc/dp/B01JM6TN8M/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537954&sr=1-1&keywords=theSkimm)\n\nFor those who don't know, theSkimm is a daily email directed toward millennial women that sends you a short news briefing.  This Flash Briefing just has Alexa read that email.  It's better than most Flash Briefings where Alexa reads the news, but it still is far from the best Flash Briefing.  I'd recommend passing on this as NPR and BBC are much better.\n\n[Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Quartz/dp/B01M278ZFA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538052&sr=1-1&keywords=quartz)\n\nAlexa reads the news.  The writing is actually pretty good, but without a human reading the news, it's not worth it.  There are tons of competitor that were a human host reads the news.\n \n[Refinery29: 8 Things You Need to Know This AM](https://www.amazon.com/Refinery29-Things-Need-Know-This/dp/B01JHR7TK0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537988&sr=1-1&keywords=refinery29)\n\nAlexa reads Refinery29 headlines.  It covers a wide swath of topics, from Health to LGBTQ News.  Refinery29 does not cover any of these stories in more than a sentence, so the Flash Briefing is short and uninformative.  My suggestion is that you should leave Refinery29 out of your morning routine.\n\n[BuzzFeed News](https://www.amazon.com/BuzzFeed-News/dp/B01MQR7Y5D/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538110&sr=1-1&keywords=buzzfeed)\n\nAlexa reads BuzzFeed headlines.  This is possibly the worst Flash Briefing made by a large company that I've seen.  Isn't BuzzFeed supposed to be better than the average media company at creating content for digital platforms?\n\n**Business News**\n\n[CNBC Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/NBCUniversal-CNBC-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01N7FH24X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is the best business news Flash Briefing.  A real human reads the business news headlines with a short explanation.  Every day it covers interesting sales numbers, mergers, and trends.  The length of the Flash Briefing is about right.  I'd highly recommend adding this to your Flash Briefing.\n\n[Motley Fool Stock Watch](https://www.amazon.com/The-Motley-Fool-Stock-Watch/dp/B01KG5YXS8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538317&sr=1-1&keywords=motley+fool)\n\nThis is a very short interview with a stock expert on a recent topic.  I find it informative and very digestible \u2014 a good way to learn interesting tidbits about what's going on in different sectors of the economy and the stock market.\n\n[Cheddar](https://www.amazon.com/Cheddar/dp/B074CM2CD8/)\n\nCheddar is making financial content specifically for Alexa... kinda. They package some boilerplate daily content (e.g., big stories of the day with few details, market stats) along with some interviews that do not provide that much information. Maybe I just have a high standard for financial news, but this is only okay.  Anyway, it's worth a try if you're looking for financial news.\n\n[Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is just a short business story read by a human.  This generally isn't a headline story, so the stories are somewhat refreshing, and the delivery is pretty good. There are not that many good options for business news in the Amazon Skill store, so if you are in need of more business news, give Level Up a try.\n\n[Bankable by Forbes](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Bankable-by/dp/B01L7DFOEU/)\n\nCute little stories about young people making it the world.  The host is rather dry and quiet, but if you need some positivity in your Flash Briefing, this might be your choice.  The length is right, and it's got a good message.\n\n[Econoday U.S. Economic Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-U-S-Economic-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01MEBW3T0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538474&sr=1-1&keywords=econoday)\n\nEconomic news read by Alexa.  It's too long, but it isn't one of those Flash Briefings that never end.  If you absolutely must have news about the Fed and stock market in your Flash Briefing, Econoday is for you.  However, it's not very good, so I'd say pass.\n\n[Econoday Global Market Update](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-Global-Market-Update/dp/B01MDPRG23/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538529&sr=1-2&keywords=econoday)\n\nAlexa reads how the stock, money, and commodity markets changed since the last day and reports basic news.  I would not recommend this Flash Briefing to anyone who doesn't have a job in finance (and I wouldn't even recommend it to most financial professionals).\n\n[The Economist](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-The-Economist/dp/B01JHLMNWU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538580&sr=1-1&keywords=economist)\n\nDon't bother including this in your Flash Briefing.  This is just an entire Economist podcast, and it's not even a good podcast.\n\n**Tech News**\n\n[Daily Tech Headlines](https://www.amazon.com/DiamondClub-TV-Daily-Tech-Headlines/dp/B01M1B3K5U/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538726&sr=1-1&keywords=Daily+Tech+Headlines)\n\nThis is the best tech news Flash Briefing.  It covers a wide expanse of tech news in just the right amount of detail.  The host is human, concise, and clear.  The only issue with this Flash Briefing is there are too many stories in each Flash Briefing, especially if you're not a tech professional.  I'd like to see the makers of this Flash Briefing really cut down the length of their shows.  That being said, this is the best tech Flash Briefing I've found, so give it a try.\n\n[This Week in Tech](https://www.amazon.com/TWiT-tv-This-Week-in-Tech/dp/B01LJB8UMS/)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is really just a taste of a longer piece of content that you can listen to elsewhere.  It's hardly a comprehensive look at tech news; rather, it's a clip from a longer tech new show.  The clip is always fun, but I would not classify this Flash Briefing as an informative tech news show.\n\n[TechCruch](https://www.amazon.com/AOL-Inc-TechCrunch/dp/B01L6HQHGQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538760&sr=1-1&keywords=techcrunch)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is weird.  A bro reads tech news and talks about what a \"badass\" Elon Musk is (that's a real quote).  This bro-host tells a bunch of jokes that aren't all that funny but feel like a stereotype of jokes a Silicon Valley bro would tell.  This might be your type of humor, but it's certainly not mine.  I'd lightly recommend passing on it, but if off-beat, that's-so-random humor is your thing then give it a try.  However, most people seem to hate it.\n\n**Sports News**\n\n[CBS Sports Minute](https://www.amazon.com/CBS-Local-Sports-Minute/dp/B01M9FIFIK/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-3&keywords=sports)\n\nThis is best sports Flash Briefing I've found, but that's not saying much.  It covers one sports related story a day, and it doesn't report scores.  The host is very energetic, and the stories are interesting.  However, you probably won't get a full update on sports scores if that's what you're interested in.\n\n[ESPN SportsCenter Update](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-ESPN-Radio-via/dp/B01JHLKHQ4/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-2&keywords=sports)\n\nThis app has a terribly boring music intro that lasts 30 seconds.  Some reviewers have complained about the volume, but I haven't noticed an issue recently.  The news itself is pretty good; what you'd expect from SportsCenter.  There is an advertisement at the end that drags out.  It lasts about 3 minutes.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n[Word of the Day](http://bit.ly/redditword)\n\nThis is my favorite Flash Briefing.  Every day, the human host sardonically explains a word of the day and gives examples of how to use the word.  It's funny, smart, and a little irreverent.  The production quality is top notch, the length of the briefing is just right, and the entertaining examples of how to use the words make it pretty hard to forget the word.  Recently, they've added [Word of the Day Quiz](http://bit.ly/redditwordquiz), which is a quiz \u2014 also voiced by a human \u2014 that helps you solidify that day's word in Word of the Day's characteristic style.  I love Word of the Day.\n\n[Daily Dad Joke](http://bit.ly/redditdadjoke)\n\nA meek host shares legitimately funny dad jokes. For the uninitiated, dad jokes are bad pun and cute one-liners.  As the name suggests, they're family friendly.  I know this doesn't sell Daily Dad Jokes, but it's legitimately great.  It brightens my day, and it gives me something silly to share with loved ones.  Give it a try!\n\n[Ripley's Weird Minute](http://bit.ly/redditripleys)\n\nRipley's is back at it with weird facts.  I thought they were gone, but nope; they're still kicking with strange facts on a daily basis.  They're fun and a human reads each day's fact with some real character.  I'm not sure why Ripley's is making a Flash Briefing, but it's one of the better ones.\n\n[Tom Bilyeu](http://bit.ly/redditbilyeu)\n\nEven though I ranked this as a hidden gem, I'm fairly mixed on this.  Tom Bilyeu is a motivational speaker/entrepreneur type. Think Tim Ferriss or Gary Vaynerchuk.  I'm really not into the motivational speaker/entrepreneur scene, so I am not a great judge of how motivational it is.  What I can say is that he's making good quality content with a good message.  If you think you'd be into some daily motivation, give him a try.\n\n[Daily Meditation Reminder](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Daily-Meditation-Reminder/dp/B07694FLKS/)\n\nFrom the makers of Word of the Day, this is a rather utilitarian Flash Briefing. Each day the human host reminds you to meditate and then gives you a tip on meditation or a summary of a medical study on meditation.  It's good, but the audience that needs this (Alexa users who meditate and want a reminder to meditate) has to be pretty small.  Regardless if you're an Alexa user that wants a nice little reminder to meditate each morning, try this one out for size.\n\n[Gary Vee 365](https://www.amazon.com/VaynerMedia-GaryVee-365/dp/B072WG89RB/)\n\nThis is Gary Vaynerchuk's Flash Briefing where he shares his daily thoughts.  I'm not sure I totally get it.  Maybe it's really just for Gary Vee fans...  Here's what I do know: the sound quality is terrible.  It is clearly recorded during other events (ex. speeches) and repurposed for Amazon Alexa.  If you're not really into Gary Vaynerchuk, I doubt this is for you.\n\n[Discovery: DNews](https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Communications-DNews/dp/B01JHK5V6G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539512&sr=1-1&keywords=dnews)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has science news.  It's one moderately in-depth story a day, often about refreshing topics not covered by other news sites.  The audio is repurposed from YouTube videos, but you probably won't notice because the audio doesn't rely on the visuals.  I'd give it a try.\n\n[Complex News](https://www.amazon.com/Complex-News/dp/B01MXXXRLW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538966&sr=1-1&keywords=complex)\n\nThis is the best Flash Briefing for celebrity gossip. It covers just one story a day, but Complex does it in style. It's very punchy and energetic.  My guess is that it's repurposed video content, but I quite like it, and I am not one who typically enjoys celebrity news.  The entire briefing lasts about 2 minutes.\n\n[Top Reddit Posts Unofficial](https://www.amazon.com/Josh-Jones-Reddit-Posts-Unofficial/dp/B01MTWUMY6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539027&sr=1-1&keywords=top+reddit+post)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has Alexa read the top recent 5 Reddit posts.  More specifically, Alexa reads the title of the Reddit post and then 1 comment.  Normally, Flash Briefings that have Alexa read the news are terrible.  This one is a mild exception.  It's good, but it's certainly not great.\n\n[Harvard Business Review: Management Tip](https://www.amazon.com/Harvard-Business-Review-Management-Tip/dp/B01LQM9N8A/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539233&sr=1-1&keywords=harvard)\n\nI don't think that a Flash Briefing is the right place for a management tip.  I find that these tips are incredibly forgettable \u2014 these tips are ideas like \"reconsider how you measuring data.\"  That's not a particularly useful tip, and I can never remember the minutia of how HBR suggests implementing the tip.  However, I know some people love this type of management advice, so if this sounds like the Flash Briefing for you, it probably is.\n\n[eHow](https://www.amazon.com/Demand-Media-eHow/dp/B01M29BSFG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539070&sr=1-1&keywords=ehow)\n\nIf you want an update on what eHow has been publishing recently, then I have the Flash Briefing for you.  You'll learn some interesting and pointless things from this Flash Briefing, like the amount of calcium in chia seeds and your dog's separation anxiety.  I wouldn't add it to your Flash Briefing, unless you want to know useless trivia or what eHow's been publishing.\n\n[Pulse of the Planet](https://www.amazon.com/Pulse-of-the-Planet/dp/B01K0JWGSY/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539103&sr=1-1&keywords=pulse+of+the+planet)\n\nThis is a weird mix of nature sounds and general interest stories.  I'm not sure who this would appeal to, but it's certainly unique.  It's not too long, so it might make sense to try it out if general interest stories are your MO.\n\n[Dan's Lie of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Dans-Lie-of-the-Day/dp/B06ZYN3PRT/)\n\nThis is a confusing Flash Briefing.  I like the concept, but I don't understand the execution. Maybe someone can explain it to me? A hard pass on this one for now.\n\nTL;DR: Try [Word of the Day](http://bit.ly/redditword), [Daily Dad Joke](http://bit.ly/redditdadjoke), and [Ripley's Weird Minute](http://bit.ly/redditripleys).",
  "Since this month's free Dot promotion does NOT include skills created with the Amazon published skill templates. It stinks, but you can't blame them.. after all there is over 8,000 fact & trivia skills up there now.

  " I worked on a trivia skill mainly to get a free t-shirt :) \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Brank-Games-Super-Trivia/dp/B06XXMXK2D\nThis is the basic trivia game with a few modifications, but I've added hundreds of questions so each game is totally different. Which is one of the things I found lacking in the trivia games so far. \n\nLet me know what you think and if there are some improvements you would like to see. I'm trying to think of other things that would make these trivia games more enjoyable. ",
  "I have built one skill thus far, \"Trivia for NASCAR\", using the easy-to-follow template. However, I want to try a custom advanced one on my own. Knowing that we can't do push notifications/voices, what ideas do you have for a skill you'd like to have? I'm seeking inspiration. ",
  "Ever since I've got my Amazon Echo, I've been searching for the ultimate set of Flash Briefing skills.  Seasoned Alexa-users are probably aware of some of the best briefings \u2014 NPR, BBC, and Fox News \u2014 and they've probably found a bunch of garbage Flash Briefings; most Flash Briefings are garbage.  However, among the swamp of crappy Flash Briefings, I've found a few staples and a few hidden gems.\n\nFor those who are just starting with Alexa and those long-time Alexa users looking for a hidden gem, here's a quick summary:\n\n**The Staples** - For those who are new to Amazon Echo and Alexa\n\n1. [NPR Hourly News](https://www.amazon.com/NPR-Hourly-News-Summary/dp/B01K07MU64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) \u2014 Well-produced news with a US focus\n\n2. \n[BBC](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-BBC/dp/B01JHLI06S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487536887&sr=1-1&keywords=bbc) \u2014 Smart reporting on world news\n\n3. [Fox News](https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-Channel/dp/B01M5EIW2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) \u2014 Great production value, great news, but suffers from an annoyin ad in the middle.\n\n**The Hidden Gems** \u2014 The best Flash Briefings off the beaten path\n\n1. [Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day) \u2014 A sardonic host explains new words and gives highly entertaining ways of using them in a sentence; great production value, hilarious, and you'll learn some new words. Do yourself a favor and enable Word of the Day.\n\n2. [90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate) \u2014 Refershing Flash Breifing about the news; the host delivers a very short news summary with panache.  You definitely can't sleep through this news report.\n\n3. [Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up) \u2014 A short Flash Briefing that tells the story of startups; it's consistently solid, and, occassionally, it will give you a story you'll think about for the rest of the day.\n\n\nFor those of you who are on the lookout for more specific Flash Briefings, I've compiled all my reviews of Flash Briefings by topic below.  I generally put better Flash Briefings at the top of each category and the worse ones toward the bottom but there are a few places where I don't quite know how to order the Briefings, so don't take the ordering too seriously.  You'll likely notice a theme: The best Flash Briefings have a human host, do not run too long or too short, and do not have ads.  I also tend to prefer Flash Briefings that have a bit of personality \u2014 dry deliveries put me to sleep.\n\n***THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO FLASH BRIEFINGS***\n\n**General News**\n\n[NPR Hourly News](https://www.amazon.com/NPR-Hourly-News-Summary/dp/B01K07MU64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is one of the most consistently well produced Flash Briefings.  Clocking in at 5 minutes, the news summary is just long enough to be substantial and comprehensive, but not so long as to be annoying.  The mix between headline news and summaries is just right, and NPR has left the advertising out of the briefing.\n\n[BBC](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-BBC/dp/B01JHLI06S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487536887&sr=1-1&keywords=bbc)\n\nJust like NPR and Fox News, this Flash Briefing stands out as one of the most well produced.  However, what really sets the BBC apart from the other two is that the BBC covers different stories \u2014 often less US-centric stories.  If you have multiple US news Flash Briefings, the BBC can be very refreshing and introduce you to some news stories you haven't yet heard about.  I'd highly recommend it.\n\n[Fox News](https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-Channel/dp/B01M5EIW2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is among the better news Flash Briefing skills.  You'll get a full view of US news from a human presenter.  The biggest problem is long, annoying ads they run.  BBC and NPR don't run ads and have similar content.  The other problem is the volume: it's all over the place.  The main host is significantly louder than the correspondents who speak with him.  That being said, it's only mildly distracting, especially compared to the ad.  In total, if you are trying to figure out which news Flash Briefings to use, give Fox News a shot.\n\n[90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate)\n\nA real human, Mike Pasca, reads 2 or 3 news stories with panache.  I really love how the presenter reads the stories; sometimes he'll say something like \"We've got two stories for you today \u2014 one that matters and one that does not.\"  You definitely won't sleep through this Flash Briefing.  There is an ad at the end, but it's the least annoying ad I've seen in a Flash Briefing so far.  Overall, I'd say give this Flash Briefing a try and see if it's for you.\n\n[theSkimm](https://www.amazon.com/theSkimm-Inc/dp/B01JM6TN8M/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537954&sr=1-1&keywords=theSkimm)\n\nFor those who don't know, theSkimm is a daily email that sends you a short news briefing.  This Flash Briefing just has Alexa read that email.  It's better than most Flash Briefings where Alexa reads the news, but it still is far from the best Flash Briefing.  I'd recommend passing on this as NPR and BBC are much better.\n\n[Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Quartz/dp/B01M278ZFA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538052&sr=1-1&keywords=quartz)\n\nAlexa reads the news.  The writing is actually pretty good, but without a human reading the news, it's not worth it.  There are tons of competitor that were a human host reads the news.\n \n[Refinery29: 8 Things You Need to Know This AM](https://www.amazon.com/Refinery29-Things-Need-Know-This/dp/B01JHR7TK0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537988&sr=1-1&keywords=refinery29)\n\nAlexa reads Refinery29 headlines.  It covers a wide swath of topics, from Health to LGBTQ News.  Refinery29 does not cover any of these stories in more than a sentence, so the Flash Briefing is short and uninformative.  My suggestion is that you should leave Refinery29 out of your morning routine.\n\n[BuzzFeed News](https://www.amazon.com/BuzzFeed-News/dp/B01MQR7Y5D/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538110&sr=1-1&keywords=buzzfeed)\n\nAlexa reads BuzzFeed headlines.

A real human reads the business news headlines with a short explanation.  Every day it covers interesting sales numbers, mergers, and trends.  The length of the Flash Briefing is about right.  I'd highly recommend adding this to your Flash Briefing.\n\n[Motley Fool Stock Watch](https://www.amazon.com/The-Motley-Fool-Stock-Watch/dp/B01KG5YXS8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538317&sr=1-1&keywords=motley+fool)\n\nThis is a very short interview with a stock expert on a recent topic.

It's too long, but it isn't one of those Flash Briefings that never end.  If you absolutely must have news about the Fed and stock market in your Flash Briefing, Econoday is for you.  However, it's not very good, so I'd say pass.\n\n[Econoday Global Market Update](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-Global-Market-Update/dp/B01MDPRG23/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538529&sr=1-2&keywords=econoday)\n\nAlexa reads how the stock, money, and commodity markets changed since the last day and reports basic news.  I would not recommend this Flash Briefing to anyone who doesn't have a job in finance (and I wouldn't even recommend it to most financial professionals).\n\n[The Economist](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-The-Economist/dp/B01JHLMNWU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538580&sr=1-1&keywords=economist)\n\nDon't bother including this in your Flash Briefing.  This is just an entire Economist podcast, and it's not even a good podcast.\n\n**Tech News**\n\n[Daily Tech Headlines](https://www.amazon.com/DiamondClub-TV-Daily-Tech-Headlines/dp/B01M1B3K5U/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538726&sr=1-1&keywords=Daily+Tech+Headlines)\n\nThis is the best tech news Flash Briefing.  It covers a wide expanse of tech news in just the right amount of detail.  The host is human, concise, and clear.  The only issue with this Flash Briefing is there are too many stories in each Flash Briefing, especially if you're not a tech professional.  I'd like to see the makers of this Flash Briefing really cut down the length of their shows.  That being said, this is the best tech Flash Briefing I've found, so give it a try.\n\n[TechCruch](https://www.amazon.com/AOL-Inc-TechCrunch/dp/B01L6HQHGQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538760&sr=1-1&keywords=techcrunch)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is weird.  A bro reads tech news and talks about what a \"badass\" Elon Musk is (that's a real quote).  This bro-host tells a bunch of jokes that aren't all that funny but feel like a stereotype of jokes a Silicon Valley bro would tell.  This might be your type of humor, but it's certainly not mine.  I'd lightly recommend passing on it, but if off-beat, that's-so-random humor is your thing then give it a try.  However, most people seem to hate it.\n\n**Sports News**\n\n[CBS Sports Minute](https://www.amazon.com/CBS-Local-Sports-Minute/dp/B01M9FIFIK/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-3&keywords=sports)\n\nThis is best sports Flash Briefing I've found, but that's not saying much.  It covers one sports related story a day, and it doesn't report scores.  The host is very energetic, and the stories are interesting.  However, you probably won't get a full update on sports scores if that's what you're interested in.\n\n[ESPN SportsCenter Update](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-ESPN-Radio-via/dp/B01JHLKHQ4/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-2&keywords=sports)\n\nThis app has a terribly boring music intro that lasts 30 seconds.  Some reviewers have complained about the volume, but I haven't noticed an issue recently.  The news itself is pretty good; what you'd expect from SportsCenter.  There is an advertisement at the end that drags out.  It lasts about 3 minutes.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n[Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day)\n\nThis is my favorite \"hidden gem\" Flash Briefing.  Every day, the human host sardonically explains a word of the day and gives examples of how to use the word.  It's funny, smart, and a little irreverent.  The production quality is top notch, the length of the briefing is just right, and the entertaining examples of how to use the words make it pretty hard to forget the word.  The Flash Briefing is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\n[Discovery: DNews](https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Communications-DNews/dp/B01JHK5V6G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539512&sr=1-1&keywords=dnews)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has science news.  It's one moderately in-depth story a day, often about refreshing topics not covered by other news sites.  The audio is repurposed from YouTube videos, but you probably won't notice because the audio doesn't rely on the visuals.  I'd give it a try.\n\n[Complex News](https://www.amazon.com/Complex-News/dp/B01MXXXRLW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538966&sr=1-1&keywords=complex)\n\nThis is the best Flash Briefing for celebrity gossip. It covers just one story a day, but Complex does it in style. It's very punchy and energetic.  My guess is that it's repurposed video content, but I quite like it, and I am not one who typically enjoys celebrity news.  The entire briefing lasts about 2 minutes.\n\n[Top Reddit Posts Unofficial](https://www.amazon.com/Josh-Jones-Reddit-Posts-Unofficial/dp/B01MTWUMY6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539027&sr=1-1&keywords=top+reddit+post)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has Alexa read the top recent 5 Reddit posts.  More specifically, Alexa reads the title of the Reddit post and then 1 comment.  Normally, Flash Briefings that have Alexa read the news are terrible.  This one is a mild exception.  It's good, but it's certainly not great.\n\n[Harvard Business Review: Management Tip](https://www.amazon.com/Harvard-Business-Review-Management-Tip/dp/B01LQM9N8A/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539233&sr=1-1&keywords=harvard)\n\nI don't think that a Flash Briefing is the right place for a management tip.  I find that these tips are incredibly forgettable \u2014 these tips are ideas like \"reconsider how you measuring data.\"  That's not a particularly useful tip, and I can never remember the minutia of how HBR suggests implementing the tip.  However, I know some people love this type of management advice, so if this sounds like the Flash Briefing for you, it probably is.\n\n[eHow](https://www.amazon.com/Demand-Media-eHow/dp/B01M29BSFG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539070&sr=1-1&keywords=ehow)\n\nIf you want an update on what eHow has been publishing recently, then I have the Flash Briefing for you.  You'll learn some interesting and pointless things from this Flash Briefing, like the amount of calcium in chia seeds and your dog's separation anxiety.  I wouldn't add it to your Flash Briefing, unless you want to know useless trivia or what eHow's been publishing.\n\n[Pulse of the Planet](https://www.amazon.com/Pulse-of-the-Planet/dp/B01K0JWGSY/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539103&sr=1-1&keywords=pulse+of+the+planet)\n\nThis is a weird mix of nature sounds and general interest stories.  I'm not sure who this would appeal to, but it's certainly unique.  It's not too long, so it might make sense to try it out if general interest stories are your MO.\n\nTL;DR: Try [Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day), [90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate), and [Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up)",

  "## I've just published my first skill on the Alexa Skills store!\n\nJust wanted to share my excitement! It was actually *much* easier than I thought. And I could never have imagined just how many people would stumble across my little game. ~~600~~ ~~850~~ 1,000 players have used it in the first 3 days of going live.\n\nLots of people have asked how I did it, so in the hope of inspiring others, I have written up a quick **2-minute guide** to creating a skill from my (dummy's) perspective.\n\n## What is a skill, and why publish it?\n\nAlexa has some very cool built-in functionality. But there are probably *other* things you wish it could do. I had an idea, so I made a skill for it. Once I had finished, I figured other people could use it too, so why not share it on the Skills Store?\n\n## What do I need?\n\n- Alexa device\n- Amazon Web Services (AWS) account\n\n## How much does it cost?\n\nFor a basic app, *nothing*. Most light-usage skills will be covered in the free tier of Amazon Web Services. So they will manage all of the infrastructure to run your code and distribute your skill for free. \n\n## How long does it take?\n\nAmazon took a few days to check the skill before allowing it to be published. That said, it probably took me no more than *5 hours* in total, including building the app, signing up for accounts, and making tweaks to get it through the certification process. My next skill will probably be significantly faster.\n\n## What kind of skill can I build?\n\nFor your first skill, *keep it simple*. Use it as an opportunity to get familiar with the development and publishing process.\n\nMy recommendation would be a skill that, when called, gives you a random fact or piece of information. There is a [guide and sample code](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact) which you can simply copy and paste.\n\nOther options you might like to look at are:\n\n- [Trivia game](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia)\n- [How-to guide](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-howto)\n\n## How do I create and publish my skill?\n\n1. Register your new skill in the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/)\n2. Write the code (or use a pre-made template like the one above).\n3. Use your code to create an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/) function.\n4. Back to the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/) to submit for certification.\n\nFor the nitty-gritty details check out Amazon's [step-by-step](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact) guide.\n\n## What skill did you make? Can I try it?\n\nSure. It's a very basic one. Alexa thinks of a number and you have to guess what it is. Say *\"Alexa, Enable Higher or Lower\"* to install it, and then *\"Start Higher or Lower\"* to play. Also feel free to explore the [source code](https://github.com/chase4646/Alexa-Higher-or-Lower).\n\n## What could be better? What do you wish was different?\n\nJust one thing. Remember I said 850 people have played the game? Well, it's yet to receive a review. Maybe you will be the first? :)\n\n## Any questions?\n\nJust let me know! I'm not a coding expert, but I'd be happy to help in any way I can :)\n\n**EDIT 1: Woah, front page! Thanks for the updoots guys. Once you've created your skill be sure to come back and share what you've made.**\n\n**EDIT 2: Up to ~~1,000~~ 1,500 users!**",
  "So. Alexa is pretty cool. But I live in Australia. If I ask her about the weather, she tells me about my dreary old UK address. I'm using a UK Alexa, so most of the really interesting developments (hell, even most of the boring ones) are locked away behind the 'what do you mean 'Murica isn't the only country' wall of indifference (I mean ffs, dlink STILL haven't got their skill published outside of the US.. They're one of, what, the top 3 smart plug manufacturers? Released their US skill 12 months ago?).  \n  \nI use a Dot, between kitchen and lounge. it's great in the kitchen (with lists, and timers and stuff). It's brilliant with my harmony hub (via Yonomi, rather than Logitech or ifttt...because, 'Murica. Yes I know these skills finally came across, months after I worked around their absence.. But still.). It won't work with the smart plugs I've got. Or any zwave hubs available locally... Or, well, much other than some hue stuff; And if I write a custom hook for my unsupported AC I'm going to have to say \"Alexa, trigger my living room air\".  And the real cherry... If I ask her a trivia question that isn't how tall is actorB (for the sake of argument, who was the previous prime minister of Australia), she will effectively tell me to google it. And everything I use her for... Well, her friend Google likes to do those things too.\n\nI'm standing on the precipice of throwing money at this voice controlled home thing... But all I can think is I bought the wrong flavour.  Should I switch teams? Talk me out of it? Or talk me into it??",
  "Or am I being stupid?",
  "I'm looking into making a new trivia skill for Alexa that allows two players (a 'One' and a 'Two'), and each person would sit on opposite sides of the Echo and shout their player number when they think they know the answer. Is it possible to make Alexa listen while speaking, and stop if she hears something? Thank you.",
  "I'd like to see a study buddy skill, where you (or a teacher) can upload a set of questions and answers and have Alexa quiz you on it. Basically, a customizable version of the many trivia skills that already exist. It would be great for kids for math fact tables, vocabulary, etc. \n\nI have a little technical skill and would be happy to build it, but I don't really know how to start. PM me if you're interested in helping me get started. ",

  "I was googling a Echo skills list and came across this thread. \nI am new to Reddit and this is my 1st post ever\n.\nI went thru the skills list on the Echo app, it is now 31 pages long. \n\nMost of the skills are still crap, a few are small audience.      \nAnyway, here is the complete list of skills as compiled by me from the Echo app over the last day or 3: \n\n(it was a PIA getting this list formatted to Reddit rules and it has to be split into 2 posts.

  "I was playing with trivia Alex skill. The question was who played Freddy in the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and one of the potential answers was  Sean Pennsylvania. Obviously, I believe she meant Sean Penn, but, I don't know if the Echo system read the abbreviation Penn as being for Pennsylvania instead of being for Sean 's last name.

  "I received my Echo last week and within the first hour of playing with it, I decided I was going to return it. Here's why: almost none of the music that I wanted to listen to was available via Prime Music. To nearly every response, Alexa offered either a sample (WTF???), a shittier live version, or a karaoke version (double WTF). I was so incredibly disappointed. I bitched about it on FB, and several of my friends canceled their pre-orders.\n\nBut then I didn't send it back. It's still sitting here on my desk, and I've ordered a separate power cord so I can move it back to my nightstand. Why? I'll admit it's partly laziness, but also I've found that I use it a good bit during the day. \n\nWithout looking up, grabbing my phone, etc etc I can just ask Alexa to set a timer. I do the Pomodoro technique while I work (25 mins of solid work, 5 mins break), so setting timers is something I do a lot.\n\nAlso, instead of looking up random bits of information, I just ask Alexa. She knows all sorts of trivia. I can also ask her to tell me today's news (NPR news update), the weather, and she'll play the old talk radio station I listened to when I lived in AZ.\n\nBasically, I realized that I don't really want to listen to good music on the Echo when I can listen to music on my nice speakers connected to my laptop. I subscribe to Spotify which is infinitely better than Prime Music. Echo is NOT a music player, though that is a side benefit of what it provides.\n\nIn very intrigued with what Amazon might do with Echo in the future, and if nothing interesting ever happens, $100 isn't too much for me to spend on a toy that might just end up turning into a glorified alarm clock.",
  "It\u2019s nearly been a month that my unlimited account stopped playing on my Echo group. So while I wait for Amazon support to bounce the ticket around I have been playing radio stations, but they don\u2019t play on the group, only the head group member.   Is this a limitation of these devices?",
  "Not sure what\u2019s going on. \n\nIt was working fine and then today, it started to happen. \n\nWhen I ask Alexa to play music or internet radio, a few speakers won\u2019t play any music at all. No Amazon music, no TuneIn radio stations. \n\n\nIs it just me? Or did something happen today?",
  "For about a week and a half now, Alexa can't find the Apple Music Radio \"Classic Alternative\" station. It's still there in the Apple Music app, plays no problem.

  "Just checking if this is a known issues as it\u2019s only just started in past day and all was good before.

If the opticial is disconnected then no issues. Any ideas?",

Just to be certain, I changed my account password several days ago, and I am still having this problem (four or five times just today, grr.)\n\nI'll be contacting SXM customer support but I wanted to ask here to see if anyone else has had this problem, especially if it's been resolved for you.

Can I make Alexa play the whole show with all episodes in order? Can I make her play the episode I want?\n\nThanks a lot, I'm totally new to these intelligent speakers.",
  "**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called \"Everywhere Turntable\" specifically for that purpose, that includes the Link. Now I can use the \"Everywhere\" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue. Some comments claim to confirm the issue was fixed, but it most certainly was not.",

Here is one of the songs dedicated to our CB fans.\u201d And then it plays some foreign song - not via Spotify though.\n\nWhen I then try to play something/anything else (another radio station or Spotify for example), it says \u201cSay start, to hear more song for our CB\u201d and waits for me to say something else. I need to say \u201cAlexa, stop\u201d for it to snap out of its weird CB fans obsession.

Only way I can find it is if I tap Echo Devices and find it there. 5th gen model feels like it\u2019s still in beta at this stage\n\nEdit 2: still no solution, but I did figure out that it had enabled the Namma R.

I do not radio stream, I don't do podcasts, I only want to listen to my bought music on equipment I purchased using liscensed music I also bought?   \n\n\nCameras often have RTSP for direct connection, Anybody found a way to access the speakers to play together or combined with or without bluetooth?   \n\n\nI regret buying these POSs useless echos, Bought 4 from Woot.

  "When I ask Alexa to play my local radio station, it does, but only after playing a couple ads from TuneIn. In Winamp, I can play the stream via a direct url. Can I get Alexa to play this url and bypass TuneIn?",
  "Okay, this one is going to be annoying I think.\n\nBackground: I used Wink for about 7 years for smart home automation/voice control via Alexa (this started way before Echos had radios for this stuff) and since Wink has been slowly dying and having had occasions where Wink was out for long periods of time I decided to just migrate to having Alexa/Echo handle my devices.\n\nMigrating over went pretty smoothly, there were a few z-wave devices I had to replace but about two weeks ago I finished moving everything over and things seemed to be working pretty well. There were a few occasions where lights would show as offline but often if I tried to actually work them they would work. I have one light (very very old GE bulb) that I've had to turn off and on a few times to get it to be happy again, but these bulbs were also ones that would occasionally drop off Wink altogether and have to be paired again. (If it keeps up I'll probably replace the bulb. But it's not a huge deal based on where it in and how often it's happened.)\n\nSo now we make it to last night, and I come home and notice that a lot of the outdoor lights didn't turn on on schedule. After taking an inventory of what was working vs what wasn't it became clear that the devices not working were all connected to one of my Echos (Kitchen) and the devices connected to a different Echo (Living Room) seemed to still be working.\n\nI rebooted the Kitchen Echo (it was potentially acting a little strange in other ways, but I didn't troubleshoot anything else before the reboot) and these devices still didn't work.\n\nI did some Googling and didn't find anything terribly helpful. The Echo in question is clearly on the Internet and can play music and control the devices that are still working. Waiting a few hours didn't fix anything and things were still not working this morning. One interesting aspect is that the non-working devices are a mix of Zigbee and Bluetooth (and the devices working from the other Echo include both Zigbee and Bluetooth) so it doesn't seem like it's a likely problem with a weak mesh, etc.\n\nI haven't attempted to reset any of the devices and see what happens if I rediscover them, but that's likely what I'll do this evening for the more important devices.\n\nSo ahead of calling Amazon's support which seems to be where I think I'm at, are the any potential common fixes that I might have overlooked? There doesn't seem to be a lot of control or diagnostics available about what is happening.\n\nI suspect I'll have to reset the unit (and reconfigure all the devices connected to it, I'm assuming?) to determine if the Echo is actually broken or just malfunctioning. So I'm expecting to do that eventually.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.",
  "So I was thinking of using some of my spare echos around an office, mainly waiting room and hallways. That would let me use my prime music and other subscriptions in a couple different rooms. It would also be easy for people to change the stations if they wanted. Only problem if they had voice controled enabled and linked to my account then people would have access to my account and be able to order stuff or get any personal information they could ask alexa for. \n\nIs there any way to set individual echos to still be linked to my account and be able to switch radio channels and mute or unmute but nothing else unless done from my alexa app.\n\nThe office is a nonprofit charity, so trying to avoid spending extra money on monthly subscriptions or extra sounds systems since thats less money for the clients and since some of the clients often have various auditory or anxiety issues its good to both have music and have the ability for them to easily change it or turn it off.\n\nThankd",
  "For the past 3 years, I start the Echo in my child's room, asking it to play a classical artist at bedtime. \"Alexa play Bach.\" \n\nTonight I go for Vivaldi and the response is: \"Music by Antonio Vivaldi is not available on iHeart Radio\"\n\nThat's strange, I don't use iHeart Radio. \n\nSo I try, \"Play music by Vivaldi on Amazon Music\"\n\nThe response is, \u201cMusic by Antonio Vivaldi is only available on Amazon Music Unlimited...

  "Hi\n\nNewbie alert. Sorry!\n\nMy family use Echo devices but my wife and I are currently on Google Home.\n\nI'm thinking seriously about jumping ship from Google Home to Alexa stuff.\n\n(Fed up with the number of showstopper bugs in the Google ecosystem that have been present for 3+ years that are never going to get fixed; in particular, we're running out of sensible namespace for device/group names due to a large collection of ghost devices/group names that are stuck in my account on Google's servers that can't be deleted, even after using tricks like deleting the entire home, or using an old version of the Google Home app. Things on the Google side aren't improving over time, but they're definitely getting worse, and it's started to break me.)\n\nWhat's stopping me jumping ship is my ignorance about the Echo ecosystem.  I've set up some Echo Shows for my parents at their home but I didn't really know what I'm doing to be honest!  I've had a bit if a search through previous discussions in this group but I'm still a bit nonplussed.  \n\nSo... I have some questions, if that's okay?\n\n\n**Currently-**\n\n*What we have:*  My wife and I both have our own Android phones and our own Google accounts.  We're two members on a single Google smart Home.  We have a collection of Google Mini speakers.  We have some smart devices (lights etc).  \n\n*What we do:*  The Google smart speakers recognise our individual voices and allow us to manage our own individual calendars by voice, our own individual to-do/shoppings by voice, our collaborative/shared lists by voice, and of course control our smart devices.\n\n\n**My questions**\n\n1. Will the Echo devices recognise who's talking and personalise activities and data based on that?  *Optional*\n2. Can we have multiple shared lists that we both manage by voice?  (By shared I mean, one of us adds an item, the other deletes an item, but we're both managing the shared list at the same time.)  And via a simple/intuitive syntax that's easy to remember?  *Absolutely Essential*\n3. Can we manage collaborative shared lists with someone else, outside of the home, with a different Amazon account?   *Optional*.\n4. Can we manage our own private lists by voice?  *Optional*\n5. Can we see our lists easily on our phones?  *Essential*  5. Can we see the content on lists on our our phone on a live widget?  *Optional*\n6. Can we each manage our separate Google Calendars by voice?  *Very much preferred, but optional*\n\nI think almost everything else we can be adaptive about.

  "Hi.  I like my Echo Auto, but the one that that drove me nuts was when I wanted to talk to Alexa, I'd have to turn my car's stereo to Bluetooth audio to hear her.  I'm almost *never* listening to music from my phone; it's usually my USB stick or the satellite radio.  So I was in Best Buy recently and wandering about bored and saw they sell a [$20 Bluetooth powered speaker with 3.5mm input](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/insignia-rugged-portable-bluetooth-speaker-black/5204300.p?skuId=5204300).  Nice thing is, it's fairly compact too *(at least in relation to the other options BB had)*.  I bought that and some [Scotch brand 10# velcro](https://www.amazon.com/SCOTCH-Fasteners-Extremely-Strong-Holds/dp/B07M6Z4SVN/ref=sr_1_12) *(I like it because it's not fuzzy velcro, it's hard plastic and reassuringly \"clicks\" into place)* and a [10' right angled 3.5mm cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WS1NFA6?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details).  I mounted the speaker on the side of my center console, ran the 3.5mm cable to the Echo and ran a micro USB from the speaker to a switched USB I had installed *(my regular cig lighter ports stay hot when the key is out...  didn't want to drain my battery so I had a dual type A female USB port installed)*.  It worked, but had a static whine.  I assumed it was a ground loop, so I bought a [cheap ground loop isolator](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BRSQ7JY?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) and put that inline and voila, sounds great now.\n\nSo now any time I talk to Alexa, I can hear her reply regardless of what my car stereo is doing.  I do have to turn it down sometimes because it's not super loud but that's much less hassle than changing inputs.  Mounting it facing me instead of facing away and down at foot level I'm sure would help that, lol, but for my car this was the most practical location.  I also found that having the Echo on vol level 10 with the speaker on max volume isn't a good idea, sounds harsh.  Echo vol 9 though sounds fine.\n\nI am sure someone already has posted something like this in the past, but figured I'd share as well just in case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08fttz5e1by81.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bab3605926074324f5cf7391c202953c47e101b4\n\nRight angle cables FTW lol:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6wqm9y0pcy81.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a6e113327855169a72bc647bb43965442fa8568",

Then when the station I am listening to goes to commercials I would normally jump around to another station...only for Alexa to play me another ad defeating the whole purpose. I guess  my questions are this:\n\n1) why is this happening all of a sudden when it never did before?\n2) anyway to skip it?",
  "Hi everyone,\n\nNo, you\u2019re not the only one that experience the annoying issue with TuneIn and Multiroom audio.\n\nAbout 2 months ago, TuneIn made a change on their Alexa Built in service/skill.\nWhen you select a radio station to play, a \u201cTuneIn\u201d jingle plays first, then your radio station.\nUnless it\u2019s on Multiroom speakers.\nThen the audio it\u2019s pitched (a bit too high, like on steroids, or low, like d-devils - dance with the devil).\n\nI decided to contact Amazon\u2019s support chat.\nThey REALLY tried to blame it on my Wifi, router, echoes, ISP, made me reset my echoes, unpair Multiroom speaker sets etc.\nI even sent them the links of the 2 threads I\u2019ve found here regarding the issue and insisted that I\u2019m not the only one experiencing the bug and that it\u2019s a service issue not a device issue. \n\nAfter a 2 hour chat session the representative files a report for the bug and I got an email.\n\nToday I got another email stating that they\u2019re looking for a fix.\n\nPosting both screenshots and will try to keep you guys updated on the progress,\n\nIn the meantime I strongly encourage you to contact them through email or chat so that they get that it\u2019s a broad issue. \n\n[First contact](https://i.imgur.com/ilpoJd8.png)\n\n[Update](https://i.imgur.com/4gj7kL9.png)",

Removed all echo devices from that room and re-added them.\u00a0\n\n2. Different echo devices of different generations\n\n3. Bought a new Yamaha AVR (which is the 'connected speaker') \n\n4. Created a new room and added the devices to a new group\n\n5.

Using the Spotify Android App tp 'send' music the Yamaha connected speaker (thus to the Alexa group) works fine.\n\n  \nAll of my above testing tells me there must be a BUG in the Spotify Alexa Skill since this problem ONLY happens with Spotify in this specific case with a speaker in an Alexa group",

  "I'm trying to help out my mother, who lives 3,000 miles away, with a weird Echo Dot problem she's having. I've never run across something like this before, so wondering if someone can shed any light on any possible answer.\n\nShe has two Echo Dots. She likes listening to WCKR-FM on TuneIn (a large New York City jazz station--she lives in NYC). The problem is this:\n\n* When she asks either Echo Dot to play WCKR (or any other radio station) on TuneIn, it works fine.\n\n* When she asks either Echo Dot to play any station *other* than WKCR on TuneIn, casting to the \"everywhere\" group, it works fine.\n\n* But when she asks either Echo Dot to play WKCR on TuneIn, casting to the \"everywhere\" group, the radio station's music sounds sped up (like a 33rpm record played at 45rpm) and then stops after about 15 seconds or so.\n\nI was on the phone with her tonight. To try to fix it, I had her reboot both Echo Dots, and we also deleted and recreated the \"everywhere\" group. None of that fixed it.\n\nI am absolutely befuddled. She says she used to be able to play WKCR to the everywhere group without a problem, but a few weeks ago it started doing this weird behaviour. Any ideas on what this might be and how we can fix it?",

  "I have 4 morning routines to keep my ADHD kid on track and reduce my impulse to nag.  Each one of those routines involves playing Disney Radio on Pandora.  \n\n\nSo, the 7:45 am routine connects to a BlueTooth speaker by his bedroom.  It plays a Good Morning message, the time, \\[used to announce weather\\], tells him the tasks he needs to accomplish by 8 am, then used to play music for 15 minutes.  After that, the routine has Alexa ask him if he's succeeded and reminds him to check in with me.  This used to be run through the Show 5, but is now run through an Echo Dot, since I relocated the Show 5 too far away from the BT speaker.  For the past week or so, the tasks are announced and then the routine goes silent.  No music.  After 15 minutes, it doesn't run the final part of the routine, either.    \n\n\nIt does work when I test the routine, just not when it triggers.  It also tends to trigger 1 to 4 minutes late.  \n\n\nThe other 3 routines run on the tall Echo, my oldest device.  The music streaming will trigger, though sometimes it randomly selects Disney Radio Chile(??) on the first Breakfast Routine.  It also fails to reset the volume to 5 once the music starts.  The second Breakfast Routine never selects DR Chile and I have that structured to break every 5 minutes for a reminder about how much time is left for Breakfast.  I don't like having 2 Breakfast Routines, but fusing them didn't work for some reason.  Finally, the Morning Clean-up/Get Ready for School Routine activates, changes to Kids Bop (ugh) and runs through perfectly.  Always on time.  No BT speaker for any of these Routines.  \n\n\nI don't feel like this is a problem with the BT speaker connection.  It will play music from Spotify, Pandora, and iHeart Radio from the Echo Dot at any other time of the day.  If I test the Routine, the BT speaker plays Disney Radio on Pandora.  \n\n\nI think the routine broke the same time I switched Alexa's default weather to Big Sky.  I deleted playing the weather from the routine, since the music wouldn't play afterwards.  Do I just need to re-write the Routine altogether instead of editing it?    \n\n\nIf anyone has any good Routines that help you or your family with ADHD challenges, please share!",

  "I bought the echo show 5 along with a supported amcrest video camera. I got the camera and the Alexa on my network.

My wife wants the audio and video feed from the camera to stay on the echo the whole night.\n\nI read about turning off the ambient clock but that didn\u2019t seem to do it. I tried to turn off nighttime mode but that didn\u2019t do it nothing seems to work. After a few minutes the echo just goes back to showing me new stories and photos and such.\n\nThere has to be a way to do this right?

  "My experience has been that using speaker groups (and after rebooting routers and all the Echo Dots in the house per Amazon's recommendation), the least reliable streaming service is the premium Amazon HD service I pay for.\n\nIndividual speakers will drop off, and occasionally come back, sometimes not. Sometimes I get the whole pause in the middle of a song, and then it will pick up moments later, sometimes in the middle of the song or on the next in the playlist.  All scenarios that I bet most here are familiar with.\n\nSame speaker group, I can stream my free Pandora stations, i\u2764radio, TuneIn, as well as subscribed XM Radio and Apple music uninterrupted for hours.\n\nI can imagine in my head that the Amazon Music is being too cleaver by half in the background because of the limitation of six continuous streams, so it's testing things regularly and interrupting the stream or serving a new stream URL to make sure everything is honest.  I've tried just streaming to 2 or 3 instead of 4 or 5 speakers in a group and that doesn't help.  \\*Most\\* of the time streaming to a single speaker anywhere in the house will stream uninterrupted.\n\nI'll probably keep the music service because I like the Ultra-HD lossless playback.  I certainly won't keep it because it's the most reliable stream on their very own speakers! \ud83e\udd23",

  "Hey everyone,  \n\n\nas of last Wednesday I'm now the owner of a second Gen Echo Show 5, which I am so far mostly satisfied with.  \nI do however have to issues with it.\n\nFirstly, my routine that is supposed to trigger 'When an alarm is dismissed' instead triggers at exactly the same time as the alarm which at first sounds like Alexa is talking over the spotify radio only to result in her quickly suppressing it, going through everything she's supposed to say just fine and the radio station resuming afterwards until I eventually dismiss the alarm, which does not trigger the routine again. So at least it only fires once, even if it does so before it's supposed to.\n\nThe second issue is with my Google Calendar, which Alexa has access to yet seemingly being unable to find anything on it. If I ask her what's on my calendar for even the busiest week of mine, the most she comes up with is official holidays, yet nothing personal I might have personally added to said calendar.  \nMind you, I have not added a single event through Alexa, they were all on the calendar before it was linked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who may be able to point out flaws in my design or otherwise help with solving this.",

Not my phone this weekend updated to Android 11 and of course the old app will no longer run.\n\n  Trying to start a station on the auto now results in that same old \"couldn't find the station you requested\" response.\n\n  It seems like Amazon has broken the Tunein skill and has not fixed it in almost a year.\n\n    Am I alone?  Is there a known fix?",
  "So I'll say things like \"play some country music\" and every time Alexa says \"here's a station you might like, Top Country on Amazon Music\".  And it plays a station that seems to have the same MAYBE 15 songs, it will even loop during the same session.\n\n\"Play music I like\".... and it will play songs I've thumbed up.     I guess I'm looking for more of a Pandora type of functionality (recognizing I can simply play Pandora on there).   \n\nI can play an artist, then i can say play songs like this ... but I really dont want to think about what I want to listen to, just play something.  \n\nLately the workaround has been playing radio stations, but ads, etc.\n\n\\[Mind you - I'm  tech saavy, but this is something I dont identify with the younger streaming generation.  I'm used to turning on a channel and watching it, rather than the 'on-demand' approach lately.}",

  "Hello. I am looking for an advice regarding commands that mix two languages. Since Czech is not supported, I have Amazon Echo switched to English, no problem there. Until I want to lsiten to a Czech song or a Czech radio station. When I say in English \"Alexa play <name of a Czech song>\" I get something different. Sometimes I can horribly mispronounce a word like an American without any knowledge of Czech would do, sometimes I can spell shorter string, like a band name or a radio station.\n\nMy question is, are there any workarounds? E.g. radio station presets in a cell phone app, then I say Alexa play me the station #2? (I tried to make a station my favorite and she said it wasn't a supported feature). Or mark albums on Amazon Music/Spotify my favorite and then somehow get her to play them?\n\nThanks.",

Is this something I can fix or is this something that I'm stuck with?",

If I start with one song on Everywhere, and request \"play more like that,\" Alexa will not continue on the Everywhere group - even having started there with the first song request - but reduces play back to the single device where the request was made.  How can this be so difficult, or impossible?\n\nI play plenty of things on the Everywhere group, but I have to know the playlist to start it that way; I can't be moving to the kitchen and 'expand' what I started in the living room.\n\nI don't use Spotify.

  "A few months back my Echo shows would not respond to the command STOP when listening to an Audio Skill such as BBC or Times Radio. Overnight the problem went away but in the last week the problem has returned and the only way to stop these skills is to say \u2018 Alexa ask BBC STOP\u2019.

  "I bought my wife an Echo 5 for her office for Christmas and we've all loved having it. I recently decided to get an Echo 8 for our kitchen. The only problem is the commands we regularly make for music to the 5 are not recognized by the 8, for instance:\n\n\"Alexa, play happy music\" - The 5 will play uplifting 80's, dance, etc. music. The 8 will say \"I could not find any happy music\"\n\n\"Alexa, play meditation music\" - The 5 would open a really good meditation playlist on Amazon Music, the 8 opens a radio station in iHeart radio.\n\nThese are just two examples, there's more music commands we make that are recognized by the 5, but not the 8. \n\nThe 8 is also constantly telling us \"I can't do that right now\" when asking for the weather.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n\nEdit: did some troubleshooting- deregistered and the factory reset the Echo 8. Now I realized it won't play any Amazon Music at all. Even tapping the \"Helpful Tips - Play Top Hits\" on the Echo screen causes Alexa to say \"I can't find any Top Hits music\".\n\nEcho 5 is working perfectly fine and will recognize all of the commands.

  "I set a weekday alarm on my bedside Echo Dot to play my local public radio station.  The  problem is that the alarm volume plays at the same level as when the Dot was last used (e.g., if I stopped listening to music during the day at volume 6, the next alarm radio volume would be 6).  I want a gentle wake up at volume 2.\n\nIn response, I created a routine that was to occur every morning at 3 am to set volume to 2.  It never worked.  Maybe it's because there was nothing playing at 3 am?  IDK.\n\nYesterday, I disabled the alarm and created this routine:  (1) when it is 5 am on weekdays, (2) set volume to 2, (3) \"Alexa, play public radio.\"  This morning the alarm did not come on.  \n\nAny ideas what I am doing wrong and how I can fix this morning volume problem?",

  "New Echo user. I usually wake up at 6am on weekdays, except for one day where I sleep in until 7. If I ask Alexa to play \u201cthe latest\u201d podcast episode of NY Times The Daily when I wake up, I end up with the previous day\u2019s episode, except for the day when I wake up at 7am, which correctly plays that day\u2019s episode. \n\nI am unsure why this happens. I am in the pacific time zone, so theoretically these episodes should have long been updated by the time I wake at 6am. I have tried setting alarms, routines, or just directly asking Alexa to play the latest outright, and I\u2019ve found that if it\u2019s at 6am (or around then) I invariably get the previous day\u2019s episode. \n\nDoes anyone else experience this issue? I use Apple Music as my default music/podcast source and so I thought that perhaps since I use a third party service, perhaps Amazon has some kind of limitation to delay refreshes on these services.

How much difference exists between giving commands on a Tap or on an Echo Dot?",
  "Hey all, \nSo I've tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling, unlinking and linking my spotify account, and I'm out of ideas. \n\nThe basics of it is this, if I request a specific song, like \"Alexa, play Ring of Fire\", Alexa will reply back, \"playing Johnny Cash Radio Station\" and then sometimes it will be that song and other times not.\n\nAnother issue is with skipping, is it normal that I can only say \"play next\" or \"skip\" like 6 times in an hour? Is there a certain command I am missing?\n\nI also get 30 second advertisements from time to time (Mindy Kaling from the Office is what I remember), yet on my phone or laptop, I never get any ads when listening on Spotify.\n\nI have Spotify set to the default music source in the app, and for experimentation I tried setting it to Amazon Music, but it did not change much, except that I would get ads telling me about the low price of Amazon Music. I mean, I have been paying for Spotify for many years now, and it has worked well for me all this time. I don't believe I should have to pay for 2 music listening services simultaneously.\n\nI am fairly new to the amazon speaker scene, and would appreciate any help if you've come across something like this. Thank you for reading and have a great day!",

  "I have a first generation Echo, the tall black cylinder. It sits in our kitchen and my wife mainly uses it to listen to the radio and set timers for cooking. Recently she noticed it wasn't playing radio stations when asked.\n\nThe voice command \"Alexa, play Radio 2\" is replied to with \"Here's BBC Radio 2\" and then a short \"BBC Sound System\" ident (which I think is broadcast by BBC). Then... nothing.\n\nThe voice command \"Alexa, play Radio X UK\" is replied to with \"Here's Radio X from Global Player\". Then... nothing.\n\nI've tried de-registering and re-registering the device to my Amazon account. I've tried a full factory reset (pressing the button underneath). Both will solve the issue for a couple of hours, then it returns. Power cycling the device will sometimes solve the issue for a short while.\n\nI've been on the phone with Amazon Support and demonstrated the issue for them. They've run through their script for solving issues (re-registering, factory reset etc.) but couldn't solve the issue. Their response was to offer a 25% discount off a new Echo device as this one is well out of warranty.\n\nOne thing that is peculiar, is that the device is not discoverable in the app when setting up. I've tried on two different devices (iPhone x and Asus Tablet) and neither can find the device during setup, so I have to use my laptop and connect directly to the device to give it its wifi credentials.\n\nAll other functions seem to work OK; timers, news bulletins, weather requests, sing me happy birthday etc. etc. It's just radio that is the issue.\n\nIt's not a wifi issue, I have a mesh wifi system that provides full coverage throughout the house to three fire sticks, two echo dots, a Fire TV and an Echo 3rd Gen. All devices work flawlessly. The Dot that's currently plugged in to the same place in the kitchen works fine on all functions.\n\nAnyone have any idea how I can get radio back?",

  "My parents just upgraded from DSL to AT&T Fixed Wireless. As such, they no longer have a public IP and have no port forwarding capability either. Their Alexa devices fail to operate correctly now, and AT&T has stated it's due to the lack of port forwarding capability.

They've gotten quite use to the automation capabilities and hate to lose it.\n\n\nEdit: This may be a solution, posted just today a few hours ago. Will update if it works for them. \nTL;DR: the Pace Modem/Router combo is dual-band with band steering, which causes issues with the Echo's radio.

  "tl;dr: somehow got echo dot to play from two separate audio sources simultaneously without a mixer, and got firetv stick to stream audio only to a third party bluetooth speaker.\n-------------------\nI have a dumb TCL tv with firestick, an echo dot w/ 2 external speakers connected to the firestick as an 'audio system', and a JBL bluetooth speaker (google assistant). \n\nI usually have the echo dot play thunderstorm or rain sounds when I go to bed. One day I decided to use the dot as a bluetooth speaker and play an audiobook from my phone. I connected the bluetooth while thunderstorm was playing and it played both the audiobook and the thunderstorm sounds at the same time.\n\nIt's very hacky and inconsistent. If I just say \"Alexa, pair\", or \"Alexa connect my phone\", my phone's audio will override the Echo Dot's original audio. I have to go into my phone's bluetooth settings manually and disconnect and reconnect bluetooth multiple times to get it working even once. \n\nThe other hack is that I was able to get firestick playing audio on the JBL speaker from a Netflix show while the TV was completely off. I came across this by pure chance and haven't gotten it working again since. Basically I had the JBL speaker hooked up as a bluetooth speaker so I can listen to The Witcher while I was in the kitchen. A few days later I thought I could use the echo dot to turn on my TV without using a remote. If I said \"Alexa, turn on my TV\" I get a \"Sorry, your TV doesn't support that\". But if I said \"Alexa, turn on firetv\", followed by something like \"play <show> on Netflix\", or even just \"Alexa, play Witcher on Netflix\". I could get audio streaming to the speakers.\n\nUsing the echo dot is only way I've found to decouple the firetv stick from my TV. If I used the firestick remote, original TCL remote, or the power button on the TV itself, it'll either shut off or turn on both devices since they're tightly coupled. It also only works with the JBL speaker (or maybe any non-amazon speaker). I've tried an echo flex in both group mode and bluetooth mode and couldn't replicate it.\n\nNow, I know most people don't care about this second functionality. But I like to turn on Netflix's narration mode and basically listen to certain shows as a radio drama. And I think being able to play rain sounds with music (or music with audiobook, or rain sounds with audiobook) is pretty cool.",

  "I got an Amazon Echo for Christmas 2018. For the past two years I have used it as an alarm set to a radio station through tunein. I set it with the command, \"Alexa, wake me up at [time] to [radio station].\" It has worked consistently for two years: the echo starts playing the radio station at the requested time, and will continue to play for an hour if I don't stop or snooze. As of last week this has changed: about 30 seconds after the radio station starts playing, a chime/alarm begins sounding (sort of a musical \"doodly-doodly-do, doodly-doodly-do\"). Asking Alexa to \"stop\" turns off the chime but also the radio station. This has disrupted my morning routine and made me very confused and grumpy at the start of every day.

  "I bought a FireTV on sale a while ago and it came with an Echo Show.  I did not want one, but I wasn't going to turn that down.  Just the other day I decided to give it shot.  I really only want to use it to control my TV.\n\nI have an old-school, basic S/PDIF surround sound receiver hooked up to my FireTV.  This is the only speaker I am interested in using.\n\nAfter some screwing around I was able to get my Echo to control my TV (More or less), though it is pretty terrible.\n\n\nMy main issue is that when I ask Alexa to do something it will mute my receiver part-way through responding.  I can't determine a reason.  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  It basically makes the entire thing useless because I have to unmute the receiver, and I can't really ask the Echo for any information because it just cuts itself off.\n\n\nMy Echo also does not turn on my receiver when I ask it to to turn on the TV.  This is not an IR issue, as I am aware that the receiver controls are being emitted from the FireTV remote.  It still doesn't work regardless of if the remote is pointed at the receiver or not.  I don't know if this is solvable, but it also makes it pretty useless.  No sound means no music.  I don't really see why this is the way it is.  If I ask Alexa to change the volume it controls the receiver just fine.\n\n\nA third issue is actually playing music.  I use Pandora as my default music service.  When I do already have my TV on AND ask Alexa to play music AND it doesn't mute itself, it doesn't actually open Pandora on the TV.  I don't know how to explain what it does, but it is buggy to say the least.  Sometimes it'll show a fullscreen display with the song, or something it'll show a fullscreen display of the last song and never change, or sometimes it'll just play in the background with no way to interact with it on the TV.  I also can't find any effective way to change my Pandora station to one of my custom stations.\n\n\nSorry for the wall of unformatted garbage, but I think unformatted garbage is an accurate description of my experiences with the Alexa so far.  It's a real damn shame since stand-alone, the Echo Show worked great.  Considering it came with the TV, I thought it would interact better with it.\n\n\nTLDR; My Echo keeps muting itself mid-sentence for no reason, and fails at every other task.  Please let me know if there is a fix to the above issues.  Thanks.",

  "**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called \"Everywhere Turntable\" specifically for that purpose, that includes the Link. Now I can use the \"Everywhere\" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue.

  "I have Apple Music setup as my preferred music source, but when asking Alexa to \u201cplay songs from YEAR\u201d or \u201cbetween YEAR and YEAR\u201d, it just plays my station.

  "I have a routine set for 6am every weekday to start playing a certain radio station.

  "So I'm a fan of Art Bell and Coast to Coast AM. Reruns of his show (before it was ruined by Clear Channel and his replacement) can be found on multiple TuneIn stations, all streaming it 24/7.\n\nOne such station was U7Radio. It suddenly stopped working through Alexa, all she would return was \"U7Radio is not available right now.\" Okay, whatever. Moved onto the other one I used, Dreamland Radio.\n\nAlmost a week ago, it stopped working. Now when asking for it all you get is a bunch of looped preroll ads before Alexa *might* tell you it's \"Not available right now.\"\n\nA third TuneIn station, Advent Radio, also no longer works and returns \"Is not available right now.\"\n\nAll three of these work perfectly if you go directly to their TuneIn page or play them through the TuneIn app.\n\nNow, these stations aren't exactly official, if you catch my drift. I'm getting the feeling that Amazon is selectively blocking TuneIn streams as they see fit. Anyone else notice any of their streams suddenly no longer working through Alexa?",

  "So I was thinking of using some of my spare echos around an office, mainly waiting room and hallways. That would let me use my prime music and other subscriptions in a couple different rooms. It would also be easy for people to change the stations if they wanted. Only problem if they had voice controled enabled and linked to my account then people would have access to my account and be able to order stuff or get any personal information they could ask alexa for. \n\nIs there any way to set individual echos to still be linked to my account and be able to switch radio channels and mute or unmute but nothing else unless done from my alexa app.\n\nThe office is a nonprofit charity, so trying to avoid spending extra money on monthly subscriptions or extra sounds systems since thats less money for the clients and since some of the clients often have various auditory or anxiety issues its good to both have music and have the ability for them to easily change it or turn it off.\n\nThankd",
  "One out of our 10 Echo devices has a weird problem.  After being idle for awhile, music won't start the first time I ask.  Asking a second time makes it play normally.  Oddly, this also applies to a routine where Alexa states the weather and then plays a station.  I haveto repeat the routine a second time to get it to play - every morning.  Any ideas on why this would happen?",
  "However, I set up the Echo Show 10 in one corner of the room and have my dot in another corner and set the two as a group so that they play music together, and now my echo devices won\u2019t do anything when I say \u201cskip\u201d or \u201creplay\u201d or \u201cpause.\u201d Nothing happens. They\u2019ll quieten the music down to listen to the command and then when I\u2019m done talking, they go right back to playing. \n\nI\u2019ve also noticed that the Show has trouble hearing the wake word even when music isn\u2019t playing (when I\u2019m sitting at the desk she\u2019s sitting on), I find myself having to repeat \u201cAlexa\u201d for her to hear me pretty often.\n\nDoes anybody know why this is happening? Mainly the Spotify issue.\n\n(Edit: I\u2019ve just realized that using the touchscreen doesn\u2019t do anything either. She\u2019s currently playing my liked songs on Spotify, and will continue to the next song once one ends, but I can\u2019t skip forward or replay songs from the touchscreen either. Unlinking the two speakers and playing from just my echo show solves the Spotify control issue, but the show seems to have thrown all intuitiveness out the window. I told her to pause, and she did. I told her to play and she responds with \u201cWhat do you want me to play?\u201d And after repeating \u201cplay\u201d, she says \u201cHere\u2019s a station you might like\u2026\u201d instead of just playing the Spotify song I had paused.)",
  "I am totally new to the Echo universe.  I bought a Echo Show 8 for my 9 year old to access music since he does not have a cell phone and we don't plan on getting him one. I have added him to our Amazon Music family plan (a whole other problem because he is under 13). Well, is it possible to view the Amazon Music (AM) interface to browse music, save albums and songs to a library, create playlists?  From what I am seeing, is that this device does not do that.  We can talk to it and ask to play a particular artist or song.  The only browse capability are these stupid boxes that show generic stations or playlists. That is useless.  The kid is starting with a completely blank slate; he needs a way to browse and save stuff into his own library.  I can't even get him logged into the PC AM app because it won't let him.  He needs an account for those 13 and over and I can't create that because he needs a phone number to verify...which he does not have and I can't use mine because its connected to my account.  And even if this was just for me, how would I access such an interface?  Because if this is it, forget it!  Please let me know if I cam missing something.

  "At Alexa's suggestion, I set up a \"Good Morning\" routine in which she tells me a \"fun fact\" about today's date, and then plays my local NPR station.  Sometimes I interrupt it and on a given day, up until today, it would always repeat the same fact.  Today, I say Alexa, Good Morning.  She tells me it's Edgar Allen Poe's birthday and plays what sounds, at first like it was my station.  WIthin 5 minutes, I realize the long form piece I'm listening to is WAY too long.  I ask her what station is playing, she doesn't answer, so I say Alexa, Good Morning again.   She tells me it's National Popcorn Day, followed by the normal lead-in for my station from TuneIn , but what followed I finally realized is the station's subchannel for the visually impaired.  Both the on-air signal and the station's app play the main channel, and the other NPR station I listen to, also streamed via TuneIn is on its main channel as well (I don't know if the other station has subchannels)  Any ideas about what's going on and how to fix it?",

  "My elderly mom's Amazon account has always been part of my Household.  You don't get to share Amazon Music (from Prime, not the full version) directly, but she's always signed into my account on her device (\"A\\*\\*\\*a, switch accounts').\n\nThis always allowed her to use Prime Music as I would, though the 1-device-at-a-time restriction was still in effect.  I built a huge library of custom playlists for her.  They always worked fine. \n\nNow, whenever she asks for specific music (and I tested this), she gets \"Here's a station you might like\", which, of course, is riddled with ads every song-and-a-half.  Even \"A\\*\\*\\*a, play/shuffle my playlist \\[exact name of playlist\\]\", said *in my voice*, while signed into my account, on that device produces \"Here's a station you might like\", when on devices registered to me produces the actual playlist.\n\nEvery request for music, no matter how you word it - and I have tried every permutation of \"music\", \"playlist\", \"play\", \"shuffle\", \"library\", \"Amazon Music\" - results in \"Here's a station\", on that device only, where the same command (from the same voice, to the same account) on another device works as expected.\n\nDid something change?  Are they cracking down even more on their shitty, overpriced music service?  Or is this a new technical wrinkle I haven't discovered?

I have purchasing turned off and all that jazz.  But I'm afraid if I do that I'll have to set up the wifi again and it's very, VERY difficult to get an IT person at her facility if it doesn't go well.

  "I\u2019m used to listening to Absolute Radio stations, by saying \u201cPlay Absolute 80s\u201d or \u201cPlay Absolute 70s\u201d etc. It has always been the Absolute Radio skill that has been used, which is a bit annoying when you stop playback, as it always thanks me for listening. I can put up with that, though.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed this week, though, that it seems to be the Planet Radio skill that\u2019s triggering when I ask to listen (I didn\u2019t install this skill). Fair enough. Today, though, if I ask it to \u201cPlay Absolute 70s\u201d, it\u2019s the Absolute Radio skill that gets used, but it just plays the normal Absolute Radio channel, not the 70s variant. I just can\u2019t get it to play the station at all. I\u2019ve tried removing the Absolute Radio and Planet Radio skills, but when I ask to play, it tells me that I used to use the Absolute Radio skill to do that, and do I want to re-install.

Is there a certain command I am missing?\n\nI also get 30 second advertisements from time to time (Mindy Kaling from the Office is what I remember), yet on my phone or laptop, I never get any ads when listening on Spotify.\n\nI have Spotify set to the default music source in the app, and for experimentation I tried setting it to Amazon Music, but it did not change much, except that I would get ads telling me about the low price of Amazon Music.

Recently she noticed it wasn't playing radio stations when asked.\n\nThe voice command \"Alexa, play Radio 2\" is replied to with \"Here's BBC Radio 2\" and then a short \"BBC Sound System\" ident (which I think is broadcast by BBC). Then... nothing.\n\nThe voice command \"Alexa, play Radio X UK\" is replied to with \"Here's Radio X from Global Player\".

They've run through their script for solving issues (re-registering, factory reset etc.) but couldn't solve the issue. Their response was to offer a 25% discount off a new Echo device as this one is well out of warranty.\n\nOne thing that is peculiar, is that the device is not discoverable in the app when setting up.

  "I got an Amazon Echo for Christmas 2018. For the past two years I have used it as an alarm set to a radio station through tunein. I set it with the command, \"Alexa, wake me up at [time] to [radio station].\" It has worked consistently for two years: the echo starts playing the radio station at the requested time, and will continue to play for an hour if I don't stop or snooze. As of last week this has changed: about 30 seconds after the radio station starts playing, a chime/alarm begins sounding (sort of a musical \"doodly-doodly-do, doodly-doodly-do\"). Asking Alexa to \"stop\" turns off the chime but also the radio station. This has disrupted my morning routine and made me very confused and grumpy at the start of every day.

  "I recently set up a stereo pair of Gen. 3 Dots and I can't get any Amazon Music stations to play by voice command. When I ask Alexa to play stations on Amazon Music that previously played, I now get a response saying l, \"I could not find a station named [station name] on Amazon Music.\"\n\nI can still play the stations from the Alexa app via the Recently Played section. I can also get the stations to play by voice if I remove the stereo pair and talk to each Dot separately.\n\nI'm not sure what else to try, but it seems the stereo pair is breaking something or at least altering how I need to ask for stations to be played.",
  "I was so excited when I got my amazon echo and honestly now I wish I have never wasted the money. \n\nWhy does this gadget have the inability to shuffle songs from Apple music properly? In a playlist of over 1,000 songs, it always plays the first song first and then the exact same sequence of songs from only about the first 20. \n\nHaving a playlist is the only option because playing \u201ctiatabs13\u2019s station\u201d allows for Alexa to play shit songs of her own that I know for a FACT I don\u2019t have downloaded as every time she does this she plays a song I have never heard before in my life. I don\u2019t really feel like saying \u201cAlexa, skip\u201d every other song, but it looks like that\u2019s ultimately the only option I have, whether I let it play my \u201cstation\u201d or my playlist. \n\nIf there is any way this can be fixed, or if there is any work around please let me know cause I\u2019m close to throwing the thing out of the window.",

  "Have a very very strange problem. Here in New Zealand I have been using an Echo Show, Echo Spot and a Dot. \n\nI listen to \u201cRNZ National\u201d, a New Zealand radio station, using the TuneIn app. \n\nSince this morning, \u201cAlexa, play RNZ National on TuneIn\u201d results in the Echo Spot showing the correct background for RNZ National, but the stream is actually RNZ Concert programme instead. This is also the same (wrong) stream that plays on the Dot. \n\nI thought maybe something was going on in TuneIn. However when I went to the TuneIn app and checked it out, the RNZ National stream DOES play RNZ National, and the RNZ Concert stream plays the concert stream. \n\nTuneIn (unlike Spotify) doesn\u2019t allow me the play from the App and send it to an Echo as a connected device. So I can\u2019t get the correct RNZ National stream to play on the Echos!\n\nVery strange problem especially since the Spot shows the correct RNZ National wallpaper on the screen while playing, not the RNZ Concert stream it is actually playing!\n\nAny ideas? I have rebooted the Echos to no avail.\n\nUPDATE:  someone on another forum found a workaround. It involves creating a routine (which didn\u2019t work) but the routine points to a DIFFERENT station on TuneIn which is the same stream. Pretty dumb that the station is listed on iHeartRadio but Alexa can\u2019t access it.\n\n\n\u201cI have been using a routine to access Radio New Zealand National with TuneIn as the music source. It recently started playing the Concert programme instead.\n\nAfter exploring different ways of playing a specific url (and finding it too hard) I came back to using TuneIn. I managed to get it to play RNZ by asking for RNZ National Auckland.\n\nWhew.\n\nPlay Radio\n\nSet volume to 2\n\nSay \"Playing Radio New Zealand\"\n\nPlay RNZ National Auckland from TuneIn",

  "In the last week or so, my Echo Show 5 has having a lot of minor issues that, when combined, are making it much less useful.

Tonight, I said \"Alexa, living room light off.\" And was told a couple things share that name, \"living room light, and living room lamp.\" Which did I want?\n\nNothing is even close to that name, I don't say lamp, I usually say light. No devices in our device list. The group that all the lights are in is called living room, but as I said before this has worked fine until this moment. I tried it multiple times with no success. I just renamed the light to something else. Super frustrating though.",
  "So, I connected my echo dot to my phone via bluetooth and I use an app called Alarmy I was wondering if my alarm will ring through my echo dot?",
  "I was setting up my Echo Show to make calls and I said the short version of my wife\u2019s first name which isn\u2019t an identical match to her contact entry. It asked me if I meant and then gave me options. I used the screen but clicked my sisters name by accident. \n\nNow it always calls my sister when I say my wife\u2019s name\u2026\n\nHow do I unteach this!?",
  "I was looking for a way for my kids to be able to call me from home without a phone and I saw that calling between Alexa devices could be an option.\nSo I pulled up the app on my phone and called one of the echo devices. \nIt rang on my phone, but nothing on the Echo...\nUntil several minutes later, it finally rang on the Echo, but at that point the calling screen on my phone has long closed and it didn't show anything on my phone.\nWhat is going on there?\nAs is, it's completely useless!",
  "I lose my phone around the house constantly, and I can get Alexa to call it, but I have to keep my phone on silent most of the time, so it just vibrates.  Bc the vibrate is not loud, I have to run from room to room, and if it\u2019s on a soft surface, I can\u2019t hear it at all.  I thought maybe I could set the ring tone from Alexa to override silent mode, but since the call comes from \u201cNo Caller ID\u201d, that doesn\u2019t seem to be an option.  The other thing is that if I don\u2019t find it in time, I have to continuously end the call and recall so it doesn\u2019t just go to voicemail.  \n\nI\u2019d like it to just loudly ping my phone, similar to how you can on apple \u201cfind my phone\u201d on an iPad.  I do have an iPad, but it\u2019s not always readily available or even in the house.  I use Alexa much more, and would be the easiest option.  I\u2019ve searched online, and all I can find is the option for it to call my phone.  Surely there must be a skill for it to ping the phone instead.  \n\nI have an iPhone.  TIA!",
  "My Sony Bravia smart TV was once called \u201cTV\u201d in Alexa devices. When I recently added a second TV I removed the old \u201cTV\u201d device from Alexa, then added both TVs using new names based on the rooms. \n\nAlexa will control the Sony TV using the new name, but will also still control it using the old \u201cTV\u201d name which no longer exists in devices. \n\nHow do I cut ties with the old name?",
  "I have 3 echo dots in different rooms in my house. Is it possible to make a call from only one of them? I don't want the whole house to hear my phonecall!",
  "**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called \"Everywhere Turntable\" specifically for that purpose, that includes the Link. Now I can use the \"Everywhere\" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue. Some comments claim to confirm the issue was fixed, but it most certainly was not.",
  "There is a 50% offer in Amazon and got two Dots 5 but I so far only need one, but being so cheap I am considering to keepo the other just in case or to give to someone.\n\nSince I am totally new to these devices, to any intelligent speakers or however they are called, I was wondering how long their life is suppoused to be.\n\nI mean, I basically needed an internet radio player because in my kitchen, the traditional radio has stopped working (don't even know why, maybe they are cutting emisions?).\n\nBut for how many years can I count on these Dots 5? Will they stop working or be sluggish after a couple of years  like smartphones do after evil softwate updates to force you to buy new models?\n\nHow durable are they suppoused to be?\n\nThanks!",
  "Hi, I've been googling for an hour and I couldn't find the  answer, maybe there isn't.\n\nI want that my Echo Dot 5 starts always at low volumen, let's say 3 out of 10.\n\nI found tips to activate something called \"adaptive volume\" but it doesn't exist in Echo 5, it was in 4 but not anymore.\n\nSo when I come to thr kitchen by night and turn the radio on it is super loud as during the day I always have it at 10, and I need that it always starts at 3 by default or the neighbours will hate me or something worse.\n\nThanks.",
  "Is it possible for my mum and dad to call my daughters echo show from there echo show without the other echos ringing in the house ?",

  "I've got an Echo Connect and I need to move it from a 5ghz wifi network to 2.4 (on different SSIDs).  But when I try to use the app option to change the Wi-Fi Network it shows the three-dots progress icons and never gets farther.  Back button works, taking me back to the settings page for it.  I've tried it on both Android and IOS and they both hang at the same point.  \n\nYes, I've tried power-cycling the device.  Yes, I've rebooted my phones and computer and started the app or web page fresh (and no, there's no ad blocking active on the network).\n\nThough when I try to add a device, on IOS it says I have to use a PC connected to WiFi (presumably to work around IOS wifi switching issues).    \n\nTrying to use a PC to do it is worse, the browser just drops back to the previous alexa main page, with a banner saying using Safari or Firefox (and I was using Firefox).\n\nI know the device is live and working as incoming calls through it do get announced on the other Echo devices in the house, and it's IP address does respond to pings.\n\nHas anyone set up a Connect recently and run into similar problems?  Found a fix?",
  "A little less than a week ago, my echo studio started mishearing things. The lamp I have sitting on a shelf in my room is called \u201cshelf light\u201d and when I tell Alexa to turn it on or off, she responds with \u201cKitchen doesn\u2019t support that.\u201d Sometimes she outright ignores me, or she\u2019ll make the noise that\u2019s supposed to confirm an action and then nothing will happen. I also have an echo show that\u2019s been acting up like this.\n\nIs anyone else having issues or should I try restarting them?",
  "I\u2019m wondering if there is a skill I can use to achieve this:\n\nI am making my kids earn some cash for a thing they want. What would be useful is a skill where I can keep track of that e.g \u2018Alexa, add a coin/buck/pound/token to StroppyTeens jar.\u2019 Not an actual account, just an arbitrary tracker. \n\nI\u2019ve tried searching but I can\u2019t find anything that would easily allow this, partly because I don\u2019t know what to call it. 2 \u2018jars\u2019 would be even better, one for each. \n\nany ideas welcome :)",
  "When I first set up my Echo Show 5, it received and made calls sent to my phone number. \n\nNow it can still make calls, but if someone calls me it won't give me the prompt to pick up with my Echo? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone have any advice?",
  "I just added a new Show 15 to my account and now have two Shows in the same house on the same network - one in my basement apartment for my daughter (Daughter 1), and one upstairs for me.\n\nI want to do a call to Daughter 2's echo show (on their own, separate account in a separate city), and include Daughter 1 in the basement. Daughter 2 in other city and I have been calling back and forth (just the two of us) for years just fine. But cannot seem to add the basement daughter in contacts to be able to establish it as a 3-way. I have been searching and have not seen a way to resolve this.\n\nI tried using an old, free Amazon account to set up Home, but somehow it is already set up, but I think in the wrong direction. If I try to remove it, it says it won't be able to join another account for 180 days! The Home thing is confusing, but I think that may be the only way to get around this.\n\nWould love to know if this has been worked out and if there are some step-by-step instructions for an old, but somewhat technology savvy lady, like me?\n\nThanks.",
  "about a week or 2 ago, my unit started to just not respond to the wakeup call until I manually mute and unmute or unplug. Then a few hours after I do that, it happens again. I even factory reset and it still persists. Did a bad update drop or something? Anyone know a fix?",
  "My 90-year-old grandma lives alone and fell the other day. She has a life alert but refuses to use it because she fears it will mess with her pacemaker.\n\nMy aunt is thinking something like an echo dot could be useful for her to make calls using her voice if something like this were to happen again. She has tasked me with figuring this part out.\n\nSo the next problem is that my grandma doesn't have a smartphone, just an old flip phone. She does have an iPad, so I can setup and use the Alexa App on there for her. But I need to know that the Echo Dot can make calls if there is no bluetooth or wifi connection to an actual phone. I don't have a Dot myself, just an old Echo Show and a plug-in one for the kitchen, so I cannot test some of the scenarios I've seen in articles and videos myself.\n\nMy sister has a Dot, but so far, all calls that she's made have listed her phone number as the contact. \n\nAny help here? \n\nTIA"
