  " Hello, I have two Echo Show connected to my Blink Doorbell. I need to turn off the indoor chimes, but still receive notifications on my phone. Could someone please help me out with doing this?",
  "Hi,\n\nI am setting up my Smart Home having recently moved into a new property and thought perhaps Alexa would be a good way forward to become the primary voice assistance, after days of trying I've come to the conclusion that while the Echo devices are in general pretty good and have lots of skills and great integration with Home Assistant (with Alexa Media Player) that for natural voice control Alexa just doesn't cut it and for this I just don't want to compromise.\n\nWhat I have found is that for some crazy reason and even through Alexa knows she is in a specific room (or Group) with a set of named devices that there is no logic check that if I request a device with a device that has the same name elsewhere inside and outside of that group Alexa can't handle it and will flip flop between switching that device or the other... its crazy and very frustrating.\n\nHere is the setup:-\n\n**Group: Living Room**  \nLiving Room Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nTable Lamp  \nFloor Lamp  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both lamps above passed through from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Hall**  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Master Bedroom**  \nMaster Bedroom Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nBedside Lamp 1  \nBedside Lamp 2  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both bedside lamps passed from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Bedroom 2**  \nBedroom 2 Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \n*Lamp*  \nPlay Right (hue lights)  \nPlay Left (hue lights)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Landing**  \n*Lamp*\n\nHere is what happens:-\n\n**Lamps example**  \nI know that currently Alexa can't distinguish between Light and Lamps say either one and all the lights come on in the room, so to get round that have a specific lamps device that is a light group exposed to Alexa from Home Assistant.\n\nSo I walk into the Master Bedroom and I say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and she turns on the lamps because there is a light in the Master Bedroom called lamps... great it works there, I turn the lamps off with the command... it works. Next I go downstairs into the Living Room and say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and the lamps don't come on and its like nothing has happened BUT actually it has cause shes actually turned on the lamps in the Master Bedroom with that command despite it being requested from the Echo in the living room group which also has a device called lamps. \n\nNow within the Living Room say \"Alexa turn on the Living Room lamps\" and the lamps come on, why does it need Living Room Lamps, she knows she is in the living room group.\n\n**TV Example**\n\nExactly the same scenario above but with TV, I say in the Master Bedroom \"Alexa turn on the TV\" but nothing happens in the Master Bedroom but it does in the Living Room cause she's turned on the TV in there. If I stay in the Master Bedroom and say \"Alexa, turn on the Master Bedroom TV\" it works fine calling that specific group for that specific device.\n\n**What I tried**\n\nResetting Alexa, Deleting All Devices from the APP and the Alexa website, renaming all devices so they would be unique enough (Master Bedroom TV, Master Bedroom Lamps etc) and no matter what I've tried I run into an issue. \n\n**My Conclusion**\n\nOf course course I could name things like Table Lamp, Floor Lamp 1, Floor Lamp 2 which is fine to control individually and that works but if your a guest or if you don't know the house then you need to know what that these commands are and then it requires three voice commands or more, then another three to dim those lights because I can't just ask Alexa to set the lamps to 50% so she controls that light group from Home Assistant.\n\nIf you want natural voice control that is going to be intuitive to people that interact with Alexa it seems thats not possible.\n\nGroups seem somewhat pointless and to be able to put Alexa into that group so she is group aware if the logic is to first look at all of the devices attached outside of the group first and then just action on that first device with that name rather than staying within the group first and controlling that device and only going outside of it when a specific group device is called.. from the Master Bedroom.. Alexa turn off the Living Room lamps.\n\nI can then only imagine this getting worse the more devices that are added.\n\nI like the echo speakers and the integration with Home Assistant but if such a simple thing can't work then its out, I have been testing with HomePod Minis too and with this same setup in HomeKit and it seems to work exactly as expected one voice command for Lights, Lamps and controlling them in the room I am requesting them for.\n\nIts a shame I have to return my 5 Echos as I had some good automations and TTS setup with them and actionable notifications but they where primarily for voice control and Alexa has failed to integrate on this occasion.",
  "Hi there, the prompt could be worded a little different, as I have my Alexa run on another language, but it generally gives me this prompt WAY to often. \n\nLike, I get to my home Office, connect my PC via AUX Cable to a Alexa (Echo Dot, 3. Gen.), which was supposed to be a better speaker than the Laptops inbuild ones, and it proclaims \"Music is played from {device}\".\n\nAway goes an hour or so without another sound output, an E-Mail arrives with the E-Mail Progamm making a specific sound: Alexa blares \"Music is being played from {device}\", not giving me the E-Mail sound because its obviously long done by now. \n\nThis repeats all day long. If there is no constant music streaming, it announces its intent again and again. All day long. \n\nHow can I turn of this notification? Don't tell me your about to play a sound, just play the bloody sound already -.-  \n\n\nDoes anybody have an ide? PLease!!!!",
  "Hey Folks,\n\nI havethe Ring Intercom since it came out and got all up and Running. I connect my Ring camera on my Balcony to have some kind of Videodoorbell. It works all fine. The only thing that annoys me and my spouse ist that Alexa tells us every time that some one is at our front door\u2026yeah\u2026we know\u2026that\u2019s the only door to our house :D\n\nIs there a way to get rid of that?",

  "While Amazon offers ways for the echo device to do a notification tone for when a package is out for delivery as well as on an overly delayed fashion, when the item has been delivered. \n\nThe problem is that they offer no built in option to alert you to the most important delivery related notification. On the Amazon app, it if it is being delivered via Amazon's own delivery service, then the app will push a notification when the package is around 3 stops away from you.  \n\n\nWhat I have been looking for is a way to have when such a notification is pushed, that the echo device will announce that a package delivery is 3 stops away.",
  "I can't find the correct answer, or my Alexa isn't working right. I have the latest Echo Dot, the Alexa Windows App with show mode, and the Android app. I want alexa to just up and say \"Your package of \"blah blah\" has been delivered\" or \"Your package is out for delivery\" which a lot of articles claim CAN be done, but whenever I follow the steps of going into the app, more, to Amazon Shopping and turning on delivery notifications along with enabling say or show titles for items you've ordered, all I get is the \"Ba-Dong\" sound for a notification, and I have to ask Alexa to read me my notifications before I know what the sound was for.\n\nI want to bypass the \"Ba-dong\" noise completely and just have Alexa automatically read out the actual notification, especially for deliveries. How do I do this? It sounds like Alexa is capable of doing this, and it sounds like I am doing it right, according to everything I have read, but I have been trying for a few years now, and still no luck, have tried new devices, new accounts, etc. This is starting to drive me nuts. Either, something is wrong with my setup, or Alexa can't actually do this, and the article are poorly written. I'm not sure which one it is, but don't want to keep trying something that wont work,",

  "Yesterday I had to call emergency services because my son was choking. I used my echo show to call as he was right in front of it, and I didn\u2019t want to search for my phone. This detail is important. I have daily routines set up for my kids to tell them to clean up their things and then another 30 minutes later to go brush their teeth and get ready for bed. While on the line with 911 a freaking reminder kicks off and interrupted the call. So was trying to do the heimlich and hear what the operator is saying while Alexa is telling my kids it\u2019s bedtime. Seconds matter in these scenarios. Thankfully we were finally able to clear his airway, but it wasn\u2019t looking great for a minute. \n\nI started a chat with Amazon customer service to see if something can be done or if my device was faulty. He said to add 911 as an emergency contact and that shouldn\u2019t happen. When I asked for help with that it turned out it couldn\u2019t be done. He said he would submit it as feedback and I could continuously check the Amazon website to see if this has been fixed. I would not receive notification that my issue had been resolved. So I called customer service instead. \n\nThe next guy I spoke with gave me a few more options. He said I could simply disable all of my routines. Boom. Problem solved. Well, I kind of like that feature. I mean that really eliminates some of the basic features. Then he suggested I go look for my phone and call 911 from that next time. He said to be sure I\u2019m always from the device or turn it down. That way my call won\u2019t get interrupted. *Really??* He was literally inches from the device. It was the closest thing capable of calling emergency services. Don\u2019t worry. I was also offered the solution of not calling 911 or to have the emergency outside of my scheduled routines. Not helpful either. It gets better. Finally, he argued with me that my device couldn\u2019t even call 911. It\u2019s not a feature that you can use. He said it couldn\u2019t connect to government numbers. I explained that I just did, and it was in fact the second time I had done so. It was actually a feature that I really appreciated given the fact I\u2019ve had to call 911 three times in the past few months. He had control of my device and I showed him the voice history proving myself right. He hung up on me.\n\nSo here we are. Is this something that is specific to my device? Has anyone else had this problem? How do I get this fixed *and* receive notification that it has been fixed? Thanks!",
  "I added the DLink water sensor kit DCH-S162, and set my dishwasher in a \"Xtreme Mat\" water collecting tray; not  big enough to catch a full dishwasher leak, but it should catch enough water to trigger the leak sensor before it reaches the floor. Not expecting a leak from this Bosch dishwasher but it has happened to me in the past. Can't drain it out as it's a solid floor.\n\nWater leaks detected by the sensor send alerts to my phone via the myDlink app, which is linkable to Alexa. The typical use case for myDlink to Alexa, I presume, is for active devices like lights that can be turned on from an Alexa command.\n\nMy question is this; can I take a leak notification and use it to send a command from Alexa to turn off a smart plug - that the dishwasher would be plugged into - thereby stopping water from going into the dishwasher.\n\nYour thoughts appreciated and Happy Thanksgiving!",
  "Just got home and my Echos were pulsing yellow. I asked, \u201cAlexa what\u2019s my notification?\u201d She responded: \u201cOne new notification; By the way, I can help you wind down for bed bla bla bla bla.\u201d That\u2019s a routine I can make already why is she talking about this? If the Alexa team wants to improve user experience then make it to were I can set a scene or routine off of current setting for a room. Instead of having to guess what percentage each bulb should be at when you set up a scene for the first time. That singular action would be revolutionary for new users and is a large barrier for entry to home automation.",

  "As the title says, I need some input / ideas about how to possibly implement the two following ideas I have been wanting to implement in my smart home system for a while.\n\n*Beforehand, for clarification why the things I want are complex to achieve: I don't live in a house, I live on the 2nd floor of an apartment building as a tenant. So I can not put anything in public areas (e.g. hallway) or change anything outside my apartment (e.g. drill holes, exchange my doorbell system, etc.).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first thing - and I've tried that multiple times - is the idea of some sort of sensor inside my mailbox downstairs, so alexa can trigger a routine whenever the mailman enters the house and opens my specific mailbox, so I am notified when I have mail. I have bought and tested multiple motion sensors from amazon but they all didn't work - until I figured out why: They ALL seem to connect via bluetooth only, not wifi, and the signal was just too far away from downstairs up into my apartment. Wifi should work as I even get a weak signal from my alexa socket connected to my washing machine in the basement.  \nAny other ideas on how I could set up a notification once my mailbox is opened?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second thing is similar: Since I can't use a ring system as I can not change anything on my apartment, I'm seeking for alternative ways to control the front door and/or my manual apartment door, as well as speak to people at the front door from anywhere in my apartment.  \nRight now I have a semi-automatic system set up for the front door through the switchbot switch toggle thingy. It is taped on my apartment doorbell speakerphone system on the door opener button. Whenever my doorbell rings and I say \"Alexa open the door\", Alexa turns on my apartment hallway light and presses that knob, at least opening the front door.\n\nOkay. Fine. However: Ideally I would much rather also have SOME way of communicating through the doorbell speakerphone or any other way with the person outside. Then I could, for instance, have an alexa routine (e.g. \"Alexa, a delivery is here\") to open the front door and say to the amazon guy \"Please drop the package by the apartment door in the 2nd floor\".  \nAny ideas how I could pull something like that off without renovating half the building by installing custom doorbell sets? :-D",

But when I ask Alexa to play a song or shuffle my library she does it like normal.\n\nI looked at Routine activity in the app and every Routine I asked for was listed, every time I asked for it, but with no comments or errors.  Other Routines that aren't voice activated but from time or motion, aren't working either, but are listed in the activities in the app.\n\nSince all my Routines are listed in the app, and the commands used within the Routines work if called out, it seems to be a Amazon server problem.

  "TLDR: I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on how this could be done. \n\nHere is the gist of my use case:\n\nI have a Panasonic HomeHawk camera that is able to detect motion and send push notifications to my phone. It is also set up in Alexa via the HomeHawk skill, however that skill doesn't give you the option to trigger a routine based on motion from the HomeHawk.\n\nSo I was trying to figure out how to close that loop and one thought I had was: _What if I could set up a routine in Alexa to trigger based on the phone receiving notifications from the HomeHawk app?_\n\nIn principle, I think this should be possible (even if not currently). My reasoning here is that my Echo Frames are already capable of speaking phone notifications to me, and it has the ability to filter which notifications it plays based on the app that sends the notification. Seems like it wouldn't be much of a stretch (code-wise) to allow routines to also be triggerable based on these notifications.\n\nAnyway, these are just my thoughts on this idea. I'd love to hear if anyone else has been able to figure out how to do this already or if there is a better solution to my stated use case.",

  "Hey everyone, My family has recently been having trouble with our Echo Show. Oftentimes my Mom would ask Alexa to play an artist, which Alexa would then play from Amazon Music.  However, only recently it seems that whenever a notification appears on the screen (joke of the day, recipe tutorials, news notifications, etc.) Alexa stops playing music in favor of displaying the notification.  \n\nIs this an issue the anyone else is having?  I'm not sure if this is a problem with Alexa thinking that there is no one in the room or if it just won't play more than 3-4 songs from Amazon Music since it doesn't seem to happen when we listen to SiriusXM.  Short of turning off every notification in the settings, I'm not sure if there is anything else I can do to.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated",

When I go into Alexa Together to create a reminder for her, it would be only allow me to play it on the Echo Show, not the Dots.\n\nShe barely ever touches her cell, and attempts to get her to use it more have failed so I thought a voice activated system like this would be best.

I foresee a problem having two thermostats connected to two different houses connected to one Alexa.  \n\nI have been informed that there is a way  to keep her on my account (for things like Amazon Music, etc.) but separate the houses so we don't accidentally keep changing each other's temperatures.  Also, I would like a ring, but it will confuse her if my ring goes off at her house.\n\nDoes anyone know how to separate?",

  "Hunches is a good service but it seems to have been designed for only one type of customer: single girl/guy who lives in an apartment. Hunches can not seem to comprehend that more than one person can live in a household. So Alexa thinks no one is home even when one person (with Alexa app on their phone) leaves the house. The rest of us will be chilling inside and all the lights will start dimming and guard will turn on. \n\nWe thought if we kept changing the guard mode (back to off) except when all of us are out then Hunches would \u201clearn\u201d that pattern. But no. \n\nIn fact the app doesn\u2019t even have any option for me to undo the action every time I get the incorrect notification that \u201cAlexa has a hunch no one is home\u201d.

  "I have a Ring Doorbell and a Ring indoor camera. I have Ring skill enabled and linked. So whenever motion is detected by either device, I get a notification on all my Echo devices.

I only included the doorbell in the plan.\n\nThe end result is: Now I don't get notifications when the doorbell detects motion. It's almost like the subscription disabled the notifications somehow. The indoor camera is unaffected and notifications still work.\n\nI can still see the alerts in the Ring app so I can confirm that it detects motion. Also, if someone rings the bell, I still get the notification on Alexa.

I have my alarms volume and general volume both set to 2, but whenever Alexa gives me a reminder the volume is insanely high, seems to be around 7. I live in a block of flats with poor noise insulation and it's totally unacceptable to have reminders like this blaring out in the late evening - I can hear my neighbour's talking at normal volume and this is roughly as loud as me shouting, so I basically can't use the reminders feature any more which is one of the few features I use a lot. Any suggestions? I've tried resetting which is the only solution I've seen so far, and it did nothing.\n\nEdit: I tried lowering the alarm volume to almost zero and then triggering a reminder.

  "[**\\*Edit: the Alexa help page has now been updated to reflect the new limitations.***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=GHKNDEFH7JCKX4DB)\n\n**TL;DR -** I just confirmed with Amazon Customer Service that soon Alexa-to-phone calling will be restricted to a pre-chosen list of no more than **10 contacts per Alexa user profile**, unless you have and link an AT&T Wireless or Skype account to your Alexa Communications profile.  Making 'Alexa-to-Alexa' calls (calling between Echo devices, the Alexa app, etc.)  will still of course be unlimited but if you want to call a landline or cellular telephone number you will only be able to choose from your set list of ten chosen contacts.  \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Full Details -** Moments ago I used Alexa to make a toll-free (1-800-number) phone call from one of the Echo Dots in my home, something I do daily/multiple times a day.  As soon as I finished my call and asked Alexa to \"hangup\" I was greeted with a \"By the way...\" notification/response from Alexa which told me the number I had just called was automatically added to my list of ten Alexa-to-phone contacts and to see the Alexa app for more information, to edit my list of ten contacts, or to link an account and still be able to make unlimited Alexa-to-phone calling from my Echo devices.  Confused I opened my Alexa app and was greeted with a \"card\" on the home screen telling me the same things/to click there for more info.  I use my Amazon Alexa devices as my primary outgoing house phone and have since 2017 on my 8 Echo Dots, four Fire HD tablets, and on various computers using the \"Alexa for PC\" Windows app.  I am disabled and being able to depend on using Alexa to make phone calls in my home on my numerous Alexa devices is vital and has been a lifesaver for me - literally - as I am occasionally prone to randomly falling asleep/passing out due to my disability.\n\n*(Long tangent example from a couple of years ago:*  *A couple of years ago this happened while I was showering - I woke up and found myself lying down in my shower in standing water with blood everywhere after having apparently blacked out/slammed my head into/cut a giant gash across my forehead on the sharp corner edge of my marble bathroom vanity sink countertop.  I was completely out of it (a CT scan later confirmed a concussion) and had probably been on the floor for 15 or 20 minutes and was too disoriented to get myself up from the floor.  My cell phone was nearby outside of the shower and I was able to pull myself over to it but the battery was dead and I was too weak and dizzy and bloody to get up and find the charger.  Fortunately I had my Echo Dot in there in that bathroom and so I began trying to get a hole of someone who might be able to help me (since you can't dial \"911\" using Alexa) but no one would answer my Alexa-to-Alexa phone calls (because most people I know who have this capability never really use this feature and would probably be totally confused receiving a call from me via it anyway). Fortunately, after calling numerous contacts from my linked mobile phone address book via Alexa I was finally able to get in touch with an old roommate/good friend and they rushed over immediately and raced me to the ER. I definitely called more than 10 contacts before someone answered.)*\n\nAnyway, the Alexa app said I could link my AT&T or Skype accounts if I wanted to still be able to make unlimited Alexa-to-phone phone calls.  Well that's fine and great, but I use Verizon Wireless as my cellular phone service provider and don't have an AT&T wireless mobile phone or account.  I continued reading through the details and \"More Information\" help sections provided in the Alexa App (text content and screenshots provided below) and then called Amazon Customer Support to see if this terrible news was really true.  While on hold I looked online to see if Amazon had made any press releases about these changes or if any news outlets/tech blogs had written anything about the new restrictive changes to making calls with Alexa but found nothing.  The Amazon representative I spoke with also knew nothing of these changes, nor did the developer/engineering team contact he reached out to as I waited on hold with him on the phone.  He looked through various internal channels/systems and couldn't find any information about these changes either and so I offered to send him screenshots of what I was seeing in my Alexa App and he thanked me and asked if I would please send them.  I sent them while on the phone and he shared them with the engineering team contact he had been talking with about this while I waited.  A while later he did confirm that he had found some information about these changes (basically just the same details that are given in the new help section about this in the Alexa App) and said he would try to find out more information and if he does learn any additional details he'll share them with me via phone or email in the next day or so. He said while it's not uncommon for Amazon to be absolutely terrible about sharing information about big changes/new features/various updates with their team members before going public with the info he did think it was odd that there was next to nothing announced about this and that I had already learned about these coming changes from the Alexa app and said that might have possibly been by accident and apologized.\n\nI hate this and wanted to share this with other Amazon Echo device/Alexa users.  I mean, I understand that it was a free service and that Amazon is not making any money (aside from revenue from the initial device purchase) by allowing people to place unlimited, free phone calls from their Alexa devices, but it's super frustrating for a core feature like this to be restricted without any advanced warning or announcement, especially at a time when most communication/telecommunication platforms and companies are adding *more* capabilities and features/free extra data/etc. to be helpful while we're all feeling and dealing with the challenges of living through a global pandemic.  Super upsetting Amazon would suddenly add restrictions.  I am fine with being required to link my cellular phone service provider account to my Alexa Communications profile/account if that's necessary to keep being able to effortlessly make outgoing phone calls using my Alexa/Echo devices, but if that's the case than other service providers that just AT&T need to be added.  Maybe AT&T is the entity here who pushed for these new restrictions, who knows...  ughhhh.  \ud83e\udd2c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Text/Details and** [**Screenshots of Details from the Alexa App**](https://i.imgur.com/4I11wev.jpeg)**:**\n\nAlexa-to-Phone Contacts\n\nThese are the phone numbers you can make unlimited mobile and landline calls to.

  "I have yet to implement some of these, but I was considering daisy chain routines-toggling-routines for higher order logic.\n\n**Goal AND Logic:** if Condition A, AND Condition B, AND Condition C, then Routine D Triggers Action\n\n**How**:\n\n* Routine A1 - if presence of Condition A, enable Routine B1\n* Routine A2 - if absence of Condition A, disable Routine B1\n* Routine B1 - if presence of Condition B, enable Routine C1\n* Routine B2 - if absence of Condition B, disable Routine C1\n* Routine C1 - if presence of Condition C, enable Routine D\n* Routine C2 - if absence of Condition C, disable Routine D\n* Routine D - if Trigger, then Action (add a cool down period)\n* Routine E - Any trigger (ie time of day) resets system by disabling Routine B1 and C1\n\n**Where it breaks**: For this logic to work Condition A must happen before Condition B, then before Condition C. Also Condition A through C will have to happen a second time (in order) once Routine D is triggered, to trigger Routine D again. Satisfaction of Conditions A-C cannot persist.\n\nExecution will be slightly more difficult because custom actions to disable routines must be done as separate routines.\n\n**Complex examples**:\n\n* If Button 1 is pressed, then Button 2 is pressed, then Button 3, then Button 4 (in other words, a password is entered), the front door will unlock.\n* If the forecast calls for rain, an wake up alarm is dismissed between 0400 and 0800, then the front door is opened, Alexa says \"Don't forget to bring an umbrella to work\" with a cool down period of 12 hours. Resets at 11 PM. IFTTT required for weather integrations.\n\n**Simple examples**:\n\n* If location leaves house, then motion is detected inside the house, play Security Alarm Siren and send a drop-in notification \"Intruder detected\"\n* If location arrives home, then use a time trigger to set the thermostat to cool to XYZ (Scheduled thermostat settings while home only)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Goal OR Logic:** If Condition A OR Condition B, then Routine D Triggers Action\n\n**How**:\n\n* Routine A1 - if presence of Condition A, enable Routine D\n* Routine A2 - if absence of Condition A, disable Routine D\n* Routine B1 - if presence of Condition B, enable Routine D\n* Routine B2 - if absence of Condition B, disable Routine D\n* Routine D - if Trigger, then Action\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nYes, you can (and I have) use routines to toggle routines. You can disable/enable routines by voice command if you give them a simple name. Name Routine D in the above examples a two digit number only (i.e. '11'), then use the Custom Commands for your Routine A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2 logic with the explicit language 'Alexa, turn off the ## routine' or 'Alexa, turn on the ## routine.'",

Right now I have a hacked-together solution for my TV audio and Dot to send audio to the same stereo channel of my home theater receiver. I did this so I could easily hear the Dot over the TV while cooking, or play music from Spotify using voice commands, for example. I'm getting an HDMI audio splitter so the digital audio out goes straight to the receiver, and that means the Dot won't be able to play through the stereo any longer. Is there any way I can control the Fire TV Stick with the Dot so that all notifications are forwarded and app commands (e.g. for Spotify) automatically go to the Fire Stick rather than being executed on the Dot itself?

I have an echo dot and a echo show 5 and they\u2019re both doing the same thing.\n\nUpdate: I called Alexa customer support and they told me there\u2019s no way to turn off message notifications unless I have do not disturb turned on and that the sound for sending messages is just a \u201cfeature \u201c of the Alexa communication. However, if I put on do not disturb then I cannot receive phone calls or answer them. Please tell me that there\u2019s another answer!",

It basically \"worked\" straight away (Felt like less setup than I remembered?), and it must be linked to my intended account, because it knows here all my packages are and sends me notifications and asks me to rate my purchases.

  "OK, Hear me out, I am beyond ranting by now, I just want to know am I idiot here, and what could I do to fix this stupid mess.\nTLDR: Due to  bugs and errors, my girlfriend got thrown out from my household. Now I can't get her back for half a year.\n\nI recently got a set of sonos portable speakers. They also support Alexa. So naturally, I resurrected my old amazon account, set it up, all good and happy.\nHowever, I wanted my girlfriend to be able to listen to her own music library, access calendar, lists ETC.\nCue last 3 hours:\n\n- create an amazon account for her. All good here.\n- Invite her to a household. Everything still makes sense and we're cruising nicely, I am already looking forward to the traditional sunday pancakes.\n- Install alexa on her phone. I can already smell the pancakes and hear the blissfull music from our respective Alexas. Oh yeah!\n- Teach her Voice to alexa. She's happy because Alexa knows her name now. I am happy because 5 minutes to the food.\n\nNarrator: \"but Amazon had other plans.\"\n\n- I pick up my phone to set up my own voice. Alexa: \"error: Your device is unsupported.\" For the record, I run iPhone 12 pro, she has iPhone 12. She was able to set the voice profile up fine, I run into an error. What the hell?\n- Reinstall Alexa app on my phone. Same error.\n- Review app permissions: It has access to literally everything it can ask for.\n- Ask alexa to recognise me. She helpfully sends me a notification to my phone, which directs me ... to the same error. \n- Pancakes are getting cold, my morning iced smoothie, however, warm.\n- I log out of her account on her phone and log in my account. I am able to configure my voice profile within a minute. What the hell?\n- Some exitement, as Alexa responds correctly now to \"what is my name,\" for both of us. Lets just add the spotify skill to her account and...\n- Open \"Link music service\" on her phone, in her alexa account. Alexa says that she is not eligible to add Spotify skill due to geo restrictions. Me, sitting next to her, was just able to do that within the same region. Doublechecked that on all the amazon and spotify accounts.\n-  30 minutes Googling turns out that it's a common issue. Changing the region to US might help.\n- I change ther phone region, language to US, and do the same on her amazon account.\n- Spotify setup done! Yay! Change the regions back, yay, pancakes\n- Ding! Says gmail. \"You just removed a household member.. Huh?\n-\nApparently a household can't exist in multiple regions. OK, makes sense.\n\nApparently, once you have removed someone from your household, they can't join or you can't add them for the next 180 days.\nMakes 0 sense.\n\nSo, given all that faffle, what did I do wrong and is there anything I could do to fix this before 180 days?

I don't recall unlinking it in any way.

Went to Calendar & Email in the settings of the Alexa app\n\n2.) Tapped on my Google account.\n\n3.) Tapped on unlink.\n\n4.) Tapped on confirm unlink.\n\n5.) This goes to another settings page with \"Google\" in the top center, then has the Google G with Unlink Account to the right of it. I tapped on unlink account.\n\n6.) Tapped on confirm unlink account. After doing this, an error saying \"Could not retrieve the list of persons belonging to this account\" in a blue pop down banner at the top of the screen.

Trying to do the unlink again on this page just loops through # 5 & # 6.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, if I close the app and reopen it and go back to the Calendar & Email settings, it comes up with a list of account types you can link (Google, Microsoft, Apple & Microsoft Exchange)... and doesn't show any linked account. When I ask \"Alexa, what's in my email\" it replies with No accounts linked and to link an account. If I ask what's on my calendar, it replies with the \"It looks like I no longer have access to one of your calendar accounts because your log in has expired, please relink your account by visiting calendar settings in the Alexa app.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've linked my Google account (only) again, and when I ask what's on my calendar, it repeats the log in has expired error, and then says John you have 2 events today, the first one is.........\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen the Google account is the only one linked on the Calendar & Email it shows 1 linked account, 2 default calendars for new events (once under for your voice and once under for other voices).

  "Besides routines (looking for something that can be used with just voice), is there a way to have Alexa say \"a thing\" at \"a time?\" So far I'm only seeing Reminders, Alarms, Timers, and Routines; each of which have their annoyances and flaws. \n\nSimple example... I'd like to say \"Alexa, let me know when it's 9pm\" and at 9pm, Alexa would say \"It's 9pm.\" Currently, this would set an alarm, so at 9pm, instead of her say \"It's 9pm\" she says, \"BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP\" until I tell her to \"STOOOPPPPP.\" \n\nReminders for this are annoying because they're logged by the app and need to be completed or dismissed (I don't need to check off that I have \"done a 9pm\") along with the double-repeat and the \"Here's your reminder...\" preface. \n\nI could set up a routine in my phone to say a custom text string at a specific time (hell of a thing to do for a quick off-the-cuff notification and kind of defeats the concept of a voice assistant). \n\nI tried the voice command \"Alexa, at 9pm, tell me it's 9pm\" and she still is like \"Okay, Alarm set for 9pm.\" -\\_- \n\nI tried \"Alexa, at 9pm, say the phrase, it's 9pm\" and she just kinda shuts-off mid command or says \"Sorry, I don't know that.\" \n\nAny ideas?",

  "(Skip to 2nd paragraph for to the point summary)\n\nSo I recently added the ring mailbox sensor to mybsrsenal. I got tired of getting motion notifications for fed ex and ups and figured this would be an easy way to know for sure when we actually do have mail. I\u2019ve got it connected, working, and surprisingly well I might add. I have a wall mounted top open metal mailbox with locking inner lid. I put the sensor on the bottom of the mailbox and ran the wire up to the top and stuck to the inside of the top lid, so when you open it you see the protected by ring wire/antenna. For giggle I tried without the antenna and seemed to work fine but I figured I might as well since I got it set up ina good spot.\n\nOk now that it works I wanted to set a routine where when mailbox gets motion a couple of my echo devices will announce that mail has arrived. My gf jokingly did the old aol you\u2019ve got mail line and that instantly made me want to set THAT as the audio that plays when mailbox is activated, that classic you\u2019ve got mail from AOL email. \n\nI\u2019ve played around a bit already and looked but has t found much luck so here I am! Idk if I should post this in ring instead but being it\u2019s a routine related issue I think it belongs here. \n\nThanks!!!",

  "We just got this for Christmas and as I have adhd my husband was hoping it could help. However we seem to have run into nothing but problems. Can anyone tell me if I\u2019m mistaken about this, I\u2019ve been reading up and this is what I\u2019ve seen so far.\n\n- when I went to import my to do list for my regular chores and reminders into Alexa there didn\u2019t seem to be a way to give a to do item a date or for it to reoccur, so I can\u2019t have it read out my to do items for today.\n- the reminders can reoccur but then basically vanish into a submenu in the app and don\u2019t sit there so I remember them. I have adhd, telling me once doesn\u2019t work!\n- i saw that it had todoist integration and i use that for work but having got it, it seems like they\u2019re phasing the integration out and it doesn\u2019t work that well now and in a far more limited scope.\n- I have an irregular work from home/in office schedule and there seems to be no way to tell Alexa what morning routine i want tomorrow, is that really right??\n- in a routine i can\u2019t get it to set off a series of alerts or alarms, whereas on my iPhone I\u2019ve programmed an automation to tell me how far through my morning routine i should be with a series of alarms, so I don\u2019t get sidetracked and end up late for work. The routines don\u2019t seem to allow this, which is mind boggling. I see it has a \u201cwait\u201d function that i could maybe use, but given that I can\u2019t program it to go off the next morning it means I\u2019d have to start it off myself, which means the times of the announcements wouldn\u2019t be right.\n\nIs this true?

  "There's something I'd like to use Alexa for, but I don't know if it's possible.\n\nWhen I cook beef stew on the stovetop, I need to stir it every 15 minutes. Right now, I just tell Alexa to \"alert me in 15 minutes,\" because there's nothing else I'm setting generic timers for. The problem is, I've been cooped up alone with Alexa for so long, I'm becoming inured to her, and now I'm prone to just telling her to \"stop,\" without actually getting up and stirring the stew. So I'd like her to stay on my case about it until I've set a new timer; setting a new timer would indicate that I've stirred the stew, and I need to stir it again the next time. (And for whatever reason, I've never been a \"snooze\"-er; if I set a 7 am alarm, I just also set a 7:05, 7:10, and 7:15 alarm, because I know I'm not going to snooze the original alarm.)\n\nMy first thought was to create a routine that would trigger off of the alarm dismissal, and would remind me every minute to go stir (making Alexa speak, not another alarm, or I'd be triggering the routine again), repeatedly--an arbitrary number of times (since I don't think routines have goto loops). And when I've taken care of the stew, I would tell it to end the routine, allowing it to restart after the next new timer that I then set. But my understanding is that, despite it being a requested feature in a handful of threads on the official forums, it is impossible to stop a routine that is already in progress. It also appears that dismissing a timer does not satisfy the alarm dismissal trigger.\n\nSo, can anyone think of a way to do this with a routine, with other Alexa commands, or even with other tools altogether?",
  "Yesterday I had to call emergency services because my son was choking. I used my echo show to call as he was right in front of it, and I didn\u2019t want to search for my phone. This detail is important. I have daily routines set up for my kids to tell them to clean up their things and then another 30 minutes later to go brush their teeth and get ready for bed. While on the line with 911 a freaking reminder kicks off and interrupted the call. So was trying to do the heimlich and hear what the operator is saying while Alexa is telling my kids it\u2019s bedtime. Seconds matter in these scenarios. Thankfully we were finally able to clear his airway, but it wasn\u2019t looking great for a minute. \n\nI started a chat with Amazon customer service to see if something can be done or if my device was faulty. He said to add 911 as an emergency contact and that shouldn\u2019t happen. When I asked for help with that it turned out it couldn\u2019t be done. He said he would submit it as feedback and I could continuously check the Amazon website to see if this has been fixed. I would not receive notification that my issue had been resolved. So I called customer service instead. \n\nThe next guy I spoke with gave me a few more options. He said I could simply disable all of my routines. Boom. Problem solved. Well, I kind of like that feature. I mean that really eliminates some of the basic features. Then he suggested I go look for my phone and call 911 from that next time. He said to be sure I\u2019m always from the device or turn it down. That way my call won\u2019t get interrupted. *Really??* He was literally inches from the device. It was the closest thing capable of calling emergency services. Don\u2019t worry. I was also offered the solution of not calling 911 or to have the emergency outside of my scheduled routines. Not helpful either. It gets better. Finally, he argued with me that my device couldn\u2019t even call 911. It\u2019s not a feature that you can use. He said it couldn\u2019t connect to government numbers. I explained that I just did, and it was in fact the second time I had done so. It was actually a feature that I really appreciated given the fact I\u2019ve had to call 911 three times in the past few months. He had control of my device and I showed him the voice history proving myself right. He hung up on me.\n\nSo here we are. Is this something that is specific to my device? Has anyone else had this problem? How do I get this fixed *and* receive notification that it has been fixed? Thanks!",

I would need a routine that'll send an SMS or a Facebook message every day.

  "STORYTIME: I have my Echo giving me a reminder for 125pm, but if I'm in the middle of something else, I'm UNLIKELY to remember my meds. So I bought an NFC tag, programmed it with a URL, and had PLANNED to use it to turn off reminders-every-3-minutes-until-meds-taken.\n\nBut. I don't understand how to do this now that I'm in the app. Would this be a routine? If so, I only see ways to START a routine using an NFC tag (this URL shows up as a doorbell when visited btw.)  \n\n\nI don't need to START a process/routine/skill/scene/whatever, I need to STOP it. At least I think I need to stop it.\n\nReddit, am I being dumb? It seems like I'm missing something fundamental that should be very simple. \n\nAll I want:\n\n1. Reminders that start at 125pm each weekday\n2. Continual reminders every 3 minutes until I verify 'task complete'\n\nI don't really even care about the NFC tag, that part just seemed cool. But if it's getting in the way, I'll ditch it.\n\nWhat's the simplest way for a home-automation newbie to get this done?",

I created a routine for Alexa to make the announcement, but routine only allows the announcement to play on a single device.

  "So I have a brand new Alexa Echo Show 10. I had pinned a reminder using the sticky notes on Monday. Today, I went in to add another sticky note and found a random note in there saying Shut the -bleep- up. The note was dated December 2021. It was NOT in there before!!!!! I don\u2019t know how it got in there and now it makes me worry! Was I hacked?",
  "I'm a heavy Alexa user with the large echo show, the medium-sized echo show, and several dots and echos scattered around the house. I use the devices to control my lights, to play music everywhere, to set reminders, and sometimes to control the thermostat.\n\nAfter more than a year, I'm increasingly frustrated by the lack of attention that Amazon seems to be paying to this ecosystem. Alexa never remembers our most basic preferences and feels the need to tell us the same thing endlessly. If you ask her anything about fashion (e.g. \"can I wear socks with Birkenstocks\"), she answers with a weather report and shopping recommendations.  \n\nI've heard from third-party developers that they're unable to update apps and address individual user complaints because of how Amazon has structured that side of the operation.\n\nThe rest of the technology world is racing ahead. There are text-to-image generators creating stunning works of art and text-to-prose generators writing decent college term papers without human intervention. Meanwhile, Alexa limps along, like little more than an updated version of \"the clapper.\" Clap on. Clap off. But don't try to do anything \\*too\\* useful with it.\n\nI don't expect Alexa to hang the moon or write an opera for me, but it would be nice to see some sort of updates and improvements to the platform, just as we see with other operating systems and with other applications. And these are all just dumb terminals, right? It's all happening on machines in the cloud, so they have access to all that computer power.\n\nThe lack of concerted customer outreach related to Alexa is also odd.\n\nIt feels like Alexa has been completely overlooked as Amazon makes other moves in the AI and robotics space (e.g. the iRobot purchase). I'm sure the people on the Alexa team must be frustrated as well.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I still love my Alexa most of the time, and it's a great device for someone who lives alone. But I worry about the lack of vision for this product. It could be SO much better. Voice interfaces could be SO much better.",
  "We have four alexa's in various rooms.  If a timer or reminder goes off on one, I was sure that I used to be able to say \"alexa stop timer\" to the nearest one and the timer/ reminder would stop.

As it is, I have to yell loud enough so that the unit with the timer/reminder going off can hear me.",

Recently it changed from saying   \n\"(kids name) here's your reminder: Go to bed\" to \"(kids name) here's your reminder from (my name): Go to bed\". How do I make it stop saying the reminder is from me? It has actually done this for all reminders I set up for other people in my house.",
  "I understand that Alexa reminders could be set to a specific time. But I need a reminder to do something when I wake up in the morning - which could happen at very different times.\n\nAlexa knows when I wake up because I initiate Alexa Good Morning routine with my voice.\n\nHow do I set a reminder to automatically be triggered by that event, as well?",
  "I have an Echo Show 5 siting at my home office desk. My idea is to have it remind me of meetings/events before they start.\n\nIt does that fine. But if I'm already in another online meeting, the reminder can be intruding - I don't see a way to quickly dismiss it without a voice command (come on Amazon, there should be an option on the screen!), nor a way to quickly mute it.\n\nWhat would be even better would be to have an option for the Show to only displays a warning on it's screen if I'm on another meeting (which it knows, since it has access to my calendar). Or even better, to automatically enter DND mode anytime I'm in meetings.\n\nDoes anyone know how to do that? Or any skills I could add to handle this?",
  "There was a post in r/ADHD asking about ADHD investments- an item you'd get for yourself to help work your way around life with ADHD. I thought I'd write about it here because as an appreciation post cuz Alexa has been life-changing!!\n\nThoughts will often run into my head with regards to tasks to complete, then I\u2019ll forget about it like a total Dory within the next seconds/minutes. So whenever the thoughts run through my head, I say \u201cHey Alexa, remind me to do \\[insert task here\\] at \\[specific time of the day\\]\u201d. I even make to-do lists to challenge myself to do everything that I need to do for the day! Alexa\u2019s also been amazing cuz I often get caught hyper focused + lose track of time on my phone or on some non-productive activity. When I catch myself drowning in a miscellaneous activity when I should be doing something else/better, I\u2019ll tell Alexa to set a timer to snap me out of it and remind me to do something ;)\n\nCertain tasks turn me off to the point where I can actually feel distressed/angered while trying to perform them, and it helps so much that I could tell Alexa to put on white noise or background music to help focus and make the task more bearable. I sometimes struggle to sleep because of racing thoughts that can often stress me out and cause me anxiety. Alexa's relaxing calming sounds (Have y'all tried water sounds????) puts me right to sleep with a smile on my face.\n\nI also leave my phone in the most random of places- lost in the couch, bed, car, fridge (I kid you not) and it comes in clutch that Alexa can call your phone for you if you ask Alexa where your phone is. Amazing. Those timers also come in clutch so that I don't forget something cooking in the kitchen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Alexa has been an incredible tool for me living with ADHD. I hope she's listening on the activities in my bedroom and while I'm in the bathroom loooool ;)",
  "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently purchased an Echo Dot (Prime Day) and I really liked the shopping list thing that she does. I managed to sync that list to my already existing list on my Reminders app on my Apple devices, using IFTTT.

When I go into Alexa Together to create a reminder for her, it would be only allow me to play it on the Echo Show, not the Dots.\n\nShe barely ever touches her cell, and attempts to get her to use it more have failed so I thought a voice activated system like this would be best.

  "I have two locations: Work and Home\n\nAt Work I tell Alexa, \"Remind me when I get Home to take out the Trash\". \n\nAlexa sets the reminder. And when I get home Alexa reminds me, but on the device at Work!!!  That's just ridiculous and makes the feature virtually useless! \n\nHow do I get Alexa to remind me at the location I want the reminder?? I.e., Home? \n\nWhat's strange is when you look at the App you can see and edit your reminders, including the location, but you can't edit the device it reminds you from!  \n\nAnd what's also crazy is you can set up locations on Alexa, like Home and Work.  But you can't add your devices to Home or Work?  When you set up the location for the device you have to enter an address again?  \n\nAlexa is amazing and so useful. The developers and programmers are phenomenal. But how do they appear to miss such obvious glitches like this? It's like they don't actually use Alexa!",
  "My SO and I live together, we have and echo 4th gen and a fire stick with various other Alexa recognized smart devices. Switches, bulbs, etc.\nMy SO have Amazon prime and therefore when setting up the echo I put stuff on her account since I just have a standard free Amazon account.  The issue is that the echo is synched with her contacts and her name and her purchases. I am the one that is wanting to use the echo to its fullest with synching a work schedule, asking about travel time, personal reminders, making calls to my contacts, announcements from me, and such. My SO is basically just along for the ride.  Is there a way to have both accounts on one echo and switch them? When we buy things off of Amazon using echo I\u2019d like it to go through her account because prime. But on the other hand I\u2019m going to take more advantage of the features than she is.  Ideally I\u2019d like to have Alexa recognize it\u2019s me and be able to play my Spotify stuff, but then when my SO uses it for say Spotify, it won\u2019t play my playlists. I\u2019m not sure if this is very clear because I\u2019m not too sure on how to ask the question. Thanks for any suggestions or tutorial links!",

  "I'm irritable right now because my husband said I can't use the alarm function on two of our household Echoes because when I dismiss them, it's causing the wake-up routine in his office/man-cave to run.  (He works nights and sleeps in there most days.)  I would think that it *should* be possible to limit the routine's prompt to just alarms set and dismissed on the device in the man-cave, but he said it isn't.  I don't know, since I don't have the Alexa app and can interact only verbally with the Echoes.\n\nI guess I'm just irritable because he was the one who insisted on seeding our house with these useless things and I had only just started using alarms so I wouldn't lose track of time so much (I have ADHD).  Other than asking Alexa to play music sometimes, that's pretty much all I do with them.\n\nHe said I can still do timers and reminders, so I guess I can work with that.

  "Full details below, TLDR here:  If I get the \u201cTHIRDREALITY Zigbee Motion Sensor\u201d, what is the hub I need to get for it to work with Echo/Alexa?  Or would a Ring camera just be easier if all I want is for a message/reminder to play when it senses motion?  \n\n\nDETAILS:  I am trying to set up a motion sensor for my dad.  He is in assisted living and wears a call pendant that he can press to have an aide come assist him when he needs to get out of bed.  Problem is, he can\u2019t remember to press it and instead tries to get up by himself, which is extremely dangerous as he is a major fall risk.  We can\u2019t afford 24/7 care for him, so if I can just have something cue him to press his button when he tries to get up, that could make all the difference.  I would set the sensor on the ground by his bed so that if/when he puts his leg down to out of the bed, the sensor would sense it and trigger a reminder from Alexa (i.e., \u201cPlease wait.  Press your call button and someone will come help you get up\u201d).  I found the Zigbee Motion Sensor on Amazon but I can\u2019t find the hub that it says I need it to work with.  Or would a Ring camera be better for our  situation (it would be even better if I could have my voice recorded, telling him to press his call button.  Not sure if Ring does that?).  I am desperate right now.  Thank you in advance!!",
  "Hi there I am autistic and bought alexa as someone said it could help me remember things.\n\nI want to be able to create a routine that starts a timer for say 4 hours.\n\nExample \"Alexa routine\", Alexa tells me a few things to do in my routing like take my tablets and brush my teeth.  as part of that same routine it starts a 4 hour timer to remind me to eat lunch.\n\nIs this possible please?",
  "Not sure if this has always been an issue or if I'm just more aware of it since I moved recently. I have my alarms volume and general volume both set to 2, but whenever Alexa gives me a reminder the volume is insanely high, seems to be around 7. I live in a block of flats with poor noise insulation and it's totally unacceptable to have reminders like this blaring out in the late evening - I can hear my neighbour's talking at normal volume and this is roughly as loud as me shouting, so I basically can't use the reminders feature any more which is one of the few features I use a lot. Any suggestions? I've tried resetting which is the only solution I've seen so far, and it did nothing.\n\nEdit: I tried lowering the alarm volume to almost zero and then triggering a reminder. It worked but now the volume is stuck at being inaudibly quiet, even if I raise it. I guess that's the lesser of two evils so I'll leave it for now, but if anyone has any solutions please let me know!",

  "Hey there!\n\nTLDR My grandma forgets stuff, how can Alexa help?\n\nMy grandma has been in and out of the hospital lately, and we are struggling with her forgetting a lot of stuff. She needs to be rehabilitated, but for that to work she has to fullfill some requirements, that she easily forgets about. Due to the virus the visiting hours are very short, so we can't be constantly by her side and coach her.\nNow to the Alexa idea: We have an Alexa at home, but very little experience. Can we connect her to our calendar and send her reminders that way? Will Alexa only talk once she is spoken to, or will she speak about the reminders on her own? \nAnother thing is that my grandma can barely read anymore since she had a stroke two years ago. Technology was already hard before that, but now she can't even call us on her own, and therefor has very little social interaction outside of the visiting hours. Now she is already taking calls from friends and families, but calling them herself is not possible yet. Do you have any recommendations on how to assist her with an Alexa? We thought a voice activated device could be useful that way, but now we worry she will forget it's there. Any feedback is more than welcome, as we would love to see her rehabilitated.

It just now seems that Amazon devices should not be expected to be dependable. if I can\u2019t actually expect them to function reliably, why would I use them?\n\n5:44 PM Pravash [redacted] | Customer Service\nIf you're not happy with the device and your device has been bought within last 30 days, you can return it for refund.\nP\n5:45 PM\nThese were all purchased well past 30 days under the impression that Amazon wouldn\u2019t remotely wipe them.  I have used Alexa since it was in beta.  I've had an Amazon account for over a decade now without issues, I feel I should have been at least contacted first.\n\n5:48 PM Pravash [redacted] | Customer Service\n[redacted], I am sorry it's not possible to issue refund as those devices not covered under return window.\n\n5:48 PM\nI am glad that you\u2019ll pass the feedback along, I appreciate that you\u2019re trying to work with me on this, but at the end I have a feedback that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever hear back on, and other than sorry it\u2019ll probably happen again if we freeze your account for any reason.  I hope you can understand the frustration. I\u2019ve spent hundreds of dollars on just the echo hardware (not counting the kindles) that are completely unreliable and I found this out years later and I\u2019m now stuck with them.  I appreciate the apology, I appreciate that you do seem to care about this, but where do I go from here? What are the action items I have to take away? Register them again, cross my fingers, and hope for the best?  That doesn\u2019t seem right, that doesn\u2019t make me feel like I\u2019m valued or heard as a customer.  That doesn't instill faith in this product.\n\n5:52 PM Pravash [redacted] | Customer Service\nThanks for the details.\n\n5:53 PM\nI mean I can move forward and treat Amazon products like they\u2019re simple toys that are not to be taken seriously, but I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s how they\u2019re intended. It\u2019s certainly not how they\u2019re marketed.\n\n5:54 PM Pravash [redacted] | Customer Service\nI will pass these comments to our concerned team to review this.\n\n5:54 PM\nCan you have them follow up with me about this? I would like to hear the results of this feedback.\n\n5:54 PM Pravash [redacted] | Customer Service\nYou can also send it via an email.\n\n5:54 PM\nWould you be able to add me to this email? After all the hours of work I\u2019ve had to put in to get this far, it doesn\u2019t feel right to make me as the customer responsible for putting in more.\nIt\u2019d also be nice to have a direct contact for support if something like this were to happen again so I could receive faster support.  I hope that I won\u2019t need it, but all of this required a significant amount of effort to undo, and could have had significant consequences.\n\n5:59 PM Pravash [redacted] | Customer Service\nI am sorry, it's not possible to add you to this email from my side.\n\n6:00 PM\nIs it a web form I need to submit, or an email address I need to contact?\n\n6:00 PM Pravash [redacted] | Customer Service\nI have passed it as complaint and feedback. You can also send it as email to us if you need further escalation on it.\n\n6:01 PM\nSo take away from this, and correct me if I am wrong:\n- The software/hardware is functioning as intended.\n- If this type of situation occurs again, my devices will again be reset and removed from my account.\n- Should I lose faith in the product due to this intended behavior I will not be eligible for a refund of these devices.\n- feedback has been submitted, but I will not be contacted regarding the outcome.\n- I can email a different team to look for solutions or submit other feedback, if I want, but there is no guarantee I will be contacted.\n\n6:04 PM Pravash [redacted] | Customer Service\nYes, please.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/help/contact-us/general-questions.html\nYou can use the above link to forward your email too.\nIs there anything else I can assist you with today?\n\n6:05 PM\nAnd that is where I will need to go to further escalate this, you can not assist with facilitating that communication?  You do not have the ability to escalate this further?\n\n6:06 PM Pravash [redacted] | Customer Service\nI am sorry, I am unable to escalate this and I have already passed it as feedback.\n\n6:07 PM\nAlright, I understand. And to confirm, it is normal normal for the account to be put on hold without contacting a customer first right? The hold and device un registration will always happen before I am given a chance to resolve it?\n\n6:08 PM Pravash [redacted] | Customer Service\nThe deregistration of devices is instinctive when the Account will be blocked.\n\n6:10 PM \nalright, thank you for that confirmation.",

My parents and my sister have shared their Google calendars with me (and I with them) so we can easily stay up to date on who's where and what family events/birthdays/whatever might be coming up.\n\nI've tried everything that I can think of!  Even if I turn the \"sync\" option to \"off\" within the Google Calendar app (on my phone, for example) or if I un-check the boxes for those shared calendars (on the web/desktop page), Alexa STILL reads/displays the calendar events from ALL of the calendars...but I only want to see the things from MY calendar throughout the day.\n\nAside from removing myself entirely from my familys' shared calendars (I really don't want to do this, because reasons), is there any way to limit which Google Calendars Alexa displays?  Or if it's linked/shared to my main Google account is that just too bad and I'm forever stuck having to see my parents dentist appointments and my sister's kids' daycare schedule?\n\nOne of my morning routines is set to read my calendar events, and right now it's reading *everyone's* events for that day.  I got the Spot for my desk at work specifically because it is a visual reminder of what's coming up on my calendar throughout the day, but I don't need to see all of my family's appointments all day in addition to my own.\n\nALSO, secondary, unrelated question:  Is it possible to have a task show up on the Alexa Spot screen, and then, just...stay there...until you mark it as completed or until you dismiss it?  I thought about setting a recurring alarm and just setting the volume to 0, but there's no way to \"name\" or label the alarms...which isn't particularly helpful if I need to mark a specific thing as being done at/around a specific time.

  "From what I can tell, Alexa seems to only be able to announce reminders to ALL devices, or only ONE device (the one that made the reminder).

When we've tried that, my daughter would be up in the living room and miss the announcement of class in her bedroom. Or in her bedroom and miss it in the living room. We don't know where we'll be, so it's not practical. And my wife and I are often in work meetings and can't always leave a meeting to make sure she heard the reminder.\n\nI made a group for all of the Echos in our house, and another for the Echos in my mom's house.

  "Around late April/early May of 2018, a bunch of tech outlets ran stories about how you could tell Alexa important information and she'd remember for you if you forgot:\n\n[How to get Alexa to remember things - CNET](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-get-alexa-to-remember-things/)\n\n[Here's How to Make Alexa Remember Things for You - The ...](https://www.macobserver.com/tips/how-to/alexa-remember-things/)\n\n[Alexa can now remember things that you ask it to remember ...](https://www.aftvnews.com/alexa-can-now-remember-things-that-you-ask-it-to-remember/)\n\nWas that all just an April Fools joke that got sent out a month late? If it wasn't, then Bezos needs to take her to get evaluated for Alzheimer's, because this bitch can't remember shit.\n\nSo far my mom's favorite thing to do with the Echo I got her for Christmas is to ask Alexa to remind her what day it is. I thought if that's what she's using it for, I should see if Alexa could remember things other than the day/date. That's when I came across these articles.\n\nProblem is, all those neat things that they said Alexa could remember for you? None of them work. Not even one. \n\nFirst I thought maybe remembering mine and my siblings ,birthdays would be helpsul, since mom gets them mixed up. Here's how that went:\n\nMe: Alexa, remember that \\[my brothter's name\\]'s birthday is March 22nd.\n\nAlexa: You want me to note that \\[my brother's name\\]'s birthday is on March 22nd, right?\n\nMe: Yes.\n\nAlexa: I'll note it.\n\nLATER...\n\nMe: Alexa, when is \\[my brother's name\\]'s birthday?\n\nAlexa: Hmmm... I'm not sure. \n\nBaffled by this, I tried the same thing with another sibling. This time when I asked when their birthday was, I got \"Sid  Vicious's birthday is May 10th.\" My brother is NOT Sid Vicious. Has she been smoking crack?\n\nI tried the dates of an upcoming visit, my new address and what time the corner store closes. Despite having told her to remember all of these things, when it came time to remember, she couldn't.\n\nI finally tried an easy one by asking her to remember that the green grapes are in the blue box. When I asked \"What's in the blue box,\" she  replied:\n\n\"Blue Box\" by Kate Ceberano has 13 songs and it's tracks are Change, Blue Box, Love and Affection, The Rules, Living with Lies...\"\n\nSo the only thing I can think of is that this was somtehing tech journalists did to fuck with the rest of us and make us think this \"Alexa\" thing was worth a damn and not just a mediocre speaker and slightly better doorstop.",

  "Besides routines (looking for something that can be used with just voice), is there a way to have Alexa say \"a thing\" at \"a time?\" So far I'm only seeing Reminders, Alarms, Timers, and Routines; each of which have their annoyances and flaws. \n\nSimple example... I'd like to say \"Alexa, let me know when it's 9pm\" and at 9pm, Alexa would say \"It's 9pm.\" Currently, this would set an alarm, so at 9pm, instead of her say \"It's 9pm\" she says, \"BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP\" until I tell her to \"STOOOPPPPP.\" \n\nReminders for this are annoying because they're logged by the app and need to be completed or dismissed (I don't need to check off that I have \"done a 9pm\") along with the double-repeat and the \"Here's your reminder...\" preface. \n\nI could set up a routine in my phone to say a custom text string at a specific time (hell of a thing to do for a quick off-the-cuff notification and kind of defeats the concept of a voice assistant). \n\nI tried the voice command \"Alexa, at 9pm, tell me it's 9pm\" and she still is like \"Okay, Alarm set for 9pm.\" -\\_- \n\nI tried \"Alexa, at 9pm, say the phrase, it's 9pm\" and she just kinda shuts-off mid command or says \"Sorry, I don't know that.\" \n\nAny ideas?",

Is there a setting for that or is it time to play hockey with my Echo Dot?",
  "Hi all, I hope this is the right forum for questions like this. We just got an Alexa and while my partner and I have tried to use Amazon households, it is very much linked to her phone. Is there a way we can get reminder notifications to either recognise who gives the reminder and send each one to the correct phone, or to send reminders to two phones? Thanks a lot :)",
  "Every time I ask for my shopping list or to do list, my Echo Dot reads out the 5 most recent things and then asks if I want to hear the rest. Is there any way of just hearing the full list as a default instead of adding a second prompt? Using frequent audio reminders is SUPER helpful for the way my brain works, but stopping a lost halfway through kinda defeats the point when it makes me more likely to forget half the list while thinking about the other half.",
  "I use reminders a lot on my devices. When I first set up the devices two years ago I could ask 'what's my next reminder?' and it would tell me no problem. Now when I ask the same question I get a list of my next four reminders with Alexa only responding to stop about 30% of the time. Is there any terminology I can use to get the time for ONLY my next reminder?",
  "I just got the echo auto, and so far I\u2019m loving having Alexa along with me when I\u2019m driving.  I can check my calendar, play my news briefing, set reminders, add to to do lists, and add events that will be there on alexa at home when I get there.  \n\nI only have one issue so far: because my car is in my garage, my phone connects and disconnects from my vehicle Bluetooth throughout the day.  This has never been a problem because my phone doesn\u2019t usually tell me about it.  But ever since getting echo auto, every time my phone connects to Bluetooth I get a new banner telling me we\u2019re ready to drive.  If I happen to be using the alexa app to set an all devices alarm or reminder at that time, my whole app will go into car mode unbidden and I have to tell it I\u2019m a passenger and start what I was doing again - all while standing in my kitchen, clearly not being a passenger in my car!  These announcements also go to my apple watch when I\u2019m at work and am near the window where my car is parked directly outside in the parking lot.  While none of these things are big; It\u2019s distracting and irritating when it is happening all day. \n\nIt seems like my only option is to turn off all notifications for Alexa, but then I won\u2019t get my reminders either, and I really need my reminders to function. \n\nAny thoughts on what I can do?  \n\nTL;DR - my phone connects and disconnects from my car Bluetooth throughout the day which makes echo auto continually send me alerts.  How do I make it stop??",

Being in a work meeting and suddenly having some 90's pop playing would probably not be the greatest thing.  \n\nIs there a way I can set up this hourly request AND a way I can easily toggle it on an off like \"Alexa do not disturb\" or \"Alexa pause everything for 2 hours\" or \"Alexa play dead\" or something?\n\nThank you.\n\n\nP.S.

  "We have a pair of Dots, one in our bedroom and one in the kitchen.  We mostly use them for timers and reminders, or looking up simple things instead of going to a browser.

So for example I have a reminder right now to take some medication every 6 hours, but I created it in the kitchen so that's where it announces.  When I'm in the bedroom, there's a very high probability I won't hear it at all.  If I were to create them on the bedroom Dot, then the inverse would be true.\n\nIt's a shame she doesn't seem to listen to which room has noise in it currently and announce there.

I only interact with the screen to say \"COMPUTER TURN OFF DISPLAY\" multiple times a night when it wakes up due to me coughing. I honesty do need perfect darkness to sleep, and if I could completely and permanently disable the screen I would. Barring that, I would like to move it to another room and get a simpler Alexa enabled device for my bedroom. I was looking at the Dot, but apparently the newest version has an LED clock that can't be disabled?\n\nI use the following features: Spotify to play music, timers, reminders, voice control of lights, query for the weather. I am not looking for anything fancy and not super concerned with high quality music sound. Is there a good device out there that can be made perfectly dark at night? Thanks!",

  " \n\nThis has happened recently (I didn't make any changes to anything, maybe it was due to my upgrading to iOS 16?) and it's SUPER annoying.\n\nI have an iPhone 13 Pro. My echo auto (in both cars, so it's two units) have stopped playing anything from Amazon music. If I ask it to stream SiriusXM, it works like a charm. Audiobooks? Not a problem. Play something from my iTunes account? Easily.\n\nBut if I tell either of them to play anything (individual songs or playlists) from Amazon Music, Alexa cheerfully announces that she's playing what I requested and... nothing. It never starts.\n\nAs far as troubleshooting, I know this:\n\n1. If I open the AmazonMusic app and use Alexa built in there, things play just fine.\n2. If I use Alexa in the Alexa app to request a song, the song loads, and is paused. If I hit pause in the app, it'll play.\n3. If I ask the Echo Auto to play something WHILE THE SONG FROM 2 ABOVE IS PLAYING, it works. If the song ends, nothing plays.\n4. I can play individual songs this way, but no playlists. The song playing pauses, but the playlist doesn't load. If I hit pause in the Alexa app, the song playing BEFORE I requested a playlist plays.\n\nI disconnected and reconnected my one Echo Auto from the app and reset it. Problem persists. I can play things just fine at home/via the Amazon Music app, so it's not anything weird like my subscription ended.\n\nHelp?",

  "I thought of this potential skill after watching  the jump segment on ESPN, then quickly realized how difficult it would be to create.\nSeveral colleges have a pre-4th quarter routine for American football, Ducks for this explanation do Shout by Otis Day and the Knights.

The issue I see are all the two variables being the most challenging.\n1) First there are the acquired rights to the song to play in the skill.\n2) The variable of time, not just the day and time of the game but when the third quarter ends.\n\nThis skill would surely be a money maker with a nominal app price followed by a $0.50-$1 per game subscription.\n\nThoughts?",

Her response was \"I can play similar music on  stations for *free*\",\"Here is a station based on the album; Honeymoon.\" This is new, Alex used to play all of the music that wasn't \"premium\" which required the subscription.

Music streams fine to all devices except for a dot that I have FreeTime (Kids Mode) enabled. When I try to stream an album it wants me to pay $3.99 for Unlimited for this device - which shouldn't happen as I have the subscription already.\n\nI was working fine until about 2 days ago - can't say what changed. I've been all around the Alexa app trying to see if there's some place where I need to connect this dot to my Unlimited account - but it all appears linked to my eyes.\n\nAny ideas?",
  "(crossposted in r/amazon)\n\nHi\n\n**Is this a good setup for an elderly couple, to get them into the world of streaming music? I'm thinking an Echo 3rd gen, a Fire 10 tablet, and adding amazon music unlimited to their Prime subscription.**\n\nBackstory: As an IT guy, I'm often come to the rescue an elderly friend or family member. In return, I get the satisfaction of feeling useful, and I get spoiled with home cooking and wine and funny old stories! Sounds like a pretty good deal to me.\n\nMy dear friend's parents called me over because they had a CD carousel jukebox that held 60 CD's that stopped working. No one is cracking open old sony cd boomboxes and replacing motors and belts any more, and they don't make 60-CD boomboxes anymore. I suggested we go streaming but they were resistant. So we actually bought a used replacement unit from an amazon seller and it arrived defective lol.\n\nNow they're on board. I want to bring them into the world of streaming music. I figure this is a good low budget solution. With the fire tablet, we can set up amazon music, and quickly rebuild their beloved CD collection into a playlist using the visual interface, plus get them turned on to the idea that they can add pretty much anything they want as part of that monthly subscription fee. And then they can just call out to Alexa to play music on the Echo whenever they like. That make sense? And I suspect they'll get addicted and they can add more echos later.\n\nIs there anything crucial I should know about, or add to this plan? I'm assuming Amazon music has pretty much everything in it, right? They are already using amazon prime, and the Mrs has a Kindle Fire for reading books, and competing products are pricier and/or less intuitive than Amazon/Alexa, I think. This plan seems like it has a good chance of bringing our old friends into the streaming age. Do you redditors agree?\n\nThanks for reading!",
  "So my parent buy pretty much everything on amazon so they have a prime membership. I don\u2019t buy as frequently so I don\u2019t have prime. I did get an echo Spot recently and I was thinking if there\u2019s any way I can use my parents Prime account with amazon music on my spot? They will never use it and will never have a spot so it seems like a waste. I know it\u2019s not expensive, but all these subscriptions add up. I like how Apple and Netflix natively work with my devices.",
  "I'll ask Alexa to play a song from somewhere that I have a subscription to, and she'll only play a sample. for example, I asked Alexa to play Ashes from Deadpool (Don't hate, its a good song) and she played it the first two-three times but now she only plays a sample. When I log on to apple music, I can play it all the way through on my computer with no limits. Yes, my subscription to apple music is still active. Anybody know why this is?\n\nThanks!",
  "I bought two new dots, gen 3, and they refuse to play music from my Amazon Unlimited Echo subscription (canada).  \nWhen I ask for a song that is only available from the Unlimited subscription, it used to say something like \"you need to upgrade to unlimited subscription\" but now it just plays samples.\n\n  \nI have two other gen 2 dots and a full size gen 2 echo that will all play unlimited music just fine.  \nThe gen 3's will play anything from the free music list.  \n\n\nI am not sure if it's because for some reason Echo Dot gen3's aren't included in the Echo subscription (echo,dot,tap) or if they just aren't properly set up. They seem to be linked to my other echo's in every other way.",
  "Any way to get Alexa to integrate/read calendar subscriptions?  I have a family calendar (cozi) that I find useful and would like Alexa to read these appointments off to me in the morning.  Would also do my kid's team calendars (teamsnap) which is also read only subscription based.  No issue adding these calendars to outlook or gmail or icloud etc, but cannot seem to figure out how to add to my alexa devices.",
  "We just got our Alexa and were a bit frustrated that much of the enjoyment of the device seemed dependent on an additional streaming subscription.

She saw that QVC was selling them and they made it seem like you needed a monthly subscription in order to use this. Also I\u2019m not sure what the differences are between the different versions.\n\n1.\tI want to make sure first that she won\u2019t need to pay a monthly subscription to use this since she\u2019s on a budget. \n\n2.\tWill she be able to play Pandora through this? \n\n3.\tAlso, my aunt mentioned somehow it will read off recipes, what do I need in order for it to do that? I\u2019d just like to have it all set up and ready to go so she can start using it right away. \n\nThanks in advance!",

  "Hi guys,   \n\n\nTL;DR - 1) Install amazon appstore. 2) Go to Settings -> Additional settings -> Privacy -> Install unknown apps -> Amazon Appstore -> check 'Allow from this source'. 3) You can now download and install alexa app from amazon appstore.\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nI've received my echo plus device last week, and I've been struggling to download and install the Alexa app since then.\n\nI'm from Israel, and the alexa app in the Playstore is not available for my country.\n\nTried US VPNs, didn't work either.\n\nIt seems like google wants you to specifically change your Playstore to US one in their preferences, but then you won't be able to change back to your country of residence for 1 year, which can hurt your active subscriptions to drive or any other active paid service you have with google.\n\nAlso, tried to download some recent alexa apk from some site (not recommended), and it only partially worked. lots of features in it failed to load, etc\\`.  \nSo I tried downloading the official amazon appstore app, and alexa appeared in it, tried to download and install,\n\nbut then nothing happened. I only had the option to install it again.\n\nI thought I was blocked by Amazon as well, tried VPNs here again - didn't work.\n\nI then checked if I'm able to install other apps from amazon appstore, and was surprised to see that I don't.  \nIt then hit me, that my phone probably blocks somehow the installation of apps from unknown sources, even though the I checked the usual \"Allow from unknown sources\".  \n\n\nSo I googled a bit, and found out that other people are struggling to install apps through the amazon appstore.\n\nAnd there it was, the solution to all agonies.\n\n[https://en.miui.com/forum.php?mod=redirect&goto=findpost&ptid=748236&pid=15254157](https://en.miui.com/forum.php?mod=redirect&goto=findpost&ptid=748236&pid=15254157)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThough I could use only the web alexa, it was annoying because some of the features are available only to the app.\n\nSuch as routines and contacts.\n\nHope this helps to save some other lost souls.  \n\n\n&#x200B;",
  "My free unlimited trial just ended, when I got my echo I read that having prime music meant I had access to several million songs.\n\nUnlimited boasted having millions more songs, so I used the unlimited trial and enjoyed it greatly. When it lapsed I was more than happy to have the million+ songs that come with my prime membership.\n\nWell now when I ask Alexa to play specific music she will either try to get me to sign up for unlimited, tell me the song is unavailable or play me a 20 second(ish) sample of the song.\n\nWhen I go into the app all i can select is \"music\" which takes me to a watered down unlimited window, which asks me to sign up for unlimited. It also has options for Spotify ect.\n\nI have a prime membership, I'm not interested in paying more for unlimited, but now my Echo is basically worthless for music playing.\n\nIs there something i'm missing? maybe my accounts are not linking or something?

  "Experienced folks already know this, but for those who are new to the Alexa scene, if you've subscribed to the $3.99 Echo Unlimited Music plan, you can add virtually _any_ album to your music library for free. Start out by saying \"Alexa, play the album <albumname> by <band>\", as in \"Alexa, play the album I, Robot by Alan Parsons Project.\" Then say \"Alexa, add this album\", and she will include it along with the albums that you've bought.\n\nWhat makes this handy is that it's easy to build up a library of music that you enjoy on a daily basis, without the hassle of manually picking what to play all the time.  Just say \"Alexa, play my music\". Good stuff!\n\nObviously, you'll need to continue your subscription for all those free albums to continue to be available to you, but from my perspective, it's a great deal!",

Do you feel that I would be wasting my money on a Pandora subscription?  Is there enough difference in your mind between the two (Prime/Pandora) to make it worth my while?\n\nI've listened to both and I like Pandora a bit better than Prime Music, but I'm unlikely to stop my Prime subscription, and I've never heard the no ads Pandora version.  Both function well with my 3rd gen Echo Dot connected to a small amplifier and bookshelf speakers.

  "So I finally took the plunge and bought 4 Alexa devices for Xmas: 2 dots, 1 Echo Plus, and 1 Echo Show.  The Echo Show (8 inch) is for my mother-in-law, who lives with us.  I have a couple of questions about the best way to set these up.\n\nWould it be advisable to set up the Echo Show separately, on my mother-in-law's own Amazon account?  (I'm pretty sure she has one).  My MIL is slightly demented, and I'm hopeful she will enjoy interacting with Alexa, doing things like asking for the weather forecast, asking to be woken up at 8:30 AM, or whatever. Plus, I'd like to use it as an intercom to other areas of the house. HOWEVER, as I've said, she is slightly demented and ***EXTREMELY*** dependent on my wife and I. So I don't want her to get *too* carried away with the intercom function. Basically, I'm wondering about the pros and cons of setting up her device on a separate account, and if I do so, will that actually prevent functionality such as the intercom.\n\nThe other three devices will go on mine and my wife's Amazon account.  The only other \"smart\" devices I have at the moment are two light switches (the switches themselves, wired into the wall), and 4 smart plugs that I bought for Xmas and haven't hooked up yet. Oh, I also have three Roku TV's that I plan to use with Alexa.  \n\nEditing to add that I subscribe to the Amazon Music Unlimited family plan, and my MIL is one of the 5 people on my plan. So, even if the Alexa device is registered to her own account, she should be able to listen to all her own music selections, correct? \n\nAny and all advice is appreciated. Thank you!",

The music, instead, plays through the Alexa app, and doesn't give any information on the quality.\n\nI'm wondering if it is still playing the HD & Ultra HD versions, or if it's just playing what Amazon Music would regularly play if one was not subbed to the HD version?\n\nUsing Android Galaxy Note 8 for all of this, music through Alexa App. I have Amazon Music app downloaded, but it doesn't play from that it seems, as it will show 2 different songs in the notification tabs, 1 for the Alexa app and a different song in the actual Amazon Music app. Basically I can have it show 2 different songs, due to it using 2 different apps for the playback.\n\nCan anyone confirm the quality or what is plays exactly?

I could make it play the song by using the Alexa app on my phone, but never by asking it. Also verified it was in my library. \nFinally figured out the problem.

Next song maybe a 50% chance it will be out of sync (noticeably, not slightly, like grand canyon echo, so it's not like I just still had the last song slightly off and can now tell with the new beat). Within 3 songs it 100% will be out of sync. Trying to adjust it again it will be like the current value is actually being treated like 0.

This is really annoying especially when I want to set things like timers or use things with the screen of the echo show. \n\n\nIs there any way to have a device preference so that it will default to the echo show besides disabling Alexa on the sound bar or disabling the mic on the sound bar?",
  "In the last 24 hours Alexa has tried to sell me a buzzer alarm, premium quality sleep sounds, and Shaquille O\u2019neil telling jokes. (all three of which I\u2019d already said no to another time) These devices that I have enjoyed for many years\u2026 I\u2019m on my third Echo Dot in there in both of my houses\u2026 Are way too often wasting my time. I\u2019m kind of tired of being the product rather than it being the product the other way around. I paid for it, I\u2019m a prime member, and it just seems like it\u2019s never enough for Alexa. Definitely wondering if google is a better way to go.",
  "Hey everyone!\n\nFirst time poster here, i hope i am in the right place with my question, and it is not one that is already answered here elsewhere. Also, english is not my first language, and not the language i use to communicate with Alexa with, so please excuse weird voabulary/grammar choices. \n\nI use an audiobook from Audible to fall asleep to. Pre-Alexa, i used my Phone with a sleep timer in the Audible app. Since i got my Echo-Dot, i usually ask Alexa to start the audiobook and once she has (saying both commands directly after each other does not work), ask her to stop the playback in X minutes. However, i tend to sometimes forget the second command, waking up hours later to my audiobook still running, so i thought i could combine the commands in a routine. \n\nHowever, i ran into the issue that i somehow cannot combine those two. The closest i have gotten is a Routine that starts my audiobook, followed by a second Routine that stops all sound from my Dot after a time delay. Which shortenes my commands to keywords, but still leaves me with 2 commands and as such does not solve the issue. \n\n I can program several things into my first routine so they happen after each other, but i cannot set an end date to the Audible playback, and i cannot set a time delay for onlyone of the actions in the routine (so that the audibook starts imediately and the \"no sound\" only starts 30 minutes later). \n\nDoes anyone know a way around that?",
  "I was talking to myself in my kitchen. Yes, I know it's weird. All of a sudden my dot lights up like I said \"Alexa\". I stared at it, waiting, and it started whispering. I've never heard it whisper before. It was going on and on. Volume was in the middle and I could barely hear it. It did not sound like Alexa. I said the wake word and \"Stop\". It did stop. It was creepy and I've unplugged it. Is this normal? A Halloween practical joke?",
  "I have a 2022 Cadillac XT5. Prior to this vehicle, I had a 2018 version. I would tell Alexa to start by using the MyCadillac skill.  Worked flawlessly. The weather has turned and I attempted to use the skill again, but with my new vehicle. Alexa runs through the skill, asking for my pin as always. However, I now get a message saying \"command start failure\". Every other feature works i.e, lock doors, unlock doors, sound alarm, and check tire pressure and fuel level, to name a few. Only starting the vehicle is the issue.\n\nI went through every possible fix I can think of. I did the following.  \n\n\n1. Made sure the right vehicle was registered and deleted the old vehicle.\n2. Cleared data and cache of both Alexa and My Cadillac apps.\n3. Deleted and reinstalled both apps.\n4. Checked that my fob and Mycadillac app can start the vehicle (they work fine).\n5. Delete and re-registered the skill and login info.\n\nI'm hoping someone else may have run into a similar issue, in any brand of vehicle and has a solution they can share with me. That or any advice would be really helpful.  \n\n\nI've attached a screenshot of the error message I get when I use my Alexa app and make the command.  \n\n\nThanks,\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2gw4vfk9hw91.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7f2d8d07de4046a854261882b43cd591eb6d345b",

  "Hey all you smart home addicts! :-)\n\nI am hoping some of you have an idea if there is any way to make more elaborate and interactive routines! Even if with 3rd party skills or tools, that's fine, too.\n\nSo here is what I wanted to do, but can not achieve with alexa's current routine system: I have the command \"Alexa, good morning\" for when I wake up in the morning. It turns on some lights and stuff and reads me today's calendar and weather. Cool, cool. Now, though, I was thinking that I wish there was some way to end the command's triggers with Alexa asking \"Do you wish to have your daily summary?\" instead of just reading weather and calender every time. Then she'd listen for my answer and trigger reading the stuff out or not, depending on what I'm replying. \n\nSo basically Alexa's routines would turn somewhat interactive with conditions and change the routine depending on user input.\n\nSounds out of reach, eh? :-( I tried to trick that with deleting the read outs from my routine and make Alexa just ask me \"do you want your summary?\" as \"Alexa says\" as last trigger.   \nThen I made a second routine with the read outs, triggered by \"Alexa, yes please\".   \nSo I thought if I said good morning, she'd turn on lights and ask if I wanted my summary. Then she'd have ended the routine but continue listening for a few seconds, so I could \"fake answer\" to her triggering the 2nd routine if I said \"yes please\".  \nExcept sadly it didn't work as she instantly stops listening once the first routine is finished triggering.\n\nOof. So far so much text, sorry. So.... ANY idea if there is a way to have such more complex routines where Alexa's triggers change depending on your verbal user input mid-routine?",

  "Hi, I've got a plan for Halloween, it involves the use of a flic button to act as a doorbell and trigger a routine which triggers lights to come on and go off, also to use the 'my pod' skill to play a custom sound through a speak. I'm having several issues with this. Firstly, it insists on saying 'PLAYING \\*INSERT TRACK NAME HERE\\*' before playing anything which kinda takes away from the whole intended spookiness. Secondly, the routines seem to insist that the action to play something MUST come at the very end of the routine and has to be the last thing to happen, when I want the opposite so that everything else happens whilst it's playing. And thirdly, the create the illusion of different lights coming on and going off I need to be able to add custom 'wait times' but am limited to a minimum of 5 seconds in the app and I leave the wait times out entirely, everything fires off too quickly to respond and loads of actions end up getting missed out entirely.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, I'm having a fair bit of trouble setting up something I thought would be quite simple to do and quite quirky come Halloween time.

The sound coming from of it is great and where it has a better output volume, it ends up accompanying me  when I\u2019m outside doing work on either my patio or deck (typically wood or metalwork). \n\nOne thing I couldn\u2019t figure out though is why there is a tripod mounting screw receptor on the bottom of the device. I imagine that you could mount it on a tripod and keep it up off the ground but I don\u2019t have a spare tripod. What I did have extra though was a microphone stand. So, I modified two generic metal bracket pieces I had. I made a hole large enough in one of them to mount between the adjustment nut and the bracket for the mic holder and the other one simply slid into the holder bracket where the mic clip was and attaches to the bottom of the Dot. \n\nThe weight of the stand makes it very stable and the adjustable height not only allows for the sound to go farther but also keeps it out of the reach of my pets and keeps it from getting dirty when I\u2019m grinding metal. I did cut and extend the power cord using some 16ga 2 conductor speaker wire so that I\u2019d be able to keep my work area less cluttered and avoid a tripping hazard and finally, in the interest of safety and I know me well, I painted the bottom half of the mic stand fluorescent green.

  "Hi all,\n\nI'm new to posting here, and usually I try to find answers first before posting my own questions.\n\nWith this said, I was reading some posts about Alexa and Wiz light problems.  I have  the unresponsive status for my Wiz lights in my Alexa app, however, my situation seems to be different from those I read.  In my case, I observe the following behavior:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. In Alexa app, the lights say unresponsive, and the status is never updated to reflect the device.\n2. The lights function normally with spoken commands to Alex, or in Alexa routines ( so this problem seems to be isolated to control from the Alexa app itself..) not a big deal, if they work in routines, and by voice, but would still like to solve the problem, if possible.\n3. The lights are also linked to Google Home, and work both in that app, and by voice.\n4. The lights work, and reflect the correct status (without problems) in the Wiz app.  Everything is up to date, I just moved to Wiz from Geeni based lights the beginning of this month, as Geeeni was giving me worse problems where the lights would randomly stop working in routines, or by voice which is more critical as I mainly just use the Alexa app to manage routines. (once devices are set up.)\n\nI am using an iPhone 12 Pro Max, running iOS 15.6, also Alexa app got an update yesterday, didn't check yesterday to see if this problem existed in the previous version.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRouter in use is an: Asus RT-AX86U, latest firmware\n\nI've disabled UPNP, WiFi 6, for (2.4Ghz)\n\nEnabled IGMP Snooping for both bands, enabled multicast routing.  These are the main settings changed from the defaults.  Also to note, I did a hard reset after updating to the latest firmware to make sure I was starting with a clean slate.\n\nThe remaining Geeni lights in use, show up in the Alexa app with the correct status.  I'm thinking, if it's not a specific glitch with alexa, maybe the router is blocking something from communicating to the app.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any feedback, I would appreciate it.

  "Hello everyone,\n\nRecently (past 2 months) I started having issues with Alexa when it comes to custom alarm sounds. I had it set up so that my alarm sound is a song from Spotify. Worked flawlessly for about 4-5 months but now, instead of Alexa going to the Spotify, selecting the song, and playing it, she instead just unpauses or plays the latest playlist/ podcast/ song I listened to before.\n\nNext, in the past 2 weeks, my lights (Solight WZ326) started to do weird stuff. I have commands to set brightness and colors - let's call the command \"Night\". Now when I call out \"Alexa Night\", the lights should set to 10% and orange color. Instead, a random number of them (0-3) do so, but the rest just quickly blinks and stays in the state as before the command. Sometimes it takes multiple repetitions for them to change. I tried resetting them and reconnecting them back to Alexa but with no luck at all.\n\nAny ideas on what should I do or try to fix this?\n\nPS: I have Echo dot gen. 3",
  "Ok, so a little background info. I don\u2019t have Alexa, my parents do, and they\u2019re a state away. So I don\u2019t really have access to the app in my hands. They just got a new button that they want to use to run a specific routine and asked me if I could help the figure out. \n\nThe routine should do the following\n- Turn off their home speakers\n      This is done using a custom command \u2018Tell SpeakerBrand to turn off speakers\u2019\n- Stop playing music on a specific echo dot speaker (That is connected to the speakers) \n        This is, apparently, also done via custom command \u2018Turn off music on music dot\u2019\n\nSo, for my question. Is it possible to run both these actions in a single routine? I guess Alexa can only do one custom command per routine, but stoping music on a specific Amazon device shouldn\u2019t really require it\u2019s own custom command, should it?\n\nExtra info:\n- They can\u2019t plug in the speakers to a smart outlet because the whole system is built into the house. \n- Leaving the speakers on is not an option as there\u2019s a static sound if they\u2019re left on and nothing is playing \n- The buttons they got are the Flic brand buttons, if that makes any sort of difference",

You say a word; it plays a sound, wtf. \n* Store listing and certification\n * Ok, understandable, but how hard is this to do for something so simple. \n* Making improvements based on user feedback\n * All I want to fucking do is play a sound when a user says a command.",

  "Hi All -\n\nI have a fairly robust smart home with upwards of 60 client devices connected. 1 gig fiber for internet.

For instance, does the sidewalk feature really work well? My kitchen is centrally located and I have a Ring floodlight camera above my garage which is at the other end of the house. Both the Echo 4th Gen and the Ring floodlight have sidewalk enabled. Do you think the Echo 4th Gen is actually communicating with the Ring floodlight via sidewalk? Would I see a drop in stability with my floodlight cam since in theory the Echo 4th Gen can communicate with it over longer distances using sidewalk?\n\nI\u2019m also not sure if the Echo relays signal to other smart devices like my hue bulbs. \n\nOverall - I\u2019m not 100% sure what connectivity features of the Echo are actually being utilized and if sidewalk is that great to begin with.

I joke that Alexa is the 3rd important woman in my life next to my mother and wife. \n\nAnyway, has anyone else felt this way or am I losing it? Thanks.",
  "My girlfriend has an Echo Dot in her flat which is probably around a year or two older than mine. When we both sleep we like to have thunderstorm sounds playing, so we use the phrase \"Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds on loop\". On my girlfriend's Echo Dot, the loop works fine and the audio is still playing in the morning. On my Echo Dot (with clock), if I ask it the same thing it never loops? It will play audio for about 30 minutes and then stop.\n\nAnyone know why this is happening or how to fix it? I checked the Alexa app, my device is up to date. I also have no other skills or routines that would affect it.",
  "I have a little skill that plays a sound file when invoked and I have initially tried to host that file on S3 but I have quickly realized that it will become very costly to run if the particular sound is invoked many times.

  "My son (6 years old) figured out that Alexa will play whale sounds, so he went and added the \u201cwhale sounds\u201d skill.

Fortunately I walked I to his room just as he was saying \u201cyes\u201d and shut it all down.

Is there any way to shut this off or restrict authorization? If not, then this is a big deal that will get parents very angry.",
  "Hi,\n\nI would like to know how I could change the music played on my phone when I ask Alexa to find my phone, I often use it, but I don't understand why there is this music, there is a very discret sound every 20 seconds, so it's impossible to find the phone in a large appartment, I have to ask Alexa to find my phone at least 3 times to find it,\n\nA continue ring sound, or even a music without pause would let me to find it in few seconds only\n\nIt's crazy, why this very low music???",

I'd like to connect them with Alexa so that the button will either send me a text message or phone call. Although getting one that automatically goes to 911 is an option, I'd like to remain the \"First Responder;\" at least for the time being.  \n\nI'm currently reading over this [guide](https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-use-your-amazon-alexa-as-a-medical-alert-system) which talks about an app called `My SOS`. It sounds like something with the features that I'm looking for, but I would rather find one that doesn't have a monthly subscription; perhaps there's an open-source option? Even if it requires a bit more initial configuring, I work in IT so I'm fairly used to messing with electronics to get them working.  \n\nDoes anyone know of a prebuilt set-up, or have ideas about how I could design a system to do this? I'm thinking that if I could simply find a wifi-enabled \"button\" that would alert Alexa, then I could create a separate script that uses the Alexa phone service to send me a text or phone call.  \n\nThanks!",
  "Hi all,\n\nWe are doing some home renovation at the moment and whilst we are ripping all of the carpets up upstairs, we have access to the floorboards to raise, so we are looking at fitting in ceiling speakers. As it stands we have a speaker on the worktop in the kitchen connected to an echo show 8, we have a home cinema amp connected to another echo dot for sound in the front room, and we have another echo dot for audio at the back of the house. Is there any suitable way to retain Alexa functionality whilst using in ceiling speakers? I have the ability to put amp(s) upstairs. \n\nThanks!",
  "I have some old playlists from Spotify that are still in my Alexa alarm sounds. Frankly, it\u2019s an eyesore and I just don\u2019t want my younger brother seeing the titles. Here\u2019s what it looks like https://ibb.co/7JfD86S. Any idea on how to get rid of them?",
  "I have converted most of the switches in my house to smart switches, and assigned them all to groups based on which room in the house they are in. For the switches that control lights, I've categorized them as lights. But the switches that control ceiling fans, I've left as switches. Now, Alexa is smart enough that when I say \"Alexa, turn off the lights\" it will turn off all the lights in whatever group is associated with the device I spoke to.\n\nI'd like to create a similar response when I say \"Alexa, turn on the fan\". For example, if I'm in the living room, and speak to the echo associated with the living room, I'd like to be able to say \"Alexa, turn on the fan\" and have Alexa turn on the switch called \"living room fan\", which is in the living room group. Similarly, if I'm in the bedroom, I'd like to say \"Alexa, turn on the fan\", but this time, Alexa will turn on the switch called \"bedroom fan\", which is in the bedroom group. And so on.\n\nCurrently, the only way I've been able to control the switch is to either say \"Alexa, turn on the ***living room*** fan\" or change the switch to a light, in which case the fan also turns on anytime I say \"Alexa, turn on the lights\". However, neither of these solutions are what I'm looking for. I'm mostly trying to change it as my partner expects commands to be intuitive, and am having a hard time selling them on the smart home when I'm having to explain commands that seem like they should be intuitive.\n\nDoes anyone know how to do this?\n\n**TL;DR - how do you generically refer to a smart switch that controls a ceiling fan as just \"fan\"** (rather that the full name, like \"living room fan\"), **similar to the functionality Alexa has for lights** based on the group they're in and the device you speak to?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: Sounds like Alexa can't do this - are there any other smart devices (e.g., google) that are more room aware? Not considering Apple as most of my devices aren't homekit compatible.**",

Customer service set my Alexa account to the UK, and Audible works for me again. Downside is that everything about your Alexa setup is lost, you have to start all over with routines, home automation etc. I figured this out no thanks to the jackasses that downvoted this post.",

  "Slightly new to Alexa, so please forgive if this is obvious or there's a better sub for questions like this. Also, I don't have my Alexa app with me, so my terminology may be off. \n\nWe really want to use our Alexa-powered Echo as a metronome. But among other hiccups, it's got a slightly long, cumbersome command to get it going \"Alexa, set my metronome to 120 beats per second.\" There are variations (e.g. BPM sometimes works), but it'd be great if we could add a custom command. \n\nI have limited experience with custom commands. The closest to this is something like \"Alexa, jam\" translates to something like \"Alexa, play Jam On on Sirius XM.\"  \n\nMy problem creating something like that for the My Metronome skill is that the beats per minute we want varies with the exercise. If I had my way, I'd be able to say \"Alexa, metro ###\" and it would include ### wherever it comes in the command. Sort of like I can say \"what is the weather in CITY\" and it will give me the weather in whatever CITY I ask. \n\nIs anything remotely like this possible? \n\n\nOh,  though I'm using a metronome as an example, the underlying question is broader than that --- can I set up a custom command that passes a variable (for lack of a better word) to the full Alexa command?\n\n\n...... \n\nIf not, any chance you have a preferred metronome skill? Our two main issues with what we've tried are hiccups and odd, jarring micro-pauses in the beat. Almost like it's a loop that takes moment to buffer. And then there's the cumbersome phrase to start it. Somewhat of a mouthful and prone to misinterpretation, especially when there's background noise. Another possibility is \"Alexa, Spotify 120 BPM,\" but there is a limited range of available tracks. A lot of times we're working  incrementally and it doesn't help. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI started asking specifically about that, but the broader question would be great in the long run.

No matter where he is in the room, if the HVAC is going, it monopolizes the Alexa mic. Same happens to me at home if I have a fan on near an echo. \n\nI\u2019ll stop there with the backstory. Please ask any questions if you have them. \n\nFor technology, he has:\n\u2022 Fire Cube\n\u2022 Insignia TV w/Alexa built in\n\u2022 Portal, configured with Alexa\n\u2022 Older iPad w Alexa app\n\nThe cube is connected to the tv as the primary listening device, if that makes sense. When I say something like, \u201cAlexa, open YouTube,\u201d the Cube shows the blue listening light, the TV turns on, and YouTube opens. Deciding which device should be the default is another topic\u2026\n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated. It\u2019s one of the few forms of entertainment he has and being able to control it is crucial. \n\nHave a great day, everyone.",
  "There was a post in r/ADHD asking about ADHD investments- an item you'd get for yourself to help work your way around life with ADHD. I thought I'd write about it here because as an appreciation post cuz Alexa has been life-changing!!\n\nThoughts will often run into my head with regards to tasks to complete, then I\u2019ll forget about it like a total Dory within the next seconds/minutes. So whenever the thoughts run through my head, I say \u201cHey Alexa, remind me to do \\[insert task here\\] at \\[specific time of the day\\]\u201d. I even make to-do lists to challenge myself to do everything that I need to do for the day! Alexa\u2019s also been amazing cuz I often get caught hyper focused + lose track of time on my phone or on some non-productive activity. When I catch myself drowning in a miscellaneous activity when I should be doing something else/better, I\u2019ll tell Alexa to set a timer to snap me out of it and remind me to do something ;)\n\nCertain tasks turn me off to the point where I can actually feel distressed/angered while trying to perform them, and it helps so much that I could tell Alexa to put on white noise or background music to help focus and make the task more bearable. I sometimes struggle to sleep because of racing thoughts that can often stress me out and cause me anxiety. Alexa's relaxing calming sounds (Have y'all tried water sounds????) puts me right to sleep with a smile on my face.\n\nI also leave my phone in the most random of places- lost in the couch, bed, car, fridge (I kid you not) and it comes in clutch that Alexa can call your phone for you if you ask Alexa where your phone is. Amazing. Those timers also come in clutch so that I don't forget something cooking in the kitchen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Alexa has been an incredible tool for me living with ADHD. I hope she's listening on the activities in my bedroom and while I'm in the bathroom loooool ;)",
  "So I have my bedroom lights set up to change color and brightness as the night goes on, to let my brain know it's getting late and I need to sleep. Some nights I'm more tired and want to sleep before these light changes happen. But if I tell Alexa to turn off the lights before 10pm, they will turn back on at the time that triggers the light dimming routine.\n\nIs there any way around this? To tell the scheduled routine not to turn on the lights if another routine (the one I use to turn off the lights and turns on the noise machines) has been activated maybe?",
  "Can you customise the alarm on alexa?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso, for example, in sted of having the custom noise it makes when the alarm goes off, you can have something like a rooster, or big ben, something more appropriate\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthanks",
  "I keep getting drop ins on my echo dot even though there is no one listed in my contacts in the app. I have no idea who is calling or how to stop it, I hear the drop in noise and the light just flashes green whenever it happens. Does anyone have any ideas on how to stop this?",
  "This problem has been happening every now and again when I ask Alexa to \u201cplay\u201d.\nShe will occasionally respond with something like \u201cask me for a zebra fart\u201d, then play the sound of the fart. It was funny at first but it\u2019s getting kinda annoying. \nHas this been happening to anyone else?",
  "I have this annoying problem with alexa where it tries to learn and it disables features as a result. My toddler loves it but then they take away functionality and I can't get it to do the thing the toddler is expecting.\n\nExample 1: I tell alexa \"meow\". It meows back. Keep saying Meow, alexa keeps meowing. Awesome. Somewhere along the way, the awful skill Box of Cats took over. Box of Cats meows 3 times then sends you to a different skill to try to sell you bedtime stories. I disabled Box of Cats 2 months ago. Still to this day, I meow and alexa says \"You've disabled Box of Cats, would you like to re-enable it?\" There's no way to permanently remove Box of Cats from alexa.\n\nExample 2: there's an Animal Noises skill that my kid loves. Great. When I am not in the skill, I ask Alexa to make a baby noise, a baby cries, and my toddler loves it. Now about 90% of the time it opens the Animal Noises skill and plays a baby chick noise. There is no way to tell Alexa to never open Animal Noises when I ask it to make a baby noise.\n\nI know I'm just ranting at the 2 people that might read this because I'm almost positive there is no solution but thanks for coming to my Ted talk.",
  "At bedtime we always put white noise on in our kids room.

Some people choose caffeine and/or other things to get psyched up to get working and keep them working, but for me loud music is my thing. The main person I want to know about texting me is my wife, and yes, she knows how to use the Alexa app and \u2018break-in\u2019 thru my music if really needed to, but I\u2019d rather do it thru a combination of programming instead of creating an extra step for her that is outside of her normal of just picking up her phone and texting me because she works outside of the house and her time is imporant too.

  "How\u2019s that for a need? Most post are people complaining their Echo is unresponsive. We actually want that. \n\nOur 94-year old mother (fairly blind, limited memory or dexterity) has a big Echo Show. Her four kids drop in on her. She doesn\u2019t have to do anything to answer or hang up. We drop in and we hang up at the end. That\u2019s all she uses the Echo for. She does have to have the volume turned up a lot, but that\u2019s OK, she has her own room. It works great. \n\nSadly, not infrequently the Echo hears something and interprets it as \u201cEcho, play heavy metal\u201d or some such thing. It\u2019s not pretty. It\u2019s really loud and jarring. Actually her trigger word is \u2018computer\u2019 but whatever it is it can be triggered by accident. \n\nShe never talks to Alexa so she\u2019s not used to saying \u201cEcho, Stop!\u201d Or \u201cAlexa, Stop!\u201d or \u201cComputer, stop!\u201d As such, when the Echo misinterprets something and starts playing (very loudly) a movie, or music, or a video, (or or or) it\u2019s not fun. \n\nOften to solve this they (the helpers at her assisted living facility) just turn down the volume to stop to unwanted noise. Then the next time we go to drop in on her she can\u2019t hear us. The volume is turned to zero. And we can\u2019t he\u2019ll her, or them how to fix it (because the volume is turned down)\n\n100% of what she does is inbound (her kids dropping in) so losing the \u2018local listening\u2019 part of Alexa would be a godsend. \n\nAny way to do that? Inbound only? No trigger word?",
  "Hi, I'm in the UK, and have a pair of Echo Dots stereo'd up. All content from BBC Sounds 'live' plays perfectly, as does music from Tune In.

I am now scared to use Alexa as I am not sure if my questions will trigger another hour-long fart fest.\n\nAs I said this is a 100% genuine question, I don't know how else to phrase it because no matter what I say it sounds utterly stupid but I'm being completely serious. I paid well over $300 for an echo studio for superior sounding audio but right now all I'm getting are superior sounding farts.\n\nI uploaded a video of the issue, I was streaming at the time so there are some overlays but you should be able to see what I'm talking about: [https://youtu.be/55BoVEMPFqc](https://youtu.be/55BoVEMPFqc)\n\nI also checked my voice history to see if it was mishearing me but as you can see the little goblin knows EXACTLY what it is doing:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kxss929zbne81.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fd23ad33022ce8e12b4a98149602779b6aa8f8fc",

  "This may be the best post I\u2019ve ever gotten to write on Reddit. Tonight, our Alexa decided to throw basic public manners to the wind (pun-intended) in front of a large portion of my extended family. \n\nPicture this: my family, having come from far and wide for Christmas, is gathered around a roaring fire to play the most wholesome of family games- Mario Party. My grandparents are at the kitchen table, my dad is in his armchair, my uncles (one of whom has brought his lovely new girlfriend) are sitting on one couch, and I\u2019m lying in my mom\u2019s lap on the other. We\u2019re VERY concentrated on the fact that my uncle\u2019s girlfriend is getting ready to open a hidden block when it happens. \n\nSuddenly under our chorus of voices, a rumbling noise begins. Quiet at first, then louder. AND LOUDER. Slowly, our voices die off and we all begin to turn, searching for the source of the obnoxiously loud, wet fart. Then, cutting the silence, my Alexa chirps out \u201cTo keep the toots coming, say random.\u201d \n\nStunned silence. Then again. \u201cTo hear a random fart noise, tell me random.\u201d \n\nI have never laughed so hard in my life. But when the laughter died down, we were still in the dark on why Alexa had decided to let one rip. I handed my controller over to my mom and put my detective skills (little brother) to use. But although my technologically minded little brother could figure out how to make MORE fart noises, he wasn\u2019t the one who triggered it in the first place. So does anyone have any idea why? I figured out it was a separate app at least, but I have no idea what triggered it.",
  "My toddler loves the animal sounds skill, I usually set it off with \"Alexa, make an elephant noise\" or whatever other animal noise she's asking about and then she can shout out animals herself or say \"random\" when Alexa prompts her and she can be entertained by this for a few minutes and it's adorable!\n\nToday she was asking for a donkey noise so I said \"Alexa, make a donkey noise\".\n\n...Alexa farted.\n\nEvery time I ask, she plays a different fart noise.\n\nGranted this provided entertainment in itself, it's much better than asking her to make a fart noise directly because with donkey noise there's no confirmation, no prompts to ask what kind, just a straight up fart noise with no explanation.\n\nNote this is different than any other animal as she doesn't start the animal sounds skill and the donkey sound within the animal sounds skill sounds like a donkey.\n\nI don't think she's misunderstanding me, I've tried saying it very carefully and enunciated. (Edit: just checked the voice history too, she definitely heard \"make a donkey noise\")\n\nI'm the only one able to set up routines in the family and so that's not it.\n\nCan anyone else try this phrase to see if they get the same thing?\n\nUpdate:\n\nSo weirdly now it just says \"sorry, the greeting skill is no longer available\". Whoever was running this probably saw an influx in requests and pulled it or something!?\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nWorking again now, also found out that the greeting skill is part of the official, built-in Alexa skills and handles things like when you say hello and goodbye and it went down for everyone for a number of hours.",

It was too quiet to hear from a distance, so I couldn\u2019t make out what Alexa said. It than followed up with a cheering sound before turning off.\nIt\u2019s happened a few times, and I\u2019m really curious what it could be.",
  "Since I enabled \"Hunches\" I've discovered that Alexa better not count on \"fortune teller\" as a second career when this whole \"smart\" speaker thing inevitably goes south. She's terrible at anticipating something as simple as when I might want to turn off the lights!\n\nShe clearly doesn't tap into all that audio espionage she's collecting for Bezos because she regularly kills the lights in rooms where I'm watching TV or cooking/cleaning/making noise. The concept that one might go to sleep at a different time on the weekends versus during the week doesn't seem to be one she's familiar with at all. And if you tell her not to turn them off when you get that initial \"warning flash,\" she just yells \"I can't understand you!\" and turns them all off anyway.\\^\\*\\*\n\nBut... the number of times she's turned off lights when I've forgotten or fell asleep before doing so outnumbers the times she's left me in the dark, so I've left Hunches on... for now.\n\nThe new development is that, starting two days ago, she's begun to just turn off all the lights in my place around 6:50 pm for no particular reason. If you ask her why, she says, \"I'm not telling and you can't make me!\"\\^\\*\\* I've been through all the routines and none of them are doing it. I have lights by different manufacturers in each room, so none of those apps have the ability to turn out ALL my lights.

  "Hi - does anyone know if Alexa Guard would be set off if there is a loud noise? I was wondering if it could possibly work for help monitoring my husband's grandparents.  They're getting some Echo devices throughout the house so they can call for help.  I was wondering if they enabled Echo Guard before bed, and then fell in the middle of the night, would a loud noise possibly set it off? I've never used Echo Guard, so not sure how it works.

When I went into Add action > Music and Podcasts, there was no option to select a particular song, I could only type the name of the song or station or playlist. The problem is there are many recordings on Prime music that go by the name White Noise, so when I went ahead and typed white noise and saved the routine and then played the routine, Alexa played some other white noise recording which was rather disturbing than calming.",

If you run with intra you can ear the vibration of your footsteps because you ear canals are blocked.\n\n**I tried Airpods Pro and the Active Noise Canceling successfully cancel all these \"body noise\" and was wondering if the ANC from the Echo buds were good enough to do the same.**\n\n**Anyone can share their experience with Echo Buds ?**\n\nCheers",

  "I have several [NiteBird Smart Light Bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0824HJ4NN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). A couple of them, when powered off (but still connected to power source) make an annoying noise. It's a high pitched noise that's a bit difficult to describe. It's not a continuous whine, but more of an intermittent squeaking. One Amazon reviewer described it as being similar to the sound of crickets chirping. Apparently a lot of different brands of light bulbs have issues with making noise when powered off.\n\nHere are some questions/reviews from Amazon describing the issue:\n\n>Why am I hearing muffled criquet noise from the bulbs? It\u2019s kinda annoying and migraine inducing... \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Are the light buzzing sounds normal? When I turn off the bulb from my phone or Alexa voice control, there is a constant noise, almost like a very light, somewhat muffled criquet noise... every single bulbs are the same, are mines broken? ...  there is a light constant buzzing sound when we turn off the bulb from the phone app. At first the noise  didn\u2019t bother much, but I started noticing a change in my sleeping  pattern. And I started waking up restless, exhausted and sometimes with  heavy migraines that just stopped when we completely disconnected the  bulb from the bedroom. The chirping noises  stop when we completely disconnect the bulbs (which cancels the whole  purpose of the automatic on/off schedule feature, or just turning off  the lights via phone or Alexa.  \nThe animals (especially the dogs) also  looked slightly bothered by it so I am quite sceptic and hope it did  not harm their ears and/or affect hearing.  \nIn overall, it\u2019s cool at  first and a great value but I don\u2019t recommend it for anyone suffering  from Chronic migraines (as Dr visits+medications will override the  costs) especially if you are sensible to noise.  It doesn\u2019t bother my husband much so I\u2019d say that most people aren\u2019t  bothered. However, we definitely went to buy the more expensive Phillips  hue light bulb to avoid the chirping noises. I wanted to love these bulbs soooo bad but anything that triggers my migraines gets a hard pass.. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Good bulbs however when they are powered off they make a high-pitched squeaking noise  that kept me up throughout the whole night. However, when the light  switch was off it wasn\u2019t heard. Intersting.  I had to take them out  because I could not get it to stop making that horrible noise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The  only issue is these lights make a chirping/buzzing sound even when the  lights are off. I had to rearrange my light layout because I couldn\u2019t  keep these lights in my bedroom as they were keeping me awake at night. I  plan to just keep them for use in the kitchen, living room, and hallway  bathroom as i do not hear those noises from room in those spaces. Anyway, great deal, easy setup, but low constant noise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But when you're ready for that cozy, deep sleep and go to turn off the lights, you will experience their screaming bat noises  that rip through your ears and make you want to succumb to  lamp-smashing rage.\u00a0 They work great with Alexa... even when you're  telling Alexa to turn up the volume on your white noise playlist just to drown out the piercing sounds while contining to convince yourself you made a good purchase.\u00a0  \nIf you simply love shrill exorcist noises  with mood lighting, this is the smart bulb for you. For those who have  enough to deal with on the daily and enjoy sleeping, skip it - you'll be  happier living in the dark. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When turned \"off\" or dimmed via command on Alexa they emit a low buzzing noise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of those are a bit over-the-top, but it *is* annoying. Does anyone know how to make it stop? Again, it only seems to happen for 2-3 of the bulbs (I have about a dozen overall).",

Occasionally Alexa just seems to refuse to recognize it.\n\nI'll ask it to do something with left and it tells me \"nightlight in hall does not support that\", which is kind of odd because I don't have any devices named anything remotely like \"nightlight\". Or it tells me \"there is no device named lamp\". Sometimes \"turn on left\" and \"turn off left\" work but attempts to change brightness or color think I'm trying to change \"lamp\".\n\nWhen this happens it is usually persistent, although sometimes the \"no device named lamp\" can be fixed by standing next to my Echo Dot and saying very loudly \"turn on left\" and really emphasizing the \"ft\".

I gave up and just turned the tv on for some BG noise instead. \n\nCame home from work this arvo and thought I\u2019d try to sort it out again. For some reason there was no Spotify option in my Alexa app on my phone despite Spotify still being my default music app and the echo was no longer linked. So I linked the echo and signed in and out of Spotify and reset it to default - first problem solved except now after re-linking the echo I have to go through the tutorial again because I still have no idea how to skip it (apparently I have to buy milk now). \n\nThen I try to voice command Alexa to play my daughters favourite song on Spotify and, hallelujah, She replies \u201cplaying Girl Like You by Maroon 5 ft. Cardi b on Spotify\u201d and we\u2019re all cheering. Until the wrong song starts playing. A look at the Alexa app tells me the \u201cGirls Like You Playlist\u201d is playing and it\u2019s full of songs that aren\u2019t the one we asked for. We try again using slightly different words \u201cplay Maroon 5, Girl Like you on Spotify\u201d and it starts playing a shuffle of Maroon 5 songs.

I asked it to do a sound check and it\u2019s been fine ever since, no unusual noises coming from it. Anyone ever experienced this before?",
  "So I\u2019ve had my Alexa for nearly 3 years now, no issues. Every night I use the \u201cAmbient Noise\u201d skill to play white noise, and every night it works great. However a few days ago I went to open it like I always do and her response was \u201cGetting it from Fire TV\u201d. So I tried again. Same thing. Tried to get her to open \u201cSleep Sounds\u201d (another skill) and same thing. Asked her for the weather and that was fine, she gave me that. Asked her to do another white noise skill (Ocean Sounds) and she did that.  Asked for the Ambient Noise skill again and same thing. The next night I tried again  and all was well, so I thought it was a glitch, but it\u2019s doing the same thing today. \n\nDoes anybody know why this is happening or how to fix it? I did have a Fire TV Stick I had associated with Alexa, but I\u2019ve given it to my dad and no longer have it, although I can\u2019t delete it from my Alexa app devices menu. However I don\u2019t think this is the problem as it seems to be random and the Fire Stick hasn\u2019t been here since it started doing this. The only two skills I have that it\u2019s done this with are Ambient Sounds and Sleep Sounds, the others all work fine. Is it a skill related issue?",
  "I just got a new dog and I wanted to see if there's a setting /skill on Alexa that will send me an alert every time my dog barks when I leave the house? \n\nHe barks loudly and hes in the same room as Alexa. Basically it would be like Guard Mode but instead of detecting glass breaking it would detect dog barking (or if its easier, any large noise that is made, since there aren't any large noises other than his bark anyway).

  "For some reason. my Echo (current gen) volume goes up after turning it down. I play white noise at night (Alexa, play rain sounds) and set the volume to low. Then the next night, or during the next day, it goes up one or two from what I originally set it. I'm the only person in the house. I've tried saying 'volume down one', tapping the physical button, and I believe I've done it in the app, but it keeps creeping up. Is there something I'm missing or another way to do it that would make it stay where I put it??? It's super annoying.",
  "We have a pair of Dots, one in our bedroom and one in the kitchen.  We mostly use them for timers and reminders, or looking up simple things instead of going to a browser.  The problem with the reminders is that they only seem to announce on the device used to create them.  So for example I have a reminder right now to take some medication every 6 hours, but I created it in the kitchen so that's where it announces.  When I'm in the bedroom, there's a very high probability I won't hear it at all.  If I were to create them on the bedroom Dot, then the inverse would be true.\n\nIt's a shame she doesn't seem to listen to which room has noise in it currently and announce there.  Or hell, announce everywhere... that would be my personal preference.  Is there any way at all to get her to announce reminders on a specific device?  Or am I stuck just always duplicating reminders to both devices?",

  "Hey Alexa gurus - I just got an Echo Show 5, and would like to use it as a fancy alarm clock.  I already have a 'goodnight' routine, which turns off all the lights; because I usually sleep with white noise, I've added the \"white noise\" skill to this routine.  So far so good - white noise launches after the lights go off.  But the white noise skill info remains on the screen.  I would prefer to start the skill, and then go back to the home (clock) screen.  I could say \"Alexa, go home\" once the white noise starts, and that would do it - but I'd prefer to bundle it into the routine.  Is this possible?  \n\n\nThanks in advance!",
  "Hello,\n\nwe have an Amazon Tap which is primarily used to play white noise for the baby. It was working fine until I tried to put the baby down for an afternoon nap and the 'loop white noise' command wasn't recognised and instead the Tap starting talking to me in German. My German is a bit limited so I couldn't do much with it, when I checked later on my phone I noticed German was added and selected as the main language on the device. We have several other Amazon devices and nothing has changed on them. Anyone has an idea how this could be added? \n\nIf anyone needs more info, we speak mainly English in our household and I speak Dutch to the baby (my other kids understand Dutch but don't really speak it). No one really says anything besides 'Alexa start white noise' and 'Alexa stop' to this device. It was working fine 4 hours prior when he went down for a morning nap.\n\nOnly my phone has the Alexa app on it to configure devices and it's been off for a few days since it won't charge any longer.",
  "My Alexa is acting super weird lately. Randomly at night, she starts playing super creepy music. Heavy, low, dark horror movie piano sounds, and that turns into a weird hip-hop funky song, but still with that creepy piano. A song I never played before. I checked it\u2019s log, no command was given to it. There was no bluetooth connection, no Spotify or Amazon Music activity, simply nothing. Alexa got no command to to anything. And what creeps me out the most: I was sitting there for about 10 minutes in my living room, petting my cats, I made no noise. 5 minutes before, it played the song I asked for, and all of a sudden, it plays this creepy song again. Again, no clue in the log. She has not misheard a command, and she has not made any sign of connecting/disconnecting, she was not operated by a different device. Only I got access to my Amazon and my Wi-Fi. \n\nCan anyone help me with this bug? I consider selling my Echo Dot, this is robbing my sleep lately...",

  "Alexa recently gained the feature where on every phone notification while sleeping it will remind me I have a phone, what it's name is, that it has Bluetooth, and that I told it to connect, every time the device makes a noise.\n\nEvery time the phone gets a notification of any description now, Alexa will announce..\n\n\"Now playing from blah blah blah\" \n\nAs if I didn't do the following.\n\n1. Tell it to connect to the phone\n2. Leave it connected to the phone\n\nThe sound could be replaced with trumpets and it would have the same effect, as I use my 4th dot as a bedside speaker to listen to things as I fall asleep.\n\nNow however it has the ability to wake me up to remind me I have a phone and told it to connect to my phone.\n\nThe functional use of trumpets announcing my phone's presence truly baffles the mind, as I told it to connect to my phone, not cherish and worship my phone's existence.\n\nI'm a nightshift worker awake during the day now to leave this message somewhere because my echo just woke me up to announce to the world my phone made a light beep to advise me of a notification, while it's on brief mode, in the longest way possible as a simple \"no sound at all\" would serve the purpose here.\n\nAs the purpose appears to not be present, but rather distant from earth and humans of the mind to think the one singular time about a thing.\n\nIf there were further proof that lizard people have taken over the planet who don't sleep and have memories with the capacity of a rice cracker made out of a rock I'm not sure what more is needed. The reason for this is the following.\n\n1. I told Alexa to do the following.\n   A. Connect to my phone.\n\nAnd then it did so, and I never then told it to do the following...\n\n   B(not present, as it did not occur). Disconnect from my phone.\n\nYet someone thought it was important to announce this when you have to also keep Alexa's volume up for alarms and such, and so as a bedside speaker will then be blasted at Mac volume with..\n\nNow playing from blah bl\u00e0h blah!\n\nAs if it itself is proud of it's very old and tired ability to connect to and disconnect from and subsequently play audio from a phone. As well as it's immediate notice of my phone's name and subsequent beginning of the religion of blah blah bl\u00e0h to become the proud supporter of my phone while I'm trying to sleep.\n\nSo I guess the question is, what functional use has this announcement aside from the above? And the answer to that question must then be to assault me while I'm trying to sleep with words that someday will cause me to attack people when they say something like...\n\n\"Oh hey what's that now playing from?\"\n\nAnd then me suddenly hearing the kill bill music and all that you know because I'm losing hours and hours of sleep to a feature that if I accept is necessary will cause me to become aggressively apathetic because the feature exists soley to remind people they have a phone and I'm not sure I'm willing to go down the thought process that people really actually are of such simple mind today that this is necessary.\n\nAnyway knowing vbs and Java the button to disable this feature should take a solid 10-15 minutes so I hope to see this before falling into a sleepless insanity soon after dealing with this for months.\n\nThank you. If the feature already exists just l\u00e9t me know what it is any you'll be saving me from the following...\n\n1. Lizard people.\n2. Phone cult.\n\n\n\nOh and as a heads up while laying in bed writing this it's told me I'm connected to my phone about 6 times.",

  "I just got a 3rd-gen Echo. I need it for white-noise when I sleep. However it seems (upon first glance at least) that Amazon Echo isn't great for this.

I don't see the option anywhere in the skills page (on mobile or desktop) of the full description page of the skill.\n2.

  "I've had my alexa system (one original and two dots) set up for a couple of weeks and the last couple of days I've had issues with it playing music and podcasts. It's like it stutters... I don't think it's a problem with the speakers as it's on at least two devices, plus it is a momentary pause then it picks back up from where it left off. This happens with Spotify and live radio streaming.\n\nI currently have them all set up as an 'everywhere' group so I can hear what I'm listening to as I wander around my apartment (this was the main reason I purchased), and around the same time I noticed the audio dropping I started having trouble with it not playing on all speakers (even though the Spotify app says it's playing everywhere). Sometimes when a new song plays, one speaker takes a couple seconds to play it (although when it does play it's in sync with the other speakers). This isn't a huge deal but it might be linked.\n\nThey are also having trouble listening to me. Sometimes I can be right next to it saying 'alexa' very clearly, without loud background noise and it doesn't pick it up. Other times the ring will light up, but my request isn't picked up, or it is but the response is very delayed. This was terrifying when I said good night to it late last night, got no response after a couple of tries so gave up, turned the lights off and snuggled in to bed, only to hear 'sleep tight' coming from across the darkness!\n\nIm guessing it's a connectivity/WiFi issue (but I don't know much about these things). Searching for solutions, it was suggested I downloaded a WiFi checker, but most on the Google app store had reviews saying that it's dodgy for asking for location data, and the one I found that didn't said that it couldn't find any WiFi networks (even though I was connected and using it at the time).\n\n It's also weird that this is a new issue. Nothing else has changed. Last weekend it was my pride and joy, this weekend it's a pita and I've resorted back to using my phone to play my podcasts.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? ",

  "We just got this for Christmas and as I have adhd my husband was hoping it could help. However we seem to have run into nothing but problems. Can anyone tell me if I\u2019m mistaken about this, I\u2019ve been reading up and this is what I\u2019ve seen so far.\n\n- when I went to import my to do list for my regular chores and reminders into Alexa there didn\u2019t seem to be a way to give a to do item a date or for it to reoccur, so I can\u2019t have it read out my to do items for today.\n- the reminders can reoccur but then basically vanish into a submenu in the app and don\u2019t sit there so I remember them. I have adhd, telling me once doesn\u2019t work!\n- i saw that it had todoist integration and i use that for work but having got it, it seems like they\u2019re phasing the integration out and it doesn\u2019t work that well now and in a far more limited scope.\n- I have an irregular work from home/in office schedule and there seems to be no way to tell Alexa what morning routine i want tomorrow, is that really right??\n- in a routine i can\u2019t get it to set off a series of alerts or alarms, whereas on my iPhone I\u2019ve programmed an automation to tell me how far through my morning routine i should be with a series of alarms, so I don\u2019t get sidetracked and end up late for work. The routines don\u2019t seem to allow this, which is mind boggling. I see it has a \u201cwait\u201d function that i could maybe use, but given that I can\u2019t program it to go off the next morning it means I\u2019d have to start it off myself, which means the times of the announcements wouldn\u2019t be right.\n\nIs this true? Is there some workaround to these problems that I can\u2019t see? I\u2019ve tried to look all of this up wherever I can and I\u2019m seeing either that it doesn\u2019t work how I want or there\u2019s no information at all.",

Then I asked \"was my alarm set\"and it said \"you do not have any alarms set\" which was not the answer I was looking for.\n\nI got an Alexa to use as my alarm because my phone was having the same issue and I was missing days. My Alexa is useless if it has the same issue. This is the second day I've missed this week and it's getting very annoying.\n\nIs it just my Alexa or do other people have this problem too.

  "There's something I'd like to use Alexa for, but I don't know if it's possible.\n\nWhen I cook beef stew on the stovetop, I need to stir it every 15 minutes. Right now, I just tell Alexa to \"alert me in 15 minutes,\" because there's nothing else I'm setting generic timers for. The problem is, I've been cooped up alone with Alexa for so long, I'm becoming inured to her, and now I'm prone to just telling her to \"stop,\" without actually getting up and stirring the stew. So I'd like her to stay on my case about it until I've set a new timer; setting a new timer would indicate that I've stirred the stew, and I need to stir it again the next time. (And for whatever reason, I've never been a \"snooze\"-er; if I set a 7 am alarm, I just also set a 7:05, 7:10, and 7:15 alarm, because I know I'm not going to snooze the original alarm.)\n\nMy first thought was to create a routine that would trigger off of the alarm dismissal, and would remind me every minute to go stir (making Alexa speak, not another alarm, or I'd be triggering the routine again), repeatedly--an arbitrary number of times (since I don't think routines have goto loops). And when I've taken care of the stew, I would tell it to end the routine, allowing it to restart after the next new timer that I then set. But my understanding is that, despite it being a requested feature in a handful of threads on the official forums, it is impossible to stop a routine that is already in progress. It also appears that dismissing a timer does not satisfy the alarm dismissal trigger.\n\nSo, can anyone think of a way to do this with a routine, with other Alexa commands, or even with other tools altogether?",

Worked flawlessly for about 4-5 months but now, instead of Alexa going to the Spotify, selecting the song, and playing it, she instead just unpauses or plays the latest playlist/ podcast/ song I listened to before.\n\nNext, in the past 2 weeks, my lights (Solight WZ326) started to do weird stuff. I have commands to set brightness and colors - let's call the command \"Night\". Now when I call out \"Alexa Night\", the lights should set to 10% and orange color. Instead, a random number of them (0-3) do so, but the rest just quickly blinks and stays in the state as before the command. Sometimes it takes multiple repetitions for them to change.

Like if he wanted to drop in would there be a beep on my end? Judging by the books here the guy is computer savvy- probably an old programmer. So my question is how badly has my privacy been violated?",
  "So I have a routine to wake up, its trigger is when I shut the alarm, but the most of the mornings it doesn't work, I shut the alarm and nothing happens next, there are few times that it works, I suspect it's because of my language setting (English USA - Spanish Mexico) any advice? Please",
  "I'd prefer to speak to my Echo as briefly as possible--to use it as a tool, not as a pal. The Echo team has made some progress (i.e. no more \"is that six in the morning, or the evening\" when setting an alarm before bed), but do y'all know of any hacks or settings I'm missing to make Alexa talk less?\n\nIn the same vein, is there a way to disable the cutesy, chummy shit? For example: I'm sick of having to stop that obnoxious \"thanks for saying I love you\" song every third time I tell my partner I love her. Any tips greatly appreciated.",
  "I've got a bunch of Alexa devices and only recently there's been a problem with timers or alarms on them not playing their sound.  I've power cycled them and connected wifi/network hardware more than once and the problem persists.\n\nI did this on an Echo Show, gen 2.\n\"Alexa, set a timer for 10 seconds\"\nwait 10 seconds\nscreen shows \"Your timer is done, 00:00\" with a dismiss button.  \nNo sound played.\n\nI've checked/set/reset the sound options, to no avail.  It seems like it's lost the ability to play timer/alarm sounds account-wide.  \n\nCuriously when I use the alexa.amazon.com website and check the settings for the Echo Show, when selecting sounds from the list it drops down an error saying \"Unable to play sound\".  But it also does this for other Alexa devices, so I'm thinking that might have more to do with it being from the web page, not through the device itself.\n\nAnyone else run into the same problem?  Timers or alarms firing, but not playing any sounds?",
  "Hi there. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to call this\u2026\nFor about a week TuneIn started to play a loud \u201eTuneIn\u201c phrase, whenever I try listening to a radio station. \n\nProblem here is, that I use a radio station as alarm and every time the alarm kicks in I now sit straight in my bed because of that loud announcement. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to build a workaround by creating a routine which sets volume to 0, starts the stream, waits 5 seconds and then change volume to 3.

  "Hey, I hope you're having a nice day. I have a couple of questions for you:  \n\n\n I have the 4th gen Echo, bought it a couple of days ago, and I've been trying to make a routine that chains timers, but it seems that you can only set one timer per routine, which kills the point, what I would like is to chain a timer for 2:30, then another for 1:40 and finally one for 50 seconds. It's for cooking steaks, but the closest I've been is chaining two routines, one with timer and another with a waiting time before setting the timer.  \nI just turned on the follow-up option which should help with setting two routines at the same time, but still... I would like to only say something once and then focus completely on cooking. \n\n Does anyone know how the \"Tap Gestures\" feature works? because I have tapped my Echo all over and it won't snooze the alarm.",

I modified the alarm that was running on the old device and moved it to the new device nothing else was changed.\n\nThe alarm goes off at 08:20 as desired and as before except now the alarm goes off I say stop, the alarm stops and then 10 seconds later says \u201cwhat do you want me to play ?\u201d\n\nWhy is this happening how do I stop it ?\n\nThanks",
  "So I have been trying to solve this one for a few weeks, and I am officially stumped. As the title reads, I have a multi-room Speaker Group set up for the kid's bedrooms. Their morning alarm uses a Schedule Routine to ramp their respective lights and play music from Spotify to their Alexa's (via the speaker group).\n\nWell, my oldest received a new 4th Gen Dot for Christmas, and after replacing the old one, the music component of the Routine has stopped working.\n\nI can manually trigger the same Routine from the Alexa app, and it works fine.\n\nIf I change the trigger to a voice command, yup, you guessed it; it works fine that way too.\n\nIt simply will not work with a Scheduled time.\n\nAny ideas you fine folks can recommend?\n\nI've also tried reinstalling the apps and creating an additional music-only routine on a schedule. Nothing seems to work. Has Alexa simply stopped supporting this crucial workaround with Scheduled Routines??\n\nEdited: Added Spotify to post. ",

  "So this morning I was woken by my alarm on Alexa, but it wouldn\u2019t turn off. It wouldn\u2019t turn my light on either. It reacts when it hears Alexa, but stops listening immediately afterwards. \n\nI\u2019ve checked all the other Alexas and they are the same, I can still control my lights using the app, and my son is able to watch YouTube on his echo show using the touchscreen but it won\u2019t respond to him talking. \n\nI\u2019ve unplugged them all, turned them back on and it\u2019s still the same. The internet is working fine and they are connected (it played music for my alarm and my son is watching YouTube) but absolutely nothing else.\n\nAny ideas?",
  "The only way I have found to get Sleep Sounds to stop running is for an alarm to be triggered. \"Mute Sleep Sounds\" turns it off temporarily, but, after you play some other audio stream, Sleep Sounds resumes running. \"Stop Sleep Sounds\" also turns it off only temporarily. \"End Sleep Sounds\" makes Alexa say it doesn't understand. Does anyone have a better command to use?",
  "I would like to create a alarm routine that gradually ramps up smart light brightness at a requested time. Depending on the day, I wake up at different times. Standard workday, workout before workday, weekend etc. Common commands could be:\n\n* \"Alexa, wake me up at 5:30am\"\n* \"Alexa, wake me up at 6:00am\"\n* \"Alexa, wake me up at 10:00am\"\n\nThis seems pretty simple with a standard alarm.\n\nBut with my desired routine, the lights would slowly ramp up brightness for 5 minutes at the requested wake up time. If a wake up time is not requested, the alarm will not go off. I am not looking to schedule a weekly recurring routine, but rather a default \"wake up\" routine using lights. \n\nIs this possible? As of now I have smart plugs which wont do the job. I've done some light research into Phillips Hue but I might need a 'bridge'? Any other recommendations appreciated.",
  "My kids each have an kids echo in their rooms. I have Amazon music unlimited but I can\u2019t play a song on two devices and I cannot stomach paying extra for that ability. Anybody got a way to play the same song at the same time as an alarm? I tried a routine but it only let me pick one device. I put them in a group but still couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it. Right now I have music waking up one kids and just a boring sound waking up the other. I can of course play it on their group on command but I\u2019d rather the alarm just do it\u2026",
  "I have been using an echo dot for a few years now, plugged into my stereo for wireless music control, alarms, etc. However, when my stereo is set to another input, TV for example, I obviously cannot hear anything from alexa. I purchased an echo flex to replace the original echo dot, with the original being set up elsewhere in my room. Is it possible to select a \"default\" device to do everything except play music, and then select the echo flex to only act when directed to play music? I want all communication to/from alexa to be from the device not plugged into my stereo, and all music/media to come through the device plugged into the stereo. The two devices currently seem to answer my commands or play music randomly. From my preliminary research it appears that this is due to the location-sensing microphones, with the closest option responding.",

  "I first noticed problems with the snooze feature. My alarm goes off at 7:15, and I always tell it to snooze 5 minutes. Well I learned to stop doing that this week, cause suddenly Alexa is \"forgetting\" wake me up again after snoozing. The alarm will go off, I'll say \"Alexa, snooze for 5 minutes\" (like always), and then it just lets me over sleep and doesn't sound the alarm again. Was late for work, so now I feel like I can never trust the Alexa snooze function again. This morning my alarm went off, I started getting up and getting ready, and then my gf asked me why I'm getting up at 5:50? I realized Alexa had got whatever reason made my alarm go off at 5:50 for NO discernible reason. I have never set an alarm for that time. I thought maybe the time settings were off, but no she could accurately tell me the time. \n\nBasically now I suddenly can't use my Echo Dot for the purpose I bought it for. Alexa is just too unreliable and has WEIRD bugs. I also have spells where she just stops understanding common commands. E.g. I used to say \"read me a book\" and it would play audible. Worked every time. Now 50% of the time she doesn't understand that command. Also have spells where she just refuses to play Spotify and I can only fix it by resetting and logging out of EVERYTHING.

I even set up a metal playlist as backup just incase for a second alarm.\n\nI like a lot of musical styles but those aren't on my top ten.  How can I get her to get a clue and stop playing it?  Can I train her in what I like or is it going to just assume that because my neighbors might like it (i live in an apartment) then I must love it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat say you?\n\nThanks",
  "I like the free Guard skill (the one where echo listens for breaking glass or a fire alarm), but I'm wondering if there's a way to modify it to remind me to check the back door before I go.\nIdeally, it would go something like this:\nMe-Alexa, I'm leaving now.\nEcho-If you're leaving from the garage, make sure the front and back doors are locked.\nEcho-OK, I'll start guarding now.",
  "I use an Echo Show as my bedside alarm clock and have been using a repeating alarm that sounds at the same time every morning on the weekdays. So when the alarm sounds in the morning, I do what I've always done and hit cancel so that the alarm doesn't snooze.  Now if I look in the Alexa app the alarm is turned off and if I want to use the alarm the next day I have to open the app and turn the alarm back on each day. The only thing that I can tie this to is that it stopped functioning correctly after I updated my phone to iOS 15.  Has anyone else seen this?",
  "My Echo Dot has been in \"Update Mode\" since last night (slow moving orange line), so like 12 hours now. If there was an update, shouldn't it only take like 20 minutes or so? I've tried looking this up online with no luck. I've owned the device since December 2020 with no problems. Now suddenly this happens. I've tried unplugging it, waiting for awhile, and then plugging it back in, but it just stays in this mode. It will still give me my reminders, but that's it. I rely on it for my alarms in the morning. Does anyone know what's going on or how to fix it? Thanks.",
  "Not sure if this has always been an issue or if I'm just more aware of it since I moved recently. I have my alarms volume and general volume both set to 2, but whenever Alexa gives me a reminder the volume is insanely high, seems to be around 7. I live in a block of flats with poor noise insulation and it's totally unacceptable to have reminders like this blaring out in the late evening - I can hear my neighbour's talking at normal volume and this is roughly as loud as me shouting, so I basically can't use the reminders feature any more which is one of the few features I use a lot. Any suggestions? I've tried resetting which is the only solution I've seen so far, and it did nothing.\n\nEdit: I tried lowering the alarm volume to almost zero and then triggering a reminder. It worked but now the volume is stuck at being inaudibly quiet, even if I raise it. I guess that's the lesser of two evils so I'll leave it for now, but if anyone has any solutions please let me know!",

  "I've been trying to fix this problem for weeks.  Originally, both my alarms and timers would sound until I stopped them myself.  This is what I want and expect from timers.  Now, on the most recently purchased Show I use in my main room, my alarms and timers will sound as briefly as just a few seconds before stopping themselves on their own.   I've restarted the Show multiple times and submitted feedback several times in the last few weeks, but it keeps doing this.\n\nMy older Amazon devices do alarms and timers just fine.\n\nWhat is wrong with this most recent Show?  Do I just have a lemon?  Or did Amazon update the programming on the current models of Show so timers and alarms stop sounding after only a few brief seconds?  (At most, it tends to last about 90 seconds.)  This is all but useless and potentially  dangerous if someone is using it as a cooking timer.\n\nSometimes I just want to drop-kick this current Show into a deep canyon.

  "Hi Folks, I have an Alexa dot in my bedroom that I use for my morning alarm. It had been working fine for the past year, but recently, it is very temperamental. I always set it to my favourite radio station, sometimes by speech and sometimes via the app. Some mornings, the radio will play as requested but at a really high volume. Other mornings, the alarm will be a continuous quiet beep.  \n\n\nI have it set to tell me the weather after I stop the alarm, but this only happens when the radio plays. Never happens after the beeping. She kind of shouts the weather at me too, given the volume goes so inexplicably high when the radio plays.  \n\n\nAnyone got any ideas how to fix this?",
  "Ok...it's been forever since I used my bedside Spot as an alarm clock...generally makes a great Alexa clock.  Used to be you could swipe up on the screen to turn off the alarm after it was going off...that seems to have changed and the only way I can figure out how to turn it off is to tell it.  Now that's all well and good but wife would like to keep sleeping.  When the alarm is sounding I couldn't seem to talk loud enough for Alexa to turn it off so wound up unplugging her.  This morning I woke up about 10 min before the alarm went off so I whispered to \"disable 6:30 alarm\".  She whispers back \"6:30 alarm disabled\" then in what seemed like the loudest voice ever asked if I wanted to disable all future alarms.  Grrr.  I'm going to experiment with a whispered \"disable todays 6:30 only\" to predict the 2nd question but any Spot users have another other suggestions?  The swipe up on the Spot screen used to work great....I looked through the app for options but couldn't find anything relevant.",

Another example would be to turn on (inside) lights at sunset when I'm home, but if, for example, I was away from home, Alexa would not turn them on at all, or at least wait until I came home.",

  "I have yet to implement some of these, but I was considering daisy chain routines-toggling-routines for higher order logic.\n\n**Goal AND Logic:** if Condition A, AND Condition B, AND Condition C, then Routine D Triggers Action\n\n**How**:\n\n* Routine A1 - if presence of Condition A, enable Routine B1\n* Routine A2 - if absence of Condition A, disable Routine B1\n* Routine B1 - if presence of Condition B, enable Routine C1\n* Routine B2 - if absence of Condition B, disable Routine C1\n* Routine C1 - if presence of Condition C, enable Routine D\n* Routine C2 - if absence of Condition C, disable Routine D\n* Routine D - if Trigger, then Action (add a cool down period)\n* Routine E - Any trigger (ie time of day) resets system by disabling Routine B1 and C1\n\n**Where it breaks**: For this logic to work Condition A must happen before Condition B, then before Condition C. Also Condition A through C will have to happen a second time (in order) once Routine D is triggered, to trigger Routine D again. Satisfaction of Conditions A-C cannot persist.\n\nExecution will be slightly more difficult because custom actions to disable routines must be done as separate routines.\n\n**Complex examples**:\n\n* If Button 1 is pressed, then Button 2 is pressed, then Button 3, then Button 4 (in other words, a password is entered), the front door will unlock.\n* If the forecast calls for rain, an wake up alarm is dismissed between 0400 and 0800, then the front door is opened, Alexa says \"Don't forget to bring an umbrella to work\" with a cool down period of 12 hours. Resets at 11 PM. IFTTT required for weather integrations.\n\n**Simple examples**:\n\n* If location leaves house, then motion is detected inside the house, play Security Alarm Siren and send a drop-in notification \"Intruder detected\"\n* If location arrives home, then use a time trigger to set the thermostat to cool to XYZ (Scheduled thermostat settings while home only)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Goal OR Logic:** If Condition A OR Condition B, then Routine D Triggers Action\n\n**How**:\n\n* Routine A1 - if presence of Condition A, enable Routine D\n* Routine A2 - if absence of Condition A, disable Routine D\n* Routine B1 - if presence of Condition B, enable Routine D\n* Routine B2 - if absence of Condition B, disable Routine D\n* Routine D - if Trigger, then Action\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nYes, you can (and I have) use routines to toggle routines. You can disable/enable routines by voice command if you give them a simple name. Name Routine D in the above examples a two digit number only (i.e. '11'), then use the Custom Commands for your Routine A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2 logic with the explicit language 'Alexa, turn off the ## routine' or 'Alexa, turn on the ## routine.'",

  "Hi,\n\nI am setting up my Smart Home having recently moved into a new property and thought perhaps Alexa would be a good way forward to become the primary voice assistance, after days of trying I've come to the conclusion that while the Echo devices are in general pretty good and have lots of skills and great integration with Home Assistant (with Alexa Media Player) that for natural voice control Alexa just doesn't cut it and for this I just don't want to compromise.\n\nWhat I have found is that for some crazy reason and even through Alexa knows she is in a specific room (or Group) with a set of named devices that there is no logic check that if I request a device with a device that has the same name elsewhere inside and outside of that group Alexa can't handle it and will flip flop between switching that device or the other... its crazy and very frustrating.\n\nHere is the setup:-\n\n**Group: Living Room**  \nLiving Room Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nTable Lamp  \nFloor Lamp  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both lamps above passed through from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Hall**  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Master Bedroom**  \nMaster Bedroom Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nBedside Lamp 1  \nBedside Lamp 2  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both bedside lamps passed from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Bedroom 2**  \nBedroom 2 Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \n*Lamp*  \nPlay Right (hue lights)  \nPlay Left (hue lights)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Landing**  \n*Lamp*\n\nHere is what happens:-\n\n**Lamps example**  \nI know that currently Alexa can't distinguish between Light and Lamps say either one and all the lights come on in the room, so to get round that have a specific lamps device that is a light group exposed to Alexa from Home Assistant.\n\nSo I walk into the Master Bedroom and I say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and she turns on the lamps because there is a light in the Master Bedroom called lamps... great it works there, I turn the lamps off with the command... it works. Next I go downstairs into the Living Room and say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and the lamps don't come on and its like nothing has happened BUT actually it has cause shes actually turned on the lamps in the Master Bedroom with that command despite it being requested from the Echo in the living room group which also has a device called lamps. \n\nNow within the Living Room say \"Alexa turn on the Living Room lamps\" and the lamps come on, why does it need Living Room Lamps, she knows she is in the living room group.\n\n**TV Example**\n\nExactly the same scenario above but with TV, I say in the Master Bedroom \"Alexa turn on the TV\" but nothing happens in the Master Bedroom but it does in the Living Room cause she's turned on the TV in there. If I stay in the Master Bedroom and say \"Alexa, turn on the Master Bedroom TV\" it works fine calling that specific group for that specific device.\n\n**What I tried**\n\nResetting Alexa, Deleting All Devices from the APP and the Alexa website, renaming all devices so they would be unique enough (Master Bedroom TV, Master Bedroom Lamps etc) and no matter what I've tried I run into an issue. \n\n**My Conclusion**\n\nOf course course I could name things like Table Lamp, Floor Lamp 1, Floor Lamp 2 which is fine to control individually and that works but if your a guest or if you don't know the house then you need to know what that these commands are and then it requires three voice commands or more, then another three to dim those lights because I can't just ask Alexa to set the lamps to 50% so she controls that light group from Home Assistant.\n\nIf you want natural voice control that is going to be intuitive to people that interact with Alexa it seems thats not possible.\n\nGroups seem somewhat pointless and to be able to put Alexa into that group so she is group aware if the logic is to first look at all of the devices attached outside of the group first and then just action on that first device with that name rather than staying within the group first and controlling that device and only going outside of it when a specific group device is called.. from the Master Bedroom.. Alexa turn off the Living Room lamps.\n\nI can then only imagine this getting worse the more devices that are added.\n\nI like the echo speakers and the integration with Home Assistant but if such a simple thing can't work then its out, I have been testing with HomePod Minis too and with this same setup in HomeKit and it seems to work exactly as expected one voice command for Lights, Lamps and controlling them in the room I am requesting them for.\n\nIts a shame I have to return my 5 Echos as I had some good automations and TTS setup with them and actionable notifications but they where primarily for voice control and Alexa has failed to integrate on this occasion.",

I was able to do basic functions (volume up / down, tv on /off) by saying \"Alexa, turn on the TV\", and could control apps by saying \"Alexa open X on FireTV\". I wanted to make this simpler by just referring to it by \"TV\", so I renamed the firestick to TV and deleted the actual TV from my devices. I was then still able to control everything but everything had to be called referred to as FireTV. I've tried different combinations of commands, unregistering and registering the device, factory reset etc, but I just can't seem to get it working by just calling it TV. Is there something I am missing here? Should I keep the actual TV device as well as the firestick in my devices? All I really want to be able to do is turn it off / on, open apps or shows, and play/pause/rewind.",
  "I'm getting so annoyed by Show now being an advertisement billboard, despite having turned off every one of 40+ options under home content settings. Some ads are impervious to these settings and they also add new ad display options frequently and default these to on.\n\nOne defense I have is a routine to \"turn off display\" every 10 minutes and that keeps it turned off unless I talk to it.\n\nI've also observed that a skill that runs continuously (such as one to play thunderstorm sounds) keeps her occupied and at least isn't showing ads. It seems to me that a skill that runs continuously and does nothing but display a pretty picture or weather or something would do the same. What are your recommendations?",

  "I have a Prime account and my wife is part of my \"Amazon household\" to share all the benefits and our digital purchases. Maybe I misunderstood how Alexa works, but I assumed part of that \"household\" sharing extended to Alexa.\n\nSo we each have the Alexa app installed and we can control the smarthome features and see all of the Echos in the house.\n\nThere are however 2 big problems:\n\n1. Every new device seems to need to be added by BOTH of our Alexa apps. Otherwise, saying \"Alexa turn on the X light\" will only work for the person who added it (e.g. me) and the other person would first need to say something like \"Switch to <other> account\" first. Same goes for grouping devices into rooms. We can get out of sync if her app says light 1 is in room 1 but my app says light 1 and light 2 are both in that room, then turning on/off room 1 will do different things.\n2. Spotify is a mess with 2 accounts. I tried adding my Spotify to \"my default music\" and my wife added her Spotify. But then when we try to say \"Play X on Spotify\" or \"Play X on Y's Spotify\" it always defaults to my account. For now I've unlinked my account so only my wife has it linked. But that is bad too because I can't even go to the Spotify app and select any of the Alexa devices to play on.\n\nSo is there a better way to setup Alexa in the house for 2 people? I saw recently (not sure if this was always a setting) that there is a \"family\" setting in the app where it shows my profile only (not my wife). And her's shows just her profile and not mine. Should I add a profile for her? Would she be able to manage that profile? Or would Alexa still be in this weird split brain mode?\n\nIdeally I'd like:\n\n1. We both have our Spotify accounts linked and can play music from our accounts on the Alexa. With a default to her account with \"Play X on Spotify\" voice commands\n2. Our smart home devices work after setting them up once.\n3. We each have the app on our phone to control devices/view the shopping list/etc.",

So if I\u2019m in the car, at work, or just outside doing something with my music playing, suddenly it stops and plays whatever she requested in her room. I was thinking I might could solve it with the Alexa \u201cLearn my Voice\u201d but the Show says it doesn\u2019t support this. When she plays Spotify from her iPad it uses her own session as it should. \n\nAny ideas?",
  "I am using Blue Iris as my NVR for a Boavision wifi camera. I'be got the camera set up fully within BI no problem although it added it as a 'Foscam compatible' PTZ.

  "My Wife and I share Google Calendar on Alexa.  Alexa is under my Account.  The Wife doesn't have an Amazon Account.  However she has done a voice profile.\n\nWhen I ask to add to the Calendar, Alexa recognizes my voice and she adds the event to Google Calendar, no dramas.  This being selected as a Family Calendar in all the relevant apps.\n\nHowever, when the Wife adds to the Calendar then even though Alexa confirms she has added the event, it doesn't show on the Google Calendar App.  After an Activity Check, I realized, Alexa is putting these events on the Alexa Calendar not on the Google Calendar.

  "Hi, I want to get Alexa for my grandpa so he can ha e access to stuff like music, weather, time, alarms, random questions, etc, but since Ive never had a device like this, and im very limited financially, I just wanna make sure I wont end up giving him a paperweight, so I have a few questions:\n\n-I know you need the app to set it up, but do you need to keep the phone you set it up on, around for Alexa to still work? Or once its set up, phone doesnt matter anymore? (I have wifi at home obviously). My grandpa cant see well so I dont want him to need to open his phone for anything.\n\n-Can he use it to make calls to anyone he wants? Or is there more to it?\n\n-I cant at least for now, pay for any subscription to any service like Prime, is there anything major that he would miss out on if I wanna keep it free? Can it still use stuff like spotify in its free, ad filled version?\n\nThanks for all the info, and if theres any extra advice so it can be more worth it for my grandpa, please let me know.",
  "I am getting married soon. I have an Amazon Prime Account and my fianc\u00e9e has had her own non-Prime Amazon account for a while. We are still living in our own homes for now, while I get my house ready to sell and move in with her. I added her to my Amazon household account a couple of days ago. I did that primarily so she could have Prime shipping and access to Prime Video. I was hoping this would also give her access to Amazon Music and found out you can't share it. Fine, we can live with that.\n\nShe sent me a text message this afternoon that the Echo Dot at her house announced that a shipment had been delivered. She wasn't expecting anything, but I was expecting one. How do I stop her from hearing my delivery notifications on her Echo Dot and probably me not hearing hers on my Echo Dots? The Alexa app lets me turn different types of notifications on and off, but I can't find any setting for limiting which devices play notifications. Am I missing a setting or is this something that is not available?",

  "Hey guys,\n\nI'm looking to make a few relatively simple Skills that play sound effects when activated.\n\nI've thumbed through the developer documentation and it seems to be so overwhelmingly broad that I feel it's going to take longer actually finding the parts relevant to what I want to do than it will to actually create the skill I'm looking to do. \n\nBasically ALL I want to do is to create a skill that has a bunch of sound effects that play when you ask Alexa to play them. They're mainly Science Fiction sound effects. Like saying \"Alexa, activate red alert\" and then a scifi alarm is activated. Or asking Alexa to \"Dial the gate\" and it plays the dailing sequence for Stargate.\n\nI know there are a few that already exist, but boy am I not happy with them. Most have sub-par sound effect quality, others have ads that play after the sound effect, others have bugs where they won't stop playing even after disabling the skill.\n\n----------------------\n\nIt's a bit insane to me that every single tutorial I'm finding doesn't start out with something easy and basic.

However, there are still several steps you\u2019ll need to include in your building process to ensure a good quality voice service.\n\nYour building process will involve several steps, including:\n\n* Planning (User experience, intents, etc)\n  * Uhm, I just want to play a sound when activated via a single voice command.\n* Creating the VUI\n * Again, I just want to play a sound when activated via a single voice command. \n* Coding the backend logic\n * This is like literally the only thing I want to do. \n* Testing (From Amazon developer console or device)\n * How much testing could it need. You say a word; it plays a sound, wtf. \n* Store listing and certification\n * Ok, understandable, but how hard is this to do for something so simple. \n* Making improvements based on user feedback\n * All I want to fucking do is play a sound when a user says a command.",

  "I have a small echo dot in one area, and an echo show 8 in the next room.

  "So something must have been changed in the last weeks about interpreting commands with room names (Germany).\n\nMy setup: \nGroup name: living room. \nIn this group there are 3 hue lights, 4 power outlets, 2 tado thermostats and 1 echo show.\n\nIn the past I could ask Alexa \u201eturn off the lights in the living room\u201c and it turned off the lights in my living room. \n\nSince maybe 2 weeks, when I say \u201eturn off the lights in the living room\u201c, Alexa turns off everything (lights + thermostat + power outlets, even the vacuum in another rooms setup). When I say \u201eturn the lights on in the living room\u201c it turns on everything.\n\nThis only happens when the voice command includes the rooms name. When I say \u201eturn off the lights\u201c to the echo show in my living room, it only turns off the lights like it should.\n\nThis has definitely been possible, since we always told Alexa to turn off the lights in room XYZ from any room in the house and it only switched off the lights.\n\nI\u2018ve reconnected every skill, deleted and added every device, updated every firmwares. I\u2019ve even tried every possible name pattern for the room and the devices.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve tried workarounds with groups and sub groups but it always results in this behavior. Even if no light is in the room, Alexa turns on / off every device when the voice command includes the rooms name.\n\nThe only workaround I\u2019ve found is \u201eAlexa dim the lights in the living room to 0%\u201c which turns off the lights and leaves everything else on.\n\nIs this a bug or something? Does any other (German) user has the same issue? Does anybody know if this is some misconfiguration?",

  "[**\\*Edit: the Alexa help page has now been updated to reflect the new limitations.***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=GHKNDEFH7JCKX4DB)\n\n**TL;DR -** I just confirmed with Amazon Customer Service that soon Alexa-to-phone calling will be restricted to a pre-chosen list of no more than **10 contacts per Alexa user profile**, unless you have and link an AT&T Wireless or Skype account to your Alexa Communications profile.  Making 'Alexa-to-Alexa' calls (calling between Echo devices, the Alexa app, etc.)  will still of course be unlimited but if you want to call a landline or cellular telephone number you will only be able to choose from your set list of ten chosen contacts.  \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Full Details -** Moments ago I used Alexa to make a toll-free (1-800-number) phone call from one of the Echo Dots in my home, something I do daily/multiple times a day.  As soon as I finished my call and asked Alexa to \"hangup\" I was greeted with a \"By the way...\" notification/response from Alexa which told me the number I had just called was automatically added to my list of ten Alexa-to-phone contacts and to see the Alexa app for more information, to edit my list of ten contacts, or to link an account and still be able to make unlimited Alexa-to-phone calling from my Echo devices.  Confused I opened my Alexa app and was greeted with a \"card\" on the home screen telling me the same things/to click there for more info.  I use my Amazon Alexa devices as my primary outgoing house phone and have since 2017 on my 8 Echo Dots, four Fire HD tablets, and on various computers using the \"Alexa for PC\" Windows app.  I am disabled and being able to depend on using Alexa to make phone calls in my home on my numerous Alexa devices is vital and has been a lifesaver for me - literally - as I am occasionally prone to randomly falling asleep/passing out due to my disability.\n\n*(Long tangent example from a couple of years ago:*  *A couple of years ago this happened while I was showering - I woke up and found myself lying down in my shower in standing water with blood everywhere after having apparently blacked out/slammed my head into/cut a giant gash across my forehead on the sharp corner edge of my marble bathroom vanity sink countertop.  I was completely out of it (a CT scan later confirmed a concussion) and had probably been on the floor for 15 or 20 minutes and was too disoriented to get myself up from the floor.  My cell phone was nearby outside of the shower and I was able to pull myself over to it but the battery was dead and I was too weak and dizzy and bloody to get up and find the charger.  Fortunately I had my Echo Dot in there in that bathroom and so I began trying to get a hole of someone who might be able to help me (since you can't dial \"911\" using Alexa) but no one would answer my Alexa-to-Alexa phone calls (because most people I know who have this capability never really use this feature and would probably be totally confused receiving a call from me via it anyway). Fortunately, after calling numerous contacts from my linked mobile phone address book via Alexa I was finally able to get in touch with an old roommate/good friend and they rushed over immediately and raced me to the ER. I definitely called more than 10 contacts before someone answered.)*\n\nAnyway, the Alexa app said I could link my AT&T or Skype accounts if I wanted to still be able to make unlimited Alexa-to-phone phone calls.  Well that's fine and great, but I use Verizon Wireless as my cellular phone service provider and don't have an AT&T wireless mobile phone or account.  I continued reading through the details and \"More Information\" help sections provided in the Alexa App (text content and screenshots provided below) and then called Amazon Customer Support to see if this terrible news was really true.  While on hold I looked online to see if Amazon had made any press releases about these changes or if any news outlets/tech blogs had written anything about the new restrictive changes to making calls with Alexa but found nothing.  The Amazon representative I spoke with also knew nothing of these changes, nor did the developer/engineering team contact he reached out to as I waited on hold with him on the phone.  He looked through various internal channels/systems and couldn't find any information about these changes either and so I offered to send him screenshots of what I was seeing in my Alexa App and he thanked me and asked if I would please send them.  I sent them while on the phone and he shared them with the engineering team contact he had been talking with about this while I waited.  A while later he did confirm that he had found some information about these changes (basically just the same details that are given in the new help section about this in the Alexa App) and said he would try to find out more information and if he does learn any additional details he'll share them with me via phone or email in the next day or so. He said while it's not uncommon for Amazon to be absolutely terrible about sharing information about big changes/new features/various updates with their team members before going public with the info he did think it was odd that there was next to nothing announced about this and that I had already learned about these coming changes from the Alexa app and said that might have possibly been by accident and apologized.\n\nI hate this and wanted to share this with other Amazon Echo device/Alexa users.  I mean, I understand that it was a free service and that Amazon is not making any money (aside from revenue from the initial device purchase) by allowing people to place unlimited, free phone calls from their Alexa devices, but it's super frustrating for a core feature like this to be restricted without any advanced warning or announcement, especially at a time when most communication/telecommunication platforms and companies are adding *more* capabilities and features/free extra data/etc. to be helpful while we're all feeling and dealing with the challenges of living through a global pandemic.  Super upsetting Amazon would suddenly add restrictions.  I am fine with being required to link my cellular phone service provider account to my Alexa Communications profile/account if that's necessary to keep being able to effortlessly make outgoing phone calls using my Alexa/Echo devices, but if that's the case than other service providers that just AT&T need to be added.  Maybe AT&T is the entity here who pushed for these new restrictions, who knows...  ughhhh.  \ud83e\udd2c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Text/Details and** [**Screenshots of Details from the Alexa App**](https://i.imgur.com/4I11wev.jpeg)**:**\n\nAlexa-to-Phone Contacts\n\nThese are the phone numbers you can make unlimited mobile and landline calls to.

  "I have a bunch of Phillips wifi light bulbs. I never have issues controlling them with WiZ app. I have WiZ skill added to my Alexa.

Thinking that was the issue, I connected them to 2.4, but that didn't help.\n\n Because I have no issues controling them with WiZ app, I know it's not a wifi issue.

  "1. Purchase New Echo Studio\n2. Setup in Bedroom\n3. Decide to move to living room\n4. Living room contains two lights and fire TV\n5. Change studio to living room on alexa app (android)\n6.

Also, getting the \"home theatre\" to work was not straight forward and I didnt want to have to do that again.\n\nThis is actually very disheartening from a troubleshooting standpoint. It means that there are MULTIPLE sources of truth depending on the code path taken. I would have assumed at the very least that this was backed up to the cloud and resynched to the echo's etc.\n\nThe fact that you can be in a constant intermediate state (not just until the next resync) means, 1. the resync can get seriously out of sync and doesn't know how to correct itself or 2. There is no resync.\n\nEither way, I could easily see a lot of frustration as the number of devices grows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's the best way out of this situation ?\n\n\nEdit:\nSo if I would have added a 3rd light this would have been easy to identify.

  "Hi,\n\nI am setting up my Smart Home having recently moved into a new property and thought perhaps Alexa would be a good way forward to become the primary voice assistance, after days of trying I've come to the conclusion that while the Echo devices are in general pretty good and have lots of skills and great integration with Home Assistant (with Alexa Media Player) that for natural voice control Alexa just doesn't cut it and for this I just don't want to compromise.\n\nWhat I have found is that for some crazy reason and even through Alexa knows she is in a specific room (or Group) with a set of named devices that there is no logic check that if I request a device with a device that has the same name elsewhere inside and outside of that group Alexa can't handle it and will flip flop between switching that device or the other... its crazy and very frustrating.\n\nHere is the setup:-\n\n**Group: Living Room**  \nLiving Room Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nTable Lamp  \nFloor Lamp  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both lamps above passed through from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Hall**  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Master Bedroom**  \nMaster Bedroom Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nBedside Lamp 1  \nBedside Lamp 2  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both bedside lamps passed from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Bedroom 2**  \nBedroom 2 Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \n*Lamp*  \nPlay Right (hue lights)  \nPlay Left (hue lights)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Landing**  \n*Lamp*\n\nHere is what happens:-\n\n**Lamps example**  \nI know that currently Alexa can't distinguish between Light and Lamps say either one and all the lights come on in the room, so to get round that have a specific lamps device that is a light group exposed to Alexa from Home Assistant.\n\nSo I walk into the Master Bedroom and I say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and she turns on the lamps because there is a light in the Master Bedroom called lamps... great it works there, I turn the lamps off with the command... it works. Next I go downstairs into the Living Room and say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and the lamps don't come on and its like nothing has happened BUT actually it has cause shes actually turned on the lamps in the Master Bedroom with that command despite it being requested from the Echo in the living room group which also has a device called lamps. \n\nNow within the Living Room say \"Alexa turn on the Living Room lamps\" and the lamps come on, why does it need Living Room Lamps, she knows she is in the living room group.\n\n**TV Example**\n\nExactly the same scenario above but with TV, I say in the Master Bedroom \"Alexa turn on the TV\" but nothing happens in the Master Bedroom but it does in the Living Room cause she's turned on the TV in there. If I stay in the Master Bedroom and say \"Alexa, turn on the Master Bedroom TV\" it works fine calling that specific group for that specific device.\n\n**What I tried**\n\nResetting Alexa, Deleting All Devices from the APP and the Alexa website, renaming all devices so they would be unique enough (Master Bedroom TV, Master Bedroom Lamps etc) and no matter what I've tried I run into an issue. \n\n**My Conclusion**\n\nOf course course I could name things like Table Lamp, Floor Lamp 1, Floor Lamp 2 which is fine to control individually and that works but if your a guest or if you don't know the house then you need to know what that these commands are and then it requires three voice commands or more, then another three to dim those lights because I can't just ask Alexa to set the lamps to 50% so she controls that light group from Home Assistant.\n\nIf you want natural voice control that is going to be intuitive to people that interact with Alexa it seems thats not possible.\n\nGroups seem somewhat pointless and to be able to put Alexa into that group so she is group aware if the logic is to first look at all of the devices attached outside of the group first and then just action on that first device with that name rather than staying within the group first and controlling that device and only going outside of it when a specific group device is called.. from the Master Bedroom.. Alexa turn off the Living Room lamps.\n\nI can then only imagine this getting worse the more devices that are added.\n\nI like the echo speakers and the integration with Home Assistant but if such a simple thing can't work then its out, I have been testing with HomePod Minis too and with this same setup in HomeKit and it seems to work exactly as expected one voice command for Lights, Lamps and controlling them in the room I am requesting them for.\n\nIts a shame I have to return my 5 Echos as I had some good automations and TTS setup with them and actionable notifications but they where primarily for voice control and Alexa has failed to integrate on this occasion.",

  "I have a Prime account and my wife is part of my \"Amazon household\" to share all the benefits and our digital purchases. Maybe I misunderstood how Alexa works, but I assumed part of that \"household\" sharing extended to Alexa.\n\nSo we each have the Alexa app installed and we can control the smarthome features and see all of the Echos in the house.\n\nThere are however 2 big problems:\n\n1. Every new device seems to need to be added by BOTH of our Alexa apps. Otherwise, saying \"Alexa turn on the X light\" will only work for the person who added it (e.g. me) and the other person would first need to say something like \"Switch to <other> account\" first. Same goes for grouping devices into rooms. We can get out of sync if her app says light 1 is in room 1 but my app says light 1 and light 2 are both in that room, then turning on/off room 1 will do different things.\n2. Spotify is a mess with 2 accounts. I tried adding my Spotify to \"my default music\" and my wife added her Spotify. But then when we try to say \"Play X on Spotify\" or \"Play X on Y's Spotify\" it always defaults to my account. For now I've unlinked my account so only my wife has it linked. But that is bad too because I can't even go to the Spotify app and select any of the Alexa devices to play on.\n\nSo is there a better way to setup Alexa in the house for 2 people? I saw recently (not sure if this was always a setting) that there is a \"family\" setting in the app where it shows my profile only (not my wife). And her's shows just her profile and not mine. Should I add a profile for her? Would she be able to manage that profile? Or would Alexa still be in this weird split brain mode?\n\nIdeally I'd like:\n\n1. We both have our Spotify accounts linked and can play music from our accounts on the Alexa. With a default to her account with \"Play X on Spotify\" voice commands\n2. Our smart home devices work after setting them up once.\n3. We each have the app on our phone to control devices/view the shopping list/etc.",

  "So I've finally given up with Google, the speech recognition has got slowly worse over the last 5 years and I use less and less of the features because of it.

Likewise for emergency numbers?\n\nSecondly what's the Spotify integration like?\n\nAnd for anyone who has swapped from Google Home, how has your experience been in comparison?

Just nothing.\n\nI have fought with this in the past and gave up.  I'm afraid this battle might end the same.\n\nNormally, I would just replace this switch with something else like TP Link.  However, this switch in my basement does not have a neutral.  Most smart switches require these.  The GE Cync is one of the few that does not.

However she has done a voice profile.\n\nWhen I ask to add to the Calendar, Alexa recognizes my voice and she adds the event to Google Calendar, no dramas.  This being selected as a Family Calendar in all the relevant apps.\n\nHowever, when the Wife adds to the Calendar then even though Alexa confirms she has added the event, it doesn't show on the Google Calendar App.  After an Activity Check, I realized, Alexa is putting these events on the Alexa Calendar not on the Google Calendar.  Yes, I can use the Transfer Function each time but is a pain in the bum.  Alexa should be doing this straight away.\n\nHow can I fix this?",
  "Hi, I want to get Alexa for my grandpa so he can ha e access to stuff like music, weather, time, alarms, random questions, etc, but since Ive never had a device like this, and im very limited financially, I just wanna make sure I wont end up giving him a paperweight, so I have a few questions:\n\n-I know you need the app to set it up, but do you need to keep the phone you set it up on, around for Alexa to still work? Or once its set up, phone doesnt matter anymore? (I have wifi at home obviously). My grandpa cant see well so I dont want him to need to open his phone for anything.\n\n-Can he use it to make calls to anyone he wants? Or is there more to it?\n\n-I cant at least for now, pay for any subscription to any service like Prime, is there anything major that he would miss out on if I wanna keep it free? Can it still use stuff like spotify in its free, ad filled version?\n\nThanks for all the info, and if theres any extra advice so it can be more worth it for my grandpa, please let me know.",
  "I am getting married soon. I have an Amazon Prime Account and my fianc\u00e9e has had her own non-Prime Amazon account for a while. We are still living in our own homes for now, while I get my house ready to sell and move in with her. I added her to my Amazon household account a couple of days ago. I did that primarily so she could have Prime shipping and access to Prime Video. I was hoping this would also give her access to Amazon Music and found out you can't share it. Fine, we can live with that.\n\nShe sent me a text message this afternoon that the Echo Dot at her house announced that a shipment had been delivered. She wasn't expecting anything, but I was expecting one. How do I stop her from hearing my delivery notifications on her Echo Dot and probably me not hearing hers on my Echo Dots? The Alexa app lets me turn different types of notifications on and off, but I can't find any setting for limiting which devices play notifications. Am I missing a setting or is this something that is not available?",

Want to know more?'. Can I turn off these 'by the way' prompts?",

  "Hey guys,\n\nI'm looking to make a few relatively simple Skills that play sound effects when activated.\n\nI've thumbed through the developer documentation and it seems to be so overwhelmingly broad that I feel it's going to take longer actually finding the parts relevant to what I want to do than it will to actually create the skill I'm looking to do. \n\nBasically ALL I want to do is to create a skill that has a bunch of sound effects that play when you ask Alexa to play them. They're mainly Science Fiction sound effects. Like saying \"Alexa, activate red alert\" and then a scifi alarm is activated. Or asking Alexa to \"Dial the gate\" and it plays the dailing sequence for Stargate.\n\nI know there are a few that already exist, but boy am I not happy with them. Most have sub-par sound effect quality, others have ads that play after the sound effect, others have bugs where they won't stop playing even after disabling the skill.\n\n----------------------\n\nIt's a bit insane to me that every single tutorial I'm finding doesn't start out with something easy and basic. Here's something I've seen a lot including in Alexa's development kit:\n\n##The Alexa skill building process\n\nASK has made the Alexa skill building process rather streamlined. However, there are still several steps you\u2019ll need to include in your building process to ensure a good quality voice service.\n\nYour building process will involve several steps, including:\n\n* Planning (User experience, intents, etc)\n  * Uhm, I just want to play a sound when activated via a single voice command.\n* Creating the VUI\n * Again, I just want to play a sound when activated via a single voice command. \n* Coding the backend logic\n * This is like literally the only thing I want to do. \n* Testing (From Amazon developer console or device)\n * How much testing could it need. You say a word; it plays a sound, wtf. \n* Store listing and certification\n * Ok, understandable, but how hard is this to do for something so simple. \n* Making improvements based on user feedback\n * All I want to fucking do is play a sound when a user says a command.",

Even if no light is in the room, Alexa turns on / off every device when the voice command includes the rooms name.\n\nThe only workaround I\u2019ve found is \u201eAlexa dim the lights in the living room to 0%\u201c which turns off the lights and leaves everything else on.\n\nIs this a bug or something? Does any other (German) user has the same issue? Does anybody know if this is some misconfiguration?",

I was surprised that it effectively auto-added itself to my Alexa app and wireless LAN -- 20 seconds after plugging it in, it was in my list of Alexa app devices. The options are easy and simple, and it is providing air quality reports in response to \"Alexa, what is the indoor air quality?\".

I use my Amazon Alexa devices as my primary outgoing house phone and have since 2017 on my 8 Echo Dots, four Fire HD tablets, and on various computers using the \"Alexa for PC\" Windows app.  I am disabled and being able to depend on using Alexa to make phone calls in my home on my numerous Alexa devices is vital and has been a lifesaver for me - literally - as I am occasionally prone to randomly falling asleep/passing out due to my disability.\n\n*(Long tangent example from a couple of years ago:*  *A couple of years ago this happened while I was showering - I woke up and found myself lying down in my shower in standing water with blood everywhere after having apparently blacked out/slammed my head into/cut a giant gash across my forehead on the sharp corner edge of my marble bathroom vanity sink countertop.  I was completely out of it (a CT scan later confirmed a concussion) and had probably been on the floor for 15 or 20 minutes and was too disoriented to get myself up from the floor.  My cell phone was nearby outside of the shower and I was able to pull myself over to it but the battery was dead and I was too weak and dizzy and bloody to get up and find the charger.  Fortunately I had my Echo Dot in there in that bathroom and so I began trying to get a hole of someone who might be able to help me (since you can't dial \"911\" using Alexa) but no one would answer my Alexa-to-Alexa phone calls (because most people I know who have this capability never really use this feature and would probably be totally confused receiving a call from me via it anyway). Fortunately, after calling numerous contacts from my linked mobile phone address book via Alexa I was finally able to get in touch with an old roommate/good friend and they rushed over immediately and raced me to the ER. I definitely called more than 10 contacts before someone answered.)*\n\nAnyway, the Alexa app said I could link my AT&T or Skype accounts if I wanted to still be able to make unlimited Alexa-to-phone phone calls.  Well that's fine and great, but I use Verizon Wireless as my cellular phone service provider and don't have an AT&T wireless mobile phone or account.  I continued reading through the details and \"More Information\" help sections provided in the Alexa App (text content and screenshots provided below) and then called Amazon Customer Support to see if this terrible news was really true.  While on hold I looked online to see if Amazon had made any press releases about these changes or if any news outlets/tech blogs had written anything about the new restrictive changes to making calls with Alexa but found nothing.  The Amazon representative I spoke with also knew nothing of these changes, nor did the developer/engineering team contact he reached out to as I waited on hold with him on the phone.  He looked through various internal channels/systems and couldn't find any information about these changes either and so I offered to send him screenshots of what I was seeing in my Alexa App and he thanked me and asked if I would please send them.  I sent them while on the phone and he shared them with the engineering team contact he had been talking with about this while I waited.  A while later he did confirm that he had found some information about these changes (basically just the same details that are given in the new help section about this in the Alexa App) and said he would try to find out more information and if he does learn any additional details he'll share them with me via phone or email in the next day or so. He said while it's not uncommon for Amazon to be absolutely terrible about sharing information about big changes/new features/various updates with their team members before going public with the info he did think it was odd that there was next to nothing announced about this and that I had already learned about these coming changes from the Alexa app and said that might have possibly been by accident and apologized.\n\nI hate this and wanted to share this with other Amazon Echo device/Alexa users.  I mean, I understand that it was a free service and that Amazon is not making any money (aside from revenue from the initial device purchase) by allowing people to place unlimited, free phone calls from their Alexa devices, but it's super frustrating for a core feature like this to be restricted without any advanced warning or announcement, especially at a time when most communication/telecommunication platforms and companies are adding *more* capabilities and features/free extra data/etc. to be helpful while we're all feeling and dealing with the challenges of living through a global pandemic.  Super upsetting Amazon would suddenly add restrictions.  I am fine with being required to link my cellular phone service provider account to my Alexa Communications profile/account if that's necessary to keep being able to effortlessly make outgoing phone calls using my Alexa/Echo devices, but if that's the case than other service providers that just AT&T need to be added.  Maybe AT&T is the entity here who pushed for these new restrictions, who knows...  ughhhh.  \ud83e\udd2c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Text/Details and** [**Screenshots of Details from the Alexa App**](https://i.imgur.com/4I11wev.jpeg)**:**\n\nAlexa-to-Phone Contacts\n\nThese are the phone numbers you can make unlimited mobile and landline calls to.

  "At home, I have a Homekit based system and I have loved being able to use Homebridge running on a Raspberry Pi to add advanced logic and triggers and unsupported devices to my system.\n\nAt my mom's house, she has quite a few Amazon Echos and Alexa-based lights and devices. I would like to be able to add some advanced logic (multiple conditions for triggering a routine) and bridge unsupported devices (Aqara vibration sensor). \n\nAt home, I'd do this with Homebridge, but I'm wondering if there is a preferred alternative in Alexa world.

I now have \"Master Bedroom Ceiling 1\", \"Living Room Side Table 2\", etc. Everything is in a group, so when I say, \"Alexa, lights one hundred-percent\" or \"Alexa, set colour to blue\" she knows what I want.\n\nThere's no confusion with her saying, \"Multiple devices share the name 'so-and-so' lights\" or other situations anymore.\n\nIt's part of making the configuration simpler, and it's made managing my smart home so much easier.

  "I have a bunch of Phillips wifi light bulbs. I never have issues controlling them with WiZ app. I have WiZ skill added to my Alexa.

But it doesn't last longer than a few days.\n\nObviously lights only connect to 2.4 Ghz, my echo shows were connected to 5Ghz. Thinking that was the issue, I connected them to 2.4, but that didn't help.\n\n Because I have no issues controling them with WiZ app, I know it's not a wifi issue. It seems like some miscommunication between Alexa and wiz app. But it doesn't make any sense why it would be only on a few lights and not all.\n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

  "1. Purchase New Echo Studio\n2. Setup in Bedroom\n3. Decide to move to living room\n4. Living room contains two lights and fire TV\n5. Change studio to living room on alexa app (android)\n6.

And it knows what lights are in the living room, but only when not giving the room name.\n\nResetting the studio doesn't seem to be the solution since the echo's in the other rooms also fail to turn the living room lights on/off correctly. Also, getting the \"home theatre\" to work was not straight forward and I didnt want to have to do that again.\n\nThis is actually very disheartening from a troubleshooting standpoint. It means that there are MULTIPLE sources of truth depending on the code path taken. I would have assumed at the very least that this was backed up to the cloud and resynched to the echo's etc.\n\nThe fact that you can be in a constant intermediate state (not just until the next resync) means, 1. the resync can get seriously out of sync and doesn't know how to correct itself or 2.

  "I just bought the Aqara Hub and Hygrometer today, as multiple other hygrometer sensors I bought recently, all suddenly failed to announce the humidity over Alexa out of nowhere. So I thought Aqara is finally gonna fix it.\n\nApparently it is neither. Or I am doing something wrong. I want the little hygrometer in my cigar humidor, so I can check on its humidity from anywhere, any time verbally through my Alexa smart home.\n\nIt WAS working with a Chinese no name sensor I had for about two weeks until last weekend. I could ask Alexa, \"what's Humidor's humidty? / temperature\" and it would reply the value through Alexa. But then suddenly that sensor stopped listening to the commands over Alexa out of nowhere. So I gave it back and tried several others.\n\nBut none of them, albeit advertised on Amazon as \"working with Alexa\", did anything in Alexa. They connected through Smart Life to Alexa, but neither could I trigger e routine with them, insert them as action in a routine or give them ANY verbal command to read out the humidity values like that Chinese sensor before. Some did nothing, some said \"Humidity is not yet supported.\"\n\nAnyway, long story short: Now my last try is with the Aqara system, but sadly it is the same here - the device connected to the new HUB and also showed in the Alexa app. But neither can I use it in any routines nor does it read out the humidity value via Alexa, regardless of what command I try to ask her.\n\nAny ideas?",

I'm getting an HDMI audio splitter so the digital audio out goes straight to the receiver, and that means the Dot won't be able to play through the stereo any longer. Is there any way I can control the Fire TV Stick with the Dot so that all notifications are forwarded and app commands (e.g. for Spotify) automatically go to the Fire Stick rather than being executed on the Dot itself?

But absolutely I do not want to hear \"Did you know your alexa can do X\" type statements, or advertisements for a famous person's voice plugin (ahem), or anything of the like.  At times we've had to unplug her just to get her to stop talking or stop expecting an answer for something she asked that we didn't ask for her to ask!",
  "I have an Echo Plus and a Hue multicolor light bulb, and as it\u2019s advertised, the Echo Plus is supposed to act as a bridge and allow me to connect them/control my lights with Alexa. Well that doesn\u2019t seem to work, and the Hue skill in the Alexa app looks like it keeps wanting me to connect a bridge to enable it. Anyone have any insight?",
  "I see that the latest $70 Echo from Amazon advertises itself as a \u201csmart home hub,\u201d but what does this mean exactly? I currently have an echo dot, which can control the smart plug I have just fine.

  "Community,\n\nIt appears that I am now having issues with getting a first generation echo speaker to stay connected on a mesh network. The primary router/AP (parent node) is a Linksys MR9600 and the secondary (child) router/AP mesh node is an MX5300 (Velop node). This was always advertised as a supported mesh configuration, but it took employing a workaround to get it to work (see [MR9600 and MX5300](https://community.linksys.com/t5/Velop-Whole-Home-Wi-Fi/MR9600-and-MX5300/m-p/1441104#M27724) on Linksys' community forum). My Amazon Echo speaker worked fine for a while, but at some point it got power cycled and would not connect to the wireless network. So, what have I tried to resolve this:\n\n* Attempted to reconnect the speaker to the network -- app tells me that the network information is incorrect, I know it's fine. \n* Switched to a hotspot network on my phone and then back to the house wifi, works on hotspot, but not on house wifi\n* A full device deregistering, factory reset, and reregistering. This didn't work either. \n* Talking the device next to the MR9600 and reconfiguring the network. Works fine. Unplug and take it back to the bedroom near the MX5300 and plug it back in, fails to connect. \n* Other devices connect just fine wirelessly and wired even to the MX5300 node. \n\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions I missing here? My wife has an Echo Spot on her nightstand and this works just fine (though I do remember it not liking the use of combined 2/5 GHz on our older Netgear equipment). Thanks. \n\nMichael",

  "So let me start by saying this is in no way a paid post or advertisement, its 100% made of my own will because this site and the 18 guys who run it are just that absurdly amazing i owe it to them to try and spread the word a bit\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo this website [https://creator.voiceflow.com/](https://creator.voiceflow.com/) is by far the greatest creation known to man in terms of Alexa skill building. It allows anyone, regardless of how much knowledge of code they may or may not have, make comprehensive complex and in depth skills for Alexa.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt achieves this by making a majority of the tedious (to me mind boggling) coding language a thing of the past and puts everything you need into a DIY drag and drop template profile creator (kind of like Amazon's own but EVEN better and more direct)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know absolutely NOTHING about coding (not for a lack of trying mind you) and ive created things such as this [https://creator.voiceflow.com/demo/462855662848467](https://creator.voiceflow.com/demo/462855662848467) which is the Federal News Network from Starship Troopers (Would you like to know more?) \n\n[\\(What it looks like via their simple drag and drop block system\\)](https://preview.redd.it/s5yvjhm921751.png?width=4337&format=png&auto=webp&s=c479d69c10263bdc74c9d445a6823b1078d905fa)\n\nIt's a simple gag skill that plays each of the movies propaganda reels sounds one after another upon replying yes to \"Would you like to know more\", stupidly simple to some, suicidal rage inducing weeks of frustration because i cant code to others (like me) without this site.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow youre probably wondering why im sucking this sites dick so much and its simple, IT DESERVES TO BE SUCKED.

  "I just purchased a new TV from Philips, which is capable of Alexa Integration.

After talking to Philips for a few days, and almost begging them to make the skill available in Romania (where I'm currently located), I couldn't find any common grounds with them.

  "My Echo just started playing a Dairy Queen ad out of nowhere. I wasn't even listening to anything. When I asked what was playing it just said \"An advertisement for Dairy Queen\". I waited to see if it would start playing music, like maybe it thought I asked it to play a radio station? But no, it just played another ad so I asked it to stop. I checked the activity history and there was no record of any requests before me asking about the ad. Is this normal?",
  "This shouldn't be this hard to find! Looking for a waterproof outdoor speaker that works like an echo.

  "I was excited to get the Studio and link it to my Fire TV cube for better sound.  However, after several months I still have daily issues.   Does anybody else have these problems?\n\nNote: a few weeks ago i did a reset on the Studio and did not re-link it to Fire TV for a few weeks.   During this time all of my issues went away, and they all returned after I linked them again.\n\n\\- Randomly, when I put on a TV program through an app, (today it was Netflix, but also Hulu, IMDBtv, etc), the TV program will play in sort of a jumpy fast forward mode -- the image only, the sound will be mostly okay, but of course, the sound is completely off from the video.   Rarely, I can just pause and play again and it will work okay.   Otherwise, I just give up and watch a different program - even a different program on the same app, and it plays fine.   Then in a day or so I'll go back to the program that would not play correctly and watch it and it's fine.\n\n\\- Apps like IMDBtv that have advertisements - the audio for the advertisement will play but the video of the TV program keeps going.  So when the ad audio finishes, i have to pause, then the audio keeps playing for a while while the video is paused.   When the audio catches up and finally pauses, then I press play and the TV program audio and video are matched up again.    Then the next commercial comes on and I go through the whole pause/wait/restart again.   On IMDB this happens 100% of the time.\n\nThese seem like some pretty serious bugs that Amazon should have fixed by now.",
  "Truth is advertising here, it\u2019s actually my wife\u2019s phone.\n\nThe situation is as follows:\n\nWe have three Alexa devices in the house,  a fire stick, an Echo Dot, and an Echo Show.\n\nBoth my wife and I have iPhone 11s with the Alexa app.\n\nMy child (like many of yours) has been stuck in the house, with school canceled, while my wife is working from home (I still drive 40 minutes to work each way, joy)\n\nMy kiddo and her cousin have been using the Echo Shows (one in each house) every day for hours at a time.\n\nHere is where the problem comes in.

Other times, the call will be listed as an Audio call and even when the kiddo answers the Echo show, the Alexa App on my wife\u2019s phone will not shut up, she has to physically acknowledge it, which can be a problem if it is out of reach and she is on a work video conference.  This same thing is happening on the other end, so my Sister in Laws phone is doing the same thing while she is working from home.\n\nPlease help.  It is greatly appreciated!",
  "Echo devices and Alexa are honestly still trash. While they like to advertise the newest and smartest features, it's still working so bad for basic things like telling the time or controlling music playback.\n\nThe level of QA they have is frankly embarassing.\n\nAt least when the speech recognition works, which is a big if, I expect somewhat reliable execution of the basic features. As it is, it's always a much better bet to grab your phone than trying to have Alexa do it. \n\nWhen I was working today I wanted to switch to the next song on Spotify. \n\nMy FireTV cube is linked to my Echo dot, otherwise it's deaf as soon as music plays. \n\nProblem 1: for Spotify, the linked Echo Dot just says \"This device doesn't support that\" whenever it picks up your voice over the FireTV. \n\nOnce you manage to have the FireTV pick it up instead, it just said \"what do you want to play?\". The next song, like I said, duh. It just repeats \"what do you want to play\". Goddamnit. \n\nTurns out it doesn't work it you open the Spotify app on the FireTV or presumably via your phone on the FireTV. Playback control only works when Spotify was opened via Alexa too. \n\nAnd that's the sad state of the most popular music service they heavily advertise. Just imagine how buggy less known or more complex things are. \n\nInstead of trying to implement a bunch of barely working new things, they should spend more time on cross-device functionality and some serious QA on the most important functionality. \n\nI don't understand how people can even recommend or rate this crap highly in it's current state, years after the initial release, when the most basic functionality is still not anywhere as reliable as they would like you to believe. \n\n/rant",

  "Ever since I've got my Amazon Echo, I've been searching for the ultimate set of Flash Briefing skills.  Seasoned Alexa-users are probably aware of some of the best briefings \u2014 NPR, BBC, and Fox News \u2014 and they've probably found a bunch of garbage Flash Briefings; most Flash Briefings are garbage.  However, among the swamp of crappy Flash Briefings, I've found a few staples and a few hidden gems.\n\nFor those who are just starting with Alexa and those long-time Alexa users looking for a hidden gem, here's a quick summary:\n\n**The Staples** - For those who are new to Amazon Echo and Alexa\n\n1. [NPR Hourly News](https://www.amazon.com/NPR-Hourly-News-Summary/dp/B01K07MU64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) \u2014 Well-produced news with a US focus\n\n2. \n[BBC](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-BBC/dp/B01JHLI06S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487536887&sr=1-1&keywords=bbc) \u2014 Smart reporting on world news\n\n3. [Fox News](https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-Channel/dp/B01M5EIW2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) \u2014 Great production value, great news, but suffers from an annoyin ad in the middle.\n\n**The Hidden Gems** \u2014 The best Flash Briefings off the beaten path\n\n1. [Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day) \u2014 A sardonic host explains new words and gives highly entertaining ways of using them in a sentence; great production value, hilarious, and you'll learn some new words. Do yourself a favor and enable Word of the Day.\n\n2. [90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate) \u2014 Refershing Flash Breifing about the news; the host delivers a very short news summary with panache.  You definitely can't sleep through this news report.\n\n3. [Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up) \u2014 A short Flash Briefing that tells the story of startups; it's consistently solid, and, occassionally, it will give you a story you'll think about for the rest of the day.\n\n\nFor those of you who are on the lookout for more specific Flash Briefings, I've compiled all my reviews of Flash Briefings by topic below.  I generally put better Flash Briefings at the top of each category and the worse ones toward the bottom but there are a few places where I don't quite know how to order the Briefings, so don't take the ordering too seriously.  You'll likely notice a theme: The best Flash Briefings have a human host, do not run too long or too short, and do not have ads.  I also tend to prefer Flash Briefings that have a bit of personality \u2014 dry deliveries put me to sleep.\n\n***THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO FLASH BRIEFINGS***\n\n**General News**\n\n[NPR Hourly News](https://www.amazon.com/NPR-Hourly-News-Summary/dp/B01K07MU64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is one of the most consistently well produced Flash Briefings.  Clocking in at 5 minutes, the news summary is just long enough to be substantial and comprehensive, but not so long as to be annoying.  The mix between headline news and summaries is just right, and NPR has left the advertising out of the briefing.\n\n[BBC](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-BBC/dp/B01JHLI06S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487536887&sr=1-1&keywords=bbc)\n\nJust like NPR and Fox News, this Flash Briefing stands out as one of the most well produced.  However, what really sets the BBC apart from the other two is that the BBC covers different stories \u2014 often less US-centric stories.  If you have multiple US news Flash Briefings, the BBC can be very refreshing and introduce you to some news stories you haven't yet heard about.  I'd highly recommend it.\n\n[Fox News](https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-Channel/dp/B01M5EIW2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is among the better news Flash Briefing skills.  You'll get a full view of US news from a human presenter.  The biggest problem is long, annoying ads they run.  BBC and NPR don't run ads and have similar content.  The other problem is the volume: it's all over the place.  The main host is significantly louder than the correspondents who speak with him.  That being said, it's only mildly distracting, especially compared to the ad.  In total, if you are trying to figure out which news Flash Briefings to use, give Fox News a shot.\n\n[90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate)\n\nA real human, Mike Pasca, reads 2 or 3 news stories with panache.  I really love how the presenter reads the stories; sometimes he'll say something like \"We've got two stories for you today \u2014 one that matters and one that does not.\"  You definitely won't sleep through this Flash Briefing.  There is an ad at the end, but it's the least annoying ad I've seen in a Flash Briefing so far.  Overall, I'd say give this Flash Briefing a try and see if it's for you.\n\n[theSkimm](https://www.amazon.com/theSkimm-Inc/dp/B01JM6TN8M/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537954&sr=1-1&keywords=theSkimm)\n\nFor those who don't know, theSkimm is a daily email that sends you a short news briefing.  This Flash Briefing just has Alexa read that email.  It's better than most Flash Briefings where Alexa reads the news, but it still is far from the best Flash Briefing.  I'd recommend passing on this as NPR and BBC are much better.\n\n[Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Quartz/dp/B01M278ZFA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538052&sr=1-1&keywords=quartz)\n\nAlexa reads the news.  The writing is actually pretty good, but without a human reading the news, it's not worth it.  There are tons of competitor that were a human host reads the news.\n \n[Refinery29: 8 Things You Need to Know This AM](https://www.amazon.com/Refinery29-Things-Need-Know-This/dp/B01JHR7TK0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537988&sr=1-1&keywords=refinery29)\n\nAlexa reads Refinery29 headlines.  It covers a wide swath of topics, from Health to LGBTQ News.  Refinery29 does not cover any of these stories in more than a sentence, so the Flash Briefing is short and uninformative.  My suggestion is that you should leave Refinery29 out of your morning routine.\n\n[BuzzFeed News](https://www.amazon.com/BuzzFeed-News/dp/B01MQR7Y5D/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538110&sr=1-1&keywords=buzzfeed)\n\nAlexa reads BuzzFeed headlines.  This is possibly the worst Flash Briefing made by a large company that I've seen.  Isn't BuzzFeed supposed to be better than the average media company at creating content for digital platforms?\n\n**Business News**\n\n[CNBC Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/NBCUniversal-CNBC-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01N7FH24X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is the best business news Flash Briefing.  A real human reads the business news headlines with a short explanation.  Every day it covers interesting sales numbers, mergers, and trends.  The length of the Flash Briefing is about right.  I'd highly recommend adding this to your Flash Briefing.\n\n[Motley Fool Stock Watch](https://www.amazon.com/The-Motley-Fool-Stock-Watch/dp/B01KG5YXS8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538317&sr=1-1&keywords=motley+fool)\n\nThis is a very short interview with a stock expert on a recent topic.  I find it informative and very digestible \u2014 a good way to learn interesting tidbits about what's going on in different sectors of the economy and the stock market.\n\n[Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is just a short business story read by a human.  This generally isn't a headline story, so the stories are somewhat refreshing, and the delivery is pretty good. There are not that many good options for business news in the Amazon Skill store, so if you are in need of more business news, give Level Up a try.\n\n[Econoday U.S. Economic Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-U-S-Economic-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01MEBW3T0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538474&sr=1-1&keywords=econoday)\n\nEconomic news read by Alexa.  It's too long, but it isn't one of those Flash Briefings that never end.  If you absolutely must have news about the Fed and stock market in your Flash Briefing, Econoday is for you.  However, it's not very good, so I'd say pass.\n\n[Econoday Global Market Update](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-Global-Market-Update/dp/B01MDPRG23/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538529&sr=1-2&keywords=econoday)\n\nAlexa reads how the stock, money, and commodity markets changed since the last day and reports basic news.  I would not recommend this Flash Briefing to anyone who doesn't have a job in finance (and I wouldn't even recommend it to most financial professionals).\n\n[The Economist](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-The-Economist/dp/B01JHLMNWU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538580&sr=1-1&keywords=economist)\n\nDon't bother including this in your Flash Briefing.  This is just an entire Economist podcast, and it's not even a good podcast.\n\n**Tech News**\n\n[Daily Tech Headlines](https://www.amazon.com/DiamondClub-TV-Daily-Tech-Headlines/dp/B01M1B3K5U/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538726&sr=1-1&keywords=Daily+Tech+Headlines)\n\nThis is the best tech news Flash Briefing.  It covers a wide expanse of tech news in just the right amount of detail.  The host is human, concise, and clear.  The only issue with this Flash Briefing is there are too many stories in each Flash Briefing, especially if you're not a tech professional.  I'd like to see the makers of this Flash Briefing really cut down the length of their shows.  That being said, this is the best tech Flash Briefing I've found, so give it a try.\n\n[TechCruch](https://www.amazon.com/AOL-Inc-TechCrunch/dp/B01L6HQHGQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538760&sr=1-1&keywords=techcrunch)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is weird.  A bro reads tech news and talks about what a \"badass\" Elon Musk is (that's a real quote).  This bro-host tells a bunch of jokes that aren't all that funny but feel like a stereotype of jokes a Silicon Valley bro would tell.  This might be your type of humor, but it's certainly not mine.  I'd lightly recommend passing on it, but if off-beat, that's-so-random humor is your thing then give it a try.  However, most people seem to hate it.\n\n**Sports News**\n\n[CBS Sports Minute](https://www.amazon.com/CBS-Local-Sports-Minute/dp/B01M9FIFIK/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-3&keywords=sports)\n\nThis is best sports Flash Briefing I've found, but that's not saying much.  It covers one sports related story a day, and it doesn't report scores.  The host is very energetic, and the stories are interesting.  However, you probably won't get a full update on sports scores if that's what you're interested in.\n\n[ESPN SportsCenter Update](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-ESPN-Radio-via/dp/B01JHLKHQ4/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-2&keywords=sports)\n\nThis app has a terribly boring music intro that lasts 30 seconds.  Some reviewers have complained about the volume, but I haven't noticed an issue recently.  The news itself is pretty good; what you'd expect from SportsCenter.  There is an advertisement at the end that drags out.  It lasts about 3 minutes.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n[Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day)\n\nThis is my favorite \"hidden gem\" Flash Briefing.  Every day, the human host sardonically explains a word of the day and gives examples of how to use the word.  It's funny, smart, and a little irreverent.  The production quality is top notch, the length of the briefing is just right, and the entertaining examples of how to use the words make it pretty hard to forget the word.  The Flash Briefing is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\n[Discovery: DNews](https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Communications-DNews/dp/B01JHK5V6G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539512&sr=1-1&keywords=dnews)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has science news.  It's one moderately in-depth story a day, often about refreshing topics not covered by other news sites.  The audio is repurposed from YouTube videos, but you probably won't notice because the audio doesn't rely on the visuals.  I'd give it a try.\n\n[Complex News](https://www.amazon.com/Complex-News/dp/B01MXXXRLW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538966&sr=1-1&keywords=complex)\n\nThis is the best Flash Briefing for celebrity gossip. It covers just one story a day, but Complex does it in style. It's very punchy and energetic.  My guess is that it's repurposed video content, but I quite like it, and I am not one who typically enjoys celebrity news.  The entire briefing lasts about 2 minutes.\n\n[Top Reddit Posts Unofficial](https://www.amazon.com/Josh-Jones-Reddit-Posts-Unofficial/dp/B01MTWUMY6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539027&sr=1-1&keywords=top+reddit+post)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has Alexa read the top recent 5 Reddit posts.  More specifically, Alexa reads the title of the Reddit post and then 1 comment.  Normally, Flash Briefings that have Alexa read the news are terrible.  This one is a mild exception.  It's good, but it's certainly not great.\n\n[Harvard Business Review: Management Tip](https://www.amazon.com/Harvard-Business-Review-Management-Tip/dp/B01LQM9N8A/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539233&sr=1-1&keywords=harvard)\n\nI don't think that a Flash Briefing is the right place for a management tip.  I find that these tips are incredibly forgettable \u2014 these tips are ideas like \"reconsider how you measuring data.\"  That's not a particularly useful tip, and I can never remember the minutia of how HBR suggests implementing the tip.  However, I know some people love this type of management advice, so if this sounds like the Flash Briefing for you, it probably is.\n\n[eHow](https://www.amazon.com/Demand-Media-eHow/dp/B01M29BSFG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539070&sr=1-1&keywords=ehow)\n\nIf you want an update on what eHow has been publishing recently, then I have the Flash Briefing for you.  You'll learn some interesting and pointless things from this Flash Briefing, like the amount of calcium in chia seeds and your dog's separation anxiety.  I wouldn't add it to your Flash Briefing, unless you want to know useless trivia or what eHow's been publishing.\n\n[Pulse of the Planet](https://www.amazon.com/Pulse-of-the-Planet/dp/B01K0JWGSY/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539103&sr=1-1&keywords=pulse+of+the+planet)\n\nThis is a weird mix of nature sounds and general interest stories.  I'm not sure who this would appeal to, but it's certainly unique.  It's not too long, so it might make sense to try it out if general interest stories are your MO.\n\nTL;DR: Try [Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day), [90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate), and [Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up)",

  "Hello, wondering if anyone else has had this issue\n\nI had an echo auto connected to my car a few years back. I know sometime in 2021 I viewed my voice recording history, it included some stuff from my fire sticks but I am certain I had recordings from my echo auto. \n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I used it, it\u2019s \u201coffline\u201d but i still have it. It was still listed as an \u201caccessory\u201d in my Alexa app. But I checked for these recordings and they\u2019re missing. Completely gone. My settings have always been \u201cnever delete\u201d \n\nI had recordings from my late SO on there, never saved them to my phone though (I know I\u2019m an idiot). His family member got a tattoo of something funny he said into Alexa and now I can\u2019t find the recording that goes with it. \n\nI chatted with Amazon and they told me to delete and reinstall the app. Now the Echo auto isn\u2019t even listed in my app. However the rep said he could still see it as a device on my account. They are escalating to an internal team and I\u2019m supposed to hear back, but not hopeful. He said if they\u2019re available they can be pulled from the cloud, but they agreed it was strange I wasn\u2019t seeing them anymore. \n\n\nAny ideas?

  "I just bought the Aqara Hub and Hygrometer today, as multiple other hygrometer sensors I bought recently, all suddenly failed to announce the humidity over Alexa out of nowhere. So I thought Aqara is finally gonna fix it.\n\nApparently it is neither. Or I am doing something wrong. I want the little hygrometer in my cigar humidor, so I can check on its humidity from anywhere, any time verbally through my Alexa smart home.\n\nIt WAS working with a Chinese no name sensor I had for about two weeks until last weekend. I could ask Alexa, \"what's Humidor's humidty? / temperature\" and it would reply the value through Alexa. But then suddenly that sensor stopped listening to the commands over Alexa out of nowhere. So I gave it back and tried several others.\n\nBut none of them, albeit advertised on Amazon as \"working with Alexa\", did anything in Alexa. They connected through Smart Life to Alexa, but neither could I trigger e routine with them, insert them as action in a routine or give them ANY verbal command to read out the humidity values like that Chinese sensor before. Some did nothing, some said \"Humidity is not yet supported.\"\n\nAnyway, long story short: Now my last try is with the Aqara system, but sadly it is the same here - the device connected to the new HUB and also showed in the Alexa app. But neither can I use it in any routines nor does it read out the humidity value via Alexa, regardless of what command I try to ask her.\n\nAny ideas?",

  "I have echo auto connected to car Bluetooth and use it all for music/podcasts and phone calls. I have Spotify and podcasts, prime music etc. linked to my account. \nWhen I get into my car it constantly plays the podcast I listen to but I don\u2019t want it to. I\u2019ve closed the app. Logged out. Reset my phone and soft reset echo auto. Nothing works. \n\nAnother side issue is often times I tell her to play something on Spotify and she says \u201cto do that, you need to open the Spotify app then try again\u201d. This is another big that needs to be patched. I follow those instructions the same way, to no avail. It plays Spotify only if I just set it as primary service and don\u2019t use the word \u201cSpotify\u201d. So weird and annoying. She does it in the house too! She\u2019s gotten dumber! \nMake this right DEVS!",

  "Hello all \nI am at my wits end. I am 30 and trying to set up alexa for my blind mom to control her television. She recently went blind and has a hard time adjusting and it needs to be fool proof.

  "Basically what the title says, I just picked up an echo dot so I didn't have to play the \"where's the remote\" game in my living room.  Living room TV is an insignia fire tv, with the wife's Amazon account linked to it.  Tried to make the echo connect with the TV, with no success.  It gives me the options to connect with the TV in my son's room and my fire stick I haven't had plugged in in years, but not the living room TV.\n\nSo, what is the most expedient way for me to control the living room TV with the echo dot?\n\nAlso, would greatly prefer not to merge hers and my Amazon accounts, for various non nefarious reasons.\n\nThanks!",
  "First, I am quite new to the Alexa app and automation in general. So forgive me if this is a basic question, but I can't find an answer to this exact situation.\n\nI have:\n\n* a four-head mini split A/C+heat system (Senville brand)\n* the Alexa Android app\n* NO Alexa device (e.g. Echo)\n* NO \\[separate\\] smart thermostat(s)\n\nThe mini split system has plug-in dongles that are Alexa capable. I got them all plugged into all four head units and connected to wifi, and the Alexa app on my phone recognizes them.\n\nWith the Alexa app itself, I can go into each of the four devices, turn it off/on, set the temperature, set the mode, and set the fan level. Basic but perfectly functional for what I need.\n\nI have also created routines so that each unit can turn on and off at predetermined times. Great!\n\nBut while I can adjust the temperature in the Alexa app on the phone, there is no option that I see when creating a **routine** to change the temperature. It's simply a binary on/off.\n\nNow, I won't invest in smart thermostats. It's not worth it to me, since I have most of what i need already. But am I missing something? Is there a way to get an app or enable some function or skill that will allow me to set the temperature on each unit **in a routine**, in addition to turning it on/off?\n\nThe basic idea is that, in winter for example, I want to turn down the bedroom but keep it at some minimum temperature (say 60F) all day until bedtime. I don't necessarily want to turn it off entirely.\n\nThanks for your help.",
  "I recently moved in with a friend, her house is already set up with alexa and I brought mine. I have attempted to connect my system to hers so I can control the lights without going into her bedroom but I have no clue what I'm doing. She is older and had someone else set up her system so I have to figure it out on my own. I basically just want to be able to access the lights, the ring camera and maybe drop in if I don't want to leave my room to ask her something. I was going to add my lights and smart plugs as I set up my bedroom and maybe add another echo in the communal area. How can I do this without having to completely add all of my devices to her account? Right now the living situation is temporary and I don't want to have my stuff just become a part of her household, especially if things don't work out. I want us to have our separate routines and stuff.\n\nI'm okay with tech but smart home stuff is a little advanced for me and need my hand held lol.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",
  "I'm nearing my wits end, especially with how integral our Alexa system has become with our home automation and daily lives.    It just seems like it's all falling apart.\n\nIn the last 2 weeks:\n\n\\- Random units drop offline for no apparent reason, complaining about loss of connectivity.    There is NO connectivity issues with any other devices in the house and I have a high end prosumer level router with gigabit synchronous fibre.   Connectivity isn't an issue.   Even if I reboot the router and related Alexa units they often fall offline again sometimes only *minutes* later.   This is 100% an Alexa issue, not a connectivity issue.\n\n\\- They've gone deaf or insane.      The Alexa show in my kitchen doesn't hear me half the time even when I'm talking directly at it, but another Dot unit at the far opposite end of the same level of the house will respond instead for some inexplicable reason.\n\n\\- They don't act as they should be.   I stood literally in front of one of my units a few days ago saying \"Alexa, stop\" trying to get music to stop and it just wholesale ignored me despite recognizing the command.   The only way to get it to stop playing music was to physically unplug it.\n\n\\- Announcements from IOT devices are just going AWOL.   We have a washing machine that used to announce on Alexa when it was completed.   My wife particularly enjoyed this feature.   Now it's just....gone.    Sometimes it works, about 80% of the time it doesn't.     \n\n\n\\- Just plain old misinterpretation of what we're saying.   Even standing next to a unit directly it seems like their ability to interpret something as simple as \"Alexa, put eggs on the shopping list\" is going downhill.  \n\nAm I alone here or does it seem like the entire infrastructure is burning down around us?     Is it time to sell it all and move to that other option that I won't name?",

  "Yesterday I had to call emergency services because my son was choking. I used my echo show to call as he was right in front of it, and I didn\u2019t want to search for my phone. This detail is important. I have daily routines set up for my kids to tell them to clean up their things and then another 30 minutes later to go brush their teeth and get ready for bed. While on the line with 911 a freaking reminder kicks off and interrupted the call. So was trying to do the heimlich and hear what the operator is saying while Alexa is telling my kids it\u2019s bedtime. Seconds matter in these scenarios. Thankfully we were finally able to clear his airway, but it wasn\u2019t looking great for a minute. \n\nI started a chat with Amazon customer service to see if something can be done or if my device was faulty. He said to add 911 as an emergency contact and that shouldn\u2019t happen. When I asked for help with that it turned out it couldn\u2019t be done. He said he would submit it as feedback and I could continuously check the Amazon website to see if this has been fixed. I would not receive notification that my issue had been resolved. So I called customer service instead. \n\nThe next guy I spoke with gave me a few more options. He said I could simply disable all of my routines. Boom. Problem solved. Well, I kind of like that feature. I mean that really eliminates some of the basic features. Then he suggested I go look for my phone and call 911 from that next time. He said to be sure I\u2019m always from the device or turn it down. That way my call won\u2019t get interrupted. *Really??* He was literally inches from the device. It was the closest thing capable of calling emergency services. Don\u2019t worry. I was also offered the solution of not calling 911 or to have the emergency outside of my scheduled routines. Not helpful either. It gets better. Finally, he argued with me that my device couldn\u2019t even call 911. It\u2019s not a feature that you can use. He said it couldn\u2019t connect to government numbers. I explained that I just did, and it was in fact the second time I had done so. It was actually a feature that I really appreciated given the fact I\u2019ve had to call 911 three times in the past few months. He had control of my device and I showed him the voice history proving myself right. He hung up on me.\n\nSo here we are. Is this something that is specific to my device? Has anyone else had this problem? How do I get this fixed *and* receive notification that it has been fixed? Thanks!",

  "My understanding is that I can connect a media device to an Echo Link and the Echo Link can then forward music played on that device to an Echo audio group.\n\n1. If that's right, then can I change which Echo audio group is selected via a verbal command (e.g. if currently connected to the kitchen group, then \"Alexa, connect Echo Link to the living room group\")\n\n2. Is there any way to create Alexa routines that only activate under the condition that audio is being played from the Echo Link? For example, making \"Alexa, stop\" trigger an automation that activates an IR blaster, but only if the Echo Link is active. Otherwise, it does what it normally does. This is just a \"nice to have\", as obviously I could have it be \"Alexa, stop CD player\" instead.",

  "I'm looking for a way to use a CD player (probably with Bluetooth), and not only have it play the audio through the echo of my choice upon command but also control the CD player's basic functions.\n\nOne thought of mine is that if I can find a CD player with an IR remote, I can use an IR blaster connected to Alexa to send the signals to control the CD player. With Bluetooth, I can also easily have it connected to a single device, but I'm not sure how to go about having it play on the echo device/group of my choice upon command.\n\nAny suggestions? Maybe some sort of device that the CD player can connect to, which then is itself directly controllable by Alexa such that this device is an intermediary for the music? I think the Echo Link can do this, but it's severely overpriced.",
  "Hello I was wondering if there was a way to automate cycling of some colors with the Alexa routine for the Sengled color lights.

For reference these are the Sengled Bluetooth bulbs connected directly to the echo. \n\nThanks",
  "Yesterday we started having multiple issues with our Amazon Echo. It's a 1st generation Echo, had it since 2015.  We've never had an issue with it prior.  In the middle of playing an album, it just stopped.  It couldn't connect to WiFi, and I couldnt get it to connect through set up or manual set up, so I had to reset it and set it up again.  I was finally able to get connected to WiFi, but there's still issues. \n\nWhen I tell it to play an album, after a significant amount of time, it says \"I'm having issues connecting to your library\" but they will start playing right after her response.  While it plays albums, it skips randomly songs.  After a bit, it'll just stop playing altogether.  It doesn't pause or stop when given the command. It also is taking a longer time to process  commands. It's also have issues from Amazon Music app.  If I open the app, play an album and have it broadcast to my Echo, it will eventually turn off after some time. \n\nIs anyone else having these issues?",

But the BT speaker does. Is there a way for both to play at the same time? The Echo is in the kitchen and the speaker is in the livingroom, which I'm kind of surprised the BT signal reached that far...\n\nOr, should I simply buy an Echo Dot (black Friday pricing) connect it via AUX to the speaker, and group the kitchen Echo and the livingroom Echo Dot together? The Echo Dot's give off enough sound, I probably don't need the BT speaker.... Was just trying to use what I have, before buying another device....",

  "As the title says, I need some input / ideas about how to possibly implement the two following ideas I have been wanting to implement in my smart home system for a while.\n\n*Beforehand, for clarification why the things I want are complex to achieve: I don't live in a house, I live on the 2nd floor of an apartment building as a tenant. So I can not put anything in public areas (e.g. hallway) or change anything outside my apartment (e.g. drill holes, exchange my doorbell system, etc.).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first thing - and I've tried that multiple times - is the idea of some sort of sensor inside my mailbox downstairs, so alexa can trigger a routine whenever the mailman enters the house and opens my specific mailbox, so I am notified when I have mail. I have bought and tested multiple motion sensors from amazon but they all didn't work - until I figured out why: They ALL seem to connect via bluetooth only, not wifi, and the signal was just too far away from downstairs up into my apartment. Wifi should work as I even get a weak signal from my alexa socket connected to my washing machine in the basement.  \nAny other ideas on how I could set up a notification once my mailbox is opened?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second thing is similar: Since I can't use a ring system as I can not change anything on my apartment, I'm seeking for alternative ways to control the front door and/or my manual apartment door, as well as speak to people at the front door from anywhere in my apartment.  \nRight now I have a semi-automatic system set up for the front door through the switchbot switch toggle thingy. It is taped on my apartment doorbell speakerphone system on the door opener button. Whenever my doorbell rings and I say \"Alexa open the door\", Alexa turns on my apartment hallway light and presses that knob, at least opening the front door.\n\nOkay. Fine. However: Ideally I would much rather also have SOME way of communicating through the doorbell speakerphone or any other way with the person outside. Then I could, for instance, have an alexa routine (e.g. \"Alexa, a delivery is here\") to open the front door and say to the amazon guy \"Please drop the package by the apartment door in the 2nd floor\".  \nAny ideas how I could pull something like that off without renovating half the building by installing custom doorbell sets? :-D",

  "This has been happening now for a couple of months. I should note I have had these devices for about 4 years. Same thing with the router.

I find this is odd. If I have wifi working for my laptop and phone why are these devices losing connection? I have to unplug and re-plug in the router.

Sometimes, it turns off all the lights at once like it is supposed to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say, this is highly frustrating. I wonder what could cause this?

  "Hello,\n\nSo I have 4 Alexa's at my house and I was going to get a couple for my older parents just up the road from me.  Should I add those to my account to manage or create a new Amazon account for them?  I was even going to setup their wifi with the same network and password to make it really easy.  They have no wifi or computers at all, so getting internet next weekend.\n\nMy main concern is if they are up there playing music or whatever they want to do, will that interfere with my own Alexas?

  "I don't want to share my phone's location data 24/7 to Amazon in order to turn on the lights. Here are the alternative triggers I've tried:\n\n1. Using IFTTT: turn on lights when my android phone connects to a specific WiFi name (my home WiFi) \n\n   Issue: IFTTT requires permission to access my accurate location 24/7 for this applet to work.\n\n2. Using a spare Android phone (always fixed at home) as an IP security camera to detect motion. Using IFTTT to trigger Alexa to turn on the lights when a motion is detected.\n\n    Issue: works, but there is too much lag between me entering my room and the lights turning on: close to 40-75 seconds delay. It would take me much less time to just use a physical switch to turn it on (4 seconds).\n\n3. Buying a WiFi based door sensor.\n\n    Issue: Same issue as above. It works better than motion detection but there is still too much latency, close to 20 seconds. I would much rather turn the lights on using my hand (4 seconds)\n\n\nPerhaps Zigbee may be faster but that's not option right now because all my other smart home devices are based on non-hub / direct WiFi.\n\nAny other ideas?",

  "As the title says, I need some input / ideas about how to possibly implement the two following ideas I have been wanting to implement in my smart home system for a while.\n\n*Beforehand, for clarification why the things I want are complex to achieve: I don't live in a house, I live on the 2nd floor of an apartment building as a tenant. So I can not put anything in public areas (e.g. hallway) or change anything outside my apartment (e.g. drill holes, exchange my doorbell system, etc.).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first thing - and I've tried that multiple times - is the idea of some sort of sensor inside my mailbox downstairs, so alexa can trigger a routine whenever the mailman enters the house and opens my specific mailbox, so I am notified when I have mail. I have bought and tested multiple motion sensors from amazon but they all didn't work - until I figured out why: They ALL seem to connect via bluetooth only, not wifi, and the signal was just too far away from downstairs up into my apartment. Wifi should work as I even get a weak signal from my alexa socket connected to my washing machine in the basement.  \nAny other ideas on how I could set up a notification once my mailbox is opened?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second thing is similar: Since I can't use a ring system as I can not change anything on my apartment, I'm seeking for alternative ways to control the front door and/or my manual apartment door, as well as speak to people at the front door from anywhere in my apartment.  \nRight now I have a semi-automatic system set up for the front door through the switchbot switch toggle thingy. It is taped on my apartment doorbell speakerphone system on the door opener button. Whenever my doorbell rings and I say \"Alexa open the door\", Alexa turns on my apartment hallway light and presses that knob, at least opening the front door.\n\nOkay. Fine. However: Ideally I would much rather also have SOME way of communicating through the doorbell speakerphone or any other way with the person outside. Then I could, for instance, have an alexa routine (e.g. \"Alexa, a delivery is here\") to open the front door and say to the amazon guy \"Please drop the package by the apartment door in the 2nd floor\".  \nAny ideas how I could pull something like that off without renovating half the building by installing custom doorbell sets? :-D",

  "Hi all,\n\nI'm new to posting here, and usually I try to find answers first before posting my own questions.\n\nWith this said, I was reading some posts about Alexa and Wiz light problems.  I have  the unresponsive status for my Wiz lights in my Alexa app, however, my situation seems to be different from those I read.  In my case, I observe the following behavior:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. In Alexa app, the lights say unresponsive, and the status is never updated to reflect the device.\n2. The lights function normally with spoken commands to Alex, or in Alexa routines ( so this problem seems to be isolated to control from the Alexa app itself..) not a big deal, if they work in routines, and by voice, but would still like to solve the problem, if possible.\n3. The lights are also linked to Google Home, and work both in that app, and by voice.\n4. The lights work, and reflect the correct status (without problems) in the Wiz app.  Everything is up to date, I just moved to Wiz from Geeni based lights the beginning of this month, as Geeeni was giving me worse problems where the lights would randomly stop working in routines, or by voice which is more critical as I mainly just use the Alexa app to manage routines. (once devices are set up.)\n\nI am using an iPhone 12 Pro Max, running iOS 15.6, also Alexa app got an update yesterday, didn't check yesterday to see if this problem existed in the previous version.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRouter in use is an: Asus RT-AX86U, latest firmware\n\nI've disabled UPNP, WiFi 6, for (2.4Ghz)\n\nEnabled IGMP Snooping for both bands, enabled multicast routing.  These are the main settings changed from the defaults.  Also to note, I did a hard reset after updating to the latest firmware to make sure I was starting with a clean slate.\n\nThe remaining Geeni lights in use, show up in the Alexa app with the correct status.  I'm thinking, if it's not a specific glitch with alexa, maybe the router is blocking something from communicating to the app.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any feedback, I would appreciate it.  The posts I read here on this similar topic were from about 2 months ago, and it sounded like that user had no control with Alexa at all.

  "So, I have a Netgear R7000 router. This router needs to be rebooted weekly. I don't know why. COuld be the sheer number of devices connected to it, but anyway...\n\nThe router does not have an option in its firmware to automatically reboot on a schedule or anything. But I discovered that Netgear has a skill for Alexa, and one of the commands is \"Alexa, ask NETGEAR to reboot my router.\"\n\nSeems like just what I need, so I configure a routine to reboot my router 2 times a week at 4:00AM when no one's awake. Last night was the first run of it, and I check it this morning.\n\nApparently, though, after running that command (which admittedly I should have done first), Alexa responds with \"Rebooting your router disrupts the internet connection and disconnects all wifi devices, including Alexa. Do you want to proceed?\" and she then waits for an answer. No answer, no reboot.\n\nSo, is there a way to set it to do this command without an answer?",

  "Hello all, through some vigorous troubleshooting and isolation, I have determined that neither Google nor Alexa's ecosystems  - and specifically speaker groups - behave well in network environments where multiple APs produce multiple identically named wifi channels.  \nThis could mean you have a Mesh system (AI Mesh from Asus, Google Mesh) or simply a multiple AP network with identically named APs but not technically Mesh (both behave similarly badly.  \n\n\nPut simply: Google has sporadic cutting out, desyncing, and other issues, Alexa/Echo seems to lose speakers from groups or also stop playing on groups/play on random members, when this is the network setup.  \n\n\nIf you are experiencing speaker group issues, I recommend naming your AP's 5Ghz band (only connect these devices to 5Ghz. never 2.4Ghz) separately   \ni.e: Johnson Home 5Ghz, Johnson Backyard 5Ghz, Johnson Upstairs 5Ghz  \n\n\nInstead of having all three with the same name, which means devices should roam between them or be actively roamed by the system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have found regardless of the cleanest and most manually configured Mesh/same name multi AP network, these speakers do not function properly in this type of environment.  \n\n\nSpecifically naming my access point's signals separately and connecting the Echo devices to their logical closest AP manually has completely fixed any and every speaker group issue I ever had.\n\nPerformance is perfect, there are no playback glitches or lost members, and because these speakers are stationary anyway, setting them up to their specific AP is a once step process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are experiencing issues please consider this solution,  \n\n\nI personally still use 3 identically named 2.4Ghz APs for my 'dumber' components (smart lights, washing machine etc) and use my 5Ghz Aps, now specifically named, for Echo devices and iPads, Laptops etc.",

I have reset the echos, tried different WiFi APs, bought new echos, used the Alexa app on android and IOS, tried the web interface.\n\nThis is 100% not an issue with hardware or networking at my end.

  "Hey Everyone!\n\nI've got a series of wifi enabled / smart devices like lights/switches... etc that I use around the house and I'm wanting to setup some more advanced triggers to do certain actions with them with certain conditions.\n\nThe problem with them is they / the app does NOT have an integration with IFTTT... **however** they / the app does have an integration with Alexa.\n\nAs such I've setup a series of routines & I can trigger device actions by saying things like \"Alexa, Turn on the porch light\" and it will turn on the light in the porch.\n\n# More advanced triggers?\n\nI'm looking for a way to create a lot more advanced triggers and you can see I've already made reference to IFTTT because I've had a look into trying to do some of my triggers in that app however it seems to lack complexity for what I am wanting as they want simple applets rather than advanced.\n\nI would have expected there was a way to do most of this within Alexa itself but I can't find anything, all of the google searches I've made point me towards IFTTT and SmartThings\n\n# What I am wanting to achieve for example\n\nIf the porch light is off **and** If the time is **after** 16:00 **but** **before** 08:00 **and** my phone enters a specific area/location **then** turn on the porch light **then** after 5 minutes turn off the porch light.\n\nThis scenario is so I can get home in the evening and have the porch light on so I can see what I am doing, take shoes off, open the main door and then get inside. After a minute or two it would turn off.\n\n# Another example relating to the above\n\nIf the porch light is on **and** If the time is **after** 16:00 **but** **before** 08:00 **and** my phone is within a specific area/location **then** after 30 minutes turn off the porch light.\n\nThis scenario is just in case I have turned the light on manually for a specific reason, 30 minutes will be long enough to do what I am doing and quick enough to not waste loads of electricity.\n\n# Location vs WiFi\n\nDepending on what would be more reliable, it might even be worth switching from location to the WiFi SSID, the only thing I am not sure about is how fast it would connect to the WiFi.\n\n# The complexity...\n\nI realise that this is a fair bit more complex than a normal IFTTT applet so am open to suggestions of using other apps either with or in place of IFTTT. I've tried looking into Tasker but I couldn't figure out how to achieve this with it.\n\nHowever at minimum I would like to be able to do **If** Location = xxx **Then** Trigger Specific Alexa Routine just to be able to turn on the porch light for now.\n\nI'm sure others are looking for something similar so maybe this thread could point others in the right direction if someone knows of a solution.\n\nThanks",

Then resumes.\n\nOverall, I am very, very tired of the new and annoying - and persistent - issues. Devices go absolutely dumb way too frequently, just stop working, suddenly can't 'see' my hue lights and have to be reinstalled, cut in and out, don't understand the simplest requests (ones I've used for years).

  "I have a routine setup that when my front door is unlocked (Halo WiFi lock), it turns on the porch lights to 80% and the living room light to 80%. Then, it issues a wait timer of 5 minutes because that\u2019s what my lock is set at to auto lock. At the end of the 5 minute wait, it returns the porch lights to off (or maybe 5%) and turns off the living room light because we rarely use that room but that light is extremely handy to safely enter and not have any pets bolt out on us.

Can anyone think of a way around this as I am using the unlocked event as my trigger. \n\n2) One that routine is set into motion, is there a way to cancel the wait and the rest of the routine?

  "Hello, \n\nI recently got an Alexa to replace a Google home mini since its WiFi died. I'm using a 2019 vizio with Alexa/home support through smart cast. When I could ask Google to play a specific title on Netflix or Hulu, it would launch and play immediately. When I ask Alexa the same thing, it just searches Vizio's Smart Cast instead of launching the title on the service. How do I get Alexa to just play what I want to watch without having to grab the remote?\n\nThanks",

Sometimes it'll play the song fine for a few rounds, sometimes it'll stop every single attempt at the song.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only thing that changed network wise is I did get a new router that was stronger than my old one because that one couldn't handle all the smart devices.

The only other change was that one of the speakers was still on the 2.4Ghz wifi instead of the 5GHz so when I got the new router I corrected that, I just can't think of what setting on the router would be causing this behavior, all other items, on the network work flawlessly except this one aspect of Alexa. \n\nMy next troubleshooting step is to add them to the 2.4 wifi to see if the issue continues there or not.

I'm designing a prototype for a class and was wondering if I could get some feedback for how useful you guys think would be.\n\n**Essentially it's a case with always-listening capabilities that you put over the Echo/dot's microphones**\n\n\\- The main feature is that this doesn't have wifi features, so even though it's listening, it cannot transmit anywhere\n\n\\- You set a wake phrase like \"G'day Alexa\" or \"Good morning/Afternoon Alexa\" which will trigger a cover over the Echo/Dot's speaker to open. At which point you ask it normally like \"Alexa, what's the weather today?\"\n\n\\- Once Alexa responds, the speaker cover automatically closes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRespond with either sentences or adjectives about how you like/dislike this idea :) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1ys22vj71l61.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9f7a2121d6272fab054697c37119baf2281dc6ac",

  "Hi,\n\nI am setting up my Smart Home having recently moved into a new property and thought perhaps Alexa would be a good way forward to become the primary voice assistance, after days of trying I've come to the conclusion that while the Echo devices are in general pretty good and have lots of skills and great integration with Home Assistant (with Alexa Media Player) that for natural voice control Alexa just doesn't cut it and for this I just don't want to compromise.\n\nWhat I have found is that for some crazy reason and even through Alexa knows she is in a specific room (or Group) with a set of named devices that there is no logic check that if I request a device with a device that has the same name elsewhere inside and outside of that group Alexa can't handle it and will flip flop between switching that device or the other... its crazy and very frustrating.\n\nHere is the setup:-\n\n**Group: Living Room**  \nLiving Room Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nTable Lamp  \nFloor Lamp  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both lamps above passed through from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Hall**  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Master Bedroom**  \nMaster Bedroom Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nBedside Lamp 1  \nBedside Lamp 2  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both bedside lamps passed from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Bedroom 2**  \nBedroom 2 Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \n*Lamp*  \nPlay Right (hue lights)  \nPlay Left (hue lights)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Landing**  \n*Lamp*\n\nHere is what happens:-\n\n**Lamps example**  \nI know that currently Alexa can't distinguish between Light and Lamps say either one and all the lights come on in the room, so to get round that have a specific lamps device that is a light group exposed to Alexa from Home Assistant.\n\nSo I walk into the Master Bedroom and I say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and she turns on the lamps because there is a light in the Master Bedroom called lamps... great it works there, I turn the lamps off with the command... it works. Next I go downstairs into the Living Room and say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and the lamps don't come on and its like nothing has happened BUT actually it has cause shes actually turned on the lamps in the Master Bedroom with that command despite it being requested from the Echo in the living room group which also has a device called lamps. \n\nNow within the Living Room say \"Alexa turn on the Living Room lamps\" and the lamps come on, why does it need Living Room Lamps, she knows she is in the living room group.\n\n**TV Example**\n\nExactly the same scenario above but with TV, I say in the Master Bedroom \"Alexa turn on the TV\" but nothing happens in the Master Bedroom but it does in the Living Room cause she's turned on the TV in there. If I stay in the Master Bedroom and say \"Alexa, turn on the Master Bedroom TV\" it works fine calling that specific group for that specific device.\n\n**What I tried**\n\nResetting Alexa, Deleting All Devices from the APP and the Alexa website, renaming all devices so they would be unique enough (Master Bedroom TV, Master Bedroom Lamps etc) and no matter what I've tried I run into an issue. \n\n**My Conclusion**\n\nOf course course I could name things like Table Lamp, Floor Lamp 1, Floor Lamp 2 which is fine to control individually and that works but if your a guest or if you don't know the house then you need to know what that these commands are and then it requires three voice commands or more, then another three to dim those lights because I can't just ask Alexa to set the lamps to 50% so she controls that light group from Home Assistant.\n\nIf you want natural voice control that is going to be intuitive to people that interact with Alexa it seems thats not possible.\n\nGroups seem somewhat pointless and to be able to put Alexa into that group so she is group aware if the logic is to first look at all of the devices attached outside of the group first and then just action on that first device with that name rather than staying within the group first and controlling that device and only going outside of it when a specific group device is called.. from the Master Bedroom.. Alexa turn off the Living Room lamps.\n\nI can then only imagine this getting worse the more devices that are added.\n\nI like the echo speakers and the integration with Home Assistant but if such a simple thing can't work then its out, I have been testing with HomePod Minis too and with this same setup in HomeKit and it seems to work exactly as expected one voice command for Lights, Lamps and controlling them in the room I am requesting them for.\n\nIts a shame I have to return my 5 Echos as I had some good automations and TTS setup with them and actionable notifications but they where primarily for voice control and Alexa has failed to integrate on this occasion.",

This is 100% an Alexa issue, not a connectivity issue.\n\n\\- They've gone deaf or insane.      The Alexa show in my kitchen doesn't hear me half the time even when I'm talking directly at it, but another Dot unit at the far opposite end of the same level of the house will respond instead for some inexplicable reason.\n\n\\- They don't act as they should be.   I stood literally in front of one of my units a few days ago saying \"Alexa, stop\" trying to get music to stop and it just wholesale ignored me despite recognizing the command.   The only way to get it to stop playing music was to physically unplug it.\n\n\\- Announcements from IOT devices are just going AWOL.   We have a washing machine that used to announce on Alexa when it was completed.   My wife particularly enjoyed this feature.   Now it's just....gone.    Sometimes it works, about 80% of the time it doesn't.     \n\n\n\\- Just plain old misinterpretation of what we're saying.   Even standing next to a unit directly it seems like their ability to interpret something as simple as \"Alexa, put eggs on the shopping list\" is going downhill.  \n\nAm I alone here or does it seem like the entire infrastructure is burning down around us?     Is it time to sell it all and move to that other option that I won't name?",
  "I have created some custom routines in Alexa, when they are triggered Alexa automatically outputs affirmation on a selected device.\n\nIf I choose my phone, the routines run, but I don't want Alexa announcing this through my phone every time of the day or night, so I have an old echo dot and I am trying to have the response routed though that. The issue is, when I set that echo dot as the response device, all I get is Alexa telling me it didn't understand the command.

  "Hello,\n\nPreviously I was using only one Echo Dot 4th Gen to control my smart home devices. I give 15-20 voice commands on a daily basis. Occasionally, I've noticed that alexa becomes unresponsive, but very sporadically and then it fixes itself. Here is how it always goes. For e.g. If I said \"Alexa\", the blue light appears, I say \"What's the time\", the blue light remains On for about 10-15 seconds, but Alexa doesn't respond.\n\nI say \"Alexa\" again, the same thing repeats.\n\nHowever, on the 3rd time, I've noticed that it does becomes responsive and starts working. It's like they've built some reset for the 3rd time internally.\n\nIt works but this unreliability that happens once or twice a day was getting very annoying. So I decided to buy another Echo Dot and make the setup \"highly available\", as in if this issue occurs in 1 device, the other device should pick it up.\n\nAfter this, the issue reduced by half, but didn't completely go away.\n\nThere is no problem with my internet as I am able to easily stream 4k videos without issues. It could be that there is too much interference in my room and that echo dot isn't designed to properly handle it.\n\nSo I was wondering, is there a 1st party/3rd party alexa voice assistant speaker that supports ethernet and is relatively inexpensive? I believe an ethernet would get rid of any interference.\n\nThe Sonos One and Fire TV Cube are too expensive.",
  "UPDATE: I contacted Amazon support and was advised to factory reset.  It seems to have fixed the issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've got Amazon unlimited and until about a week ago everything worked perfectly.  I could ask Alexa to play my music and she would do so until I asked her to stop.\n\nNow she'll play one or two songs, then stop.  If I don't want to hear the first song and ask to skip she'll skip to the next song, but if I ask again she'll say \"next isn't supported\" and refuse to play a different song.\n\nThis happens if I ask her to play my music, play a specific playlist, or play a soundtrack.\n\nIs there a fix for this?  I haven't changed any settings so I don't know why all of a sudden music won't play.",

  "**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use a the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called \"Everywhere Turntable\" specifically for that purpose. Now I can use the \"Everywhere\" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue.

The G2 Dot ring light sensor is now disabled. The ring light always runs at 100% brightness.\n3. The WiFi stack in the G2 Dot regularly crashes leaving the Dot unable to communicate with the router.

  "So a special-built version of Alexa was installed in the Orion capsule that went around the moon and reportedly worked fine.

Someone upstairs has one of these countertop screens with Alexa built in, and it has the same stupid problem, always automatically starting up music and playing it two or three notches too loud.  Even worse, when I ask it to play something, the volume is much too low.\n\nIs this just an issue that plagues all Alexa users in general?\nOr is it a setting I missed?",
  "Is anyone else having issues or has had issues with their entire house not playing Amazon music on the everywhere group or it jumps around or quits playing after a few seconds? No one else is using the music so it\u2019s not an issue with confusing commands, the music will play for roughly 15 to 30 seconds and then just quit like the playlist is over.",
  "Hi Folks,\n\nI have 4 echo buttons which I use for lightswitches for my kids.\n\nLooks like there was a recent update on my echo shows they are paired to and now none of them work. I've tried repairing etc and no luck.\n\nAny else having this issue?",
  "TLDR:\nInsignia fire tv doesn\u2019t seem to be the \u201ctv\u201d device in the description and I can\u2019t get Alexa to respond to the set name of the tv \u201cSophia\u2019s tv,\u201d it only works with name \u201cnew tv.\u201d\n\n\n\u2014So this is like the weirdest thing. I have an LG TV that is connected to Alexa and when I go to it on the app, there\u2019s a power button and it is simply just in there as the TV brand. \nGot a new insignia TV today with fire TV, built-in, and it connected immediately to Alexa. However, when you go to it, it\u2019s description is \u201cAmazon Alexa\u201d while our main tv is \u201cLG web OS*****\u201d\u2026 it\u2019s almost set as if it doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a TV? Or something? It\u2019s definitely not in there the same way as a tv you just connect to Alexa. Side note: when it initially connected to Alexa it actually showed two new devices, but I\u2019m not sure what happened to the other one at this point because I erased both of them to start over.\n\nAlso, another issue that I\u2019m having is I changed the name, which for some reason started out as \u201cnew TV,\u201d and now when I try to say, turn off Sophia\u2019s TV it says \u201cSophia\u2019s tv doesn\u2019t support that.\u201d BUT\u2026\nIf I say, turn off \u201cnew TV,\u201d it says OK and does it. \nIt\u2019s literally so frustrating how it\u2019s so difficult to fix/set/ get things like this to work properly. It\u2019s always some stupid little issue. \nI even tried deregistering and re-registering it, and it does the same thing. \nNo matter what command you use. It just says it doesn\u2019t support that unless you say \u201cnew TV.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know if this would help or not but I got a free echo dot with it\u2026 But I already have three echos in the house and I didn\u2019t really care to put a new one in here, but I guess if it would help, I could probably try. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nUghhhh",

  "Alexa has been getting worse and worse. It has been so great in years past but constantly running into issues now. I just need to rant as maybe someone else has the same issue or knows how to address.\n\nAs of 12/1/22 the Alexa iOS App updated to v2.2.510211.0 This is all fine as there are updates just about biweekly and many haven\u2019t caused issues for me but some surely have. It\u2019s always related to third party like ADT, Hue, Feit, etc. This update was the latest and exactly when things stopped working.\n\nI reached out to ADT and they assured me there are no outages etc. ADT Control App updated three weeks ago in mid, November. Since that ADT Control App update there have been no issues. \n\nThe short of the issue is that the Alexa App updated five days ago which has killed the ADT Control Skill. I am able to arm stay, arm away, and disarm via Alexa or the ADT App itself.\n\nThe issue arises when you are arming or disarming in relation to routines tied to the skill.\n\n-Alexa Arm Stay or ADT Control App set to Arm Stay.\n-Security Panel Arms\n-Routines however do not kickoff once armed/disarmed.\n-Lights don\u2019t turn off, doors don\u2019t lock, thermostat doesn\u2019t set etc.\n\nI have done everything. Checked profiles, unlinked and linked skill again. Deleted routines and recreated from scratch, and everything else. It\u2019s easy to see the recent Alexa App update broke some API call somewhere between it and ADT. \n\nI\u2019m just super annoyed that I\u2019ve committed to the Alexa ecosystem. As Alexa isn\u2019t making Amazon the money they hoped for, it\u2019ll likely be tossed on the back burner. Amazon can\u2019t seem to understand that anyone using these features is also a Prime Member and can go elsewhere. \n\nJust really thinking that it\u2019s time to make an ecosystem jump as much of a pain as that would be. I\u2019m just sick of paying a premium for service and getting f$&@ all in return. \n\nSo yea, I guess I\u2019ll just sit on my thumb and wait to see if this is fixed. Zero guarantee that it will be either, that\u2019s the worst part. What is the point of skills and routines if you can\u2019t use them and have to open many different apps to turn off or adjust all your things?\n\nI did contact Amazon Support and received the run of the mill \u201cdid you do this or do that\u201d.

  "Yesterday I had to call emergency services because my son was choking. I used my echo show to call as he was right in front of it, and I didn\u2019t want to search for my phone. This detail is important. I have daily routines set up for my kids to tell them to clean up their things and then another 30 minutes later to go brush their teeth and get ready for bed. While on the line with 911 a freaking reminder kicks off and interrupted the call. So was trying to do the heimlich and hear what the operator is saying while Alexa is telling my kids it\u2019s bedtime. Seconds matter in these scenarios. Thankfully we were finally able to clear his airway, but it wasn\u2019t looking great for a minute. \n\nI started a chat with Amazon customer service to see if something can be done or if my device was faulty. He said to add 911 as an emergency contact and that shouldn\u2019t happen. When I asked for help with that it turned out it couldn\u2019t be done. He said he would submit it as feedback and I could continuously check the Amazon website to see if this has been fixed. I would not receive notification that my issue had been resolved. So I called customer service instead. \n\nThe next guy I spoke with gave me a few more options. He said I could simply disable all of my routines. Boom. Problem solved. Well, I kind of like that feature. I mean that really eliminates some of the basic features. Then he suggested I go look for my phone and call 911 from that next time. He said to be sure I\u2019m always from the device or turn it down. That way my call won\u2019t get interrupted. *Really??* He was literally inches from the device. It was the closest thing capable of calling emergency services. Don\u2019t worry. I was also offered the solution of not calling 911 or to have the emergency outside of my scheduled routines. Not helpful either. It gets better. Finally, he argued with me that my device couldn\u2019t even call 911. It\u2019s not a feature that you can use. He said it couldn\u2019t connect to government numbers. I explained that I just did, and it was in fact the second time I had done so. It was actually a feature that I really appreciated given the fact I\u2019ve had to call 911 three times in the past few months. He had control of my device and I showed him the voice history proving myself right. He hung up on me.\n\nSo here we are. Is this something that is specific to my device? Has anyone else had this problem? How do I get this fixed *and* receive notification that it has been fixed? Thanks!",

  "I've just installed an Amazon smart thermostat to my wall mounted AC/Heat unit. It works fine to control it, but here's the issue.\nI want to set it so it doesn't use its own internal thermometer to decide if it should heat or not, but rather use one of my gen 5 dots in other rooms to determine if it should heat or not. Or better yet, have it set temperature based on average house temperature between all gen 5 dots. \n\nThe use case for this is that because I don't have central air, the thermostat (previously built into the unit, now smart) can only feel the temperature where it is physically positioned, but that means that while the living room stays at a perfect temperature, the bedroom and office get overheated or cold, depending on the outside temperature and use of the room.

Using a spare Android phone (always fixed at home) as an IP security camera to detect motion. Using IFTTT to trigger Alexa to turn on the lights when a motion is detected.\n\n    Issue: works, but there is too much lag between me entering my room and the lights turning on: close to 40-75 seconds delay. It would take me much less time to just use a physical switch to turn it on (4 seconds).\n\n3. Buying a WiFi based door sensor.\n\n    Issue: Same issue as above. It works better than motion detection but there is still too much latency, close to 20 seconds.

In the Amazon Music app, when I begin the playlist with a song that isn't usually played and activate the shuffle, now the playlist will go truly randomly, but if I start with one of the songs that is usually played, it will go with the aforementioned cycle.

Both speakers are the 'Echo (4th gen) with premium sound, smart home hub' models. Often, the music seems to only start playing up on one speaker. I have tried:  \n\n\nPutting the 2 speakers in a speaker group, and telling it to play from that group via custom command.  \n\n\nPutting both speakers in the bedroom  group, and telling the routine to default to the room .  \n\n\nBoth things fail every once in a while, and its driving me insane. It'll only play through one most of the time, and sometimes neither.   \n\n\nI have no idea if this is an integration with spotify problem, a problem with speaker groups running in routines, or something else entirely. Anyone have ideas for where I could start looking? And if not, any suggestions for alternatives? I really like having surround sound in my bedroom, we have sleepytime video game music and it feels nice to be 'surrounded' by the atmospheric sounds of skyrim, but anytime I look for good 'surround' speakers I get tons of high price options for literal surround sound, for like a home theater.

Which shortenes my commands to keywords, but still leaves me with 2 commands and as such does not solve the issue. \n\n I can program several things into my first routine so they happen after each other, but i cannot set an end date to the Audible playback, and i cannot set a time delay for onlyone of the actions in the routine (so that the audibook starts imediately and the \"no sound\" only starts 30 minutes later). \n\nDoes anyone know a way around that?",

  "Thanks for reading. \n\nI and others are having continuous frustration in which the wemo skill becomes disabled within 24 hrs of activating it.  \n\nThis has gotten so bad that the skill has tons of 1 and half star reviews, causing the wemo skills overall rating to be less than one star. \n \n\nEveryone shares the same experience.

  "This is the second time this happened to me, I will explain in detail to find if someone has experienced the same behavior.\nFirst time: I was close to my echo dot device and suddenly without any command said to it (I\u2019m sure because my main language is different that Alexa\u2019s English), Alexa started to play some weird sound like a shower sound and suddenly someone started talking, I was with my sister we freaked out and unplugged the device, later we realized we shouldn\u2019t have unplugged the device, instead we should have listened more to figure out what happened.\nSecond time: today I woke up and again a voice on my Alexa, it was someone talking about business issues it sounded like someone across the room in a business call with another person, this time the behavior was different the sound reproduced like six times in the span of an hour for two or four seconds then it went silent, no lights on the Alexa device. \n\nMy best guess on this is a bug connecting two Alexa devices on a drop in call, or maybe the other side accidentally making a drop in call to my device, is that even possible?, has anyone else experienced this?",

  "Slightly new to Alexa, so please forgive if this is obvious or there's a better sub for questions like this. Also, I don't have my Alexa app with me, so my terminology may be off. \n\nWe really want to use our Alexa-powered Echo as a metronome. But among other hiccups, it's got a slightly long, cumbersome command to get it going \"Alexa, set my metronome to 120 beats per second.\" There are variations (e.g. BPM sometimes works), but it'd be great if we could add a custom command. \n\nI have limited experience with custom commands. The closest to this is something like \"Alexa, jam\" translates to something like \"Alexa, play Jam On on Sirius XM.\"  \n\nMy problem creating something like that for the My Metronome skill is that the beats per minute we want varies with the exercise. If I had my way, I'd be able to say \"Alexa, metro ###\" and it would include ### wherever it comes in the command. Sort of like I can say \"what is the weather in CITY\" and it will give me the weather in whatever CITY I ask. \n\nIs anything remotely like this possible? \n\n\nOh,  though I'm using a metronome as an example, the underlying question is broader than that --- can I set up a custom command that passes a variable (for lack of a better word) to the full Alexa command?\n\n\n...... \n\nIf not, any chance you have a preferred metronome skill? Our two main issues with what we've tried are hiccups and odd, jarring micro-pauses in the beat. Almost like it's a loop that takes moment to buffer. And then there's the cumbersome phrase to start it. Somewhat of a mouthful and prone to misinterpretation, especially when there's background noise. Another possibility is \"Alexa, Spotify 120 BPM,\" but there is a limited range of available tracks. A lot of times we're working  incrementally and it doesn't help. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI started asking specifically about that, but the broader question would be great in the long run. If it's impossible but you have metronome suggestions, we'd greatly appreciate it.",

  "I currently have Sylvania (non-multicolor) and Merkury (multicolor) smart light bulbs paired with our Alexa setup at home. Family members almost always use the physical wall light switches to turn the bulbs on or off. When they do this I see the bulbs as \"Device is Unresponsive\" in my Alexa app and I then have to go through the ritual of pairing the bulbs to Alexa once again. Happens frequently and is quite maddening! \n\nMy question to the community is does anyone know if there is a brand that will automatically pair itself to Alexa after a physically switching the light bulb(s) back to the ON position?\n\nEDIT: so many good responses! Thank you! The Merkury do respond a lot better than the Sylvania in my usage. I\u2019ll definitely be doing some research!\n\nEDIT: so finally got some time to read a little more. The Sylvania bulbs use BT while the Merkury bulbs have wifi built into the bulb base. Looking at the reviews for the Sylvania BT bulbs it got some bad reviews citing connection instability. OK then off to another brand to replace the two Sylvania bulbs I currently have with wifi bulbs! Thanks for all your input again people! I appreciate it!\n\nEDIT: bought two more Merkury multicolor wifi bulbs. Work a heck of a lot better than the BT type. Issue solved!",

  "I posted about this before in another sub, LG and Blu and a few other manufacturers screwed up their phones being able to add smart devices with an Android 11 security update and I was forced to use an Android 10 tablet. After going through a ton of blogs I found a fix.\n\nTested and works on both phones. What you have to do is to connect to the Wi-Fi network your smart devices are connected to before you do anything. Don't open Alexa or any apps like Smart Life. Reboot the phone / tablet then set up the device. If you need to set up more than one device you might have to reboot the phone or tablet each device you add because something with the security update screws up setting up smart devices with Wi-Fi. I had to do a reboot each time.\n\nLG says they are aware of the issue, LG tech support further said we do not recommend installing any apps on the device that does not come pre-installed that means they don't recommend installing Alexa or Google Home or any other app that doesn't come with the phone \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nBlu only comment is \"Do a factory reset and see if that fixes it\".\n\nFor Xiaomi and Redmi devices that have add snart device issues the problem is with MIUI itself and have to completely disable MiUI which basically redoes most of your phone settings and launcher settings.

  "Last night I set my alarm volume to 10 and set an alarm for 5 am, then I wake up at 9:52 realizing that I had overslept because of the alarm not going off. I then ask Alexa \"did my alarm go off\" and it lit up for a second then made a quick sound and turned off. Then I asked \"play the alarm sound\" and it shut off again. Then I asked \"was my alarm set\"and it said \"you do not have any alarms set\" which was not the answer I was looking for.\n\nI got an Alexa to use as my alarm because my phone was having the same issue and I was missing days. My Alexa is useless if it has the same issue. This is the second day I've missed this week and it's getting very annoying.\n\nIs it just my Alexa or do other people have this problem too. I may have to end up buying an old school analog alarm clock if no digital devices decide to work",
  "Sometime between 3 and 5 weeks ago (November 2022 time frame), a new update was sent out for the Gen 2 Echo Dots, causing a whole passel of issues:\n\n1. When the G2 Dot is rebooted, the volume begins at level 10+. Now I have to always ask for it to reduce to 7. It no longer remembers its volume prior to the restart.\n2. The G2 Dot ring light sensor is now disabled. The ring light always runs at 100% brightness.\n3. The WiFi stack in the G2 Dot regularly crashes leaving the Dot unable to communicate with the router. This happens once about every 24 hours or so, forcing me to unplug and reboot every single one of the G2 units. I don't have time for that.\n\nThese are just the problems I've found.\n\nI have 4 of these now useless G2 devices in my house and every single one of them is behaving identically. My guess is that someone at Amazon pushed out an incorrect firmware update that wasn't intended for the G2 Dots. Now these Dots are barely functional because the firmware is incorrect for the G2 units. Amazon needs to fix these problems.\n\nFor the record, I have several G1 devices that still work fine. I also have two G3s, one G4 and an Echo Input all behaving correctly and without any issues. Whatever Amazon did in that update only affects G2 Dots, effectively making them useless to me.\n\nAnyone else experiencing these issues with their G2 Dots?",
  "There are always times when Alexa's voice is blazing loud, other times when it's normal, other times when it's low because I told it turn TF down (again).\n\nBut all of this chaos is simply not good enough for me.\n\nWhat could possibly be the final solution to this very stupid problem?   Someone upstairs has one of these countertop screens with Alexa built in, and it has the same stupid problem, always automatically starting up music and playing it two or three notches too loud.  Even worse, when I ask it to play something, the volume is much too low.\n\nIs this just an issue that plagues all Alexa users in general?\nOr is it a setting I missed?",
  "Hey, all!\n\nI've got a stereo pair of dots, an Echo plus, and now an Echo Studio that I'd like to be able to adjust the volume on all at once. As difficult as that may be to do, I also want to be able to set them to DIFFERENT volumes. For example, let's say when I say \"quiet volume\" I want the stereo pair set to 2, the Studio set to 1 and the Plus set to 1.\n\nUntil I added the Studio today I had just created a routine that changed the volume of the device I was speaking to, and at the end of the routine had a custom line for it to change the volume of the stereo pair also. Now that I have a third in the mix though, and routines only let you have one custom line, I'm not sure how to go about doing this. I'm not above doing it in some convoluted way if necessary, I just need to know what that way would be, haha\n\nAny ideas? Thanks in advance!",

  " I'm pretty frustrated with what is a pretty basic, fundamental thing I want to do with my \"smart\" speakers- change the volume.\n\nI personally tend to use my phone or Sonos app to change the volume, but my partner, roommate, and guests sometimes need to use Alexa. I also like the convenience of it when I'm not near my phone.\n\nWhen I ask Alexa to change the volume of a group, it's only changing the volume of one speaker instead of the whole group. The volume is only changed on the Alexa enabled speaker.\n\nI have an Arc+Sub and a Move. I enabled Alexa on the Move. I made a group in the Alexa app to group them together, named \"Lounge\". I'll say something like, \"Change volume in Lounge to 20%\", or \"Change volume in lounge to 2\", and Alexa only changes the volume on the Move.\n\nI troubleshooted with Sonos support for 90 minutes before hanging up on them in frustration. We went through all of the standard troubleshooting steps which I'd already done myself, and finally got to a point where they just kept asking me to do the same thing repeatedly despite explaining I'd already done it. Almost as if he was waiting for me to rage quit.\n\nAt some point during the troubleshooting I was able to change the volume of both speakers by just saying \"Change the volume to x\", leaving out the group name. This is viable at the moment, but not when (..if) I expand my setup to have more speakers, and I want to control only a specific group of them.\n\nMy Alexa setup is pretty simple at the moment. The Move isn't in any other groups, and the Arc+Sub is in one other group- \"Living Room\". The Arc is named \"Sonos Living Room\", and the Move is named \"Sonos Move\". I can change the volume of each of them individually with Alexa, but never the two combined when using the group name.\n\nAll software is up to date (which I suspect is the problem- a software update- since I didn't have this problem when I lived here 8 months ago). We reset and unplugged the Arc. Renamed everything.\n\nI've found other posts complaining about this, but most of them were at least a year old and I didn't actually see any solutions.\n\nAny help sincerely appreciated.",

They worked great for a while, then recently Alexa stopped announcing anything for the garage door.\n\nI figured that something must have gone wrong on the hubitat side but when I dug into it, I found that the Alexa routine was running correctly in each of the 3 cases, but the \"Alexa says\" action was not doing anything.\n\nFor example, I can put another action in each routine and it will run when the garage door opens or closes. I can even put certain other \"Alexa says\" actions in the routine like \"Encourage me to clean up\" (etc.) but some work and others don't. The one I need (\"customized\") doesn't work anymore.\n\nI also made a new routine trigger off speaking a custom phrase and it had the same behavior: some \"Alexa says\" options work as an action but others don't (including \"customized\")\n\nIt doesn't seem to be a volume issue as Alexa speak at a normal volume when it works, and  the ring light on the echo dot doesn't light up when the action fails.\n\nAny idea what might be going wrong?",
  "Just received a Echo 4th Gen.\nThe sound is very good but the bass is so loud the neighbours can here the thumping even at low volume.\n\nI've been into the equaliser and dropped the bass down to min with not much difference.\n\nI just tried disconnecting the sub physically but the 2 remaining speakers are rubbish.\n\nAny solutions?\nThanks!",
  "Hi. I have an echo dot 4 since it came out. It suddenly disconnected from internet a few days ago but the commands were still operative in the app, so I didn't fix it earlier. Now I tried the setup mode and it says wifi password is wrong. I have already clear data and cache, deleted the app on the phone and reinstalled it. I have factory reseted alexa (40 seconds on mute mic and lower volume) and it still exactly the same. holding now in orange light. pretty much tried everything and it doesnt work. Also restarted router just in case, still the same.",

I want alexa to constantly whisper when it's responding to me. Please tell me that I can achieve this demand with some coding or third party apps etc.\n\nAlso I can't always whisper to it because it does not hear my voice when i'm whispering, and loudly whispering is something difficult.\n\nI hope you guys have a solution for this, thanks. \n\nI use echo dot.",

  "I'm trying to find a solution to major volume Issues I'm having. I have my Echo Dot set to level 1, it's super quiet, and can barely be heard if I ask it questions, but responds with the correct volume when asked specifically.\n\nHowever, when I have a reminder, timer or an alarm goes off the thing blares at what is roughly volume 5. And if I set the volume any higher than 1 it's even louder. It shakes the table it's on and it can't even hear me telling it to shut up!\n\nI can't see any separate volume settings, and although I can find mention of Adaptive Volume which might be causing it, I'm in UK and the setting is US specific so doesn't appear on my options.\n\nIs there anything else I'm missing which could be causing this?",

The alarm doesn't go off in the morning, or rather, it goes off silently. The light ring is rotating, but there is no sound. Using the volume keys while the alarm is going off, doesn't produce sound. If I talk to Alexa, the light ring pulses as if it's responding but there is no sound.\n\nIf I unplug it and re-plug it, the alarm will go off, with sound, once it reboots. It's like it had forgotten it has a speaker. \n\nI have tried a total factory reset, made sure it has the latest firmware, have set the alarm to not increase gradually, etc. Can't think of anything else to try.

  "So the reason I suspect the cause of my podcats pausing (youtube and apple music lower their respective volumes) when I leave  my house\u2019s vicinity or come home (like a block away) is because I have alexa automate turning the lights on/off if it detects I\u2019m home and after I set it up that\u2019s when this issue started. Anyone else experience this problem? I unlinked apple music from the Alexa app thinking that was causing it but it still does this weird thing.

  "How\u2019s that for a need? Most post are people complaining their Echo is unresponsive. We actually want that. \n\nOur 94-year old mother (fairly blind, limited memory or dexterity) has a big Echo Show. Her four kids drop in on her. She doesn\u2019t have to do anything to answer or hang up. We drop in and we hang up at the end. That\u2019s all she uses the Echo for. She does have to have the volume turned up a lot, but that\u2019s OK, she has her own room. It works great. \n\nSadly, not infrequently the Echo hears something and interprets it as \u201cEcho, play heavy metal\u201d or some such thing. It\u2019s not pretty. It\u2019s really loud and jarring. Actually her trigger word is \u2018computer\u2019 but whatever it is it can be triggered by accident. \n\nShe never talks to Alexa so she\u2019s not used to saying \u201cEcho, Stop!\u201d Or \u201cAlexa, Stop!\u201d or \u201cComputer, stop!\u201d As such, when the Echo misinterprets something and starts playing (very loudly) a movie, or music, or a video, (or or or) it\u2019s not fun. \n\nOften to solve this they (the helpers at her assisted living facility) just turn down the volume to stop to unwanted noise. Then the next time we go to drop in on her she can\u2019t hear us. The volume is turned to zero. And we can\u2019t he\u2019ll her, or them how to fix it (because the volume is turned down)\n\n100% of what she does is inbound (her kids dropping in) so losing the \u2018local listening\u2019 part of Alexa would be a godsend. \n\nAny way to do that?

  "Hi, I wonder if its possible to increase / decrease the volume on my TV? The TV is an old Samsung smart TV with an Fire TV 4k stick plugged in. TV via zattoo.tv App. \n\nWhen I say alexa increase volume, it only increases the volume of the echo dot, not the TV. When Spotify is running, it works how I want it. But not on the TV App.\n\nAny ideas?",
  "I did not teach it how to do this. I did not set this up. This is now an older TV. It will operate with the remote control. The sensor is located at the bottom of the screen on the right. So things block it sometimes.  \n\nThis is an Emerson TV.  It does not have Wi-Fi. It does not have Bluetooth.  I did connect a Roku premier to an HDMI input. The Roku remote will turn on the TV. Any Roku app will do this. I use my iPhone and my iPad. I prefer to use the iPad because I have plugged my stereo speakers into the earphone plug. I get good stereo sound coming from the monitor speakers.  I can mute the television speakers with the remote control.  I turn the earphones off to block the audio from advertisements.\n\nI think I asked Alexa to turn the TV on long ago.  This did not happen.  Now it does. I wish I could get it to control the volume and switch channels on my Roku premier.",
  "It seems like Echo devices are getting increasingly annoying by recommending things you don't want with no way to turn it off. I understand the entire plan on Amazon's part is to make you buy more shit, but I object to them doing it on a device I paid for with no way to turn it off. Lately it's even ignoring my \"brief mode\" setting and responding in full sentences anyway. \"OKAY. PLAYING RAIN SOUNDS BY SLEEPJAR!\" at max volume during my bedtime routine. Just do what I tell you and shut the fuck up you god damn machine.  \n  \n/rant",
  "I've downloaded the LG ThinQ app, and connected my Echo to the TV. I can control the volume with Alexa, but when I ask it to turn the TV on or off, it say \"TV doesn't support that\". It seems like the issue is not with the connection, but with the specific phrase I use. I haven't figured out what the exact words I should use are. But as an example, if I say \"Alexa, set the TV volume to 5\" it says \"TV doesn't support that\". But if I say \"Alexa, TV volume to 5\", it adjust. I've tried all sorts of phrases, but nothing works for powering the TV.\n\nAnyone else have a similar problem, or know of a solution?",

  "Past two days now I've been trying to listen to this podcast before bed and every time I ask my Alexa to play it with the phrase \"Alexa, play (podcast name)\" my Alexa then goes \"Playing (podcast name/episode etc.)\", then nothing happens, saying \"Alexa, resume\" just plays the song that was last played and \"Alexa, what is playing right now?\", just says my last played song. It is not a volume issue and trying other podcasts I have had results all over. No podcasts work on my Alexa on Spotify. All songs work but no podcasts. Tried it on my desktop app too, switched the output to my Alexa in the bottom right of the Spotify application and tried to start a podcast that way manually. Get the blue error bubble \"Spotify can't play this right now, if you have the file... blah blah\". I also do not have any explicit filter as Alexa plays explicit songs too.

  "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been having a problem for a while now where if I turn off my weekly alarm via the app, it still goes off the following morning, waking either myself up or my entire house if I'm away. Sometimes, even when I'm sitting beside the device and I turn off the alarm via the app, it still shows on the top right corner of the device.\n\nOn a separate issue, often times when I hit snooze, the alarm immediately goes off again at full volume.\n\nAre there any solutions for this?

  "Not sure if this has always been an issue or if I'm just more aware of it since I moved recently. I have my alarms volume and general volume both set to 2, but whenever Alexa gives me a reminder the volume is insanely high, seems to be around 7. I live in a block of flats with poor noise insulation and it's totally unacceptable to have reminders like this blaring out in the late evening - I can hear my neighbour's talking at normal volume and this is roughly as loud as me shouting, so I basically can't use the reminders feature any more which is one of the few features I use a lot. Any suggestions? I've tried resetting which is the only solution I've seen so far, and it did nothing.\n\nEdit: I tried lowering the alarm volume to almost zero and then triggering a reminder. It worked but now the volume is stuck at being inaudibly quiet, even if I raise it.

I always set it to my favourite radio station, sometimes by speech and sometimes via the app. Some mornings, the radio will play as requested but at a really high volume. Other mornings, the alarm will be a continuous quiet beep.  \n\n\nI have it set to tell me the weather after I stop the alarm, but this only happens when the radio plays. Never happens after the beeping. She kind of shouts the weather at me too, given the volume goes so inexplicably high when the radio plays.  \n\n\nAnyone got any ideas how to fix this?",

However, it always resets to the home screen after a few minutes, so I have do do several clicks just to get to where I can tweak the volume.

  "I have several [NiteBird Smart Light Bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0824HJ4NN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). A couple of them, when powered off (but still connected to power source) make an annoying noise. It's a high pitched noise that's a bit difficult to describe. It's not a continuous whine, but more of an intermittent squeaking. One Amazon reviewer described it as being similar to the sound of crickets chirping. Apparently a lot of different brands of light bulbs have issues with making noise when powered off.\n\nHere are some questions/reviews from Amazon describing the issue:\n\n>Why am I hearing muffled criquet noise from the bulbs? It\u2019s kinda annoying and migraine inducing... \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Are the light buzzing sounds normal? When I turn off the bulb from my phone or Alexa voice control, there is a constant noise, almost like a very light, somewhat muffled criquet noise... every single bulbs are the same, are mines broken? ...  there is a light constant buzzing sound when we turn off the bulb from the phone app. At first the noise  didn\u2019t bother much, but I started noticing a change in my sleeping  pattern. And I started waking up restless, exhausted and sometimes with  heavy migraines that just stopped when we completely disconnected the  bulb from the bedroom. The chirping noises  stop when we completely disconnect the bulbs (which cancels the whole  purpose of the automatic on/off schedule feature, or just turning off  the lights via phone or Alexa.  \nThe animals (especially the dogs) also  looked slightly bothered by it so I am quite sceptic and hope it did  not harm their ears and/or affect hearing.  \nIn overall, it\u2019s cool at  first and a great value but I don\u2019t recommend it for anyone suffering  from Chronic migraines (as Dr visits+medications will override the  costs) especially if you are sensible to noise.  It doesn\u2019t bother my husband much so I\u2019d say that most people aren\u2019t  bothered. However, we definitely went to buy the more expensive Phillips  hue light bulb to avoid the chirping noises. I wanted to love these bulbs soooo bad but anything that triggers my migraines gets a hard pass.. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Good bulbs however when they are powered off they make a high-pitched squeaking noise  that kept me up throughout the whole night. However, when the light  switch was off it wasn\u2019t heard. Intersting.  I had to take them out  because I could not get it to stop making that horrible noise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The  only issue is these lights make a chirping/buzzing sound even when the  lights are off. I had to rearrange my light layout because I couldn\u2019t  keep these lights in my bedroom as they were keeping me awake at night. I  plan to just keep them for use in the kitchen, living room, and hallway  bathroom as i do not hear those noises from room in those spaces. Anyway, great deal, easy setup, but low constant noise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But when you're ready for that cozy, deep sleep and go to turn off the lights, you will experience their screaming bat noises  that rip through your ears and make you want to succumb to  lamp-smashing rage.\u00a0 They work great with Alexa... even when you're  telling Alexa to turn up the volume on your white noise playlist just to drown out the piercing sounds while contining to convince yourself you made a good purchase.\u00a0  \nIf you simply love shrill exorcist noises  with mood lighting, this is the smart bulb for you. For those who have  enough to deal with on the daily and enjoy sleeping, skip it - you'll be  happier living in the dark. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When turned \"off\" or dimmed via command on Alexa they emit a low buzzing noise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of those are a bit over-the-top, but it *is* annoying. Does anyone know how to make it stop? Again, it only seems to happen for 2-3 of the bulbs (I have about a dozen overall).",

  "Hi,\n\nI am setting up my Smart Home having recently moved into a new property and thought perhaps Alexa would be a good way forward to become the primary voice assistance, after days of trying I've come to the conclusion that while the Echo devices are in general pretty good and have lots of skills and great integration with Home Assistant (with Alexa Media Player) that for natural voice control Alexa just doesn't cut it and for this I just don't want to compromise.\n\nWhat I have found is that for some crazy reason and even through Alexa knows she is in a specific room (or Group) with a set of named devices that there is no logic check that if I request a device with a device that has the same name elsewhere inside and outside of that group Alexa can't handle it and will flip flop between switching that device or the other... its crazy and very frustrating.\n\nHere is the setup:-\n\n**Group: Living Room**  \nLiving Room Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nTable Lamp  \nFloor Lamp  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both lamps above passed through from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Hall**  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Master Bedroom**  \nMaster Bedroom Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nBedside Lamp 1  \nBedside Lamp 2  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both bedside lamps passed from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Bedroom 2**  \nBedroom 2 Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \n*Lamp*  \nPlay Right (hue lights)  \nPlay Left (hue lights)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Landing**  \n*Lamp*\n\nHere is what happens:-\n\n**Lamps example**  \nI know that currently Alexa can't distinguish between Light and Lamps say either one and all the lights come on in the room, so to get round that have a specific lamps device that is a light group exposed to Alexa from Home Assistant.\n\nSo I walk into the Master Bedroom and I say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and she turns on the lamps because there is a light in the Master Bedroom called lamps... great it works there, I turn the lamps off with the command... it works. Next I go downstairs into the Living Room and say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and the lamps don't come on and its like nothing has happened BUT actually it has cause shes actually turned on the lamps in the Master Bedroom with that command despite it being requested from the Echo in the living room group which also has a device called lamps. \n\nNow within the Living Room say \"Alexa turn on the Living Room lamps\" and the lamps come on, why does it need Living Room Lamps, she knows she is in the living room group.\n\n**TV Example**\n\nExactly the same scenario above but with TV, I say in the Master Bedroom \"Alexa turn on the TV\" but nothing happens in the Master Bedroom but it does in the Living Room cause she's turned on the TV in there. If I stay in the Master Bedroom and say \"Alexa, turn on the Master Bedroom TV\" it works fine calling that specific group for that specific device.\n\n**What I tried**\n\nResetting Alexa, Deleting All Devices from the APP and the Alexa website, renaming all devices so they would be unique enough (Master Bedroom TV, Master Bedroom Lamps etc) and no matter what I've tried I run into an issue. \n\n**My Conclusion**\n\nOf course course I could name things like Table Lamp, Floor Lamp 1, Floor Lamp 2 which is fine to control individually and that works but if your a guest or if you don't know the house then you need to know what that these commands are and then it requires three voice commands or more, then another three to dim those lights because I can't just ask Alexa to set the lamps to 50% so she controls that light group from Home Assistant.\n\nIf you want natural voice control that is going to be intuitive to people that interact with Alexa it seems thats not possible.\n\nGroups seem somewhat pointless and to be able to put Alexa into that group so she is group aware if the logic is to first look at all of the devices attached outside of the group first and then just action on that first device with that name rather than staying within the group first and controlling that device and only going outside of it when a specific group device is called.. from the Master Bedroom.. Alexa turn off the Living Room lamps.\n\nI can then only imagine this getting worse the more devices that are added.\n\nI like the echo speakers and the integration with Home Assistant but if such a simple thing can't work then its out, I have been testing with HomePod Minis too and with this same setup in HomeKit and it seems to work exactly as expected one voice command for Lights, Lamps and controlling them in the room I am requesting them for.\n\nIts a shame I have to return my 5 Echos as I had some good automations and TTS setup with them and actionable notifications but they where primarily for voice control and Alexa has failed to integrate on this occasion.",
  "I just bought the Aqara Hub and Hygrometer today, as multiple other hygrometer sensors I bought recently, all suddenly failed to announce the humidity over Alexa out of nowhere. So I thought Aqara is finally gonna fix it.\n\nApparently it is neither. Or I am doing something wrong. I want the little hygrometer in my cigar humidor, so I can check on its humidity from anywhere, any time verbally through my Alexa smart home.\n\nIt WAS working with a Chinese no name sensor I had for about two weeks until last weekend. I could ask Alexa, \"what's Humidor's humidty? / temperature\" and it would reply the value through Alexa. But then suddenly that sensor stopped listening to the commands over Alexa out of nowhere. So I gave it back and tried several others.\n\nBut none of them, albeit advertised on Amazon as \"working with Alexa\", did anything in Alexa. They connected through Smart Life to Alexa, but neither could I trigger e routine with them, insert them as action in a routine or give them ANY verbal command to read out the humidity values like that Chinese sensor before. Some did nothing, some said \"Humidity is not yet supported.\"\n\nAnyway, long story short: Now my last try is with the Aqara system, but sadly it is the same here - the device connected to the new HUB and also showed in the Alexa app. But neither can I use it in any routines nor does it read out the humidity value via Alexa, regardless of what command I try to ask her.\n\nAny ideas?",

I was wondering if anyone has the same/similar situation with an Alexa-only device and was able to find a workaround with IFTTT, Tasker, etc. I'm heavily invested in the Google ecosystem (4 minis, 2 displays, 1 full size speaker, Chromecasts, Pixel Phone, etc.) so I don't feel buying a cheap echo would be practical. Thanks for any input.",
  "Hi guys\n\nWhat is the best way to manage my commands?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Create all scenes in SmartThings, import to Alexa and just create a routine for each one so they triggers them using voice?\n* Or create in SmartThings only the commands not compatible with Alexa and create all the rest in Alexa Routines?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr is there a better option? I am new to this smart devices thing. Thanks in advance",
  "First, I am quite new to the Alexa app and automation in general. So forgive me if this is a basic question, but I can't find an answer to this exact situation.\n\nI have:\n\n* a four-head mini split A/C+heat system (Senville brand)\n* the Alexa Android app\n* NO Alexa device (e.g. Echo)\n* NO \\[separate\\] smart thermostat(s)\n\nThe mini split system has plug-in dongles that are Alexa capable. I got them all plugged into all four head units and connected to wifi, and the Alexa app on my phone recognizes them.\n\nWith the Alexa app itself, I can go into each of the four devices, turn it off/on, set the temperature, set the mode, and set the fan level. Basic but perfectly functional for what I need.\n\nI have also created routines so that each unit can turn on and off at predetermined times. Great!\n\nBut while I can adjust the temperature in the Alexa app on the phone, there is no option that I see when creating a **routine** to change the temperature. It's simply a binary on/off.\n\nNow, I won't invest in smart thermostats. It's not worth it to me, since I have most of what i need already. But am I missing something? Is there a way to get an app or enable some function or skill that will allow me to set the temperature on each unit **in a routine**, in addition to turning it on/off?\n\nThe basic idea is that, in winter for example, I want to turn down the bedroom but keep it at some minimum temperature (say 60F) all day until bedtime. I don't necessarily want to turn it off entirely.\n\nThanks for your help.",
  "I recently moved in with a friend, her house is already set up with alexa and I brought mine. I have attempted to connect my system to hers so I can control the lights without going into her bedroom but I have no clue what I'm doing. She is older and had someone else set up her system so I have to figure it out on my own. I basically just want to be able to access the lights, the ring camera and maybe drop in if I don't want to leave my room to ask her something. I was going to add my lights and smart plugs as I set up my bedroom and maybe add another echo in the communal area. How can I do this without having to completely add all of my devices to her account? Right now the living situation is temporary and I don't want to have my stuff just become a part of her household, especially if things don't work out. I want us to have our separate routines and stuff.\n\nI'm okay with tech but smart home stuff is a little advanced for me and need my hand held lol.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",

  "Hi!  We bought our two kids each an echo dot to use from their rooms.  We set both them up with Amazon Kids and they each can ask their echo dot questions.  It gives back kinda silly responses but fine.  \n\nThe problem now though is that they can\u2019t use any other Alexa device in the house.  The expected behavior was not to limit their Alexa use to their room echo dots only.  We expected that on any echo dot device in the house the kids\u2019 voice would be recognized and restrictions would be applied to their requests.  I do not want to restrict them to use only their one echo dot.  \n\nCan we put kid restrictions on all echo dot devices in our home and allow them to talk to any echo dot in the house?  The current limitation of only 1 echo dot for them to use seems silly to me.\n\nThanks!",

What i would like it to do if possible is turn the volume to 10 on all devices and then make an announcement on all devices.

  "I have a routine which has been working just fine for a year or so. It just tunes my SHOW to a radio station at 6:45AM. But, recently the \"Tunein\" blub has been very loud. It would be nice to tell the device to fade in from 20% to 40% volume over the next 2 minutes. I think this can be done in an alarm, but I don't see how to cause an alarm to wake with a radio station. So, the only thing I can think of with the routine is to put a \"alexa set volume to 30%\" before the start radio command and then create a 2nd routine for 6:46 to set it to 40% and finally a 3rd for 6:47 to set to 40%. I'm sure I'm missing something :)",

  "I'm nearing my wits end, especially with how integral our Alexa system has become with our home automation and daily lives.    It just seems like it's all falling apart.\n\nIn the last 2 weeks:\n\n\\- Random units drop offline for no apparent reason, complaining about loss of connectivity.    There is NO connectivity issues with any other devices in the house and I have a high end prosumer level router with gigabit synchronous fibre.   Connectivity isn't an issue.   Even if I reboot the router and related Alexa units they often fall offline again sometimes only *minutes* later.   This is 100% an Alexa issue, not a connectivity issue.\n\n\\- They've gone deaf or insane.      The Alexa show in my kitchen doesn't hear me half the time even when I'm talking directly at it, but another Dot unit at the far opposite end of the same level of the house will respond instead for some inexplicable reason.\n\n\\- They don't act as they should be.   I stood literally in front of one of my units a few days ago saying \"Alexa, stop\" trying to get music to stop and it just wholesale ignored me despite recognizing the command.   The only way to get it to stop playing music was to physically unplug it.\n\n\\- Announcements from IOT devices are just going AWOL.   We have a washing machine that used to announce on Alexa when it was completed.   My wife particularly enjoyed this feature.   Now it's just....gone.    Sometimes it works, about 80% of the time it doesn't.     \n\n\n\\- Just plain old misinterpretation of what we're saying.   Even standing next to a unit directly it seems like their ability to interpret something as simple as \"Alexa, put eggs on the shopping list\" is going downhill.  \n\nAm I alone here or does it seem like the entire infrastructure is burning down around us?     Is it time to sell it all and move to that other option that I won't name?",

  "I have a Prime account and my wife is part of my \"Amazon household\" to share all the benefits and our digital purchases. Maybe I misunderstood how Alexa works, but I assumed part of that \"household\" sharing extended to Alexa.\n\nSo we each have the Alexa app installed and we can control the smarthome features and see all of the Echos in the house.\n\nThere are however 2 big problems:\n\n1. Every new device seems to need to be added by BOTH of our Alexa apps. Otherwise, saying \"Alexa turn on the X light\" will only work for the person who added it (e.g. me) and the other person would first need to say something like \"Switch to <other> account\" first. Same goes for grouping devices into rooms. We can get out of sync if her app says light 1 is in room 1 but my app says light 1 and light 2 are both in that room, then turning on/off room 1 will do different things.\n2. Spotify is a mess with 2 accounts. I tried adding my Spotify to \"my default music\" and my wife added her Spotify. But then when we try to say \"Play X on Spotify\" or \"Play X on Y's Spotify\" it always defaults to my account. For now I've unlinked my account so only my wife has it linked.

Should I add a profile for her? Would she be able to manage that profile? Or would Alexa still be in this weird split brain mode?\n\nIdeally I'd like:\n\n1. We both have our Spotify accounts linked and can play music from our accounts on the Alexa. With a default to her account with \"Play X on Spotify\" voice commands\n2.

  "Hello,\n\nPreviously I was using only one Echo Dot 4th Gen to control my smart home devices. I give 15-20 voice commands on a daily basis. Occasionally, I've noticed that alexa becomes unresponsive, but very sporadically and then it fixes itself. Here is how it always goes. For e.g. If I said \"Alexa\", the blue light appears, I say \"What's the time\", the blue light remains On for about 10-15 seconds, but Alexa doesn't respond.\n\nI say \"Alexa\" again, the same thing repeats.\n\nHowever, on the 3rd time, I've noticed that it does becomes responsive and starts working. It's like they've built some reset for the 3rd time internally.\n\nIt works but this unreliability that happens once or twice a day was getting very annoying. So I decided to buy another Echo Dot and make the setup \"highly available\", as in if this issue occurs in 1 device, the other device should pick it up.\n\nAfter this, the issue reduced by half, but didn't completely go away.\n\nThere is no problem with my internet as I am able to easily stream 4k videos without issues. It could be that there is too much interference in my room and that echo dot isn't designed to properly handle it.\n\nSo I was wondering, is there a 1st party/3rd party alexa voice assistant speaker that supports ethernet and is relatively inexpensive? I believe an ethernet would get rid of any interference.\n\nThe Sonos One and Fire TV Cube are too expensive.",

  "**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use a the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called \"Everywhere Turntable\" specifically for that purpose. Now I can use the \"Everywhere\" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue.

  "I can't find the correct answer, or my Alexa isn't working right. I have the latest Echo Dot, the Alexa Windows App with show mode, and the Android app. I want alexa to just up and say \"Your package of \"blah blah\" has been delivered\" or \"Your package is out for delivery\" which a lot of articles claim CAN be done, but whenever I follow the steps of going into the app, more, to Amazon Shopping and turning on delivery notifications along with enabling say or show titles for items you've ordered, all I get is the \"Ba-Dong\" sound for a notification, and I have to ask Alexa to read me my notifications before I know what the sound was for.\n\nI want to bypass the \"Ba-dong\" noise completely and just have Alexa automatically read out the actual notification, especially for deliveries. How do I do this? It sounds like Alexa is capable of doing this, and it sounds like I am doing it right, according to everything I have read, but I have been trying for a few years now, and still no luck, have tried new devices, new accounts, etc. This is starting to drive me nuts. Either, something is wrong with my setup, or Alexa can't actually do this, and the article are poorly written. I'm not sure which one it is, but don't want to keep trying something that wont work,",

  "Last night I set my alarm volume to 10 and set an alarm for 5 am, then I wake up at 9:52 realizing that I had overslept because of the alarm not going off. I then ask Alexa \"did my alarm go off\" and it lit up for a second then made a quick sound and turned off. Then I asked \"play the alarm sound\" and it shut off again. Then I asked \"was my alarm set\"and it said \"you do not have any alarms set\" which was not the answer I was looking for.\n\nI got an Alexa to use as my alarm because my phone was having the same issue and I was missing days. My Alexa is useless if it has the same issue. This is the second day I've missed this week and it's getting very annoying.\n\nIs it just my Alexa or do other people have this problem too.

  "Sometime between 3 and 5 weeks ago (November 2022 time frame), a new update was sent out for the Gen 2 Echo Dots, causing a whole passel of issues:\n\n1. When the G2 Dot is rebooted, the volume begins at level 10+. Now I have to always ask for it to reduce to 7. It no longer remembers its volume prior to the restart.\n2. The G2 Dot ring light sensor is now disabled. The ring light always runs at 100% brightness.\n3. The WiFi stack in the G2 Dot regularly crashes leaving the Dot unable to communicate with the router. This happens once about every 24 hours or so, forcing me to unplug and reboot every single one of the G2 units. I don't have time for that.\n\nThese are just the problems I've found.\n\nI have 4 of these now useless G2 devices in my house and every single one of them is behaving identically. My guess is that someone at Amazon pushed out an incorrect firmware update that wasn't intended for the G2 Dots. Now these Dots are barely functional because the firmware is incorrect for the G2 units. Amazon needs to fix these problems.\n\nFor the record, I have several G1 devices that still work fine. I also have two G3s, one G4 and an Echo Input all behaving correctly and without any issues. Whatever Amazon did in that update only affects G2 Dots, effectively making them useless to me.\n\nAnyone else experiencing these issues with their G2 Dots?",

  "While I love the newer Alexa update that allows all devices to act as triggers, thus making your smart switch able to toggle more than what it\u2019s wired to, it does not seem to be compatible with the brand pictured. My whole house has Kasa switches except for the 3 upstairs in the bedrooms since I needed a fan/light combo switch that Kasa did not have on the market at the time. I love the new ability to have a master switch for the group/room. Essentially it mimics the \u201clights on/lights off voice command (barring you\u2019ve got all desired lights and Echo in its respective group). For example, the Kasa switch in the living room that used to solely toggle the main ceiling light now has a routine in place that says when ceiling light is off, then tv light, sconce lights, short lamp and ceiling light turn off. Is there any workaround to this or am I missing something blatant?\n\nThanks for any suggestions!",
  "I've been using one for a few weeks now due to me not trusting the Landlord provided CO monitor.\n\nNow the issue I have with it is that the hourly monitor is based on an average. Fine.

Though this seems to be true for all metrics.\n\nIt seems to take the lowest score recorded for each day and average them. Which isn't how averages work. Does anyone know if this is supposed to be the correct way this unit monitors such things or if it's a bug in the software?\n\nOr better still if there's a setting I'm missing which allows me to control how the data is displayed so it reads logically.\n\nAnyone else had any experience with the AQM device?",

  "Hey, all!\n\nI've got a stereo pair of dots, an Echo plus, and now an Echo Studio that I'd like to be able to adjust the volume on all at once. As difficult as that may be to do, I also want to be able to set them to DIFFERENT volumes. For example, let's say when I say \"quiet volume\" I want the stereo pair set to 2, the Studio set to 1 and the Plus set to 1.\n\nUntil I added the Studio today I had just created a routine that changed the volume of the device I was speaking to, and at the end of the routine had a custom line for it to change the volume of the stereo pair also. Now that I have a third in the mix though, and routines only let you have one custom line, I'm not sure how to go about doing this. I'm not above doing it in some convoluted way if necessary, I just need to know what that way would be, haha\n\nAny ideas? Thanks in advance!",
  "I have one Echo at work in one town, and another at my SO's apartment in another. I was attempting to follow some instructions where I can give each one a particular location so that if we say, \"Alexa, play (whatever) in the office\", it will play it on the office device. Same with the \"living room\" device. So, I did that, but when we ask for a particular Echo to play something at it's location, it is still interfering with the other (they don't both play the same thing, rather it just stops playing music on the other device altogether). Am I misunderstanding that I can't get the results I am looking for and this cannot be done? Or am I doing something wrong?",

  "So if I ask Alexa ON my Samsung Smart TV to show me a specific camera, it works!  But if I ask Alexa on an echo device to show me a camera ON the TV, it says \"this device doesn't support camera viewing\" or something along those lines.  If it is an Echo Show then it just shows the camera on the Show itself.  \n\nTo activate Alexa ON the TV, I have to hold down a thing on the remote and it's kind of annoying. I just want to say \"Alexa....\" and do a command.  Back when I had a fireTV I had to manually link echo devices to the fireTV to have this functionality happen but I don't see a way of doing this for the TV.  Anyone tried something like this before with success?",

The device in the bedroom does not do this to the other rooms, and I\u2019m not sure why this particular one is doing it. \n\nThoughts on what I should check? It\u2019s irritating to turn off the living room lights at night, only to be plunged into pitch darkness because Alexa has decided that everything must go.",

  "So I bought a 2nd Alexa Dot (5th Generation) for another room. The distance between the 2 devices are 3 metres. I combined speakers and I can ask Alexa to play a song and then use a keyword like \"Everywhere\" and it will play on both Dots simultaneously (using Amazon Prime accessible songs) GREAT! I sometimes play songs off my phone though and I can connect to both speakers via bluetooth simultaneously but the music (Samsung Music App) will only ever come out of one speaker. I don't want to bring the speakers closer (I know this might be one solution) because that defeats the purpose of buying the second Dot. I like that I don't have to yell and I have my living room and bedroom now connected.\n\nDoes anyone know how to get audio playing from a phone to both  Alexa Dot speakers simultaneously?\n\nEDIT UPDATE 1: I figured it out. I had slide down on my phone and click media output, then click the second speaker. Both devices were paired, but the audio was switching between them until I went to this media output and enabled the 2nd speaker. Thank you Samsung for dual audio. Now, if I buy a 3rd Alex Dot can I run 3 speaks off my phone...?\n\nEDIT UPDATE 2: They call it Samsung Dual Audio for reason. I tried with a non Alexa Dot Bluetooth speaker and I realized I can have it on PLUS one Alexa dot simultaneously, but not all 3 at the same time. Still, I can play music in 2 rooms of my phone now.",

So was trying to do the heimlich and hear what the operator is saying while Alexa is telling my kids it\u2019s bedtime. Seconds matter in these scenarios. Thankfully we were finally able to clear his airway, but it wasn\u2019t looking great for a minute. \n\nI started a chat with Amazon customer service to see if something can be done or if my device was faulty. He said to add 911 as an emergency contact and that shouldn\u2019t happen. When I asked for help with that it turned out it couldn\u2019t be done. He said he would submit it as feedback and I could continuously check the Amazon website to see if this has been fixed. I would not receive notification that my issue had been resolved. So I called customer service instead. \n\nThe next guy I spoke with gave me a few more options. He said I could simply disable all of my routines. Boom. Problem solved. Well, I kind of like that feature. I mean that really eliminates some of the basic features. Then he suggested I go look for my phone and call 911 from that next time. He said to be sure I\u2019m always from the device or turn it down. That way my call won\u2019t get interrupted. *Really??* He was literally inches from the device. It was the closest thing capable of calling emergency services. Don\u2019t worry. I was also offered the solution of not calling 911 or to have the emergency outside of my scheduled routines. Not helpful either. It gets better. Finally, he argued with me that my device couldn\u2019t even call 911. It\u2019s not a feature that you can use. He said it couldn\u2019t connect to government numbers. I explained that I just did, and it was in fact the second time I had done so. It was actually a feature that I really appreciated given the fact I\u2019ve had to call 911 three times in the past few months. He had control of my device and I showed him the voice history proving myself right. He hung up on me.\n\nSo here we are. Is this something that is specific to my device?

He said it couldn\u2019t connect to government numbers. I explained that I just did, and it was in fact the second time I had done so. It was actually a feature that I really appreciated given the fact I\u2019ve had to call 911 three times in the past few months. He had control of my device and I showed him the voice history proving myself right. He hung up on me.\n\nSo here we are. Is this something that is specific to my device? Has anyone else had this problem? How do I get this fixed *and* receive notification that it has been fixed? Thanks!",
  "So I was just sitting at my desk working and all of a sudden an article on the new Avatar movie comes on my echo show. I tell her to turn it off and no response. I manually go home and she just goes silent and then brings up the same article and stops for the weather and then a joke. Then she started to act like one of my kids and goes crazy with clicking stuff. Turned the echo show off and on again and hopefully she don\u2019t go bonkers again. Maybe Alexa is becoming human.

  "My kids constantly disrupt each other's Spotify listening on their individual Alexa Echos, because their accounts are all through my Spotify. In addition, if I play a song in the car while they're at home, it disrupts their listening.\n\nAs you can imagine, this is frustrating to everyone.\n\nIs there a clear way to have two different Echo Dots playing two different songs, and my car also playing a third song?

  "Ok, so my wife bought an Echo last year and there was a Black Friday sale or something so she got this Echo Show 5 for my kid. We set up the Amazon kids but honestly, we don\u2019t use any of the Amazon services so I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s needed. \n\nWhat my kid does do is use it to play Spotify while she\u2019s hanging out in her room. We have a Spotify family plan for no ads and I have my kid with her own account so she gets her own playlists, etc. Now, anytime she talks to the Echo Show and asks it to play, it takes over my Spotify session. So if I\u2019m in the car, at work, or just outside doing something with my music playing, suddenly it stops and plays whatever she requested in her room. I was thinking I might could solve it with the Alexa \u201cLearn my Voice\u201d but the Show says it doesn\u2019t support this. When she plays Spotify from her iPad it uses her own session as it should. \n\nAny ideas?",

  "There was a post in r/ADHD asking about ADHD investments- an item you'd get for yourself to help work your way around life with ADHD.

So whenever the thoughts run through my head, I say \u201cHey Alexa, remind me to do \\[insert task here\\] at \\[specific time of the day\\]\u201d. I even make to-do lists to challenge myself to do everything that I need to do for the day!

When I catch myself drowning in a miscellaneous activity when I should be doing something else/better, I\u2019ll tell Alexa to set a timer to snap me out of it and remind me to do something ;)\n\nCertain tasks turn me off to the point where I can actually feel distressed/angered while trying to perform them, and it helps so much that I could tell Alexa to put on white noise or background music to help focus and make the task more bearable. I sometimes struggle to sleep because of racing thoughts that can often stress me out and cause me anxiety. Alexa's relaxing calming sounds (Have y'all tried water sounds????) puts me right to sleep with a smile on my face.\n\nI also leave my phone in the most random of places- lost in the couch, bed, car, fridge (I kid you not) and it comes in clutch that Alexa can call your phone for you if you ask Alexa where your phone is. Amazing. Those timers also come in clutch so that I don't forget something cooking in the kitchen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Alexa has been an incredible tool for me living with ADHD.

  "I have an extra 4th gen Amazon Kids Echo Dot that we ended up with, and I thought \"Hey, I don't care that it looks like an animal, I can just use it on my desk!\" Well, no matter what I do, it keeps telling me I need to subscribe to Amazon Kids. First, we already have an active Kids subscription for the other Kids devices we have (a Fire tablet and another Kids Echo Dot); second, I don't need Kids enabled on my device.\n\nIs there a way to disable that, or is it baked into this particular device?",
  "How\u2019s that for a need? Most post are people complaining their Echo is unresponsive. We actually want that. \n\nOur 94-year old mother (fairly blind, limited memory or dexterity) has a big Echo Show. Her four kids drop in on her. She doesn\u2019t have to do anything to answer or hang up. We drop in and we hang up at the end. That\u2019s all she uses the Echo for. She does have to have the volume turned up a lot, but that\u2019s OK, she has her own room. It works great. \n\nSadly, not infrequently the Echo hears something and interprets it as \u201cEcho, play heavy metal\u201d or some such thing. It\u2019s not pretty. It\u2019s really loud and jarring. Actually her trigger word is \u2018computer\u2019 but whatever it is it can be triggered by accident. \n\nShe never talks to Alexa so she\u2019s not used to saying \u201cEcho, Stop!\u201d Or \u201cAlexa, Stop!\u201d or \u201cComputer, stop!\u201d As such, when the Echo misinterprets something and starts playing (very loudly) a movie, or music, or a video, (or or or) it\u2019s not fun. \n\nOften to solve this they (the helpers at her assisted living facility) just turn down the volume to stop to unwanted noise. Then the next time we go to drop in on her she can\u2019t hear us. The volume is turned to zero. And we can\u2019t he\u2019ll her, or them how to fix it (because the volume is turned down)\n\n100% of what she does is inbound (her kids dropping in) so losing the \u2018local listening\u2019 part of Alexa would be a godsend. \n\nAny way to do that? Inbound only? No trigger word?",

  "I bought my daughter an Echo Dot kids edition. I'll be honest, I'm not sure if we're doing something wrong, it's broken or the whole thing just isn't very good. \n\nMy main issues:\n\n- if she says 'play musical chairs' Alexa will say it has no idea what she's on about. However, if you say 'play musical games' Alexa then gives you the option to play musical chairs. It's like some sort of mad folder structure that you have to know in order to access stuff. Alexa seems incapable of understanding unless you complete voice commands in the right order? This is my main gripe, as you can't easily explore content.\n\n\n- sometimes my daughter will play a quiz. After each question you get a few seconds to answer. If you miss this window, that's it. Alexa acts like she has no idea what you're talking about if you try and provide the answer again.\n\n\n- if I say something like 'play happy birthday' it will tell me it doesn't know that song. But if I say 'its my birthday' it will proceed to sing happy birthday to me. Surely it's ai is smarter than that?\n\n\n- Spotify won't link. It's all setup in my Alexa account, but the dot just tells me to complete setup again and again.\n\n\n- even when i give permissions to skills and enable, many still won't work. I'm wondering whether this is to do with it being the kids edition?\n\n\nDoes it sound like we're doing something wrong? Or are these known issues?",
  "Okay so this might be a very dumb question but I haven't managed to make it work yet.

Even included custom integrations like Home Assistant. \n\nI want to migrate to Alexa devices but I can't figure out how to have the same seamless setup... is it possible?. I know the US has [Amazon Household](https://www.amazon.com/myh/households) and it lets you add adults or kid accounts but I can't find anything similar for Germany. The closest I can find is the option to [Share your Prime Benefits](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GWZ7QXD2X8WL8YE8) which honestly only covers Prime Shipping and her account is already added there anyway. \n\nThere are options inside the Alexa app to add family members but it seems to be a local thing. Just name/nickname/relationship so you can refer to them more easily and not actually linking other people in. \n\nI'm guessing I could just set up the devices and she would be able to access all the integrations through the voice assistant just not on her phone but then... how do you configure voice recognition so it shows relevant information depending on who is speaking?.\n\n/Edit: Just to make sure its clear.

I have come across multiple articles from a few years ago that all imply that the Kids version can play sleep sounds, but none of the ones I try seem to work.",
  "My kid has a name which is also a common English word, yet it's pronounced German. Whenever I try using their name (e.g. to turn on the light in their room), Alexa won't understand the name as it's not very common. When I'm using the English pronunciation, Alexa will react but by kid will be mad ;).\nIs there any trick to teach Alexa how their name is pronounced?",
  "I cant seem to figure this out. It's allowing him to announce to all devices associated with my account from his child's profile, but if he tries to call, it says 'ADD CONTACTS - Ask your parent to add contacts for you in the Alexa app.' \n\nI'm not sure how to do this. Google says to do the following:\n\nSet Up Calling in Amazon Kids on Your Fire Tablet\nOpen the Alexa app.\nSelect Communicate.\nSelect the contacts icon.\nToggle the switch to On.\nSelect your name.\nSelect your child's name.\nSelect Add New Contact.\n\nI dont see anywhere to 'toggle the switch to on', nor do I see my child's name when selecting my name. This is pretty confusing. I'd just like for him to be able to call a specific device, like mine or his mother's echo show from his child profile on his Fire tablet. Does anyone know how to do this?",
  "I recently connected my ATT account with Alexa and now she is announcing every call. I love the feature when my kids, wife, friends, or mom calls me but I don't want all the spam or recruiter calls to be announced. Is there a way to restrict which selected numbers get announced when someone calls my phone?",
  "I use the \u2018school time\u2019 blueprint to keep my homeschool on track.\nI programmed in each kid\u2019s schedule for each day.  And at the designated day/time  it will announce what class is starting. \nIt\u2019s great, and far easier to program and edit than using alarms on my phone.  \n\nHowever, it always repeats the reminder.   Then multiply that by more then one kid, and this announcement takes a while, and is very disruptive.  \n\u201cThis is a reminder from school time, [child #1 name] study hall.   This is a reminder from school time, [child name] study hall. This is a reminder from school time, [child #2] reading.

  "[**\\*Edit: the Alexa help page has now been updated to reflect the new limitations.***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=GHKNDEFH7JCKX4DB)\n\n**TL;DR -** I just confirmed with Amazon Customer Service that soon Alexa-to-phone calling will be restricted to a pre-chosen list of no more than **10 contacts per Alexa user profile**, unless you have and link an AT&T Wireless or Skype account to your Alexa Communications profile.  Making 'Alexa-to-Alexa' calls (calling between Echo devices, the Alexa app, etc.)  will still of course be unlimited but if you want to call a landline or cellular telephone number you will only be able to choose from your set list of ten chosen contacts.  \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Full Details -** Moments ago I used Alexa to make a toll-free (1-800-number) phone call from one of the Echo Dots in my home, something I do daily/multiple times a day.  As soon as I finished my call and asked Alexa to \"hangup\" I was greeted with a \"By the way...\" notification/response from Alexa which told me the number I had just called was automatically added to my list of ten Alexa-to-phone contacts and to see the Alexa app for more information, to edit my list of ten contacts, or to link an account and still be able to make unlimited Alexa-to-phone calling from my Echo devices.  Confused I opened my Alexa app and was greeted with a \"card\" on the home screen telling me the same things/to click there for more info.  I use my Amazon Alexa devices as my primary outgoing house phone and have since 2017 on my 8 Echo Dots, four Fire HD tablets, and on various computers using the \"Alexa for PC\" Windows app.  I am disabled and being able to depend on using Alexa to make phone calls in my home on my numerous Alexa devices is vital and has been a lifesaver for me - literally - as I am occasionally prone to randomly falling asleep/passing out due to my disability.\n\n*(Long tangent example from a couple of years ago:*  *A couple of years ago this happened while I was showering - I woke up and found myself lying down in my shower in standing water with blood everywhere after having apparently blacked out/slammed my head into/cut a giant gash across my forehead on the sharp corner edge of my marble bathroom vanity sink countertop.  I was completely out of it (a CT scan later confirmed a concussion) and had probably been on the floor for 15 or 20 minutes and was too disoriented to get myself up from the floor.  My cell phone was nearby outside of the shower and I was able to pull myself over to it but the battery was dead and I was too weak and dizzy and bloody to get up and find the charger.  Fortunately I had my Echo Dot in there in that bathroom and so I began trying to get a hole of someone who might be able to help me (since you can't dial \"911\" using Alexa) but no one would answer my Alexa-to-Alexa phone calls (because most people I know who have this capability never really use this feature and would probably be totally confused receiving a call from me via it anyway). Fortunately, after calling numerous contacts from my linked mobile phone address book via Alexa I was finally able to get in touch with an old roommate/good friend and they rushed over immediately and raced me to the ER. I definitely called more than 10 contacts before someone answered.)*\n\nAnyway, the Alexa app said I could link my AT&T or Skype accounts if I wanted to still be able to make unlimited Alexa-to-phone phone calls.  Well that's fine and great, but I use Verizon Wireless as my cellular phone service provider and don't have an AT&T wireless mobile phone or account.  I continued reading through the details and \"More Information\" help sections provided in the Alexa App (text content and screenshots provided below) and then called Amazon Customer Support to see if this terrible news was really true.  While on hold I looked online to see if Amazon had made any press releases about these changes or if any news outlets/tech blogs had written anything about the new restrictive changes to making calls with Alexa but found nothing.  The Amazon representative I spoke with also knew nothing of these changes, nor did the developer/engineering team contact he reached out to as I waited on hold with him on the phone.  He looked through various internal channels/systems and couldn't find any information about these changes either and so I offered to send him screenshots of what I was seeing in my Alexa App and he thanked me and asked if I would please send them.  I sent them while on the phone and he shared them with the engineering team contact he had been talking with about this while I waited.  A while later he did confirm that he had found some information about these changes (basically just the same details that are given in the new help section about this in the Alexa App) and said he would try to find out more information and if he does learn any additional details he'll share them with me via phone or email in the next day or so. He said while it's not uncommon for Amazon to be absolutely terrible about sharing information about big changes/new features/various updates with their team members before going public with the info he did think it was odd that there was next to nothing announced about this and that I had already learned about these coming changes from the Alexa app and said that might have possibly been by accident and apologized.\n\nI hate this and wanted to share this with other Amazon Echo device/Alexa users.  I mean, I understand that it was a free service and that Amazon is not making any money (aside from revenue from the initial device purchase) by allowing people to place unlimited, free phone calls from their Alexa devices, but it's super frustrating for a core feature like this to be restricted without any advanced warning or announcement, especially at a time when most communication/telecommunication platforms and companies are adding *more* capabilities and features/free extra data/etc. to be helpful while we're all feeling and dealing with the challenges of living through a global pandemic.  Super upsetting Amazon would suddenly add restrictions.  I am fine with being required to link my cellular phone service provider account to my Alexa Communications profile/account if that's necessary to keep being able to effortlessly make outgoing phone calls using my Alexa/Echo devices, but if that's the case than other service providers that just AT&T need to be added.  Maybe AT&T is the entity here who pushed for these new restrictions, who knows...  ughhhh.  \ud83e\udd2c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Text/Details and** [**Screenshots of Details from the Alexa App**](https://i.imgur.com/4I11wev.jpeg)**:**\n\nAlexa-to-Phone Contacts\n\nThese are the phone numbers you can make unlimited mobile and landline calls to.

  "I have Echo dots in 3 of the kids rooms, and two of the kiddos have a Fire Tablet HD 8 Kids. I setup their Freetime/Kids parental controls initially for their tablets to cut off at a certain time so they have a limit on screen time. Their tablets travel between my and their mom's house, so its nice to know they aren't being overused over there.  \n\nI recently setup their Echo devices under their same Kids profiles rather than default to mine. Unfortunately, the same cutoff times now apply as the tablets. Meaning at bedtime, they can't do things like use the Sleep Sounds skill, listen to music, or hear a story. (I could change the cutoff/bed time, but then they could use their tablet later.)\n\nI'm frustrated with with Amazon's one-size-fits-all parental controls. I dislike their poorly thought out constraints on the tablets especially. (No concept of an educational app like IXL vs a game.)\n\nI may see if there's another 3rd party option for the tablets so I could use their Amazon profiles just for the Echo devices. Or replace the tablets with android or apple at some point, but cost is a factor there.\n\nA clunky option I've yet to try is setup a new Kids profile for the Echo(s) dialed in how I want. Downfall of that is calling/communication won't work well as it's either one generic Amazon Kid account/contact or each child has two contacts now.\n\nAny other thoughts from parents in the same boat?\n\nEdit: Grammar and Title should read \"Is it possible...\"",

Or if it's linked/shared to my main Google account is that just too bad and I'm forever stuck having to see my parents dentist appointments and my sister's kids' daycare schedule?\n\nOne of my morning routines is set to read my calendar events, and right now it's reading *everyone's* events for that day.  I got the Spot for my desk at work specifically because it is a visual reminder of what's coming up on my calendar throughout the day, but I don't need to see all of my family's appointments all day in addition to my own.\n\nALSO, secondary, unrelated question:  Is it possible to have a task show up on the Alexa Spot screen, and then, just...stay there...until you mark it as completed or until you dismiss it?  I thought about setting a recurring alarm and just setting the volume to 0, but there's no way to \"name\" or label the alarms...which isn't particularly helpful if I need to mark a specific thing as being done at/around a specific time.  Suggestions?\n\nHALP!",

  "So my problem is this.\n\nI just set up a Google home system, with Google assistant in my phone, and one Nest mini device at home. Since I live in Finland (Finnish is not supported by Google home yet), I have to keep my phone's language in English, otherwise Google Assistant won't get the voice commands. The problem is that my wife and kid would also like to use the routines i have set up, but i can't assume they would also change their phones' language to English. And the routines won't work unless they install Google home apps in their phones, and change the whole phone's language to English.\n\nSo the question is, if I change my system to Alexa and get a Echo dot, am i still gonna have the same problem?

Unfortunately, when trying to do this with one of the kids' identities, it says that I can't select a child account.\n\nI saw that child voice profiles were supported as of September, so I'm not sure if this was exclusive to the \"Echo Kids\" product line, or if its been extended to the rest of the product families.

  "We have an Echo and early this year it just stopped working with Spotify (premium) properly. For example, It would tell me I couldn\u2019t play specific songs On Spotify and ask me if I wanted info about Amazon music instead. I trouble shot as much as I could with the Alexa app and my Spotify account and in the end decided the least amount of energy and effort would just be to Bluetooth from my phone.

I gave up and just turned the tv on for some BG noise instead. \n\nCame home from work this arvo and thought I\u2019d try to sort it out again. For some reason there was no Spotify option in my Alexa app on my phone despite Spotify still being my default music app and the echo was no longer linked. So I linked the echo and signed in and out of Spotify and reset it to default - first problem solved except now after re-linking the echo I have to go through the tutorial again because I still have no idea how to skip it (apparently I have to buy milk now). \n\nThen I try to voice command Alexa to play my daughters favourite song on Spotify and, hallelujah, She replies \u201cplaying Girl Like You by Maroon 5 ft. Cardi b on Spotify\u201d and we\u2019re all cheering. Until the wrong song starts playing. A look at the Alexa app tells me the \u201cGirls Like You Playlist\u201d is playing and it\u2019s full of songs that aren\u2019t the one we asked for. We try again using slightly different words \u201cplay Maroon 5, Girl Like you on Spotify\u201d and it starts playing a shuffle of Maroon 5 songs. Another try, again with different wording and it finally plays the song, but it\u2019s not the version we asked for and that turns out to be a playlist as well.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried so many different songs and it either plays the wrong song or it plays the right song but remixed or covered by another Artist.\n\nSo long story short, if you live in Brisbane, Australia, I have a charcoal Amazon Gen 2 Echo in good, clean condition for sale or swap for a Google Home/ Nest",

In fact I'm pretty sure they promised that. My wife and I are seriously thinking about disconnecting the eavesdropping little bastages.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this behavior?\n\n*\"The accordion\" reference is an inside family joke: when the kids were little my son grabbed his toy, functional accordion and used it to wake me up when I would fall asleep during the day.

  "My ex-wife and I divorced, sold the house, and each have our own place now.  Our kids split time with each of us.\n\nMy ex has an Echo registered to her, and I bought an Echo Show registered to me.  We are still in an Amazon household together, sharing Prime benefits.  \n\n \nIn my Alexa app, I can see her Echo, edit settings, etc.  I haven't asked yet, but I'm guessing she can see mine too.\n\nOn the Amazon website, under Manage Your Content and Devices, I do *not* see her device - only mine.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1.  When I announce to all devices, will it announce to hers too (same household, different account)?\n\n2.  Is there a way for us to separate our devices but still share Prime benefits?\n\n3.  If we do end up not being in the same Household anymore, would it be possible for her to still have the ability to call my Echo Show from her phone and video chat with the kids?  Would I just have to have her as a contact on my Show?\n\nThanks!",

The last two weeks there's a 50% chance the song will play.\n2. I have a series of alarms that play from a 1st Gen Echo Show through the day; today they stopped going off. I had to manually turn them off and on in the app to get them to reappear.\n\nOver the last few months I've noticed this kind of degradation in performance with Alexa as a whole across my many Echo devices, especially around routines and command recognition.

Alexa doesn\u2019t recognize the command \u201cset a reminder for every weekday **except** Wednesdays, so I have to set **four** identical reminders for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. \nAny way to maybe like check boxes for which days I want the reminders repeated? (My iPhone has this option for calendar events).\n\n2) Is there a Skill (I think that\u2019s what they\u2019re called) that works with iCal or with Outlook calendar?\n\n3) I have an Alexa in my office (let\u2019s call I A) and my kids have one in each of their rooms (B and C) I\u2019d like to have certain reminders be announced on A\nAnd B, as others on A and C. I don\u2019t need my kid\u2019s in room B being interrupted with room\u2019s C reminders but I\u2019d like all reminders to be announced on device A.

  "I received two Echo Dots (3rd gen) for free along with a Christmas gift this past year.  We are an Apple/Siri household so they\u2019ve been sitting unused for months until now...\n\nI\u2019d like to set these up in each of my kids\u2019 room (11 and 7), with the idea that I\u2019d like them to be able to ask Alexa to set an alarm, control some smart plugs in their rooms, access our Apple Music subscription, and for me to announce stuff to them (both individually and together).\n\nI don\u2019t have an Alexa device myself, just the app on my iPhone which I would use to set up the Dots, and use to drop in/send announcements.  Here are my questions:\n\nMy kids each have their own iPads (not phones).  Does it make sense for me to set everything up from my phone or should I set up each from the Alexa app on each of their iPads?\n\nI\u2019d like to be able to control each kid from dropping in on each other (likewise, I don\u2019t feel the need to \u201cdrop in\u201d on my kids, but I still would like to \u201cintercom\u201d back and forth if possible).  My main concern being my older kid being an ass and announcing at all hours and waking up my younger one.  I\u2019d also like to limit each kid from triggering scenes or turning smart devices on and off in each others\u2019 rooms...\n\nAm I going about this correctly?  Should I be doing different accounts/linking inside a household/having the Alexa app on each kid\u2019s iPad?  Being completely new to Alexa, skills, etc I\u2019m not sure the best way to do this and still maintain some control!  Thanks!",

In the past 2 weeks when I ask Alexa to \"Open Sleep Jar\", instead of her saying \"Okay, Here's Sleep Jar\",  I get responses like \"You don't need to sleep tonight\" or \"Just go to work tired\".  I have to repeat the command several times before it finally opens Sleep Jar.  I don't have any idea what is causing the snarkiness. \n\nAround the same time, she started telling me to \"Have a great morning\" or \"Have a relaxing evening\" when I turn lights on and off.  There are multiple variations of the things she says, and it covers various times of the day (morning, afternoon, evening, night, etc.)\n\nThoughts?",

  "I have a routine setup to play white noise from a skill when I say Alexa, bed time.  It works well for the most part but my issue is the the white noise screen stays up and I can no longer see the clock.  I want to add a step to the routine that sends me back to the home screen after the white noise starts.  I tried updating my command \"ask sleep jar for brown noise and go home\" but it doesn't work.

  "I just got a 3rd-gen Echo. I need it for white-noise when I sleep. However it seems (upon first glance at least) that Amazon Echo isn't great for this. From what I've read many skills have ads built in them, and will wake me up if I don't buy them. ok, fine.\n\n1. How do I purchase a subscription? I don't see the option anywhere in the skills page (on mobile or desktop) of the full description page of the skill.\n2. Even if I buy a subscription and have the premium service, will Alexa really still interrupt the skill in the middle of the night with other ads and suggestions as I've seen from other posts?\n3. When setting up a bedtime routine, I see I can select a specific \"enabled skill\" as an option, but I can't seem to figure out how to use a specific sound within that skill. For example I can select \"Sleep and Relaxation Sounds\" which has like 100+ different sounds, but I can't seem to tell Alexa which one to use (via the routine, NOT using voice commands). Am I missing something or does this functionality not exist?\n\nI really want to keep this device. I really want it to replace my Google Home Mini, as it sounds much better. But so far the routine builder seems underwhelming, especially coming from Amazon, the one who owns most of the smart speaker /assistant market. Right now I can just tell my Google Home Mini \"goodnight\" and it automatically adjusts volume and starts playing ambient noise without any \"piano notes\" tone, and no jarring half second of static that Alexa somehow uses. Does anyone have any suggestions? I'd prefer to not have to make a 200 song Spotify playlist of white noise tracks in order to achieve this, but if there's no other option I might try it.",
  "The last couple of days or so my Alexa just randomly starts rambling about different shit. Nothing said to her. No TV or anything on where she might accidentally think she has been triggered.

Trivia games, news, other crap. Perhaps some get pushed as a featured skill or something. Could see a few mistakes on my end, but no way 96.\n\nI see regular posts for Alexa inaccuracies, maybe something to look at for others.",
  "So I use the question of the day skill (I find it fun) as part of my good morning routine.

Heaven forbid I\u2019m right because then I get a bonus question, which she then asks in French too! Thankfully I understand French, but not as well as English! Nor do I wanna do any trivia in French !\n\nHas anyone else experienced Alexa switching languages in the middle of an interaction? If so, any advice?

[NPR Hourly News](https://www.amazon.com/NPR-Hourly-News-Summary/dp/B01K07MU64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) \u2014 Well-produced news with a US focus\n\n2. \n[BBC](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-BBC/dp/B01JHLI06S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487536887&sr=1-1&keywords=bbc) \u2014 Smart reporting on world news\n\n3. [Fox News](https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-Channel/dp/B01M5EIW2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) \u2014 Great production value, great news, but suffers from an annoyin ad in the middle.\n\n**The Hidden Gems** \u2014 The best Flash Briefings off the beaten path\n\n1. [Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day) \u2014 A sardonic host explains new words and gives highly entertaining ways of using them in a sentence; great production value, hilarious, and you'll learn some new words. Do yourself a favor and enable Word of the Day.\n\n2. [90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate) \u2014 Refershing Flash Breifing about the news; the host delivers a very short news summary with panache.  You definitely can't sleep through this news report.\n\n3. [Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up) \u2014 A short Flash Briefing that tells the story of startups; it's consistently solid, and, occassionally, it will give you a story you'll think about for the rest of the day.\n\n\nFor those of you who are on the lookout for more specific Flash Briefings, I've compiled all my reviews of Flash Briefings by topic below.  I generally put better Flash Briefings at the top of each category and the worse ones toward the bottom but there are a few places where I don't quite know how to order the Briefings, so don't take the ordering too seriously.  You'll likely notice a theme: The best Flash Briefings have a human host, do not run too long or too short, and do not have ads.  I also tend to prefer Flash Briefings that have a bit of personality \u2014 dry deliveries put me to sleep.\n\n***THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO FLASH BRIEFINGS***\n\n**General News**\n\n[NPR Hourly News](https://www.amazon.com/NPR-Hourly-News-Summary/dp/B01K07MU64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is one of the most consistently well produced Flash Briefings.  Clocking in at 5 minutes, the news summary is just long enough to be substantial and comprehensive, but not so long as to be annoying.  The mix between headline news and summaries is just right, and NPR has left the advertising out of the briefing.\n\n[BBC](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-BBC/dp/B01JHLI06S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487536887&sr=1-1&keywords=bbc)\n\nJust like NPR and Fox News, this Flash Briefing stands out as one of the most well produced.  However, what really sets the BBC apart from the other two is that the BBC covers different stories \u2014 often less US-centric stories.  If you have multiple US news Flash Briefings, the BBC can be very refreshing and introduce you to some news stories you haven't yet heard about.  I'd highly recommend it.\n\n[Fox News](https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-Channel/dp/B01M5EIW2D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is among the better news Flash Briefing skills.  You'll get a full view of US news from a human presenter.  The biggest problem is long, annoying ads they run.  BBC and NPR don't run ads and have similar content.  The other problem is the volume: it's all over the place.  The main host is significantly louder than the correspondents who speak with him.  That being said, it's only mildly distracting, especially compared to the ad.  In total, if you are trying to figure out which news Flash Briefings to use, give Fox News a shot.\n\n[90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate)\n\nA real human, Mike Pasca, reads 2 or 3 news stories with panache.  I really love how the presenter reads the stories; sometimes he'll say something like \"We've got two stories for you today \u2014 one that matters and one that does not.\"  You definitely won't sleep through this Flash Briefing.  There is an ad at the end, but it's the least annoying ad I've seen in a Flash Briefing so far.  Overall, I'd say give this Flash Briefing a try and see if it's for you.\n\n[theSkimm](https://www.amazon.com/theSkimm-Inc/dp/B01JM6TN8M/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537954&sr=1-1&keywords=theSkimm)\n\nFor those who don't know, theSkimm is a daily email that sends you a short news briefing.  This Flash Briefing just has Alexa read that email.  It's better than most Flash Briefings where Alexa reads the news, but it still is far from the best Flash Briefing.  I'd recommend passing on this as NPR and BBC are much better.\n\n[Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Quartz/dp/B01M278ZFA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538052&sr=1-1&keywords=quartz)\n\nAlexa reads the news.  The writing is actually pretty good, but without a human reading the news, it's not worth it.  There are tons of competitor that were a human host reads the news.\n \n[Refinery29: 8 Things You Need to Know This AM](https://www.amazon.com/Refinery29-Things-Need-Know-This/dp/B01JHR7TK0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537988&sr=1-1&keywords=refinery29)\n\nAlexa reads Refinery29 headlines.  It covers a wide swath of topics, from Health to LGBTQ News.  Refinery29 does not cover any of these stories in more than a sentence, so the Flash Briefing is short and uninformative.  My suggestion is that you should leave Refinery29 out of your morning routine.\n\n[BuzzFeed News](https://www.amazon.com/BuzzFeed-News/dp/B01MQR7Y5D/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538110&sr=1-1&keywords=buzzfeed)\n\nAlexa reads BuzzFeed headlines.  This is possibly the worst Flash Briefing made by a large company that I've seen.  Isn't BuzzFeed supposed to be better than the average media company at creating content for digital platforms?\n\n**Business News**\n\n[CNBC Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/NBCUniversal-CNBC-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01N7FH24X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis is the best business news Flash Briefing.  A real human reads the business news headlines with a short explanation.  Every day it covers interesting sales numbers, mergers, and trends.  The length of the Flash Briefing is about right.  I'd highly recommend adding this to your Flash Briefing.\n\n[Motley Fool Stock Watch](https://www.amazon.com/The-Motley-Fool-Stock-Watch/dp/B01KG5YXS8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538317&sr=1-1&keywords=motley+fool)\n\nThis is a very short interview with a stock expert on a recent topic.  I find it informative and very digestible \u2014 a good way to learn interesting tidbits about what's going on in different sectors of the economy and the stock market.\n\n[Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is just a short business story read by a human.  This generally isn't a headline story, so the stories are somewhat refreshing, and the delivery is pretty good. There are not that many good options for business news in the Amazon Skill store, so if you are in need of more business news, give Level Up a try.\n\n[Econoday U.S. Economic Flash Briefing](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-U-S-Economic-Flash-Briefing/dp/B01MEBW3T0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538474&sr=1-1&keywords=econoday)\n\nEconomic news read by Alexa.  It's too long, but it isn't one of those Flash Briefings that never end.  If you absolutely must have news about the Fed and stock market in your Flash Briefing, Econoday is for you.  However, it's not very good, so I'd say pass.\n\n[Econoday Global Market Update](https://www.amazon.com/Econoday-Global-Market-Update/dp/B01MDPRG23/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538529&sr=1-2&keywords=econoday)\n\nAlexa reads how the stock, money, and commodity markets changed since the last day and reports basic news.  I would not recommend this Flash Briefing to anyone who doesn't have a job in finance (and I wouldn't even recommend it to most financial professionals).\n\n[The Economist](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-The-Economist/dp/B01JHLMNWU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538580&sr=1-1&keywords=economist)\n\nDon't bother including this in your Flash Briefing.  This is just an entire Economist podcast, and it's not even a good podcast.\n\n**Tech News**\n\n[Daily Tech Headlines](https://www.amazon.com/DiamondClub-TV-Daily-Tech-Headlines/dp/B01M1B3K5U/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538726&sr=1-1&keywords=Daily+Tech+Headlines)\n\nThis is the best tech news Flash Briefing.  It covers a wide expanse of tech news in just the right amount of detail.  The host is human, concise, and clear.  The only issue with this Flash Briefing is there are too many stories in each Flash Briefing, especially if you're not a tech professional.  I'd like to see the makers of this Flash Briefing really cut down the length of their shows.  That being said, this is the best tech Flash Briefing I've found, so give it a try.\n\n[TechCruch](https://www.amazon.com/AOL-Inc-TechCrunch/dp/B01L6HQHGQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538760&sr=1-1&keywords=techcrunch)\n\nThis Flash Briefing is weird.  A bro reads tech news and talks about what a \"badass\" Elon Musk is (that's a real quote).  This bro-host tells a bunch of jokes that aren't all that funny but feel like a stereotype of jokes a Silicon Valley bro would tell.  This might be your type of humor, but it's certainly not mine.  I'd lightly recommend passing on it, but if off-beat, that's-so-random humor is your thing then give it a try.  However, most people seem to hate it.\n\n**Sports News**\n\n[CBS Sports Minute](https://www.amazon.com/CBS-Local-Sports-Minute/dp/B01M9FIFIK/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-3&keywords=sports)\n\nThis is best sports Flash Briefing I've found, but that's not saying much.  It covers one sports related story a day, and it doesn't report scores.  The host is very energetic, and the stories are interesting.  However, you probably won't get a full update on sports scores if that's what you're interested in.\n\n[ESPN SportsCenter Update](https://www.amazon.com/TuneIn-ESPN-Radio-via/dp/B01JHLKHQ4/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487534851&sr=1-2&keywords=sports)\n\nThis app has a terribly boring music intro that lasts 30 seconds.  Some reviewers have complained about the volume, but I haven't noticed an issue recently.  The news itself is pretty good; what you'd expect from SportsCenter.  There is an advertisement at the end that drags out.  It lasts about 3 minutes.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n[Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day)\n\nThis is my favorite \"hidden gem\" Flash Briefing.  Every day, the human host sardonically explains a word of the day and gives examples of how to use the word.  It's funny, smart, and a little irreverent.  The production quality is top notch, the length of the briefing is just right, and the entertaining examples of how to use the words make it pretty hard to forget the word.  The Flash Briefing is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\n[Discovery: DNews](https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Communications-DNews/dp/B01JHK5V6G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539512&sr=1-1&keywords=dnews)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has science news.  It's one moderately in-depth story a day, often about refreshing topics not covered by other news sites.  The audio is repurposed from YouTube videos, but you probably won't notice because the audio doesn't rely on the visuals.  I'd give it a try.\n\n[Complex News](https://www.amazon.com/Complex-News/dp/B01MXXXRLW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538966&sr=1-1&keywords=complex)\n\nThis is the best Flash Briefing for celebrity gossip. It covers just one story a day, but Complex does it in style. It's very punchy and energetic.  My guess is that it's repurposed video content, but I quite like it, and I am not one who typically enjoys celebrity news.  The entire briefing lasts about 2 minutes.\n\n[Top Reddit Posts Unofficial](https://www.amazon.com/Josh-Jones-Reddit-Posts-Unofficial/dp/B01MTWUMY6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539027&sr=1-1&keywords=top+reddit+post)\n\nThis Flash Briefing has Alexa read the top recent 5 Reddit posts.  More specifically, Alexa reads the title of the Reddit post and then 1 comment.  Normally, Flash Briefings that have Alexa read the news are terrible.  This one is a mild exception.  It's good, but it's certainly not great.\n\n[Harvard Business Review: Management Tip](https://www.amazon.com/Harvard-Business-Review-Management-Tip/dp/B01LQM9N8A/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539233&sr=1-1&keywords=harvard)\n\nI don't think that a Flash Briefing is the right place for a management tip.  I find that these tips are incredibly forgettable \u2014 these tips are ideas like \"reconsider how you measuring data.\"  That's not a particularly useful tip, and I can never remember the minutia of how HBR suggests implementing the tip.  However, I know some people love this type of management advice, so if this sounds like the Flash Briefing for you, it probably is.\n\n[eHow](https://www.amazon.com/Demand-Media-eHow/dp/B01M29BSFG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539070&sr=1-1&keywords=ehow)\n\nIf you want an update on what eHow has been publishing recently, then I have the Flash Briefing for you.  You'll learn some interesting and pointless things from this Flash Briefing, like the amount of calcium in chia seeds and your dog's separation anxiety.  I wouldn't add it to your Flash Briefing, unless you want to know useless trivia or what eHow's been publishing.\n\n[Pulse of the Planet](https://www.amazon.com/Pulse-of-the-Planet/dp/B01K0JWGSY/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539103&sr=1-1&keywords=pulse+of+the+planet)\n\nThis is a weird mix of nature sounds and general interest stories.  I'm not sure who this would appeal to, but it's certainly unique.  It's not too long, so it might make sense to try it out if general interest stories are your MO.\n\nTL;DR: Try [Word of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Peppercorn-Media-Word-the-Day/dp/B06VTHH5MW/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487539695&sr=1-3&keywords=word+of+the+day), [90 Seconds with Slate](https://www.amazon.com/The-Slate-Group-Seconds-with/dp/B01JHR8T68/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487537683&sr=1-1&keywords=slate), and [Level Up](https://www.amazon.com/Forbes-Media-LLC-Level-Up/dp/B01L7DFOEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1487538402&sr=1-1&keywords=level+up)",
  "I just got an Alexa for my birthday and found the Jeopardy J6 app.  \"Awesome!\" I thought, until I realized it gives the same 5 questions until the next day.  Does anyone know of a good trivia app that gives you more than that?\n\nThanks!",
  "With all the Xmas hype we keep seeing commercials for Alexa. We are thinking to get one, but which one? We have Amazon Prime. We're on our phones all the time looking up stuff, reading, and it's like trivia 24/7, us questioning everything! I'm not even sure what to get, Any helpful suggestions would be appreciated. We have Google Pixel phones, Comcast and smart TVs.\n",
  "From the looks of this api as a noob to it , I can see receiving JSON text for Alexia to speak. \n\nHowever if I wanted my trivia game to have sound effects or sound bytes as I would call them. could this be done interactively ?",
  "For a couple of days now my Alexas are having problems streaming. Anything on TuneIn has a 99% chance of not playing, as does the Radio Browser skill (which can use any supported audio stream online.) She responds \"Playing (name)\" and then does nothing. I checked my DNS query logs and see they're going through and being answered fine. Just to make sure it wasn't a speakers group issue I deleted them and remade them. Still doesn't work.\n\nAmazon Music works fine, Spotify works fine. Stuff like NPR radio (via its own skill) works fine. Nothing else seems to. Anyone else getting this?",
  "I\u2019ve currently got 3 echo devices, a 1st gen echo plus, a 3rd gen echo dot and a 1st gen echo show 5.\n\nUp until today they\u2019ve been working absolutely fine together. This morning however the echo plus was glowing red stating \u201cconnectivity issues\u201d. I restarted it and everything seemed fine.\n\nI then tried to play music using Spotify on my \u201ceverywhere\u201d group and nothing played. I opened Spotify and the group was missing, although all the devices were there individually.\n\nThe only group showing was one without the echo plus in it. I tested this by removing the plus from the \u201ceverywhere\u201d group and that group then appeared in Spotify, but then disappeared again when I re-added the device.\n\nThe even stranger thing is that the \u201ceverywhere\u201d group still works to play an internet radio station on all the speakers, just not Spotify.\n\nI\u2019m pulling my hair out trying to figure out what has changed so any help would be appreciated!",
  "When I stream a radio station, I could always tell it to stop. Now it says, \"I don't know how to do that\".  I tried a few suggestions I have read about, like \"hush\" or \"quit\" but they don't work. I have to shut the power off. I have had this for years, and the problem just started around a week ago. It just seems strange to have this problem just start like this. \n\nI am wondering if anyone else has this issue?",
  "Starting just this morning, NONE of my echo 5 radio alarms work anymore. I had an established alarm, but now it will only play the regular alarm tone. And when I set radio alarms on the other devices, even though the app says it will play the radio, it only plays the standard alarm tone. I haven't had these for long... maybe it's time for Google home?",
  "i have an echo dot and i really want my alarm to wake me up with the radio/music and not the alarm sounds alexa gives. whenever i try to create a routine for this the \u201cwhen\u201d is only ever a command, you can\u2019t seem to set it to a fixed time. any help?",
  "This morning my alexa was playing a relaxing dog music station and alongside the music porn started playing. I was wondering if I should be worried or if this is something someone likely did to the station. We have a closed Wi-Fi network. I'm going to check my router logs to see if any new devices connected recently as well. Can Alexa even play two audio sources at once?",
  "I have a routine which has been working just fine for a year or so. It just tunes my SHOW to a radio station at 6:45AM. But, recently the \"Tunein\" blub has been very loud. It would be nice to tell the device to fade in from 20% to 40% volume over the next 2 minutes. I think this can be done in an alarm, but I don't see how to cause an alarm to wake with a radio station. So, the only thing I can think of with the routine is to put a \"alexa set volume to 30%\" before the start radio command and then create a 2nd routine for 6:46 to set it to 40% and finally a 3rd for 6:47 to set to 40%. I'm sure I'm missing something :)",
  "If I say turn on disney plus she turns on disney radio. If I say HBO max she says did you mean HBO recommends? \n\nShe gets Netflix, YouTube, and prime video right though",
  "I have Alexa set a routine to play white noise radio on echo and sleep music on echo dot after about 1 hour it cuts off. Never happened before.",
  "Hi. I have several Echo Gen 4 Dots, all grouped together under the name Everywhere.\n\nIf I play a regular radio station, e.g., Bounce 99.5FM, on one Echo, it comes in via TuneIn.  I can easily have it play on all within the group by saying, \"Alexa, play Everywhere.\" There's a slight delay, then all Echoes play the selected station in sync.\n\nHowever, if I play a station from SiriusXM on one Echo, when I say, \"Alexa, play Everywhere.\", it reverts to the last TuneIn station I had playing before playing on all grouped Echoes.\n\nIf I change stations while it's playing all grouped Echoes, the new station will play on the Everywhere group.\n\nI just want to to be able to say, \"Alexa, play such-and-such Everywhere.\", and have it make it so, without having to go back and forth.\n\nAny suggestions?",
  "Setup.. In the house I have 3 5th Gen Echos with the clocks and one big Echo. They are all on the same account and in different rooms so no cross talk/messages. On one of them, Alexa (she) will not play anything from Amazon music it seems to just be defaulting to iheart radio. When I ask it to play (insert name) station or playlist she says she can\u2019t find Amazon music and plays iheart radio. All of the other devices do it just fine. It seems that this one device just isn\u2019t hooking up to my Amazon music account. I\u2019m going to try to kill the device from my account and reload it onto the account. I\u2019ve also from what I can tell completely disconnected the iheart radio skill from my account but this one device keeps connected to it. Anyone else seen anything like this?",
  "We added an Alexa Kids edition dot a few weeks ago to our girls room. We have a dot in our master bedroom, office, and an echo show 5 in the living room. \n\nThe kids edition will not play music such as The Wiggles or even open a radio station. \n\nThe office model used to work perfectly fine when asked to play anything, now when we ask it to play local radio stations or some bands, it says I cannot do that and plays something similar. \n\nThe master bedroom dot and echo show 5 work perfectly normally. \n\nI cannot find why this is an issue in the app. Do I need to start over?",
  "**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use a the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called \"Everywhere Turntable\" specifically for that purpose. Now I can use the \"Everywhere\" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue. Some comments claim to confirm the issue was fixed, but it most certainly was not.",

  "I am in the process of automating much of my farm using Alexa. One of the biggest time sucks in my life is turning electric fences on and off and opening and closing gates. I want to use Alexa for this but I don't want to have to pull my phone up and get the app open in order to give her commands. \n\nI've already figured out how to connect the fences gates etc to Alexa but is there any way I can use something like a walkie talkie to give Alexa commands while I am riding a truck/atv/4 wheeler? \n\nExample: As I'm moving from one pasture to another doing a fence inspection, I might need to issue the following commands:\n\"Alexa, turn off the electric fence in Pasture 2, turn on the electric fence in Pasture 1, open Gate 4 then close Gate 4 after a two minute delay\"\n\nI can build routines for this but I'd still like to be able to quickly issue commands via walkie talkie without having to stop driving. \n\nDoes any solution for this currently exist?",

  "So a special-built version of Alexa was installed in the Orion capsule that went around the moon and reportedly worked fine.  Since there were no humans on board this mission, spoken commands had to come from Houston and Alexa responses were send back down, with an overall delay of about 7 seconds or so (6 for the round trip radio signal).\n\nThis Alexa was *not* using Amazon's servers back on Earth (NASA did want this test to actually *work*), and all responses were generated within the capsule instead.\n\nFuture uses could be to verbally issue guidance commands for the capsule and to ask Alexa questions (\"Alexa, is there drinking water available on the moon?\" or \"Alexa, where the hell are we?\")\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/17/23325038/nasa-alexa-space-amazon-orion-callisto-hands-on-artemis-i](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/17/23325038/nasa-alexa-space-amazon-orion-callisto-hands-on-artemis-i)\n\nThis was reported earlier in the year:\n\n[https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/589806-alexa-is-going-to-the-moon-as-part-of-nasas-artemis-1-mission/](https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/589806-alexa-is-going-to-the-moon-as-part-of-nasas-artemis-1-mission/)",

I have to be very deliberate when I pronouce Pandora or Spotify.   Now I've dicovered another bias and I'm pretty sure it is Alexa and not the music servers.  When I tell her to play Pandora and she does, she only plays 2 or 3 songs before stopping.

  "Hi all,\n\nFor years I've asked my Alexa to play two radio stations - Clyde 1 and Forth 1 which are both owned by the same company and so both play through the same skill which I explicitly installed - ~~Global Player~~ Planet Radio.\n\nA  few days ago Forth 1 has started to play through TuneIn (Clyde 1 remains unchanged). When the station is played through TuneIn the stream is sped up slightly so everyones voice is a higher pitch and songs play faster, very annoying. It also after about 60 seconds seems to lose it's signal, it acts like an analog signal and just turns to static then nothing. You can ask Alexa to play the station again and it comes back but then loses the signal again after 60 seconds.\n\nI've never installed TuneIn and it is not in my list of skills on the app so I can't uninstall it. How the hell do I get rid of it!? It's driving me nuts!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: The skill is actually Planet Radio, not Global Player. I did manage to develop a work around thanks to the comments by using a routine. The Planet Radio skill does not support commands like \"Play Forth 1 on Planet Radio\" so I could not set up a routine with that skill. Another skill Radioplayer does however so now when I say \"Play Forth 1\" it uses my routine and plays the station in Radioplayer instead of the default TuneIn app.",

Play TuneIN radio station on my Surround system\n\n**Problem:** Two simple things. In the Alexa routine, it is 2min work to make such a routine but instead of playing radio on my AVR (Denon X6400H) over Bluetooth, Alexa plays radio on the Echo device.\n\n**Why:** I can't command in routine Alexa to connect to my AVR through Bluetooth. I can only command to turn on AVR but Alexa is still playing music through Echo.\n\n**Solutions that are not hitting the target:**\\- Before I go to sleep connect Eco to AVR over Bluetooth, so when Alexa does the routine AVR will be already connected.- Connect the Echo to a 3.5mm cable. - I want to connect Echo to AVR only when I want to or when routine wants to.- One funny solution which actually worked but only once (when I make a routine) is to put in a routine sentence that Alexa will say out loud (to herself) and trigger the procedure as: \"Alexa connect to Bluetooth speaker\". The funny thing is that when she says this she actually connects to AVR and then routine works. This happens only when the routine is triggered for the first time, after the first time Alexa is ignoring commends to her.\n\n**Do you have any solution for that?** I have been waiting for 3 years for amazon to add this possibility to routine, I was writing to amazon customer service searched infinitely for some user-friendly solution but haven't found any answer. To be honest, it is hard to believe that in this HiFi and smart things culture no one has such a problem, or it is even worse to think that users are bypassing this by buying and connecting additional echo just to solve this problem.\n\nI would appreciate any help.

However, the email is in spanish, and I do not speak spanish, never have except a few curse and miscellaneous words. Aaalso, the email is addressed to Solrac Szucs. You guessed it, it's not my name or the name of anyone I know. Acting on a damn impulse, I reset the password for coinbase account and try to log in. A pop-up comes up saying I've been sent a reset password link or something like that and to try again. Anyway, this is getting so damn freaky, I decide to completely delete the email I just made and uninstall the coinbase app. \n\n\nI googled the name Solrac Szucs and literally nothing of use is coming up. Seriously, not sure how this happened and if I hacked someone's account or if someone hacked me, but truly bizarre. Swearing I will not mess with this bitcoin stuff, I just want to forget this whole situation, turn off the internet on my phone and go get ready for bed.\n\n\nNow, onto the Alexa thing. Sorry for the long backstory as well. My partner and I go to the bed, which is on a gallery and a good three meters away from Alexa. In any case, we talk or play tv/radio the whole day usually, and Alexa never got triggered by any other sounds before, other than me saying \"Alexa\" and even then I sometimes need to repeat myself to get her started. As we're laying in the bed, we're chatting about the weird thing that happened this evening and wondering what in the heck was that. Suddenly, Alexa goes \"which number would you like to dial?\" And we both stop talking immediately, stunned and are just terrified. Alexa repeats the same question again and I immediately go \"Alexa shut the fuck up\", and she does. We unplugged her and haven't plugged her back in since last night because we think my weird coinbase situation might be connected and believe I was hacked. We also reset the router lol.\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this? Is it a glitch? Is it possible I got hacked? I can't wrap my head around it, but we're seriously creeped out by the events and not sure if it's a coincidence or what. Not sure what to do, but I'm on a verge of getting rid of the damn thing, changing the internet provider and selling my phone.\n\n\nTldr; messed with a crypto app, made new email for it. Crypto app saying there's already an account with that email. Trued to reset the coinbase account password, didn't work. Deleted the gmail and coinbase app. After two hours, without being prompted, Alexa asked which number to dial two times.  Alexa got brutally murdered by being unplugged asap and will not be coming back to life until further notice. Me - scared af.",
  "Until Thursday or Friday if I was listening to Spotify or my Amazon music or whatever on my Show and said \"Alexa, [play] iHeartRadio\", it would take me to the last station I listened to.

  "Yet another bug out of nowhere. I've got two Echos, and they're in a speaker group together so I can listen to radio/music across rooms as I move around and do stuff.\n\nThe other day, this functionality ceased to work. If I ask her to play (content) on \"Everywhere\" (my speaker group name), she responds like normal, \"Playing (content) on Everywhere\", but only the kitchen Echo plays. The living room one remains silent.\n\nIf I ask the kitchen Echo to do the same, she responds but nothing plays on either.\n\nI've reset the speaker groups, I've made sure they're saved correctly, nothing fixes it, so I'm assuming it's yet another glitch on Amazon's end.\n\nRelated to this, if I ask for any content to play (without using speaker groups), most of the time the kitchen one will play, even if it's the living room Echo that takes the command and processes it. I have to specify \"Play (content) on living room\" to reliably get it to play there.",

E .O .X. O. R. it says the same weird Pixels thing. Ok, why not just play a song by them (which for some reason asking Alexa to play music, popular music, or shuffle music by them, those all work just fine, just not recently added music) and then ask Alexa to \"play recently added music by this artist\" THEN it says \"as above, so below radio from Pandora.\" What the heck?! That sound nothing like it! And just like the Pixels thing it says this no matter how you word it. If you tell Alexa to play the name of all of their recent songs individually by name, those all work, so what's the problem?

  "Alexa can't dial 911?  For what is essentially a household communications device, to me it seems like an obvious need that should be filled.  The issue of a false launch from a TV or radio in the background could easily be handled with a 2-factor authorization.\n\nA loud Beep occurs, and Alexa says, \"I have been asked to connect with 911, are you certain this is what you want?\"  After a 30 second (or whatever length of time) without a response, a loud beep sounds again, and the 911 call is made.  Better a slowed down call, than no call in my opinion.",
  "Happy Holidays everyone. Hope everyone is making the most of, well, whatever this year is and brings. One thing it's bringing to me is the free time to tinker with my Christmas light set up and have so far now converted all my lights to some sort of smart switch/plug/light.\n\nThis gave me an idea and let me do something I thought was pretty cool, but... could be better. I set a routine so that when I say \"It's Christmas time\", Alexa responds by saying \"then let's make it feel like it\"! And then proceeds to turn on ALL of our Christmas lights inside and out (save for the little individual knick-knacks and whatnot). The cherry on top is after all the lights turn on, the Christmas music hits radio station starts playing in every room in the house!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow once I get the Christmas tree, and we get it decorated, I will make sure to throw the tree on a smart switch as well. And I am sure I will add a few more things outside purely because I have a couple of free smart outlets available on the strip. But one thing I have been thinking about, and looking into, but haven't really been able to find an answer or success is;\n\nI just got a brand new 65\" LG nano cell tv (with the LG smart app support AND its also connected to a harmony hub), and also have a Samsung smart tv in my office (connected to an Xbox and smartthings hub), and the bedroom TV that has a firestick. \n\nThe big one would be the living room 65\" LG, but my ideal goal would be this: When I run that routine, all the Xmas lights come on, dim the house lights, the Xmas music starts playing, and then the tv turns on and automatically flips straight to the UHD 4k Fireplace stream. Just that little extra touch that I think would really add to the experience. \n\nMy entire house is full of hue bulbs, and I've never once felt the need to buy/own the colored bulbs. But I am also very tempted to get a couple of the bulbs for the front and back porch lights, so I can see them as green or red? \n\nSo team, any thoughts on how I might be able to include launching that specific video/movie or whatever in my routine? I know Netflix has some good 4K fireplace videos. Youtube does too. I should have access to most all the streaming platforms so whatever would work. I feel like I should be able to set a Harmony Hub scene that does it but can't figure out how to choose a specific show or channel. \n\nThanks in advance!! Also, if anyone else has any good Christmas theme type smart home ideas, please let me hear them!!!!! Maybe like I could rig up a snowblower to turn on and frost the house when the routine runs? ;)",

  "I got an Amazon Echo for Christmas 2018. For the past two years I have used it as an alarm set to a radio station through tunein. I set it with the command, \"Alexa, wake me up at [time] to [radio station].\" It has worked consistently for two years: the echo starts playing the radio station at the requested time, and will continue to play for an hour if I don't stop or snooze. As of last week this has changed: about 30 seconds after the radio station starts playing, a chime/alarm begins sounding (sort of a musical \"doodly-doodly-do, doodly-doodly-do\"). Asking Alexa to \"stop\" turns off the chime but also the radio station. This has disrupted my morning routine and made me very confused and grumpy at the start of every day.

  "Hi. I have several Echo Gen 4 Dots, all grouped together under the name Everywhere.\n\nIf I play a regular radio station, e.g., Bounce 99.5FM, on one Echo, it comes in via TuneIn.  I can easily have it play on all within the group by saying, \"Alexa, play Everywhere.\" There's a slight delay, then all Echoes play the selected station in sync.\n\nHowever, if I play a station from SiriusXM on one Echo, when I say, \"Alexa, play Everywhere.\", it reverts to the last TuneIn station I had playing before playing on all grouped Echoes.\n\nIf I change stations while it's playing all grouped Echoes, the new station will play on the Everywhere group.\n\nI just want to to be able to say, \"Alexa, play such-and-such Everywhere.\", and have it make it so, without having to go back and forth.\n\nAny suggestions?",
  "Setup.. In the house I have 3 5th Gen Echos with the clocks and one big Echo. They are all on the same account and in different rooms so no cross talk/messages. On one of them, Alexa (she) will not play anything from Amazon music it seems to just be defaulting to iheart radio. When I ask it to play (insert name) station or playlist she says she can\u2019t find Amazon music and plays iheart radio. All of the other devices do it just fine. It seems that this one device just isn\u2019t hooking up to my Amazon music account. I\u2019m going to try to kill the device from my account and reload it onto the account. I\u2019ve also from what I can tell completely disconnected the iheart radio skill from my account but this one device keeps connected to it. Anyone else seen anything like this?",
  "We added an Alexa Kids edition dot a few weeks ago to our girls room. We have a dot in our master bedroom, office, and an echo show 5 in the living room. \n\nThe kids edition will not play music such as The Wiggles or even open a radio station. \n\nThe office model used to work perfectly fine when asked to play anything, now when we ask it to play local radio stations or some bands, it says I cannot do that and plays something similar. \n\nThe master bedroom dot and echo show 5 work perfectly normally. \n\nI cannot find why this is an issue in the app. Do I need to start over?",
  "**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use a the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called \"Everywhere Turntable\" specifically for that purpose. Now I can use the \"Everywhere\" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue. Some comments claim to confirm the issue was fixed, but it most certainly was not.",

  "I have an Alexa in pretty much every room and my house is highly automated.  I recently noticed that when I ask Alexa to play music on Pandora or Spotify, she instead plays the same station from Prime Music (i.e. play ZZtop radio on Pandora ends up as ZZTop radio on Prime).  I have to be very deliberate when I pronouce Pandora or Spotify.   Now I've dicovered another bias and I'm pretty sure it is Alexa and not the music servers.  When I tell her to play Pandora and she does, she only plays 2 or 3 songs before stopping.  Yes, I'm aware of the \"are you there?\"  things that the streaming services do after an hour or so, but this is not that.  A song ends and nothing else happens until I tell Alexa to resume playing.  If I let Alexa play a station from Prime, it will play without stopping.    Has anybody else noticed this?",

OR...even though the song is in my library and I've purchased it...she's asking me to buy the 8.99 subscription plan. \n\nI have no clue at this point what I'm even paying for, amazon music wise.

  "Hi all,\n\nFor years I've asked my Alexa to play two radio stations - Clyde 1 and Forth 1 which are both owned by the same company and so both play through the same skill which I explicitly installed - ~~Global Player~~ Planet Radio.\n\nA  few days ago Forth 1 has started to play through TuneIn (Clyde 1 remains unchanged). When the station is played through TuneIn the stream is sped up slightly so everyones voice is a higher pitch and songs play faster, very annoying. It also after about 60 seconds seems to lose it's signal, it acts like an analog signal and just turns to static then nothing. You can ask Alexa to play the station again and it comes back but then loses the signal again after 60 seconds.\n\nI've never installed TuneIn and it is not in my list of skills on the app so I can't uninstall it. How the hell do I get rid of it!? It's driving me nuts!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: The skill is actually Planet Radio, not Global Player. I did manage to develop a work around thanks to the comments by using a routine. The Planet Radio skill does not support commands like \"Play Forth 1 on Planet Radio\" so I could not set up a routine with that skill. Another skill Radioplayer does however so now when I say \"Play Forth 1\" it uses my routine and plays the station in Radioplayer instead of the default TuneIn app.",

Play TuneIN radio station on my Surround system\n\n**Problem:** Two simple things. In the Alexa routine, it is 2min work to make such a routine but instead of playing radio on my AVR (Denon X6400H) over Bluetooth, Alexa plays radio on the Echo device.\n\n**Why:** I can't command in routine Alexa to connect to my AVR through Bluetooth. I can only command to turn on AVR but Alexa is still playing music through Echo.\n\n**Solutions that are not hitting the target:**\\- Before I go to sleep connect Eco to AVR over Bluetooth, so when Alexa does the routine AVR will be already connected.- Connect the Echo to a 3.5mm cable. - I want to connect Echo to AVR only when I want to or when routine wants to.- One funny solution which actually worked but only once (when I make a routine) is to put in a routine sentence that Alexa will say out loud (to herself) and trigger the procedure as: \"Alexa connect to Bluetooth speaker\". The funny thing is that when she says this she actually connects to AVR and then routine works. This happens only when the routine is triggered for the first time, after the first time Alexa is ignoring commends to her.\n\n**Do you have any solution for that?** I have been waiting for 3 years for amazon to add this possibility to routine, I was writing to amazon customer service searched infinitely for some user-friendly solution but haven't found any answer. To be honest, it is hard to believe that in this HiFi and smart things culture no one has such a problem, or it is even worse to think that users are bypassing this by buying and connecting additional echo just to solve this problem.\n\nI would appreciate any help.

A few weeks ago the living room echo dot stopped behaving, and now responds to the identical request with \"CBC music Edmonton from TuneIn\" and starts playing that station instead. The recording history correctly shows that I asked for Toronto, yet Alexa responds with Edmonton. Today I came downstairs and gave the identical command to another echo dot. This time Alexa says \"CBC radio 1 Sudbury from TuneIn\" and plays that news station. Every single time.\n\nSimilarly, if I tell the echo show to play whatever song \"on the everywhere group\" she usually does so, but when I give the same commands from other echo devices it's hit or miss whether she actually plays on the multi room music group or just the one device.\n\nThese commands all used to work as intended a few months ago. I can't link the change in behaviour to any event or new equipment.\n\nI've checked, and every device has the latest software version.

  "Happy Holidays everyone. Hope everyone is making the most of, well, whatever this year is and brings. One thing it's bringing to me is the free time to tinker with my Christmas light set up and have so far now converted all my lights to some sort of smart switch/plug/light.\n\nThis gave me an idea and let me do something I thought was pretty cool, but... could be better. I set a routine so that when I say \"It's Christmas time\", Alexa responds by saying \"then let's make it feel like it\"! And then proceeds to turn on ALL of our Christmas lights inside and out (save for the little individual knick-knacks and whatnot). The cherry on top is after all the lights turn on, the Christmas music hits radio station starts playing in every room in the house!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow once I get the Christmas tree, and we get it decorated, I will make sure to throw the tree on a smart switch as well. And I am sure I will add a few more things outside purely because I have a couple of free smart outlets available on the strip. But one thing I have been thinking about, and looking into, but haven't really been able to find an answer or success is;\n\nI just got a brand new 65\" LG nano cell tv (with the LG smart app support AND its also connected to a harmony hub), and also have a Samsung smart tv in my office (connected to an Xbox and smartthings hub), and the bedroom TV that has a firestick. \n\nThe big one would be the living room 65\" LG, but my ideal goal would be this: When I run that routine, all the Xmas lights come on, dim the house lights, the Xmas music starts playing, and then the tv turns on and automatically flips straight to the UHD 4k Fireplace stream. Just that little extra touch that I think would really add to the experience. \n\nMy entire house is full of hue bulbs, and I've never once felt the need to buy/own the colored bulbs. But I am also very tempted to get a couple of the bulbs for the front and back porch lights, so I can see them as green or red? \n\nSo team, any thoughts on how I might be able to include launching that specific video/movie or whatever in my routine? I know Netflix has some good 4K fireplace videos. Youtube does too. I should have access to most all the streaming platforms so whatever would work. I feel like I should be able to set a Harmony Hub scene that does it but can't figure out how to choose a specific show or channel. \n\nThanks in advance!! Also, if anyone else has any good Christmas theme type smart home ideas, please let me hear them!!!!! Maybe like I could rig up a snowblower to turn on and frost the house when the routine runs? ;)",

  "Hi all,\n\nAnnoying problem that started last week.  Have a Pandora station I have used with Alexa for years.  \"Alexa, play J-Pop Radio on Pandora\".  It goes to my linked Pandora account and plays my station.\n\nSince last week it refuses to play this station from voice command.  It alternatively plays a Justin Timberlake and other pop artist stations, or a couple of other pop stations.\n\nI go in, delete these new stations from Pandora's collection, but it Alexa keeps adding them back.  \n\nFirst World Problems, I know.  But it's really irritating.  Is there a way to map a specific station to an Alexa routine?  I tried naming my station directly in a routine but it still picks a random pop station.\n\nThanks",

  "Lately Alexa has been defaulting music and radio station commands to my Xbox instead of the device where I am making the request. Instead of playing the radio station or song from Spotify on the Echo or Dot, she tries to open it on my Xbox even though Spotify is not installed on it.

Again, Ring alarm was not activated. \n\nBoth times, I dropped in on my echo spot, and no smoke. \n\nWe have a chimney, so I thought maybe a gust of wind blew in some smoke smell.

  "I ran into an issue with TuneIn recently (a variant on the usual \"there's similarly named stations and Alexa refuses to play the one I want\") and it occurred to me that if TuneIn would assign a unique numeric ID to each station as an alternative way of specifying the station, it would provide a workaround for all of these type of cases.\n\nI contacted TuneIn support and got a CSR who replied to every email very quickly but I could not explain myself well enough to get anything but a \"I'm sorry, we can't change the name of a station for you. The station would have to request that change.\"\n\nI tried contacting Amazon support (since TuneIn integration is built into the product), but they said \"contact TuneIn support\".\n\nSo I'm looking for a better way to get the feature request to TuneIn's dev team.

This has happened numerous times, always the same episode from a month ago, and it doesn\u2019t actually play it.\n\n- I will ask it to play a song, even one that I own in my amazon library, or available through apple music which I have a subscription to (and enabled as my default service in the app) and it will say it is only available through an Amazon music subscription.\n\n- I will ask it to play a song and it will say the song then just not play it.\n\n- Sometimes I will be streaming a radio station on the Sonos and it will just stop playing randomly.\n\nOther weird things have happened but those are the most recurring.\n\nDo I need to reset something?

The thing is because of where my home is and how it is situated my temp here can be different enough.  So is there an outdoor thermometer that is Alexa enabled?  When I did some searches I found plenty of weather stations that were not Alexa enabled, several indoor only ones that were Alexa enabled, and some that said they had the capability but also seemed to indicate they did a lot of other things and weren't very expensive which to me is a big red flag.  So is there anything people have used that will tell you what the weather is like outside and have it integrate with Alexa so I can simply ask for the temp and know it is accurate for outside of my home?",

  "*Edit - Issue solved with factory-reset on the misbehaving unit.\n\nWe have a few Alexa/Echo stations around the house (including Dot, Studio, and this one Echo Show), and everything usually works fine. The Echo Show is in the kitchen, and over the last few days it's started to say \"Sorry, something went wrong!\" as soon as anyone says \"Alexa!\" but before finishing the request. It will interrupt me and talk over me to say this \"Sorry...\" statement. \n\nWe have a station in almost every room, and one of the other stations will usually hear the request at the same time and respond accordingly. Even when I'm in the living room and ask Alexa for something, the I can hear the kitchen station say \"Sorry, something went wrong!\" from the other room, while the living room station completes the request. \n\nFor example, say I want to play music. I would ordinarily say \"Alexa, play music by Weird Al Yankovic\" and Alexa would say something along the lines of \"Here's a playlist of Weird Al music that I think you'll enjoy!\" and then proceed to play the music. Now I'll say \"Alexa...\" (kitchen station interrupts to say \"Sorry, something went wrong!\", but I keep talking...), \"Play music by Weird Al\", and the other Echo station (living room, etc.), will fulfill the request as usual. \n\nThe kitchen Echo Show WILL actually output the music with the rest of the stations, but doesn't interact properly with the commands. \n\nSorry if this is a bit of a confusing explanation, but please let me know if you have experienced anything like this and/or know what I can do about it. We've tried unplugging the Show and letting it rest without power for a while, but have stopped short of doing a factory reset to try and see if there are other options before having to re-link everything. \n\nThanks!",

I can understand that the playlist might have ended, but even if I select the playlist on my phone and send it to the Dot, also clicking the *Shuffle* button (isn't that the button with two arrow that criss-cross?), it seems to stop after a while.  Shouldn't the shuffle option make the music continuous?  Or does it play each track once and then stop?  \n\nSide-question: The button in Amazon Music that's just an arrow going in a circle\u2014I'm assuming that just repeats the current track over and over?  \n\nI've had better luck tuning in radio stations, or sometimes online stations (such as those available through Amazon Music), but sometimes even the Amazon Music stations will stop. In fact, the only time I can remember waking up in the morning with music still playing was when I tuned in a local classical music station.  \n\nIs there some voice command I should be giving Alexa? Like, \"Alexa, repeat this playlist until 6 AM?\" or something like that?  \n\nAny and all advice is appreciated.  Thanks!",
  "Curious if anyone might have an idea.  I logged into my Alexa app on my iPhone today to manually change the music station.  When I hit play it gave me an option to play from a fire stick TV.

  "Hey all. I have pondered this for many a times and have not come up with any answers. I spoke with Amazon directly they basically tell me that I cannot do what I want to accomplish. I figured this is the best place for advice at this point.\n\nMy setup is as follows. I have many echo devices. An echo dot in my daughters room, her makeup room, and one in our kids' game/tv room. I also have an echo dot in my basement, connected to an amp that allows me to stream music from my phone/spotify acct to my outdoor speakers. My son has a Echo Show 5 in his bedroom, I have an echo show 5 in the kitchen, and we also have an older Echo speaker in our bedroom. I have all this connected to my smart home which is controlled through my phone with Apple Homekit and voice control using Alexa.\n\nOverall we have 5 people in our house. I have profiles setup for myself and my wife however I am unable to include my kids into the mix. The main issue lies in music... Currently all the echos are under my profile however if I'm listening to my spotify account ( say in my car) and my kids want to listen to music at home, then it disconnects me and switches the music to their echo station. I pay for the family spotify premium so I need to allow my echos attach to different accounts.\n\nIs there a way to accomplish all this and keep the ecosystem under my main profile or do I need to opening separate amazon accounts for my wife and kids, and set their echos up separately under their usernames. And if so, how can I be the main controller of all the devices since they are all under my house?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for all your help",

  "Bunnings, our local hardware joint, had the Alexa and Google units for sale at $36, so I bought an Alexa, came home and set it up reasonably quickly, and got my lights working with it, Spotify and our local FM stations playing from it and pretty much enjoying the experience overall.\n\nBut then I realised I needed another unit for my bedroom, so living alone (OK I have a cat and a dog) I didn't need Alexa's intercom option, so went for the Google Home Mini.\n\nI found it much harder to set up, and at times was left scratching my head on where to add new devices. On the Alexa app it was all right in front of me, but I had to hunt for the option with Google.\n\nI still feel that the options on the Google unit were somewhat limited too.\n\nWhen I was trying to decide which unit to buy, I was very fifty fifty, but what tipped the scales for me was that I felt that saying \"Alexa\" was going to be easier to say, \"OK Google\" makes me feel like I've got a mouthful of marbles, I plan to try changing it to \"Computer\" soon. (or Alexa).\n\nIf you're thinking of buying one of these units and you consider yourself less tech savvy than other people appear to be, I'd quite honestly choose the Alexa over Google.",

  "I have been watching Smart Home Solver YouTube channel for inspirations! \n\nHere\u2019re the few automations I have done:\n\n1. when I enter the house, Alexa will recognize it\u2019s me who\u2019s entering (through my location and face recognition) and give me a personalized welcome message. Turn the lounge lights on, turns the entertainment system (TV, PlayStation and sound system) and plays my top 2019 Spotify playlist. \n\nIf it\u2019s not me who\u2019s entering (property manager/maintenance person), it won\u2019t do anything I mentioned above but... give me a notification on my watch and phone to let me know there\u2019s someone and asks me whether I want to view the security cam. \n\n2. When my partner or I get up late at night to use the restroom, the light strips under my bed will detect motion and light up the strips to like 20% so you can find your way to the restroom without waking up the other person or struggle to find where the light switches are. \n\n3. Smart lights understand my behavior and when I\u2019m out of town, the lights will mimic my presence exactly the way I use it. So it doesn\u2019t all turn on like at 6 PM and turn off at midnight. So it\u2019s pretty cool. \n\n4.

  "This happened yesterday: I wanted to listen to SomaFM's \"Xmas in Frisko\" channel (if you like non-tradition and possibly offensive holiday music, you'll love it), so I asked Alexa to play it. I pronounced it \"xmas\" because that's how it's spelled, and also how they pronounce it on station IDs. Alexa successfully found the station (after a couple attempts at the right syntax - what finally worked was \"Alexa, open SomaFM\" and then \"Play Xmas in Frisko\"), but she responded \"OK, playing Christmas in Frisko on SomaFM\" (and on failed attempts, she said she couldn't find \"Christmas in Frisko\").\n\nSo, apparently, when she hears \"xmas\", she maps it to \"christmas\", and while searching, \"xmas\" will match \"christmas\", but she always says \"christmas\" and never \"xmas\", regardless of how I say it or how it is spelled on the found resource.\n\nOne might imagine a conspiracy or agenda to \"put the Christ back in Xmas\", but more likely it's just doing it to improve success at responding to christmas/xmas related requests. Anyhow, I found it mostly amusing, yet slightly irritating.",

  "Hi,\n\nI am setting up my Smart Home having recently moved into a new property and thought perhaps Alexa would be a good way forward to become the primary voice assistance, after days of trying I've come to the conclusion that while the Echo devices are in general pretty good and have lots of skills and great integration with Home Assistant (with Alexa Media Player) that for natural voice control Alexa just doesn't cut it and for this I just don't want to compromise.\n\nWhat I have found is that for some crazy reason and even through Alexa knows she is in a specific room (or Group) with a set of named devices that there is no logic check that if I request a device with a device that has the same name elsewhere inside and outside of that group Alexa can't handle it and will flip flop between switching that device or the other... its crazy and very frustrating.\n\nHere is the setup:-\n\n**Group: Living Room**  \nLiving Room Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nTable Lamp  \nFloor Lamp  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both lamps above passed through from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Hall**  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Master Bedroom**  \nMaster Bedroom Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nBedside Lamp 1  \nBedside Lamp 2  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both bedside lamps passed from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Bedroom 2**  \nBedroom 2 Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \n*Lamp*  \nPlay Right (hue lights)  \nPlay Left (hue lights)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Landing**  \n*Lamp*\n\nHere is what happens:-\n\n**Lamps example**  \nI know that currently Alexa can't distinguish between Light and Lamps say either one and all the lights come on in the room, so to get round that have a specific lamps device that is a light group exposed to Alexa from Home Assistant.\n\nSo I walk into the Master Bedroom and I say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and she turns on the lamps because there is a light in the Master Bedroom called lamps... great it works there, I turn the lamps off with the command... it works. Next I go downstairs into the Living Room and say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and the lamps don't come on and its like nothing has happened BUT actually it has cause shes actually turned on the lamps in the Master Bedroom with that command despite it being requested from the Echo in the living room group which also has a device called lamps. \n\nNow within the Living Room say \"Alexa turn on the Living Room lamps\" and the lamps come on, why does it need Living Room Lamps, she knows she is in the living room group.\n\n**TV Example**\n\nExactly the same scenario above but with TV, I say in the Master Bedroom \"Alexa turn on the TV\" but nothing happens in the Master Bedroom but it does in the Living Room cause she's turned on the TV in there. If I stay in the Master Bedroom and say \"Alexa, turn on the Master Bedroom TV\" it works fine calling that specific group for that specific device.\n\n**What I tried**\n\nResetting Alexa, Deleting All Devices from the APP and the Alexa website, renaming all devices so they would be unique enough (Master Bedroom TV, Master Bedroom Lamps etc) and no matter what I've tried I run into an issue. \n\n**My Conclusion**\n\nOf course course I could name things like Table Lamp, Floor Lamp 1, Floor Lamp 2 which is fine to control individually and that works but if your a guest or if you don't know the house then you need to know what that these commands are and then it requires three voice commands or more, then another three to dim those lights because I can't just ask Alexa to set the lamps to 50% so she controls that light group from Home Assistant.\n\nIf you want natural voice control that is going to be intuitive to people that interact with Alexa it seems thats not possible.\n\nGroups seem somewhat pointless and to be able to put Alexa into that group so she is group aware if the logic is to first look at all of the devices attached outside of the group first and then just action on that first device with that name rather than staying within the group first and controlling that device and only going outside of it when a specific group device is called.. from the Master Bedroom.. Alexa turn off the Living Room lamps.\n\nI can then only imagine this getting worse the more devices that are added.\n\nI like the echo speakers and the integration with Home Assistant but if such a simple thing can't work then its out, I have been testing with HomePod Minis too and with this same setup in HomeKit and it seems to work exactly as expected one voice command for Lights, Lamps and controlling them in the room I am requesting them for.\n\nIts a shame I have to return my 5 Echos as I had some good automations and TTS setup with them and actionable notifications but they where primarily for voice control and Alexa has failed to integrate on this occasion.",

  "First of all, who has a landline phone any more? Most of the people that think they have one, don't, they have VOIP, which is not the same thing. But not many people I know even have those. I ditched anything but a cell phone back in 2011. I never got why anyone would want to pay for two phones. Apparently Alexa *can* make that call if you have 911 in your trusted contacts list on your phone, but then it only works if the screen is unlocked and the app is open. Which makes next to no sense. Most people don't leave their screen open, or apps they're not using running. \n\nIt's sad, because it *could* be that much better if it could do things like that. Another great feature would be to only accept voice commands from recognized users. This way let's say you're the victim of a home invasion you could tell Alexa to make that 911 call, assuming it worked without the extra steps, and even if someone else tried to cancel that call or unplug Alexa, neither would work. \n\nWhen my wife and I eventually buy a house I plan to get some sort of home security system beyond things like Blink cameras, Ring, etc, but it'd be nice to have that little extra help if it's needed.",

  "**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use a the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called \"Everywhere Turntable\" specifically for that purpose. Now I can use the \"Everywhere\" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue. Some comments claim to confirm the issue was fixed, but it most certainly was not.",

  "Alexa has been getting worse and worse. It has been so great in years past but constantly running into issues now.

It\u2019s always related to third party like ADT, Hue, Feit, etc. This update was the latest and exactly when things stopped working.\n\nI reached out to ADT and they assured me there are no outages etc. ADT Control App updated three weeks ago in mid, November. Since that ADT Control App update there have been no issues. \n\nThe short of the issue is that the Alexa App updated five days ago which has killed the ADT Control Skill. I am able to arm stay, arm away, and disarm via Alexa or the ADT App itself.\n\nThe issue arises when you are arming or disarming in relation to routines tied to the skill.\n\n-Alexa Arm Stay or ADT Control App set to Arm Stay.\n-Security Panel Arms\n-Routines however do not kickoff once armed/disarmed.\n-Lights don\u2019t turn off, doors don\u2019t lock, thermostat doesn\u2019t set etc.\n\nI have done everything.

  "So I bought a 2nd Alexa Dot (5th Generation) for another room. The distance between the 2 devices are 3 metres.

I sometimes play songs off my phone though and I can connect to both speakers via bluetooth simultaneously but the music (Samsung Music App) will only ever come out of one speaker. I don't want to bring the speakers closer (I know this might be one solution) because that defeats the purpose of buying the second Dot. I like that I don't have to yell and I have my living room and bedroom now connected.\n\nDoes anyone know how to get audio playing from a phone to both  Alexa Dot speakers simultaneously?\n\nEDIT UPDATE 1: I figured it out. I had slide down on my phone and click media output, then click the second speaker.

Now, if I buy a 3rd Alex Dot can I run 3 speaks off my phone...?\n\nEDIT UPDATE 2: They call it Samsung Dual Audio for reason.

This detail is important. I have daily routines set up for my kids to tell them to clean up their things and then another 30 minutes later to go brush their teeth and get ready for bed. While on the line with 911 a freaking reminder kicks off and interrupted the call. So was trying to do the heimlich and hear what the operator is saying while Alexa is telling my kids it\u2019s bedtime. Seconds matter in these scenarios. Thankfully we were finally able to clear his airway, but it wasn\u2019t looking great for a minute. \n\nI started a chat with Amazon customer service to see if something can be done or if my device was faulty. He said to add 911 as an emergency contact and that shouldn\u2019t happen. When I asked for help with that it turned out it couldn\u2019t be done. He said he would submit it as feedback and I could continuously check the Amazon website to see if this has been fixed. I would not receive notification that my issue had been resolved. So I called customer service instead. \n\nThe next guy I spoke with gave me a few more options. He said I could simply disable all of my routines. Boom. Problem solved. Well, I kind of like that feature. I mean that really eliminates some of the basic features. Then he suggested I go look for my phone and call 911 from that next time. He said to be sure I\u2019m always from the device or turn it down. That way my call won\u2019t get interrupted. *Really??* He was literally inches from the device. It was the closest thing capable of calling emergency services. Don\u2019t worry. I was also offered the solution of not calling 911 or to have the emergency outside of my scheduled routines. Not helpful either. It gets better. Finally, he argued with me that my device couldn\u2019t even call 911. It\u2019s not a feature that you can use. He said it couldn\u2019t connect to government numbers. I explained that I just did, and it was in fact the second time I had done so. It was actually a feature that I really appreciated given the fact I\u2019ve had to call 911 three times in the past few months. He had control of my device and I showed him the voice history proving myself right. He hung up on me.\n\nSo here we are. Is this something that is specific to my device?

Using the Alexa app I could go to the light under devices and control it with no problem. \n\nHere is the weird part. I have routines that set scenes with all my hue lights. My non hue I have added into the routine to get appropriate color/brightness. Used these routines for a couple years with no issue. \n\nI added new lights into routine. Set them for color/brightness. Tested routine and the Smart Life would briefly change to new setting for about a half second before reverting to the previous setting. \n\nI tried adding the Smart Lifes to a single group and using that group in the routine but same result. \n\nAny ideas?",

And if I ask Alexa to turn off the gym fan she turns everything off including the gym lights.\n\nIt's like Alexa is associating the gym fan on/off request with a completely made up routine, because turning the gym heater on is not part of any routine and turning the gym lights off is not part of any routine.

Other Routines that aren't voice activated but from time or motion, aren't working either, but are listed in the activities in the app.\n\nSince all my Routines are listed in the app, and the commands used within the Routines work if called out, it seems to be a Amazon server problem.

  "She and her husband have been fighting for months and he's starting to get scary when he's angry so we are trying to put some safety backups in place just in case (yes she is doing other things to prepare to leave if needed) . We've looked into some of the safety apps,  but most of them require physical contact with the phone,  or pressing buttons 5 times, which is easily messed up and thus useless.  In the event she's at home but not within reach of her phone, ideally she could trigger Alexa to call an emergency contact with a subtle keyword, without saying Alexa's name and without Alexa responding (which would alert him to what she's doing). So if they are arguing and she feels the need, in the conversation she can include the keyword \"orange\" or something and alexa on her phone,  on the other side of the room, calls me silently. I'd hear what's going on and could make a judgement call about what to do next. \n\nI'm thinking we could change the name from Alexa to Orange (or the keyword, whatever it is), but that doesn't resolve the issue of Alexa responding before calling. \n\nThanks!",

  "So I just bought 2 Echo Dot 4 devices, one for my office and one for my bedroom, along with 2 smart bulbs in order to get started with how this stuff works.But I'm having a issue that if I tell the Bedroom echo dot \"Turn on/off the lights\" it'll ask me something like \"There's 2 'light' devices, which one do you want to turn on? Office or Bedroom?\" and then I can answer \"Bedroom\" whilst the Office one answers for \"Turn on/off the lights\".\n\nCan I make each Echo Dot recognize each room's light bulbs as their own in some way? as a workaround I'm now calling for \"Turn on office lights/Turn on Bedroom lights\".  \n\n\nEDIT: Solved, turns out my Bedroom group  didn't have a Echo Dot attached to it, so it was kinda floating and trying to turn on the office lights because of that.",

I cannot for the life of me figure out what to say to get her to use it.\n\n\"Alexa, play my soundtrack on not desk\" results in \"I can't find that on Amazon Music.\" So does \"On not desk, play my soundtrack\" and \"play my soundtrack on the group not desk.\" I even tried changing the name to other things as well as typing those commands into the Alexa app to make sure it wasn't an issue with her understanding me. No dice.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong here?",
  "Hello! My boyfriend has an Echo device at his house, and I have one at mine.

  "TLDR trying to enable/disable routine at sunrise and sunset on shared Alexa account\n\nI have routine called ABC on my phone that will turn on my driveway lights when I come home (based on location) at night but I only want it to be enabled at night so I have a separate routine that will run at sunset which will say \"enable ABC routine\" and another routine that will run at sunrise which will say \"disable ABC routine\". This works fine\n\nThe problem is I'm trying to do the same thing on my wife's phone and she is logged into her own Amazon account. On her phone we have a routine called XYZ that will turn on the driveway lights when HER phone comes home and this works fine. But the issue is when we have a separate routine on her phone that says \"enable XYZ routine\", Alexa will say \"I don't know that routine\"\n\nI know this is a really convoluted way to implement this but as far as I can tell, it seems to be the only way I can get routines to run only from sunset to sunrise!

  "I think I already know the answer, but I'm posting it in the hopes all you tech savvy people might actually know a way to do this.\n\nI had a Google Home set up for my senior parents, but recently switched to an Alexa Show 5 (because with Amazon Music my mother can play the actual songs she asks for and doesn't flip a coin on whether or not she gets the actual song she wants or some random music).\n\nI'd like to be able to text the device from my phone while I'm at work, or use the video chat rather than have to call home for something simple.  But as far as I know, the Amazon Show has to go through my phone to message or make calls, right? Meaning if I'm out of the house, I can't use the Show for calls?\n\nCould I use a second phone, one that's not activated, for this, or would that phone still need to be activated (have a working number, etc)?\n\nAlso, my father has a simple flip phone.

  "There was a post in r/ADHD asking about ADHD investments- an item you'd get for yourself to help work your way around life with ADHD. I thought I'd write about it here because as an appreciation post cuz Alexa has been life-changing!!\n\nThoughts will often run into my head with regards to tasks to complete, then I\u2019ll forget about it like a total Dory within the next seconds/minutes. So whenever the thoughts run through my head, I say \u201cHey Alexa, remind me to do \\[insert task here\\] at \\[specific time of the day\\]\u201d. I even make to-do lists to challenge myself to do everything that I need to do for the day! Alexa\u2019s also been amazing cuz I often get caught hyper focused + lose track of time on my phone or on some non-productive activity. When I catch myself drowning in a miscellaneous activity when I should be doing something else/better, I\u2019ll tell Alexa to set a timer to snap me out of it and remind me to do something ;)\n\nCertain tasks turn me off to the point where I can actually feel distressed/angered while trying to perform them, and it helps so much that I could tell Alexa to put on white noise or background music to help focus and make the task more bearable. I sometimes struggle to sleep because of racing thoughts that can often stress me out and cause me anxiety. Alexa's relaxing calming sounds (Have y'all tried water sounds????) puts me right to sleep with a smile on my face.\n\nI also leave my phone in the most random of places- lost in the couch, bed, car, fridge (I kid you not) and it comes in clutch that Alexa can call your phone for you if you ask Alexa where your phone is. Amazing. Those timers also come in clutch so that I don't forget something cooking in the kitchen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Alexa has been an incredible tool for me living with ADHD. I hope she's listening on the activities in my bedroom and while I'm in the bathroom loooool ;)",
  "Is it possible to get Alexa to flash kasa smart light bulb (already purchased) when a dog barks?\n\nBackground:\n\nAn elderly man in early stages of dementia often forgets to let the dog back inside. The dog barks. The neighbors can hear it, but he cannot. Please do not make suggestions for separating the dog and the man, even if you are correct, that is not my call to make and I will not pass it along to the family (they heard enough).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never worked with smart tech before, but I bought an alexa and a smart bulb (kasa, they were on sale - but now regretting this choice) and a smart plug.

Worked flawlessly for about 4-5 months but now, instead of Alexa going to the Spotify, selecting the song, and playing it, she instead just unpauses or plays the latest playlist/ podcast/ song I listened to before.\n\nNext, in the past 2 weeks, my lights (Solight WZ326) started to do weird stuff. I have commands to set brightness and colors - let's call the command \"Night\". Now when I call out \"Alexa Night\", the lights should set to 10% and orange color. Instead, a random number of them (0-3) do so, but the rest just quickly blinks and stays in the state as before the command. Sometimes it takes multiple repetitions for them to change.

One called Overhead for my bedroom and one called Living Room for my LR.\n\nWell tonight I told my echo ball thing (not the dot sizes)  to \"Turn on living room.\" this had always turned on my living room lights. Well tonight it said \"Living room is now armed, you have 60 seconds to leave.\" I told it to disarm living room not understanding and it said I had to do it in the app. I looked on my app and saw that my mothers two cameras 'living room' and 'kitchen' were now listed as devices in the alexa app.  \n\nI had to go into the arlo camera app and disarm and stop the contestant text alerts for motion since my mother was home.  I also changed the name of my group from living room to family room. But when did the arlo cameras go from a paired skill to a device controlled by alexa?",
  "I have two devices in a speaker group. One echo dot gen3, and one echo input.

This skill works, and is visible in the Alexa app under More - Skills & Games - Your Skills.\n\nI want him to be able to hear from this RSS feed using a custom voice command (so he doesn't have to listen through loads of other Flash Briefing things we have switched on), so am trying to create a new Routine using the Alexa app. However when selecting the action for this routine to perform, the \"Rugby News\" skill isn't in the list of skills I can choose from.\n\nAny ideas?

  "I have two Echo Dot smart speakers. On both of them, when it gives me a severe weather alert, it would say \"The National Weather Service has issued a severe thunderstorm alert for <location>, where the location was the name of an apartment complex about 500 feet from me. I called Amazon tech support, and they had me verify that the correct street address was shown for each device. The problem continued. So, they had me do a hardware reset on one device, then set it up again in the Alexa app on my phone. That device now gave me weather alerts for my apartment complex's name, not the wrong apartment complex. I had to go through the same procedure for the other Echo Dot. Apparently, when you set up an Echo Dot, it gets your physical address, probably through cell tower locations instead of the phone's GPS, because the initial setup when I bought the devices had my location incorrect. This suggests that, if you move to a new house or apartment (or city), you need to go through the hardware reset process again.",

This happens every time, so I'm assuming something is going on medically.\n\nSimilarly, if I say \"Alexa, turn on the light,\" she'll sometimes do it, but also say  \"by the way, I can do metaphorical jumping jacks if you say 'monkey-monkey' three times fast.

Please try again later or...\" which goes on for maybe 15 seconds. This is troubling because it's possible Alexa thinks I suffer from an extreme mental disability that requires a half-baked, semi-decently coded F-tier AI to tell me how to reset my internet.

That TV has the Tidal app on it, I've also told the echo dot to play Tidal on the group that the smart TV is on, but it says it can't do that either.\n\nThe reason why I want to do this is I have speakers throughout my house wired to the receiver that is hooked up to the TV. My receiver turns on when the Fire TV turns on. So the goal would be to be able to be in my basement and tell the TV upstairs to turn on through an echo. That would cause the receiver to turn on, and I could listen to whatever I want in the basement without going upstairs.",

  "I have converted most of the switches in my house to smart switches, and assigned them all to groups based on which room in the house they are in. For the switches that control lights, I've categorized them as lights. But the switches that control ceiling fans, I've left as switches. Now, Alexa is smart enough that when I say \"Alexa, turn off the lights\" it will turn off all the lights in whatever group is associated with the device I spoke to.\n\nI'd like to create a similar response when I say \"Alexa, turn on the fan\". For example, if I'm in the living room, and speak to the echo associated with the living room, I'd like to be able to say \"Alexa, turn on the fan\" and have Alexa turn on the switch called \"living room fan\", which is in the living room group. Similarly, if I'm in the bedroom, I'd like to say \"Alexa, turn on the fan\", but this time, Alexa will turn on the switch called \"bedroom fan\", which is in the bedroom group. And so on.\n\nCurrently, the only way I've been able to control the switch is to either say \"Alexa, turn on the ***living room*** fan\" or change the switch to a light, in which case the fan also turns on anytime I say \"Alexa, turn on the lights\".

  "Hi there.  I've exposed some scripted scenes from Home Assistant to Alexa to enable basic control of a TV and associated devices.  The scenes all work fine from home assistant but Alexa seems to be getting confused no matter how I name the scenes.\n\nThe scenes all sync through to alexa with the expected name, it's more that I can't get Alexa to recognise them.  With existing switches and lights, I've not had a problem and this is the first time using scenes.\n\nI'm getting a real mixture of \"hmm, I don't know that\" or \"A couple of things share that thing\" followed by not recognising the one I call out\n\nIs there some kind of knack to using scenes with Alexa.",
  "My family regularly calls the grandparents (who have an Echo Show on their own account) which works great except we have to hover around a single Echo Show and/or take turns.  My son has his own Echo Show (on our account) and I was wondering if it's possible to have a video call with the grandparents, \"Parents\" Echo Show, and \"Son's\" Echo Show at the same time. So one video call using the following:\n\nAccount 1: Parent's Echo Show, Son's Echo Show\n\nAccount 2:  Grandparent's Echo Show\n\nCan this be done? If so, would someone be kind enough to point out how to accomplish this? TIA",

  "There's a service called My Pod which allows users to stream an audio file to Alexa, and there's an option in it for \"Don't read the title before playing.\". The problem with this is that the free service offers very limited playback time per month (only one hour). Therefore, I'd love to use Plex instead.\n\nMy problem with using Plex is that Alexa is reading out the name of the song and album before playing, which is rather annoying. Is there any way to disable this like can be done with My Pod?",
  "The device responds to Alexa when called upon. I'm not sure why, but when I try to get Alexa to play music, it only plays from iHeartRadio or it cannot find any music.  \n\nFor example, when I say \"Alexa, play Japanese music\", it says it cannot find anything. If I say, \"Alexa, play top hits\" or any other song it's able to find, it'll only play from iHeartRadio.  \n\nIs this a limitation of this device? For reference, Alexa is able to play Japanese music when I did the same query from my phone's Alexa app, my Echo dot, and my Echo Show. It does however find the music from Amazon Music. I don't know why the Marshall Acton II is unable to play music outside of iHeartRadio.  \n\nDoes anyone have any ideas?",

  "Hey  all - I have an original Echo (the one which looks like the now called  \"echo plus\") in our living room which has worked great for years, we  have an echo dog 3rd gen in the bedroom which also works great, but the  echo dot 4th gen (the ball shaped one) in the kitchen is god awful! It  doesn't hear us, you have to stop timers 2 or 3 times in a row,  sometimes they never stop at all and you have to unplug it. Its just  awful. I have heard similar stories from others.\n\nSo  I am thinking about getting the Echo Show 8 inch 2021 version for the  living room, moving the original echo into the kitchen, and binning the  4th gen dot. What are people's opinions on this? Is the show going to  give me crappy audio quality compared to the original echo that i have  in the living room currently? Is the show just as much of a \"shit-show\"  (see what i did there) as the dot 4th gen?",
  "I bought an amazon fire tablet for the soul purpose of using it as a home automation dashboard & in one of the many youtube tutorials came across i found a tool called fire toolbox to remove all of the bloatwear. It did what it said on the tin & stripped all the default apps that i'd likely never use but it also removed alexa. There is a restore option to revert the tablet back to how it was before i ran the debloat which has seemingly restored it to the way it was but now when i open the alexa app it begins to open then just crashes & closes. I've tried running the debloat again & installing alexa from the play store but it just does the same. Is there anyway to get alexa back??",

When nothing happens it goes on snooze for the next 5 min so i have to always turn it off and on manually. Is there a way to actually stop the alarm?",
  "I am trying to set up an amazon echo for my granny, so that she can call both me and my sister, hopefully group calls also. She doesn't have a smartphone, but just a normal phone, so I created an amazon account with her phone number, but I'm trying to use my smartphone's Alexa with her account to set things up. It doesn't look like any of the imported or created contacts are detected as Alexa-to-Alexa. I guess it is because Alexa is installed on a phone with different number. Any hints on how to overcome this? I would prefer not to have to use her simcard on my phone because I won't have access to it often if I need to control her settings.\n\nP.S.

  "I need to call Amazon, but thought I'd start here to see if anyone else is experiencing this.  It started a couple of months ago, I think.  I'll tell her to do something, and she'll begin to respond but immediately cut off and the blue ring will circle round and round for a minute till it goes dark, and then I try again.  Sometimes it will work on the next try, but often it will cut off several times in a row.  I've tried to figure out a pattern but it's all completely random.  Sometimes she'll be good for a few days.  Sometimes it will be almost every time, sometimes cutting off after one second and sometimes near the end of her response.\n\nI've reset her a few times.

There is NO connectivity issues with any other devices in the house and I have a high end prosumer level router with gigabit synchronous fibre.   Connectivity isn't an issue.   Even if I reboot the router and related Alexa units they often fall offline again sometimes only *minutes* later.   This is 100% an Alexa issue, not a connectivity issue.\n\n\\- They've gone deaf or insane.      The Alexa show in my kitchen doesn't hear me half the time even when I'm talking directly at it, but another Dot unit at the far opposite end of the same level of the house will respond instead for some inexplicable reason.\n\n\\- They don't act as they should be.   I stood literally in front of one of my units a few days ago saying \"Alexa, stop\" trying to get music to stop and it just wholesale ignored me despite recognizing the command.   The only way to get it to stop playing music was to physically unplug it.\n\n\\- Announcements from IOT devices are just going AWOL.

  "As the title says, I need some input / ideas about how to possibly implement the two following ideas I have been wanting to implement in my smart home system for a while.\n\n*Beforehand, for clarification why the things I want are complex to achieve: I don't live in a house, I live on the 2nd floor of an apartment building as a tenant. So I can not put anything in public areas (e.g. hallway) or change anything outside my apartment (e.g. drill holes, exchange my doorbell system, etc.).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first thing - and I've tried that multiple times - is the idea of some sort of sensor inside my mailbox downstairs, so alexa can trigger a routine whenever the mailman enters the house and opens my specific mailbox, so I am notified when I have mail. I have bought and tested multiple motion sensors from amazon but they all didn't work - until I figured out why: They ALL seem to connect via bluetooth only, not wifi, and the signal was just too far away from downstairs up into my apartment. Wifi should work as I even get a weak signal from my alexa socket connected to my washing machine in the basement.  \nAny other ideas on how I could set up a notification once my mailbox is opened?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second thing is similar: Since I can't use a ring system as I can not change anything on my apartment, I'm seeking for alternative ways to control the front door and/or my manual apartment door, as well as speak to people at the front door from anywhere in my apartment.  \nRight now I have a semi-automatic system set up for the front door through the switchbot switch toggle thingy. It is taped on my apartment doorbell speakerphone system on the door opener button. Whenever my doorbell rings and I say \"Alexa open the door\", Alexa turns on my apartment hallway light and presses that knob, at least opening the front door.\n\nOkay. Fine. However: Ideally I would much rather also have SOME way of communicating through the doorbell speakerphone or any other way with the person outside. Then I could, for instance, have an alexa routine (e.g. \"Alexa, a delivery is here\") to open the front door and say to the amazon guy \"Please drop the package by the apartment door in the 2nd floor\".  \nAny ideas how I could pull something like that off without renovating half the building by installing custom doorbell sets? :-D",

Is there a way to complexly separate our devices but remain on the same Prime account using different logons? \n\nThanks for your help.",
  "Maybe somewhat of a bit unique use-case but I'm kind of stuck and any help would be appreciated!\n\nBackground:\n\nMy grandmother is bedridden and I want to keep in touch with her as much as possible even though we live across the country from each other. In trying to get her as much autonomy as possible I've setup an Alexa Echo for her to listen to music and control little things in her house. One thing we've been doing also is using Drop-In to communicate since she's not very tech/phone savvy. This also gives the family a way to check up on her if we need to.\n\nIssue:\n\nI use Alexa App on my iPad and iPhone when talking to my grandmother over Drop-In. Sometimes the conversations can last quite some time. I've been trying to use bluetooth or a wired headset when talking to her so I don't have to hold the iPad/iPhone the whole time. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work. When using the headphone/AUX jack, it seems audio goes the the headphone for a second but then reverts back to the built-in speakers/mic. Bluetooth connects but again audio doesn't go through the bluetooth device but stays on the built-in speakers/mic. I've tested other apps (music, phone, Facetime, etc) on both devices and external audio devices work just fine. Just doesn't seem to work with the Alexa App for some reason. Has anyone tried this and is there a way to get the Alexa app to use external audio devices?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for the help!",
  "In my morning routine, when I'm about to take a shower, I'm used to saying \"Alexa, play the album Alive by Kiss\" and then listening to the whole album in order. Now she comes back and says something like \"shuffling songs from Alive by Kiss and other selected songs.\" Glancing at a few other messages on the subreddit, I'm guessing this is a new policy from Amazon, not letting us play specific stuff unless we pony up for a music subscription? Jesus, Amazon\u2026I already paid for the device (two of them actually!) and give you $200 a year or whatever for Prime, and now you're taking away basic features? I'm severely considering dropping Prime from my life over this.\n \n(Also, Alex keeps trying to play NPR News for some reason. Can't figure that one out.)",
  "My daughter wants to listen to her Spotify music on her echo but I also want to listen to my Spotify music on my echo. Both echos are under the same Amazon account since I use the smart home features and drop-in. I have 2 Spotify accounts but can only figure out how to sign in on all devices not just one. I saw some posts about this a couple years ago but the resolution was creating separate Amazon accounts which is not something I can do, since I have the smart home setup. Anyone have a fix for this? Tired of my recommendations getting screwed up in my Spotify account.",
  "I tried toying with the settings on my Show 8 last night, and while I\u2019ve owned it for a while I\u2019ve never really changed anything in settings before. I have 2 things I want to change:\n\nCan I make the clock really big? Right now, there\u2019s nature scene screensavers that scroll with news headlines, with the clock really tiny up in the corner. It used to get larger when the screen dimmed at night, but as I played with the settings now the screen doesn\u2019t dim anymore. Can I get that back, at least? All of the screen settings seemed to be just changing the screensaver, not changing the arrangement of the screen (like for a larger clock).\n\nAlso, I want to start using my Alexa as a live camera for my room via the Drop In feature. This is both to check in on my cat, and because I\u2019ve been having some roommate issues. Is there a way to make it so my Show\u2019s screen doesn\u2019t change when I drop in, so if someone is in my room they won\u2019t be notified I\u2019m monitoring things via my phone? Right now it goes to that Facetime-like screen with an audio cue, so it would be really obvious I\u2019m checking in. Or is there a Skill that just quietly turns on the camera that I could enable?\n\nThanks!",
  "This is the second time this happened to me, I will explain in detail to find if someone has experienced the same behavior.\nFirst time: I was close to my echo dot device and suddenly without any command said to it (I\u2019m sure because my main language is different that Alexa\u2019s English), Alexa started to play some weird sound like a shower sound and suddenly someone started talking, I was with my sister we freaked out and unplugged the device, later we realized we shouldn\u2019t have unplugged the device, instead we should have listened more to figure out what happened.\nSecond time: today I woke up and again a voice on my Alexa, it was someone talking about business issues it sounded like someone across the room in a business call with another person, this time the behavior was different the sound reproduced like six times in the span of an hour for two or four seconds then it went silent, no lights on the Alexa device. \n\nMy best guess on this is a bug connecting two Alexa devices on a drop in call, or maybe the other side accidentally making a drop in call to my device, is that even possible?, has anyone else experienced this?",

  "Hi All -\n\nI have a fairly robust smart home with upwards of 60 client devices connected. 1 gig fiber for internet. I have an Amazon device in every room, full Ring security system with 3 outside cameras and a cam floodlight, Phillips hue bulbs in every room and multiple Sonos speakers around the house. And many more items. \n\nI want to unify my sound system a bit more and the only room that doesn\u2019t have a Sonos speaker in it is my kitchen where I have an Echo 4th Gen. Obviously the sound quality is better on a Sonos One and I can have Alexa on it. I just want to be able to play over Sonos in all rooms and right now the kitchen is the only one that I wouldn\u2019t be able to. \n\nMy question is what will I be losing by replacing the Echo 4 with a Sonos One? For instance, does the sidewalk feature really work well? My kitchen is centrally located and I have a Ring floodlight camera above my garage which is at the other end of the house. Both the Echo 4th Gen and the Ring floodlight have sidewalk enabled. Do you think the Echo 4th Gen is actually communicating with the Ring floodlight via sidewalk? Would I see a drop in stability with my floodlight cam since in theory the Echo 4th Gen can communicate with it over longer distances using sidewalk?\n\nI\u2019m also not sure if the Echo relays signal to other smart devices like my hue bulbs. \n\nOverall - I\u2019m not 100% sure what connectivity features of the Echo are actually being utilized and if sidewalk is that great to begin with.

She doesn\u2019t have to do anything to answer or hang up. We drop in and we hang up at the end. That\u2019s all she uses the Echo for. She does have to have the volume turned up a lot, but that\u2019s OK, she has her own room. It works great. \n\nSadly, not infrequently the Echo hears something and interprets it as \u201cEcho, play heavy metal\u201d or some such thing. It\u2019s not pretty. It\u2019s really loud and jarring. Actually her trigger word is \u2018computer\u2019 but whatever it is it can be triggered by accident. \n\nShe never talks to Alexa so she\u2019s not used to saying \u201cEcho, Stop!\u201d Or \u201cAlexa, Stop!\u201d or \u201cComputer, stop!\u201d As such, when the Echo misinterprets something and starts playing (very loudly) a movie, or music, or a video, (or or or) it\u2019s not fun. \n\nOften to solve this they (the helpers at her assisted living facility) just turn down the volume to stop to unwanted noise.

  "I just wanted to share this little anecdote that happened this morning with my mom.\n\nI only just dipped my toes into the Echo / Alexa ecosystem last week at the behest of my sister to see if there was a way to use some type of home assistant / camera to better help our mom. Mom is 91yo and lives in her own apartment in a senior community / facility (so she is 100% safe). Unfortunately, dementia is getting worse and we've recently gone from not knowing what day it is to starting to get confused about bigger things and timeframes.\n\nSo I did some research and decided to try the Echo Show 8. Spent a weekend figuring it out, how to manage it remotely, drop-in from my iPad, etc. \n\nSunday night I created a motion-triggered routine to greet mom when she first comes out of her room. It says good morning, tells her the date, time, weather. And then I have it kick off 30 minutes of her favorite church songs that I loaded into her Amazon Music account. In addition, I created a large-print cheat sheet to give her some basic instructions on how to interact with Alexa.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised this morning when I was checking her history. The routine triggered at 7:55 AM. At 8:26 AM there was a command to \"continue playing the music.\" Given where my mom has always been with technology (not good) and where she is with object permanence and memory issues (not good), this was a huge thing. It means she was listening to the music, recognized that it went off, remembered that she could control Alexa, and formed a command that wasn't on the cheat sheet. It made my morning.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing what else I can do to enable mom more with Alexa and her Echo Show.",

Then it goes on this wild goose chase, telling me to hold the round button to re-engage setup, or telling me to connect to the wifi network labeled \"Amazon\", which I don't see at all. One of the failed attempts did eventually show a list of my wifi channels, only to immediately go da-dump two seconds later and give me the same connection drop error.

Now, on the most recently purchased Show I use in my main room, my alarms and timers will sound as briefly as just a few seconds before stopping themselves on their own.   I've restarted the Show multiple times and submitted feedback several times in the last few weeks, but it keeps doing this.\n\nMy older Amazon devices do alarms and timers just fine.\n\nWhat is wrong with this most recent Show?  Do I just have a lemon?  Or did Amazon update the programming on the current models of Show so timers and alarms stop sounding after only a few brief seconds?  (At most, it tends to last about 90 seconds.)  This is all but useless and potentially  dangerous if someone is using it as a cooking timer.\n\nSometimes I just want to drop-kick this current Show into a deep canyon.

  "I have yet to implement some of these, but I was considering daisy chain routines-toggling-routines for higher order logic.\n\n**Goal AND Logic:** if Condition A, AND Condition B, AND Condition C, then Routine D Triggers Action\n\n**How**:\n\n* Routine A1 - if presence of Condition A, enable Routine B1\n* Routine A2 - if absence of Condition A, disable Routine B1\n* Routine B1 - if presence of Condition B, enable Routine C1\n* Routine B2 - if absence of Condition B, disable Routine C1\n* Routine C1 - if presence of Condition C, enable Routine D\n* Routine C2 - if absence of Condition C, disable Routine D\n* Routine D - if Trigger, then Action (add a cool down period)\n* Routine E - Any trigger (ie time of day) resets system by disabling Routine B1 and C1\n\n**Where it breaks**: For this logic to work Condition A must happen before Condition B, then before Condition C. Also Condition A through C will have to happen a second time (in order) once Routine D is triggered, to trigger Routine D again. Satisfaction of Conditions A-C cannot persist.\n\nExecution will be slightly more difficult because custom actions to disable routines must be done as separate routines.\n\n**Complex examples**:\n\n* If Button 1 is pressed, then Button 2 is pressed, then Button 3, then Button 4 (in other words, a password is entered), the front door will unlock.\n* If the forecast calls for rain, an wake up alarm is dismissed between 0400 and 0800, then the front door is opened, Alexa says \"Don't forget to bring an umbrella to work\" with a cool down period of 12 hours. Resets at 11 PM. IFTTT required for weather integrations.\n\n**Simple examples**:\n\n* If location leaves house, then motion is detected inside the house, play Security Alarm Siren and send a drop-in notification \"Intruder detected\"\n* If location arrives home, then use a time trigger to set the thermostat to cool to XYZ (Scheduled thermostat settings while home only)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Goal OR Logic:** If Condition A OR Condition B, then Routine D Triggers Action\n\n**How**:\n\n* Routine A1 - if presence of Condition A, enable Routine D\n* Routine A2 - if absence of Condition A, disable Routine D\n* Routine B1 - if presence of Condition B, enable Routine D\n* Routine B2 - if absence of Condition B, disable Routine D\n* Routine D - if Trigger, then Action\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nYes, you can (and I have) use routines to toggle routines. You can disable/enable routines by voice command if you give them a simple name. Name Routine D in the above examples a two digit number only (i.e. '11'), then use the Custom Commands for your Routine A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2 logic with the explicit language 'Alexa, turn off the ## routine' or 'Alexa, turn on the ## routine.'",

Then this happened.\n\nMe: Alexa, play Serial.\n\nAlexa: Getting the most recent episode of Serial from Amazon.\n\nMe: Oh, for fuck sake. Alexa, stop. (doesn't stop) ALEXA! STOP!\n\nSo, already the stupid thing is lying to me, but luckily the intelligence part of \"artificial intelligence\" isn't her strong suit and she's told me how to do what I want So I tell her to play Serial \"on Apple Podcasts.\" To which she responds: Now Playing Serial Chapter Five from Apple Podcasts.\n\nWhat?? How the hell this dumb bitch gonna go and play \"Chapter Five\" when I haven't heard Chapters One through Four yet??? Does she not know how things ordered in Chapters work?

  "I've had Sonos for over a decade.  Started with a Play:5.  Decent enough.  Definitely not audiophile and doesn't compare to my B&W CDM 9NT speakers, nor do I expect it to, but I did hook a Sonos Connect up to that system for the better audio quality of those speakers.  I also eventually got some Play:1's, a Playbase, a Sub, and a Sonos One.\n\nSonos eventually rendered my old system incompatible with itself.  The older Play:5 and Connect are not compatible with the other newer speakers.  If I try to play through all of them on the legacy app, the sound keeps dropping out.  Their solution is to buy more of their stuff and junk my old perfectly working $500 Play:5 and both of my $350 Connects.  Yes.  That is over $1,000 in equipment they want me to junk.\n\nWell, with the Echo, you can take the 1/8\" jack and output audio to any type of amp and speaker.  If the tech in the Echo becomes outdated, just get a new cheap Echo instead of throwing out $1,200 in equipment.  In fact, I had an old, but good quality 100W/channel studio power amp in a rack and some decent bookshelf speakers, just hooked an Echo up to them, and they sounds way better than the pair of Play:1's that were originally in the room... And it still would have been cheaper if I bought everything new instead of using stuff I had lying around.\n\nGranted, the audio quality of the Echo output isn't audiophile quality.  However, if you pair it with a better speaker, it will sound better in many respects than any of the Sonos speakers.  Also, if you want better quality audio, just get the Echo Link.  Best of all, you won't be forced to throw out a perfectly good amp and speaker when Sonos decides to render the streaming portion obsolete.",

  "  \n\nHi,\n\nWe have three Alexa devices set up in one section of the house for use by my elderly blind mother, who recently had a stroke. Her Amazon account is linked with a phone number so that she can easily call my wife or me. Yesterday I received and installed an Echo dot for use in my hobby room. It is linked to my Amazon account and connected to the same network in the house as the devices on my mother\u2019s Amazon account. Until yesterday, my mother only had to say \u201c<Wake-Word> call <Name>,\u201d and the Echo would call my or my wife\u2019s cell phone. Now, when she tries to call me, the Alexa device responds with \u201cWhich should I call? <Name\u2019s> phone or Alexa devices?\u201d I have made no changes to the contact list in her Alexa account. I have disabled drop-in on all Alexa devices in the house. I believe that her Echo sensed my Echo over the network and is now suddenly offering her a choice. As stated above, she recently had a stroke, so making changes to how things work and making them more complicated is not beneficial. Is there a way to get her devices to revert to simply accepting the command and dialing the number?\n\nTLDR: How do we change device calling back to accepting the \"Alexa, call <Name>\" command and dialing the number listed in the contact without asking whether we want to call a phone or Alexa device?\n\nThanks,  \nLugh\n\nEDIT - Added TLDR",

  "Hey guys! I'm having problems with my Show 5, the kinda smaller one. The screen isn't always on? Like it sometimes is just black but it's backlit or whatever so I know it's still on. And when I say Alexa, the blue bar on the bottom appears to let me know she's listening but the screen is still black. When it plays music, it shows the Spotify information. And it is on sometimes. I don't know if there's a pattern as to when it's on and off. Is this normal or an issue? \n\nSecondly, I am unable to drop in from my phone. My other device is an Echo, the tall one that's just a speaker, and I want to see the camera (I'm going out of town so I thought I could use it as a pseudo-security camera). Drop in is enabled on the device in the app. When I try to drop in, I get the 3 dots saying that it's attempting the call and then it says that the device is unavailable. How can I address this issue? Could these two issues be related? \n\nThanks!",
  "I have prime. I bought an echo dot for my elderly grandmother under my name. She is blind and has dementia. We live in the same building but basically upstairs and downstairs flats, close enough to be on the same wifi. I can run downstairs to help her anytime but I want to set alexa up so that she can be relatively more independent. I just bought her a Fire TV Cube so that she can turn on the TV through voice command. I want to have two different ecosystems of music/tv/etc playing for upstairs and downstairs.\n\nWhen I try to make her echo do something (like play from spotify), it basically hijacks my spotify account on my phone. Even if the command came from her phone. I already have a spotify family subscription with multiple profiles. My mother has a bunch of Audible books from 10 years of membership we want to let her listen to. Currently, I and my mother are the two adults on the Amazon Household. I'd like to open my grandmother's echo, make her an account, and log into my mom's audible account on that echo.  \n\nCan we set up my grandmother as a \"teen\" on the household with her cell phone, so that she can listen to our shared content and play her own music but not buy anything on prime? I can just buy stuff on her behalf.\n\nOr should we dis-associate her Echo and Fire TV cube from my household altogether and start over with a brand new household through her cell phone?

Got her an Alexa Show to make it easier to stay connected during the corona pandemic when nursing homes are in total lockdown.\nIt generally works fine as a phone and is simple enough for her to use, but she is hard of hearing and misses every call (especially because she blasts her TV).\nI tried Drop-In, but she doesn\u2019t hear us unless she shuts off her TV first.\n\n\nWas thinking to connect a smart-plug to Alexa so a table lamp would flash when there is an incoming call. She would then know there\u2019s a call and shut off the TV. Anyone know if that is possible (and how)? \n\nOr is there a better way to make Alexa more visually prominent when there is an incoming call?\n\nOr can I directly connect Alexa to the TV and MUTE it when there is a call?",
  "Hello,\nI\u2019ve recently bought a echo dot and I\u2019m having issues with Alexa not responding. The light doesn\u2019t turn on when talking to it or anything. I\u2019ve paired it up to my phone. Dropping in, playing music ect all works. Just having issues talking to the echo dot itself. So at the moment it\u2019s kind of acting like a speaker.

  "Hi,\n\nI'd like to send my grandparents an echo show so we can drop in on them for video calls (too hard to accept calls with other devices).  Someone can help with set up.  \n\n\nMy plan is to create an amazon account for them, and log in to alexa on my phone (different city) to help manage settings after setup.  I don't use alexa for anything else so don't mind that it's my number associated and I can just log out of the app when not dropping in. That way I think other family members (contacts in my phone) can drop in without it ringing me. Not sure what other complications there would be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes this make sense? Is it possible to set up like this from afar or does my phone need to ever be on the same wifi as the device?\n\nThanks!",
  "I have 4 Alexa devices on my home network, and have had this setup for a long time. But lately, over the last few days, Alexa is getting much slower to respond, and its to the point where she just drops out periodically. Just asking for the weather can take several seconds before the light ring comes on, and 10 or more seconds to get a response. I have also noticed that Alexa is getting confused about which speaker to answer or play on. I did have all my speakers in one group, and at one point I had specified a preferred speaker, but I undid all that when I realized how it actually worked. But it still will sometimes answer me from a far away speaker, or play music on a far speaker. This seems especially true if that speaker is already playing music. It should ask me if I want to play from the nearer speaker. Instead it plays music on the far speaker. All of these problems are relatively new. Any help appreciated...\n\nFWIW: my home wifi is very fast, like 200 MBps according to Speedtest.",

We use it to check up on the puppy when we're out and the loud notification wakes him and sets him off if he's settled. I'd prefer to remove the notification completely on this single device, but I'm assuming that this wouldn't be an option.   \n\n\nI've gone in to my settings and turned down the notification volume, but that doesn't seem to change the volume of the chime that goes off when I connect to it.   \n\n\nAny suggestions?",

Using my phone either through mobile data or wifi I cannot make a call to a usa number via alexa app, it simply never rings. But the interesting part is that I can make that same call using the actual Echo device without a problem.\n\nAny techies out there might know why?

  "I've had my alexa system (one original and two dots) set up for a couple of weeks and the last couple of days I've had issues with it playing music and podcasts. It's like it stutters... I don't think it's a problem with the speakers as it's on at least two devices, plus it is a momentary pause then it picks back up from where it left off. This happens with Spotify and live radio streaming.\n\nI currently have them all set up as an 'everywhere' group so I can hear what I'm listening to as I wander around my apartment (this was the main reason I purchased), and around the same time I noticed the audio dropping I started having trouble with it not playing on all speakers (even though the Spotify app says it's playing everywhere). Sometimes when a new song plays, one speaker takes a couple seconds to play it (although when it does play it's in sync with the other speakers). This isn't a huge deal but it might be linked.\n\nThey are also having trouble listening to me. Sometimes I can be right next to it saying 'alexa' very clearly, without loud background noise and it doesn't pick it up. Other times the ring will light up, but my request isn't picked up, or it is but the response is very delayed. This was terrifying when I said good night to it late last night, got no response after a couple of tries so gave up, turned the lights off and snuggled in to bed, only to hear 'sleep tight' coming from across the darkness!\n\nIm guessing it's a connectivity/WiFi issue (but I don't know much about these things). Searching for solutions, it was suggested I downloaded a WiFi checker, but most on the Google app store had reviews saying that it's dodgy for asking for location data, and the one I found that didn't said that it couldn't find any WiFi networks (even though I was connected and using it at the time).\n\n It's also weird that this is a new issue. Nothing else has changed. Last weekend it was my pride and joy, this weekend it's a pita and I've resorted back to using my phone to play my podcasts.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? ",

  "I'm nearing my wits end, especially with how integral our Alexa system has become with our home automation and daily lives.    It just seems like it's all falling apart.\n\nIn the last 2 weeks:\n\n\\- Random units drop offline for no apparent reason, complaining about loss of connectivity.    There is NO connectivity issues with any other devices in the house and I have a high end prosumer level router with gigabit synchronous fibre.   Connectivity isn't an issue.   Even if I reboot the router and related Alexa units they often fall offline again sometimes only *minutes* later.   This is 100% an Alexa issue, not a connectivity issue.\n\n\\- They've gone deaf or insane.      The Alexa show in my kitchen doesn't hear me half the time even when I'm talking directly at it, but another Dot unit at the far opposite end of the same level of the house will respond instead for some inexplicable reason.\n\n\\- They don't act as they should be.   I stood literally in front of one of my units a few days ago saying \"Alexa, stop\" trying to get music to stop and it just wholesale ignored me despite recognizing the command.   The only way to get it to stop playing music was to physically unplug it.\n\n\\- Announcements from IOT devices are just going AWOL.

  "As the title says, I need some input / ideas about how to possibly implement the two following ideas I have been wanting to implement in my smart home system for a while.\n\n*Beforehand, for clarification why the things I want are complex to achieve: I don't live in a house, I live on the 2nd floor of an apartment building as a tenant. So I can not put anything in public areas (e.g. hallway) or change anything outside my apartment (e.g. drill holes, exchange my doorbell system, etc.).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first thing - and I've tried that multiple times - is the idea of some sort of sensor inside my mailbox downstairs, so alexa can trigger a routine whenever the mailman enters the house and opens my specific mailbox, so I am notified when I have mail. I have bought and tested multiple motion sensors from amazon but they all didn't work - until I figured out why: They ALL seem to connect via bluetooth only, not wifi, and the signal was just too far away from downstairs up into my apartment. Wifi should work as I even get a weak signal from my alexa socket connected to my washing machine in the basement.  \nAny other ideas on how I could set up a notification once my mailbox is opened?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second thing is similar: Since I can't use a ring system as I can not change anything on my apartment, I'm seeking for alternative ways to control the front door and/or my manual apartment door, as well as speak to people at the front door from anywhere in my apartment.  \nRight now I have a semi-automatic system set up for the front door through the switchbot switch toggle thingy. It is taped on my apartment doorbell speakerphone system on the door opener button. Whenever my doorbell rings and I say \"Alexa open the door\", Alexa turns on my apartment hallway light and presses that knob, at least opening the front door.\n\nOkay. Fine. However: Ideally I would much rather also have SOME way of communicating through the doorbell speakerphone or any other way with the person outside. Then I could, for instance, have an alexa routine (e.g. \"Alexa, a delivery is here\") to open the front door and say to the amazon guy \"Please drop the package by the apartment door in the 2nd floor\".  \nAny ideas how I could pull something like that off without renovating half the building by installing custom doorbell sets? :-D",

We have both ordered Alexa devices off of our respective accounts but we still see one another's devices including what one another are purchasing, music listened to, etc. She even dropped in on me the other day, I have now turned that feature off. Is there a way to complexly separate our devices but remain on the same Prime account using different logons? \n\nThanks for your help.",
  "Maybe somewhat of a bit unique use-case but I'm kind of stuck and any help would be appreciated!\n\nBackground:\n\nMy grandmother is bedridden and I want to keep in touch with her as much as possible even though we live across the country from each other. In trying to get her as much autonomy as possible I've setup an Alexa Echo for her to listen to music and control little things in her house. One thing we've been doing also is using Drop-In to communicate since she's not very tech/phone savvy. This also gives the family a way to check up on her if we need to.\n\nIssue:\n\nI use Alexa App on my iPad and iPhone when talking to my grandmother over Drop-In. Sometimes the conversations can last quite some time. I've been trying to use bluetooth or a wired headset when talking to her so I don't have to hold the iPad/iPhone the whole time. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work. When using the headphone/AUX jack, it seems audio goes the the headphone for a second but then reverts back to the built-in speakers/mic. Bluetooth connects but again audio doesn't go through the bluetooth device but stays on the built-in speakers/mic. I've tested other apps (music, phone, Facetime, etc) on both devices and external audio devices work just fine. Just doesn't seem to work with the Alexa App for some reason. Has anyone tried this and is there a way to get the Alexa app to use external audio devices?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for the help!",
  "In my morning routine, when I'm about to take a shower, I'm used to saying \"Alexa, play the album Alive by Kiss\" and then listening to the whole album in order. Now she comes back and says something like \"shuffling songs from Alive by Kiss and other selected songs.\" Glancing at a few other messages on the subreddit, I'm guessing this is a new policy from Amazon, not letting us play specific stuff unless we pony up for a music subscription? Jesus, Amazon\u2026I already paid for the device (two of them actually!) and give you $200 a year or whatever for Prime, and now you're taking away basic features? I'm severely considering dropping Prime from my life over this.\n \n(Also, Alex keeps trying to play NPR News for some reason. Can't figure that one out.)",
  "My daughter wants to listen to her Spotify music on her echo but I also want to listen to my Spotify music on my echo.

  "I tried toying with the settings on my Show 8 last night, and while I\u2019ve owned it for a while I\u2019ve never really changed anything in settings before. I have 2 things I want to change:\n\nCan I make the clock really big? Right now, there\u2019s nature scene screensavers that scroll with news headlines, with the clock really tiny up in the corner. It used to get larger when the screen dimmed at night, but as I played with the settings now the screen doesn\u2019t dim anymore. Can I get that back, at least? All of the screen settings seemed to be just changing the screensaver, not changing the arrangement of the screen (like for a larger clock).\n\nAlso, I want to start using my Alexa as a live camera for my room via the Drop In feature. This is both to check in on my cat, and because I\u2019ve been having some roommate issues. Is there a way to make it so my Show\u2019s screen doesn\u2019t change when I drop in, so if someone is in my room they won\u2019t be notified I\u2019m monitoring things via my phone? Right now it goes to that Facetime-like screen with an audio cue, so it would be really obvious I\u2019m checking in.

  "This is the second time this happened to me, I will explain in detail to find if someone has experienced the same behavior.\nFirst time: I was close to my echo dot device and suddenly without any command said to it (I\u2019m sure because my main language is different that Alexa\u2019s English), Alexa started to play some weird sound like a shower sound and suddenly someone started talking, I was with my sister we freaked out and unplugged the device, later we realized we shouldn\u2019t have unplugged the device, instead we should have listened more to figure out what happened.\nSecond time: today I woke up and again a voice on my Alexa, it was someone talking about business issues it sounded like someone across the room in a business call with another person, this time the behavior was different the sound reproduced like six times in the span of an hour for two or four seconds then it went silent, no lights on the Alexa device. \n\nMy best guess on this is a bug connecting two Alexa devices on a drop in call, or maybe the other side accidentally making a drop in call to my device, is that even possible?, has anyone else experienced this?",

Obviously the sound quality is better on a Sonos One and I can have Alexa on it. I just want to be able to play over Sonos in all rooms and right now the kitchen is the only one that I wouldn\u2019t be able to. \n\nMy question is what will I be losing by replacing the Echo 4 with a Sonos One? For instance, does the sidewalk feature really work well? My kitchen is centrally located and I have a Ring floodlight camera above my garage which is at the other end of the house. Both the Echo 4th Gen and the Ring floodlight have sidewalk enabled. Do you think the Echo 4th Gen is actually communicating with the Ring floodlight via sidewalk?

It\u2019s really loud and jarring. Actually her trigger word is \u2018computer\u2019 but whatever it is it can be triggered by accident. \n\nShe never talks to Alexa so she\u2019s not used to saying \u201cEcho, Stop!\u201d Or \u201cAlexa, Stop!\u201d or \u201cComputer, stop!\u201d As such, when the Echo misinterprets something and starts playing (very loudly) a movie, or music, or a video, (or or or) it\u2019s not fun. \n\nOften to solve this they (the helpers at her assisted living facility) just turn down the volume to stop to unwanted noise.

  "I just wanted to share this little anecdote that happened this morning with my mom.\n\nI only just dipped my toes into the Echo / Alexa ecosystem last week at the behest of my sister to see if there was a way to use some type of home assistant / camera to better help our mom. Mom is 91yo and lives in her own apartment in a senior community / facility (so she is 100% safe). Unfortunately, dementia is getting worse and we've recently gone from not knowing what day it is to starting to get confused about bigger things and timeframes.\n\nSo I did some research and decided to try the Echo Show 8. Spent a weekend figuring it out, how to manage it remotely, drop-in from my iPad, etc. \n\nSunday night I created a motion-triggered routine to greet mom when she first comes out of her room. It says good morning, tells her the date, time, weather. And then I have it kick off 30 minutes of her favorite church songs that I loaded into her Amazon Music account. In addition, I created a large-print cheat sheet to give her some basic instructions on how to interact with Alexa.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised this morning when I was checking her history. The routine triggered at 7:55 AM. At 8:26 AM there was a command to \"continue playing the music.\" Given where my mom has always been with technology (not good) and where she is with object permanence and memory issues (not good), this was a huge thing. It means she was listening to the music, recognized that it went off, remembered that she could control Alexa, and formed a command that wasn't on the cheat sheet. It made my morning.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing what else I can do to enable mom more with Alexa and her Echo Show.",

Then it goes on this wild goose chase, telling me to hold the round button to re-engage setup, or telling me to connect to the wifi network labeled \"Amazon\", which I don't see at all. One of the failed attempts did eventually show a list of my wifi channels, only to immediately go da-dump two seconds later and give me the same connection drop error.

Now, on the most recently purchased Show I use in my main room, my alarms and timers will sound as briefly as just a few seconds before stopping themselves on their own.   I've restarted the Show multiple times and submitted feedback several times in the last few weeks, but it keeps doing this.\n\nMy older Amazon devices do alarms and timers just fine.\n\nWhat is wrong with this most recent Show?  Do I just have a lemon?  Or did Amazon update the programming on the current models of Show so timers and alarms stop sounding after only a few brief seconds?  (At most, it tends to last about 90 seconds.)  This is all but useless and potentially  dangerous if someone is using it as a cooking timer.\n\nSometimes I just want to drop-kick this current Show into a deep canyon.

  "I have yet to implement some of these, but I was considering daisy chain routines-toggling-routines for higher order logic.\n\n**Goal AND Logic:** if Condition A, AND Condition B, AND Condition C, then Routine D Triggers Action\n\n**How**:\n\n* Routine A1 - if presence of Condition A, enable Routine B1\n* Routine A2 - if absence of Condition A, disable Routine B1\n* Routine B1 - if presence of Condition B, enable Routine C1\n* Routine B2 - if absence of Condition B, disable Routine C1\n* Routine C1 - if presence of Condition C, enable Routine D\n* Routine C2 - if absence of Condition C, disable Routine D\n* Routine D - if Trigger, then Action (add a cool down period)\n* Routine E - Any trigger (ie time of day) resets system by disabling Routine B1 and C1\n\n**Where it breaks**: For this logic to work Condition A must happen before Condition B, then before Condition C. Also Condition A through C will have to happen a second time (in order) once Routine D is triggered, to trigger Routine D again. Satisfaction of Conditions A-C cannot persist.\n\nExecution will be slightly more difficult because custom actions to disable routines must be done as separate routines.\n\n**Complex examples**:\n\n* If Button 1 is pressed, then Button 2 is pressed, then Button 3, then Button 4 (in other words, a password is entered), the front door will unlock.\n* If the forecast calls for rain, an wake up alarm is dismissed between 0400 and 0800, then the front door is opened, Alexa says \"Don't forget to bring an umbrella to work\" with a cool down period of 12 hours. Resets at 11 PM. IFTTT required for weather integrations.\n\n**Simple examples**:\n\n* If location leaves house, then motion is detected inside the house, play Security Alarm Siren and send a drop-in notification \"Intruder detected\"\n* If location arrives home, then use a time trigger to set the thermostat to cool to XYZ (Scheduled thermostat settings while home only)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Goal OR Logic:** If Condition A OR Condition B, then Routine D Triggers Action\n\n**How**:\n\n* Routine A1 - if presence of Condition A, enable Routine D\n* Routine A2 - if absence of Condition A, disable Routine D\n* Routine B1 - if presence of Condition B, enable Routine D\n* Routine B2 - if absence of Condition B, disable Routine D\n* Routine D - if Trigger, then Action\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nYes, you can (and I have) use routines to toggle routines. You can disable/enable routines by voice command if you give them a simple name. Name Routine D in the above examples a two digit number only (i.e. '11'), then use the Custom Commands for your Routine A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2 logic with the explicit language 'Alexa, turn off the ## routine' or 'Alexa, turn on the ## routine.'",

Then this happened.\n\nMe: Alexa, play Serial.\n\nAlexa: Getting the most recent episode of Serial from Amazon.\n\nMe: Oh, for fuck sake. Alexa, stop. (doesn't stop) ALEXA! STOP!\n\nSo, already the stupid thing is lying to me, but luckily the intelligence part of \"artificial intelligence\" isn't her strong suit and she's told me how to do what I want So I tell her to play Serial \"on Apple Podcasts.\" To which she responds: Now Playing Serial Chapter Five from Apple Podcasts.\n\nWhat?? How the hell this dumb bitch gonna go and play \"Chapter Five\" when I haven't heard Chapters One through Four yet??? Does she not know how things ordered in Chapters work?

  "I've had Sonos for over a decade.  Started with a Play:5.  Decent enough.  Definitely not audiophile and doesn't compare to my B&W CDM 9NT speakers, nor do I expect it to, but I did hook a Sonos Connect up to that system for the better audio quality of those speakers.  I also eventually got some Play:1's, a Playbase, a Sub, and a Sonos One.\n\nSonos eventually rendered my old system incompatible with itself.  The older Play:5 and Connect are not compatible with the other newer speakers.  If I try to play through all of them on the legacy app, the sound keeps dropping out.  Their solution is to buy more of their stuff and junk my old perfectly working $500 Play:5 and both of my $350 Connects.  Yes.  That is over $1,000 in equipment they want me to junk.\n\nWell, with the Echo, you can take the 1/8\" jack and output audio to any type of amp and speaker.  If the tech in the Echo becomes outdated, just get a new cheap Echo instead of throwing out $1,200 in equipment.  In fact, I had an old, but good quality 100W/channel studio power amp in a rack and some decent bookshelf speakers, just hooked an Echo up to them, and they sounds way better than the pair of Play:1's that were originally in the room... And it still would have been cheaper if I bought everything new instead of using stuff I had lying around.\n\nGranted, the audio quality of the Echo output isn't audiophile quality.  However, if you pair it with a better speaker, it will sound better in many respects than any of the Sonos speakers.  Also, if you want better quality audio, just get the Echo Link.  Best of all, you won't be forced to throw out a perfectly good amp and speaker when Sonos decides to render the streaming portion obsolete.",

  "  \n\nHi,\n\nWe have three Alexa devices set up in one section of the house for use by my elderly blind mother, who recently had a stroke. Her Amazon account is linked with a phone number so that she can easily call my wife or me. Yesterday I received and installed an Echo dot for use in my hobby room. It is linked to my Amazon account and connected to the same network in the house as the devices on my mother\u2019s Amazon account. Until yesterday, my mother only had to say \u201c<Wake-Word> call <Name>,\u201d and the Echo would call my or my wife\u2019s cell phone. Now, when she tries to call me, the Alexa device responds with \u201cWhich should I call? <Name\u2019s> phone or Alexa devices?\u201d I have made no changes to the contact list in her Alexa account. I have disabled drop-in on all Alexa devices in the house. I believe that her Echo sensed my Echo over the network and is now suddenly offering her a choice. As stated above, she recently had a stroke, so making changes to how things work and making them more complicated is not beneficial. Is there a way to get her devices to revert to simply accepting the command and dialing the number?\n\nTLDR: How do we change device calling back to accepting the \"Alexa, call <Name>\" command and dialing the number listed in the contact without asking whether we want to call a phone or Alexa device?\n\nThanks,  \nLugh\n\nEDIT - Added TLDR",

  "Hey guys! I'm having problems with my Show 5, the kinda smaller one. The screen isn't always on? Like it sometimes is just black but it's backlit or whatever so I know it's still on. And when I say Alexa, the blue bar on the bottom appears to let me know she's listening but the screen is still black. When it plays music, it shows the Spotify information. And it is on sometimes. I don't know if there's a pattern as to when it's on and off. Is this normal or an issue? \n\nSecondly, I am unable to drop in from my phone. My other device is an Echo, the tall one that's just a speaker, and I want to see the camera (I'm going out of town so I thought I could use it as a pseudo-security camera). Drop in is enabled on the device in the app. When I try to drop in, I get the 3 dots saying that it's attempting the call and then it says that the device is unavailable. How can I address this issue? Could these two issues be related? \n\nThanks!",
  "I have prime. I bought an echo dot for my elderly grandmother under my name. She is blind and has dementia. We live in the same building but basically upstairs and downstairs flats, close enough to be on the same wifi. I can run downstairs to help her anytime but I want to set alexa up so that she can be relatively more independent. I just bought her a Fire TV Cube so that she can turn on the TV through voice command. I want to have two different ecosystems of music/tv/etc playing for upstairs and downstairs.\n\nWhen I try to make her echo do something (like play from spotify), it basically hijacks my spotify account on my phone. Even if the command came from her phone. I already have a spotify family subscription with multiple profiles. My mother has a bunch of Audible books from 10 years of membership we want to let her listen to. Currently, I and my mother are the two adults on the Amazon Household. I'd like to open my grandmother's echo, make her an account, and log into my mom's audible account on that echo.  \n\nCan we set up my grandmother as a \"teen\" on the household with her cell phone, so that she can listen to our shared content and play her own music but not buy anything on prime? I can just buy stuff on her behalf.\n\nOr should we dis-associate her Echo and Fire TV cube from my household altogether and start over with a brand new household through her cell phone?

Got her an Alexa Show to make it easier to stay connected during the corona pandemic when nursing homes are in total lockdown.\nIt generally works fine as a phone and is simple enough for her to use, but she is hard of hearing and misses every call (especially because she blasts her TV).\nI tried Drop-In, but she doesn\u2019t hear us unless she shuts off her TV first.\n\n\nWas thinking to connect a smart-plug to Alexa so a table lamp would flash when there is an incoming call. She would then know there\u2019s a call and shut off the TV. Anyone know if that is possible (and how)? \n\nOr is there a better way to make Alexa more visually prominent when there is an incoming call?\n\nOr can I directly connect Alexa to the TV and MUTE it when there is a call?",
  "Hello,\nI\u2019ve recently bought a echo dot and I\u2019m having issues with Alexa not responding. The light doesn\u2019t turn on when talking to it or anything. I\u2019ve paired it up to my phone. Dropping in, playing music ect all works. Just having issues talking to the echo dot itself. So at the moment it\u2019s kind of acting like a speaker.

  "Hi,\n\nI'd like to send my grandparents an echo show so we can drop in on them for video calls (too hard to accept calls with other devices).  Someone can help with set up.  \n\n\nMy plan is to create an amazon account for them, and log in to alexa on my phone (different city) to help manage settings after setup.  I don't use alexa for anything else so don't mind that it's my number associated and I can just log out of the app when not dropping in. That way I think other family members (contacts in my phone) can drop in without it ringing me. Not sure what other complications there would be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes this make sense? Is it possible to set up like this from afar or does my phone need to ever be on the same wifi as the device?\n\nThanks!",
  "I have 4 Alexa devices on my home network, and have had this setup for a long time. But lately, over the last few days, Alexa is getting much slower to respond, and its to the point where she just drops out periodically. Just asking for the weather can take several seconds before the light ring comes on, and 10 or more seconds to get a response. I have also noticed that Alexa is getting confused about which speaker to answer or play on. I did have all my speakers in one group, and at one point I had specified a preferred speaker, but I undid all that when I realized how it actually worked. But it still will sometimes answer me from a far away speaker, or play music on a far speaker. This seems especially true if that speaker is already playing music. It should ask me if I want to play from the nearer speaker. Instead it plays music on the far speaker. All of these problems are relatively new. Any help appreciated...\n\nFWIW: my home wifi is very fast, like 200 MBps according to Speedtest.",

We use it to check up on the puppy when we're out and the loud notification wakes him and sets him off if he's settled. I'd prefer to remove the notification completely on this single device, but I'm assuming that this wouldn't be an option.   \n\n\nI've gone in to my settings and turned down the notification volume, but that doesn't seem to change the volume of the chime that goes off when I connect to it.   \n\n\nAny suggestions?",

Using my phone either through mobile data or wifi I cannot make a call to a usa number via alexa app, it simply never rings.

  "I've had my alexa system (one original and two dots) set up for a couple of weeks and the last couple of days I've had issues with it playing music and podcasts. It's like it stutters... I don't think it's a problem with the speakers as it's on at least two devices, plus it is a momentary pause then it picks back up from where it left off. This happens with Spotify and live radio streaming.\n\nI currently have them all set up as an 'everywhere' group so I can hear what I'm listening to as I wander around my apartment (this was the main reason I purchased), and around the same time I noticed the audio dropping I started having trouble with it not playing on all speakers (even though the Spotify app says it's playing everywhere). Sometimes when a new song plays, one speaker takes a couple seconds to play it (although when it does play it's in sync with the other speakers). This isn't a huge deal but it might be linked.\n\nThey are also having trouble listening to me. Sometimes I can be right next to it saying 'alexa' very clearly, without loud background noise and it doesn't pick it up. Other times the ring will light up, but my request isn't picked up, or it is but the response is very delayed. This was terrifying when I said good night to it late last night, got no response after a couple of tries so gave up, turned the lights off and snuggled in to bed, only to hear 'sleep tight' coming from across the darkness!\n\nIm guessing it's a connectivity/WiFi issue (but I don't know much about these things). Searching for solutions, it was suggested I downloaded a WiFi checker, but most on the Google app store had reviews saying that it's dodgy for asking for location data, and the one I found that didn't said that it couldn't find any WiFi networks (even though I was connected and using it at the time).\n\n It's also weird that this is a new issue. Nothing else has changed. Last weekend it was my pride and joy, this weekend it's a pita and I've resorted back to using my phone to play my podcasts.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? ",

  "This is odd.

So I gave it back and tried several others.\n\nBut none of them, albeit advertised on Amazon as \"working with Alexa\", did anything in Alexa. They connected through Smart Life to Alexa, but neither could I trigger e routine with them, insert them as action in a routine or give them ANY verbal command to read out the humidity values like that Chinese sensor before. Some did nothing, some said \"Humidity is not yet supported.\"\n\nAnyway, long story short: Now my last try is with the Aqara system, but sadly it is the same here - the device connected to the new HUB and also showed in the Alexa app. But neither can I use it in any routines nor does it read out the humidity value via Alexa, regardless of what command I try to ask her.\n\nAny ideas?",

I got them all plugged into all four head units and connected to wifi, and the Alexa app on my phone recognizes them.\n\nWith the Alexa app itself, I can go into each of the four devices, turn it off/on, set the temperature, set the mode, and set the fan level. Basic but perfectly functional for what I need.\n\nI have also created routines so that each unit can turn on and off at predetermined times. Great!\n\nBut while I can adjust the temperature in the Alexa app on the phone, there is no option that I see when creating a **routine** to change the temperature.

  "There's something I'd like to use Alexa for, but I don't know if it's possible.\n\nWhen I cook beef stew on the stovetop, I need to stir it every 15 minutes. Right now, I just tell Alexa to \"alert me in 15 minutes,\" because there's nothing else I'm setting generic timers for. The problem is, I've been cooped up alone with Alexa for so long, I'm becoming inured to her, and now I'm prone to just telling her to \"stop,\" without actually getting up and stirring the stew. So I'd like her to stay on my case about it until I've set a new timer; setting a new timer would indicate that I've stirred the stew, and I need to stir it again the next time. (And for whatever reason, I've never been a \"snooze\"-er; if I set a 7 am alarm, I just also set a 7:05, 7:10, and 7:15 alarm, because I know I'm not going to snooze the original alarm.)\n\nMy first thought was to create a routine that would trigger off of the alarm dismissal, and would remind me every minute to go stir (making Alexa speak, not another alarm, or I'd be triggering the routine again), repeatedly--an arbitrary number of times (since I don't think routines have goto loops). And when I've taken care of the stew, I would tell it to end the routine, allowing it to restart after the next new timer that I then set. But my understanding is that, despite it being a requested feature in a handful of threads on the official forums, it is impossible to stop a routine that is already in progress. It also appears that dismissing a timer does not satisfy the alarm dismissal trigger.\n\nSo, can anyone think of a way to do this with a routine, with other Alexa commands, or even with other tools altogether?",

  "Yesterday I had to call emergency services because my son was choking. I used my echo show to call as he was right in front of it, and I didn\u2019t want to search for my phone. This detail is important. I have daily routines set up for my kids to tell them to clean up their things and then another 30 minutes later to go brush their teeth and get ready for bed. While on the line with 911 a freaking reminder kicks off and interrupted the call. So was trying to do the heimlich and hear what the operator is saying while Alexa is telling my kids it\u2019s bedtime. Seconds matter in these scenarios. Thankfully we were finally able to clear his airway, but it wasn\u2019t looking great for a minute. \n\nI started a chat with Amazon customer service to see if something can be done or if my device was faulty. He said to add 911 as an emergency contact and that shouldn\u2019t happen. When I asked for help with that it turned out it couldn\u2019t be done. He said he would submit it as feedback and I could continuously check the Amazon website to see if this has been fixed. I would not receive notification that my issue had been resolved. So I called customer service instead. \n\nThe next guy I spoke with gave me a few more options. He said I could simply disable all of my routines. Boom. Problem solved. Well, I kind of like that feature. I mean that really eliminates some of the basic features. Then he suggested I go look for my phone and call 911 from that next time. He said to be sure I\u2019m always from the device or turn it down. That way my call won\u2019t get interrupted. *Really??* He was literally inches from the device. It was the closest thing capable of calling emergency services. Don\u2019t worry. I was also offered the solution of not calling 911 or to have the emergency outside of my scheduled routines. Not helpful either. It gets better. Finally, he argued with me that my device couldn\u2019t even call 911. It\u2019s not a feature that you can use. He said it couldn\u2019t connect to government numbers. I explained that I just did, and it was in fact the second time I had done so. It was actually a feature that I really appreciated given the fact I\u2019ve had to call 911 three times in the past few months. He had control of my device and I showed him the voice history proving myself right. He hung up on me.\n\nSo here we are. Is this something that is specific to my device? Has anyone else had this problem? How do I get this fixed *and* receive notification that it has been fixed? Thanks!",

  "I guess this is an issue where Amazon Music is also involved: I have a playlist with over 500 songs for our business and I put them to be played randomly through a routine in Alexa, but I'd be damned if it played more than 150, and they're the same, so evidently there's a pattern to it.

  "As the title says, I need some input / ideas about how to possibly implement the two following ideas I have been wanting to implement in my smart home system for a while.\n\n*Beforehand, for clarification why the things I want are complex to achieve: I don't live in a house, I live on the 2nd floor of an apartment building as a tenant. So I can not put anything in public areas (e.g. hallway) or change anything outside my apartment (e.g. drill holes, exchange my doorbell system, etc.).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first thing - and I've tried that multiple times - is the idea of some sort of sensor inside my mailbox downstairs, so alexa can trigger a routine whenever the mailman enters the house and opens my specific mailbox, so I am notified when I have mail. I have bought and tested multiple motion sensors from amazon but they all didn't work - until I figured out why: They ALL seem to connect via bluetooth only, not wifi, and the signal was just too far away from downstairs up into my apartment. Wifi should work as I even get a weak signal from my alexa socket connected to my washing machine in the basement.  \nAny other ideas on how I could set up a notification once my mailbox is opened?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second thing is similar: Since I can't use a ring system as I can not change anything on my apartment, I'm seeking for alternative ways to control the front door and/or my manual apartment door, as well as speak to people at the front door from anywhere in my apartment.  \nRight now I have a semi-automatic system set up for the front door through the switchbot switch toggle thingy. It is taped on my apartment doorbell speakerphone system on the door opener button. Whenever my doorbell rings and I say \"Alexa open the door\", Alexa turns on my apartment hallway light and presses that knob, at least opening the front door.\n\nOkay. Fine. However: Ideally I would much rather also have SOME way of communicating through the doorbell speakerphone or any other way with the person outside. Then I could, for instance, have an alexa routine (e.g. \"Alexa, a delivery is here\") to open the front door and say to the amazon guy \"Please drop the package by the apartment door in the 2nd floor\".  \nAny ideas how I could pull something like that off without renovating half the building by installing custom doorbell sets? :-D",

And if I ask Alexa to turn off the gym fan she turns everything off including the gym lights.\n\nIt's like Alexa is associating the gym fan on/off request with a completely made up routine, because turning the gym heater on is not part of any routine and turning the gym lights off is not part of any routine. She is treating gym on/off as \"turn every single available device in the gym on/off\" even though no such routine actually exists.\n\nEven if I remove the gym fan from the gym group, the same thing keeps happening.\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this?

Also, english is not my first language, and not the language i use to communicate with Alexa with, so please excuse weird voabulary/grammar choices. \n\nI use an audiobook from Audible to fall asleep to. Pre-Alexa, i used my Phone with a sleep timer in the Audible app. Since i got my Echo-Dot, i usually ask Alexa to start the audiobook and once she has (saying both commands directly after each other does not work), ask her to stop the playback in X minutes. However, i tend to sometimes forget the second command, waking up hours later to my audiobook still running, so i thought i could combine the commands in a routine. \n\nHowever, i ran into the issue that i somehow cannot combine those two. The closest i have gotten is a Routine that starts my audiobook, followed by a second Routine that stops all sound from my Dot after a time delay. Which shortenes my commands to keywords, but still leaves me with 2 commands and as such does not solve the issue. \n\n I can program several things into my first routine so they happen after each other, but i cannot set an end date to the Audible playback, and i cannot set a time delay for onlyone of the actions in the routine (so that the audibook starts imediately and the \"no sound\" only starts 30 minutes later). \n\nDoes anyone know a way around that?",

Alexa's built in podcast features seem... lacking.  and a lot of things ive read online suggest using a 3rd party skill.

  "Hey all you smart home addicts! :-)\n\nI am hoping some of you have an idea if there is any way to make more elaborate and interactive routines! Even if with 3rd party skills or tools, that's fine, too.\n\nSo here is what I wanted to do, but can not achieve with alexa's current routine system: I have the command \"Alexa, good morning\" for when I wake up in the morning. It turns on some lights and stuff and reads me today's calendar and weather. Cool, cool. Now, though, I was thinking that I wish there was some way to end the command's triggers with Alexa asking \"Do you wish to have your daily summary?\" instead of just reading weather and calender every time. Then she'd listen for my answer and trigger reading the stuff out or not, depending on what I'm replying. \n\nSo basically Alexa's routines would turn somewhat interactive with conditions and change the routine depending on user input.\n\nSounds out of reach, eh? :-( I tried to trick that with deleting the read outs from my routine and make Alexa just ask me \"do you want your summary?\" as \"Alexa says\" as last trigger.   \nThen I made a second routine with the read outs, triggered by \"Alexa, yes please\".   \nSo I thought if I said good morning, she'd turn on lights and ask if I wanted my summary. Then she'd have ended the routine but continue listening for a few seconds, so I could \"fake answer\" to her triggering the 2nd routine if I said \"yes please\".  \nExcept sadly it didn't work as she instantly stops listening once the first routine is finished triggering.\n\nOof. So far so much text, sorry. So.... ANY idea if there is a way to have such more complex routines where Alexa's triggers change depending on your verbal user input mid-routine?",

  "I throw a big Halloween party every year and normally use Alexa to automate and trigger certain events. I have tried two ways to automate this year and am incurring different problems.\n\nI have:\n\n5x Echo Dots set up as a single speaker group playing into amps across House/property\n\nGroups of outdoor smart lights (novestella, hue - grouped separately)\n\nGroups of smart plugs\n\n\n\nMy first approach was the following:\n\n\nRoutine starts at 6:45pm.\n\nGroup of lights turn off\nGroup of outlets turn on\nPlaylist starts playing on Apple Music on speaker group - approximately 1.5hrs long.\n\nWhen the playlist is over the following happens \n\nAround 8:15pm\n\nGroup 1 of outlets turn off, group 2 of outlets turns on, short playlist plays one song, when it\u2019s over group 2 of outlets turns back off, group 1 of outlets turns back on. \n\nWhen outlet turns back on then a new playlist is set to play. The above sequence repeats itself around 8:30pm and then 8:45pm. \n\nSO\n\nSetting it up this way seemed to not fully play my playlists totally. It seemed to make it all the way to the outlets turning off and on for the first time but the next playlist would not trigger via Apple Music OR the music would stop playing across the group before it finished the first playlist\n\n\n\nNext scenario  I tried setting four separate routines:\n\n\nRoutine 1 - 6:45 - shuts certain lights, turns Halloween lights on and  starts playlist on Apple\nMusic across groups of speakers \n\nRoutine 2 - 8:15  (original playlist is still on when new routine triggers). Group 1 of outlets turn off, group 2 of outlets turns on, short playlist plays one song, when it\u2019s over group 2 of outlets turns back off, group 1 of outlets turns back on and then a new  playlist starts\n\nRoutine 3 - 8:30  (routine 2\u2019s playlist is still on when new routine triggers). Group 1 of outlets turn off, group 2 of outlets turns on, short playlist to play one song, when it\u2019s over group 2 of outlets turns back off, group 1 of outlets turns back on and then a new playlist starts\n\nRoutine 4 - 8:45 (routine 3\u2019s playlist is still on when new routine triggers). Group 1 of outlets turn off, group 2 of outlets turns on, short playlist to play one song, when it\u2019s over group 2 of outlets turns back off, group 1 of outlets turns back on and then a new playlist starts\n\nThe problem I\u2019m having with this approach is it works to trigger all the playlists however every other time it will not turn group 2 of outlets back off and group one back on?

  "**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use a the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called \"Everywhere Turntable\" specifically for that purpose. Now I can use the \"Everywhere\" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue. Some comments claim to confirm the issue was fixed, but it most certainly was not.",

  "Morning everyone! \n\nI am exploring alexa as a replacement for my google home devices.  We currently have google smart speakers all over the house, and theyre mainly used for interacting with our smart home control stuff in Home assistant.  I was really pleased when I bought my first alexa device and found that it integrates pretty seamlessly there! \n\nBut a feature I use daily on my google home devices is the \"good morning\" routine.  It does three simple things.  Turns on the lights in the room I am in when I ask it, (by using \"ok google, turn on the lights\") tells me the weather forecast, and then plays a selection of news podcasts ive pre-set in the google home app. \n\nThe problem I'm having is with the podcasts.  Alexa's built in podcast features seem... lacking.  and a lot of things ive read online suggest using a 3rd party skill.  The 3rd party skills dont seem to integrate well with a series of items in a routine, since any custom \"voice command\" in a routine has to be at the end, and you can only have one.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis all doesnt seem like a tall order, so i assume that I am just going about it the wrong way, but I have not been able to find any useful info online.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo any of you power users out there do something similar? and how do you get it done? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",
  "Hey all you smart home addicts! :-)\n\nI am hoping some of you have an idea if there is any way to make more elaborate and interactive routines! Even if with 3rd party skills or tools, that's fine, too.\n\nSo here is what I wanted to do, but can not achieve with alexa's current routine system: I have the command \"Alexa, good morning\" for when I wake up in the morning. It turns on some lights and stuff and reads me today's calendar and weather. Cool, cool. Now, though, I was thinking that I wish there was some way to end the command's triggers with Alexa asking \"Do you wish to have your daily summary?\" instead of just reading weather and calender every time. Then she'd listen for my answer and trigger reading the stuff out or not, depending on what I'm replying. \n\nSo basically Alexa's routines would turn somewhat interactive with conditions and change the routine depending on user input.\n\nSounds out of reach, eh? :-( I tried to trick that with deleting the read outs from my routine and make Alexa just ask me \"do you want your summary?\" as \"Alexa says\" as last trigger.   \nThen I made a second routine with the read outs, triggered by \"Alexa, yes please\".   \nSo I thought if I said good morning, she'd turn on lights and ask if I wanted my summary. Then she'd have ended the routine but continue listening for a few seconds, so I could \"fake answer\" to her triggering the 2nd routine if I said \"yes please\".  \nExcept sadly it didn't work as she instantly stops listening once the first routine is finished triggering.\n\nOof. So far so much text, sorry. So.... ANY idea if there is a way to have such more complex routines where Alexa's triggers change depending on your verbal user input mid-routine?",

  "Slightly new to Alexa, so please forgive if this is obvious or there's a better sub for questions like this. Also, I don't have my Alexa app with me, so my terminology may be off. \n\nWe really want to use our Alexa-powered Echo as a metronome. But among other hiccups, it's got a slightly long, cumbersome command to get it going \"Alexa, set my metronome to 120 beats per second.\" There are variations (e.g. BPM sometimes works), but it'd be great if we could add a custom command. \n\nI have limited experience with custom commands. The closest to this is something like \"Alexa, jam\" translates to something like \"Alexa, play Jam On on Sirius XM.\"  \n\nMy problem creating something like that for the My Metronome skill is that the beats per minute we want varies with the exercise. If I had my way, I'd be able to say \"Alexa, metro ###\" and it would include ### wherever it comes in the command. Sort of like I can say \"what is the weather in CITY\" and it will give me the weather in whatever CITY I ask. \n\nIs anything remotely like this possible? \n\n\nOh,  though I'm using a metronome as an example, the underlying question is broader than that --- can I set up a custom command that passes a variable (for lack of a better word) to the full Alexa command?\n\n\n...... \n\nIf not, any chance you have a preferred metronome skill? Our two main issues with what we've tried are hiccups and odd, jarring micro-pauses in the beat. Almost like it's a loop that takes moment to buffer. And then there's the cumbersome phrase to start it. Somewhat of a mouthful and prone to misinterpretation, especially when there's background noise. Another possibility is \"Alexa, Spotify 120 BPM,\" but there is a limited range of available tracks. A lot of times we're working  incrementally and it doesn't help. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI started asking specifically about that, but the broader question would be great in the long run. If it's impossible but you have metronome suggestions, we'd greatly appreciate it.",

  "I'm a heavy Alexa user with the large echo show, the medium-sized echo show, and several dots and echos scattered around the house. I use the devices to control my lights, to play music everywhere, to set reminders, and sometimes to control the thermostat.\n\nAfter more than a year, I'm increasingly frustrated by the lack of attention that Amazon seems to be paying to this ecosystem. Alexa never remembers our most basic preferences and feels the need to tell us the same thing endlessly. If you ask her anything about fashion (e.g. \"can I wear socks with Birkenstocks\"), she answers with a weather report and shopping recommendations.  \n\nI've heard from third-party developers that they're unable to update apps and address individual user complaints because of how Amazon has structured that side of the operation.\n\nThe rest of the technology world is racing ahead. There are text-to-image generators creating stunning works of art and text-to-prose generators writing decent college term papers without human intervention. Meanwhile, Alexa limps along, like little more than an updated version of \"the clapper.\" Clap on. Clap off. But don't try to do anything \\*too\\* useful with it.\n\nI don't expect Alexa to hang the moon or write an opera for me, but it would be nice to see some sort of updates and improvements to the platform, just as we see with other operating systems and with other applications. And these are all just dumb terminals, right? It's all happening on machines in the cloud, so they have access to all that computer power.\n\nThe lack of concerted customer outreach related to Alexa is also odd.\n\nIt feels like Alexa has been completely overlooked as Amazon makes other moves in the AI and robotics space (e.g. the iRobot purchase). I'm sure the people on the Alexa team must be frustrated as well.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I still love my Alexa most of the time, and it's a great device for someone who lives alone. But I worry about the lack of vision for this product. It could be SO much better. Voice interfaces could be SO much better.",

  "Hello all. \n\nI\u2019ve been using echo products for years. I recently purchased an echo show 15. It\u2019s pretty great. \n\nHowever, when I run my bedtime routine, it will not read my calendar events for tomorrow. It\u2019ll show them quickly and then move onto the next step in the routine. \n\nMy routine does the following: \n- turns off my lights\n- turns on my fan\n- tells me the weather\n- supposed to read my calendar but it doesn\u2019t \n- custom action to enable wake-up light alarm. \n\nI\u2019ve deleted the routine. Recreated it. Same issue. I\u2019ve reset the echo show 15. Same issue. The issue doesn\u2019t occurring on my echo show 8 or echo show 5. They both will read my calendar within the routine just fine.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue and resolved it?\n\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nI reached out to Amazon support. After telling my issue and walking through all the steps I\u2019ve already done and mentioning the issue doesn\u2019t occur on any other echo product I own, the solution they gave me was to not use a custom action. \n\nI removed the custom action and it took Alexa about 10-15 seconds to read my calendar for tomorrow. \n\nI asked them to send the feedback further so it can be looked into because it\u2019s annoying. \n\nSo my workaround is to set a 15 second wait after the read calendar tomorrow action and the custom action.",

I called Amazon tech support, and they had me verify that the correct street address was shown for each device. The problem continued. So, they had me do a hardware reset on one device, then set it up again in the Alexa app on my phone. That device now gave me weather alerts for my apartment complex's name, not the wrong apartment complex. I had to go through the same procedure for the other Echo Dot. Apparently, when you set up an Echo Dot, it gets your physical address, probably through cell tower locations instead of the phone's GPS, because the initial setup when I bought the devices had my location incorrect.

There's no way to tell it to continue doing other tasks while music is playing. This happens with all audio elements. News, Weather, everything.\n\nBefore you ask why I don't use the ramp feature in Alexa, its because its terrible. Alexa doesn't know how to ramp my lights at all. It takes 70% down to 20%, then 20% to 1% then off. In this case, its like 70% for 2 minute, then 20% for 3 minutes, then 1% for half a second and then off. So I had to do my own custom ramping with wait timers in my routine.\n\nI gotta say, Alexa is a rather big disappointment since I began using it. Sometimes I'll say \"Alexa Lights\" and it asks me what I want to play. I can't even say \"Alexa, turn off the light in 5 minutes\", because it doesn't know how to do that.

  "I just wanted to share this little anecdote that happened this morning with my mom.\n\nI only just dipped my toes into the Echo / Alexa ecosystem last week at the behest of my sister to see if there was a way to use some type of home assistant / camera to better help our mom. Mom is 91yo and lives in her own apartment in a senior community / facility (so she is 100% safe). Unfortunately, dementia is getting worse and we've recently gone from not knowing what day it is to starting to get confused about bigger things and timeframes.\n\nSo I did some research and decided to try the Echo Show 8. Spent a weekend figuring it out, how to manage it remotely, drop-in from my iPad, etc. \n\nSunday night I created a motion-triggered routine to greet mom when she first comes out of her room. It says good morning, tells her the date, time, weather. And then I have it kick off 30 minutes of her favorite church songs that I loaded into her Amazon Music account. In addition, I created a large-print cheat sheet to give her some basic instructions on how to interact with Alexa.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised this morning when I was checking her history. The routine triggered at 7:55 AM. At 8:26 AM there was a command to \"continue playing the music.\" Given where my mom has always been with technology (not good) and where she is with object permanence and memory issues (not good), this was a huge thing. It means she was listening to the music, recognized that it went off, remembered that she could control Alexa, and formed a command that wasn't on the cheat sheet. It made my morning.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing what else I can do to enable mom more with Alexa and her Echo Show.",

I have reset the echos, tried different WiFi APs, bought new echos, used the Alexa app on android and IOS, tried the web interface.\n\nThis is 100% not an issue with hardware or networking at my end.

  "USA had a time change today, back to standard time from daylight savings. Alexa herself reset her time properly, went backwards an hour during the night. My *alarms* synched properly too. However, any *routine* that was set to trigger at a specific time got reset to an hour earlier than they are supposed to be. Example, my one that's set to go off at 10am every day to turn on my lights, give me news and weather updates, and tell me about my day went off at *9am* this morning. I checked all the others I have with a time specific trigger and found out every one of them was an hour off, so I had to manually reset all of them. Luckily I only have 8 with time triggers, but I know some people with dozens who had to individually reset every one manually. This seems like a huge flaw that they've overlooked.",

Other mornings, the alarm will be a continuous quiet beep.  \n\n\nI have it set to tell me the weather after I stop the alarm, but this only happens when the radio plays.

(Yes, I realize this is exactly how it already works when you ask her the weather). \n\nThe idea would be: Turn common questions into routines to avoid \u201cby the way,\u201d *if* routines help avoid that annoyance.

Also Condition A through C will have to happen a second time (in order) once Routine D is triggered, to trigger Routine D again. Satisfaction of Conditions A-C cannot persist.\n\nExecution will be slightly more difficult because custom actions to disable routines must be done as separate routines.\n\n**Complex examples**:\n\n* If Button 1 is pressed, then Button 2 is pressed, then Button 3, then Button 4 (in other words, a password is entered), the front door will unlock.\n* If the forecast calls for rain, an wake up alarm is dismissed between 0400 and 0800, then the front door is opened, Alexa says \"Don't forget to bring an umbrella to work\" with a cool down period of 12 hours.

IFTTT required for weather integrations.\n\n**Simple examples**:\n\n* If location leaves house, then motion is detected inside the house, play Security Alarm Siren and send a drop-in notification \"Intruder detected\"\n* If location arrives home, then use a time trigger to set the thermostat to cool to XYZ (Scheduled thermostat settings while home only)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Goal OR Logic:** If Condition A OR Condition B, then Routine D Triggers Action\n\n**How**:\n\n* Routine A1 - if presence of Condition A, enable Routine D\n* Routine A2 - if absence of Condition A, disable Routine D\n* Routine B1 - if presence of Condition B, enable Routine D\n* Routine B2 - if absence of Condition B, disable Routine D\n* Routine D - if Trigger, then Action\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nYes, you can (and I have) use routines to toggle routines. You can disable/enable routines by voice command if you give them a simple name. Name Routine D in the above examples a two digit number only (i.e. '11'), then use the Custom Commands for your Routine A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2 logic with the explicit language 'Alexa, turn off the ## routine' or 'Alexa, turn on the ## routine.'",

  "Since I got my Echo when it was first released I have had a daily ritual of asking it \"what's new\" or \"play my flash briefing\".   Both of those commands once had the same result, but they have somehow morphed into different things. Regardless, it was through them I learned to love two podcasts.  The Daily, from the New York Times and The Intelligence from the Economist.  \n\nAfter a few years, Flash Briefing and What's New secretly changed and those podcasts no longer played.  But I found I ask for them by name separately so I adapted.  I could just say,   \n\"Alexa - play The Daily\" or   \n***\"Alexa - play The Intelligence\".***\n\nAt some point she didn't recognize \"The Intelligence\" so I adapted my syntax and the only thing that worked was    \n***\"Alexa, play The podcast the Intelligence\"***\n\nSix months late instead of playing The Intelligence from the economist, that command ended up with her playing some random  \"intelligence report\" so I had to modify my syntax again and say   \n***\"Alexa, play the podcast The Intelligence from Tune in\".*** \n\nThen suddenly, instead of playing today's episode, it started picking up where I left off the prior day - not what I want from a daily news podcast.  But Alexa would clearly say \"Resuming where you left off, to play the latest episode, just say \"latest episode\"\". \n\nThat worked a few times..... but a few weeks later when I would say \"Play the latest episode\" it would dump podcast and play some random heavy metal band instead.  Similar issues were creeping in with The Daily. \n\nBut.... I learned....- or Alexa trained me.... So for the past 4 months I've carefully constructed my request -   \n***\"Alexa,- play the latest episode of the podcast The Intelligence from Tune In\"*** \n\nBut today.  NO GO. Alexa played some random podcast with the word \"Intelligence\" in the title, and some other podcast called simply \"Daily\"  (i.e. not The Daily).  There was no phrasing I could come up with that would work for either one.   \n\nOh - and to top it off, half the time my living room Alexa was responding instead of my Kitchen one -  it seems they fixed that problem around 2017 but it's crept back in. \n\nI use Alexa for home automation (through Hubitat), kitchen timers, and very occasional weather or other questions.  But I'm ready to give up having it play music or podcasts or anything else - I can't spend time memorizing even more complex syntax and it's just easier to control on my phone. What a shame.",

Instead, it played \"One more time\" by Daft Punk. At first I thought it was something in a news clip, but halfway through I realized perhaps not. I ask, \"Alexa, what are you doing?\", *\"Sorry, I'm not sure about that.\"* \"Alexa, Stop. Play my flash briefing.\"\n\nLater that day i got on facebook to see that Daft Punk had announced the end of their band. Maybe a programmer at Amazon wanted to honor their favorite band or something??? Has anyone else had Alexa just do absolutely bizarre things like this?",
  "Does anyone know how to fix echo's weather accuracy? I have read before and only they gave the explanation but not the fix, mostly pointing about account location but my account's location is correct.\n\nYesterday Alexa told me that was gonna be a bright day so I decided to go to work on the bike, and in the way started a heavy raining and ended up soaked at 7 AM; Today it said that was about to be a thunderstorm but currently there is a clear bright sky.",

  "Hey everyone, to provide a little context, I'm helping a disabled individual troubleshoot an Amazon Alexa in their assisted living facility, so I have no physical access to the device. The individual was recently moved to a new room in the facility and is now experiencing some issues with their device. Originally, the Alexa will play podcasts, news, music (Prime Music + Spotify), etc. though at some point (usually around an hour or so later), will stop playing. So the user will request a song, podcast, news, etc., Alexa will respond saying \"Playing ... from Spotify\" (for example), but will not actually play anything. So a response is given, but nothing is actually played. Interestingly, the device WILL play jokes, weather, and even provide information from Wikipedia, but no songs, podcasts, or news. The only way to get the echo to continue playing media is to unplug the device, and plug it back in. But the issue usually re-occurs within an hour. \n\nSome example scenarios:\n\n1. Ask for the Weather: Alexa will return the current weather\n2. Ask for Every Breath You Take by the Police: Alexa will return \"Playing Every Breath You Take on (person's) Spotify\", but nothing actually plays\n3. Ask for a Joke: Alexa says a joke\n\nThe users device is registered to my Amazon account, so I went into the Alexa app and saw an option to continue playing the last thing the user had been listening to. It acts like it is then playing, but it then stops and I get a weird loading prompt, etc. and the user never actually hears anything playing.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is potentially a weak WiFi signal in the users new room. That being said, I'm surprised it will respond and play certain commands, and not others. Does this behavior make sense in the case of a weak WiFi signal? Any other things that we should try? I have confirmed that the device is up-to-date, and all skills are also on the latest version. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

  "Been on the Echo environment for a few years now, but I still can\u2019t believe the simplest of things Amazon just refuses to add or fix. They\u2019re are by far the most out of touch with their customer base. \n\n1) TIMERS: why can\u2019t I ask an echo in another room \u201chow much time is left on timer?\u201d Which I set on the kitchens echo? Always \u201cno timers set\u201d unless you ask the echo you set it on. This makes no sense to me. You also can\u2019t cancel a timer. But once the timer is going off, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter which echo you talk to, it will stop it if you ask it too. So this is deliberate on Amazon\u2019s behalf. \n\n2) ECHO CLOCK: this also revolves around timers and alarms etc. why does the echo clock only display the timer from one device? My clock is in my living room, but if I set a cooking timer in my kitchen I get nothing on the clock. \u2014 only if I set the timer in my living room. Simple Fix Amazon refuses to do. \n\n3) why is it so complicated to do simple things like stop music from playing? I\u2019ll be watching tv and The trigger word will be said, then it opens Apple Music and starts playing music. You\u2019d think \u201cstop music\u201d, or \u201cstop playing music\u201d or even \u201cturn off music\u201d would stop it \u2014 nope. You have to specifically say \u201cstop playing Apple Music\u201d. Again, why complicate it? \u201cStop music\u201d is stop music. \n\n4) this brings me to their limited options for wake words since it\u2019s inception. I have a daughter named \u201cAlexa\u201d, I also watch Star Trek a lot; and anyone that knows that show knows having \u201ccomputer\u201d as a wake word is a no-go. What\u2019s left \u201cecho\u201d, \u201cAmazon\u201d? Both don\u2019t sound native to speaking to something. It\u2019s actually why I choose Amazon echos over Google home at first. \u201cHey Google\u201d sounded so unnatural to start a sentence with. \u201cAmazon, what\u2019s the weather\u201d or \u201cecho what\u2019s the weather\u201d just sounds ridiculous to me. Why does Amazon refuse to add more wake words? This is something I\u2019ve seen asked for for years by a huge number of users, or why not allow us to record our own wake word? It recognizes our voice and words already, so how complicated is it to allow us to record our own? but once again all this falls on deaf ears at Amazon. \n\n5) finally, in regards to their screen equipped echos, like the spot and show. What\u2019s the point of having a 8\u201d screen when the clock is always only using 20% of it? Then of course Amazon refuses to allow anyone to turn off their \u201chave your tried...\u201d and other screens they force you to continually scroll through. Yes, I have disabled all the rotations and disabled the screens they allow me too, but it won\u2019t just display what I want it too. I want a clock on the screen all night, so when I look at it, I see the time, not \u201chey, try saying \u2018call mom\u2019\u201d or say X to see all the things you can ask me to do. Once again, a highly asked for thing to be able to do, yet Amazon refuses. \n\nSome of these things may not apply to you, or maybe they just don\u2019t bother you; but the question remains, what\u2019s so hard about doing these things? Why does Amazon force stupid things on us we don\u2019t want; why does Amazon refuse to make their products work together? \n\nThe \u201ctry saying...\u201d screen I know why they won\u2019t get rid of, it\u2019s because they collect voices and responses from us and use it for their algorithms and probably other data collection purposes. I\u2019ve turned off any and all sharing of my voice to Amazon. But why they won\u2019t sync their products together is beyond me. \n\nAnyways rant over. I think I sorta hear my kitchen echos timer going off; who knows, I can\u2019t tell from any other echo in the house, or the app on my phone, or the app on my watch.\n\nI should add.. users in the US get fixes and features about a year or two before the rest of the world.

It doesn't understand what I ask and then makes a guess, and answers with a complete nonsense or even initiates an action that's not even close to what I said.

  "I have two echo dots in my house. There is a 3rd dot on my Amazon account belonging to my mom, as she is a household member on my Amazon account. I can see and manage her devices on my alexa app-she does not use the app but sets all of her alarms/routines manually.\n\nThe problem I've run into is that I use my alexa as an alarm, occasionally when I turn my alarm off (or when I hit snooze) I will be greeted with my mother's name and the routine she set to go over news, weather, and interesting fact etc. I am not a morning person and do not enjoy this information when I haven't woken up. I've checked and double checked that everything is set to announce from the correct devices, and it has still happened. Does anyone have any ideas?",

Only problem is both my kids have an alarm as well and it plays the weather 3x's! 2x's for each of their alarms and a 3rd time for mine.

  "Has anyone else noticed a change in the way Alexa gives the 7-day weather forecast? It used to give a day-by-day forecast (e.g. Thursday will be sunny with a high of 89 and a low of 74.

Sunday and Monday will see some sun and thunderstorms. Daytime highs will be in the 80's with... etc\"  \n\n\nI've had Echo Dots and Google Homes since launch and am now on the latest versions of each.

  "I know this might be a picky thing, but it seriously annoys me so much when Alexa does the \u201cBy the way...\u201d thing. I think it\u2019s mostly because I usually just want a quick answer without having to wait for Alexa to say her whole spiel about how much she can do for me as an assistant. It\u2019s happened to me twice today: once when turning on the lights and another when I asked her for the weather. It bugs me so much and I wish there was an option to disable it.",

  "So I\u2019ve had my Alexa for nearly 3 years now, no issues. Every night I use the \u201cAmbient Noise\u201d skill to play white noise, and every night it works great. However a few days ago I went to open it like I always do and her response was \u201cGetting it from Fire TV\u201d. So I tried again. Same thing. Tried to get her to open \u201cSleep Sounds\u201d (another skill) and same thing. Asked her for the weather and that was fine, she gave me that. Asked her to do another white noise skill (Ocean Sounds) and she did that.  Asked for the Ambient Noise skill again and same thing. The next night I tried again  and all was well, so I thought it was a glitch, but it\u2019s doing the same thing today. \n\nDoes anybody know why this is happening or how to fix it? I did have a Fire TV Stick I had associated with Alexa, but I\u2019ve given it to my dad and no longer have it, although I can\u2019t delete it from my Alexa app devices menu. However I don\u2019t think this is the problem as it seems to be random and the Fire Stick hasn\u2019t been here since it started doing this.

When I did some searches I found plenty of weather stations that were not Alexa enabled, several indoor only ones that were Alexa enabled, and some that said they had the capability but also seemed to indicate they did a lot of other things and weren't very expensive which to me is a big red flag.

I have also noticed that Alexa is getting confused about which speaker to answer or play on. I did have all my speakers in one group, and at one point I had specified a preferred speaker, but I undid all that when I realized how it actually worked. But it still will sometimes answer me from a far away speaker, or play music on a far speaker. This seems especially true if that speaker is already playing music.

  "**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use a the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called \"Everywhere Turntable\" specifically for that purpose. Now I can use the \"Everywhere\" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue.

It used to get larger when the screen dimmed at night, but as I played with the settings now the screen doesn\u2019t dim anymore. Can I get that back, at least?

  "Morning everyone! \n\nI am exploring alexa as a replacement for my google home devices.  We currently have google smart speakers all over the house, and theyre mainly used for interacting with our smart home control stuff in Home assistant.  I was really pleased when I bought my first alexa device and found that it integrates pretty seamlessly there! \n\nBut a feature I use daily on my google home devices is the \"good morning\" routine.  It does three simple things.  Turns on the lights in the room I am in when I ask it, (by using \"ok google, turn on the lights\") tells me the weather forecast, and then plays a selection of news podcasts ive pre-set in the google home app. \n\nThe problem I'm having is with the podcasts.  Alexa's built in podcast features seem... lacking.  and a lot of things ive read online suggest using a 3rd party skill.  The 3rd party skills dont seem to integrate well with a series of items in a routine, since any custom \"voice command\" in a routine has to be at the end, and you can only have one.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis all doesnt seem like a tall order, so i assume that I am just going about it the wrong way, but I have not been able to find any useful info online.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo any of you power users out there do something similar? and how do you get it done? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

A few weeks ago the living room echo dot stopped behaving, and now responds to the identical request with \"CBC music Edmonton from TuneIn\" and starts playing that station instead. The recording history correctly shows that I asked for Toronto, yet Alexa responds with Edmonton. Today I came downstairs and gave the identical command to another echo dot. This time Alexa says \"CBC radio 1 Sudbury from TuneIn\" and plays that news station. Every single time.\n\nSimilarly, if I tell the echo show to play whatever song \"on the everywhere group\" she usually does so, but when I give the same commands from other echo devices it's hit or miss whether she actually plays on the multi room music group or just the one device.\n\nThese commands all used to work as intended a few months ago. I can't link the change in behaviour to any event or new equipment.\n\nI've checked, and every device has the latest software version.

Example, my one that's set to go off at 10am every day to turn on my lights, give me news and weather updates, and tell me about my day went off at *9am* this morning. I checked all the others I have with a time specific trigger and found out every one of them was an hour off, so I had to manually reset all of them.

  "[**\\*Edit: the Alexa help page has now been updated to reflect the new limitations.***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=GHKNDEFH7JCKX4DB)\n\n**TL;DR -** I just confirmed with Amazon Customer Service that soon Alexa-to-phone calling will be restricted to a pre-chosen list of no more than **10 contacts per Alexa user profile**, unless you have and link an AT&T Wireless or Skype account to your Alexa Communications profile.  Making 'Alexa-to-Alexa' calls (calling between Echo devices, the Alexa app, etc.)  will still of course be unlimited but if you want to call a landline or cellular telephone number you will only be able to choose from your set list of ten chosen contacts.  \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Full Details -** Moments ago I used Alexa to make a toll-free (1-800-number) phone call from one of the Echo Dots in my home, something I do daily/multiple times a day.  As soon as I finished my call and asked Alexa to \"hangup\" I was greeted with a \"By the way...\" notification/response from Alexa which told me the number I had just called was automatically added to my list of ten Alexa-to-phone contacts and to see the Alexa app for more information, to edit my list of ten contacts, or to link an account and still be able to make unlimited Alexa-to-phone calling from my Echo devices.  Confused I opened my Alexa app and was greeted with a \"card\" on the home screen telling me the same things/to click there for more info.  I use my Amazon Alexa devices as my primary outgoing house phone and have since 2017 on my 8 Echo Dots, four Fire HD tablets, and on various computers using the \"Alexa for PC\" Windows app.  I am disabled and being able to depend on using Alexa to make phone calls in my home on my numerous Alexa devices is vital and has been a lifesaver for me - literally - as I am occasionally prone to randomly falling asleep/passing out due to my disability.\n\n*(Long tangent example from a couple of years ago:*  *A couple of years ago this happened while I was showering - I woke up and found myself lying down in my shower in standing water with blood everywhere after having apparently blacked out/slammed my head into/cut a giant gash across my forehead on the sharp corner edge of my marble bathroom vanity sink countertop.  I was completely out of it (a CT scan later confirmed a concussion) and had probably been on the floor for 15 or 20 minutes and was too disoriented to get myself up from the floor.  My cell phone was nearby outside of the shower and I was able to pull myself over to it but the battery was dead and I was too weak and dizzy and bloody to get up and find the charger.  Fortunately I had my Echo Dot in there in that bathroom and so I began trying to get a hole of someone who might be able to help me (since you can't dial \"911\" using Alexa) but no one would answer my Alexa-to-Alexa phone calls (because most people I know who have this capability never really use this feature and would probably be totally confused receiving a call from me via it anyway). Fortunately, after calling numerous contacts from my linked mobile phone address book via Alexa I was finally able to get in touch with an old roommate/good friend and they rushed over immediately and raced me to the ER. I definitely called more than 10 contacts before someone answered.)*\n\nAnyway, the Alexa app said I could link my AT&T or Skype accounts if I wanted to still be able to make unlimited Alexa-to-phone phone calls.  Well that's fine and great, but I use Verizon Wireless as my cellular phone service provider and don't have an AT&T wireless mobile phone or account.  I continued reading through the details and \"More Information\" help sections provided in the Alexa App (text content and screenshots provided below) and then called Amazon Customer Support to see if this terrible news was really true.  While on hold I looked online to see if Amazon had made any press releases about these changes or if any news outlets/tech blogs had written anything about the new restrictive changes to making calls with Alexa but found nothing.  The Amazon representative I spoke with also knew nothing of these changes, nor did the developer/engineering team contact he reached out to as I waited on hold with him on the phone.  He looked through various internal channels/systems and couldn't find any information about these changes either and so I offered to send him screenshots of what I was seeing in my Alexa App and he thanked me and asked if I would please send them.  I sent them while on the phone and he shared them with the engineering team contact he had been talking with about this while I waited.  A while later he did confirm that he had found some information about these changes (basically just the same details that are given in the new help section about this in the Alexa App) and said he would try to find out more information and if he does learn any additional details he'll share them with me via phone or email in the next day or so. He said while it's not uncommon for Amazon to be absolutely terrible about sharing information about big changes/new features/various updates with their team members before going public with the info he did think it was odd that there was next to nothing announced about this and that I had already learned about these coming changes from the Alexa app and said that might have possibly been by accident and apologized.\n\nI hate this and wanted to share this with other Amazon Echo device/Alexa users.  I mean, I understand that it was a free service and that Amazon is not making any money (aside from revenue from the initial device purchase) by allowing people to place unlimited, free phone calls from their Alexa devices, but it's super frustrating for a core feature like this to be restricted without any advanced warning or announcement, especially at a time when most communication/telecommunication platforms and companies are adding *more* capabilities and features/free extra data/etc. to be helpful while we're all feeling and dealing with the challenges of living through a global pandemic.  Super upsetting Amazon would suddenly add restrictions.  I am fine with being required to link my cellular phone service provider account to my Alexa Communications profile/account if that's necessary to keep being able to effortlessly make outgoing phone calls using my Alexa/Echo devices, but if that's the case than other service providers that just AT&T need to be added.  Maybe AT&T is the entity here who pushed for these new restrictions, who knows...  ughhhh.  \ud83e\udd2c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Text/Details and** [**Screenshots of Details from the Alexa App**](https://i.imgur.com/4I11wev.jpeg)**:**\n\nAlexa-to-Phone Contacts\n\nThese are the phone numbers you can make unlimited mobile and landline calls to.

  "Since I got my Echo when it was first released I have had a daily ritual of asking it \"what's new\" or \"play my flash briefing\".   Both of those commands once had the same result, but they have somehow morphed into different things. Regardless, it was through them I learned to love two podcasts.  The Daily, from the New York Times and The Intelligence from the Economist.  \n\nAfter a few years, Flash Briefing and What's New secretly changed and those podcasts no longer played.  But I found I ask for them by name separately so I adapted.  I could just say,   \n\"Alexa - play The Daily\" or   \n***\"Alexa - play The Intelligence\".***\n\nAt some point she didn't recognize \"The Intelligence\" so I adapted my syntax and the only thing that worked was    \n***\"Alexa, play The podcast the Intelligence\"***\n\nSix months late instead of playing The Intelligence from the economist, that command ended up with her playing some random  \"intelligence report\" so I had to modify my syntax again and say   \n***\"Alexa, play the podcast The Intelligence from Tune in\".*** \n\nThen suddenly, instead of playing today's episode, it started picking up where I left off the prior day - not what I want from a daily news podcast.  But Alexa would clearly say \"Resuming where you left off, to play the latest episode, just say \"latest episode\"\". \n\nThat worked a few times..... but a few weeks later when I would say \"Play the latest episode\" it would dump podcast and play some random heavy metal band instead.  Similar issues were creeping in with The Daily. \n\nBut.... I learned....- or Alexa trained me.... So for the past 4 months I've carefully constructed my request -   \n***\"Alexa,- play the latest episode of the podcast The Intelligence from Tune In\"*** \n\nBut today.  NO GO. Alexa played some random podcast with the word \"Intelligence\" in the title, and some other podcast called simply \"Daily\"  (i.e. not The Daily).  There was no phrasing I could come up with that would work for either one.   \n\nOh - and to top it off, half the time my living room Alexa was responding instead of my Kitchen one -  it seems they fixed that problem around 2017 but it's crept back in. \n\nI use Alexa for home automation (through Hubitat), kitchen timers, and very occasional weather or other questions.  But I'm ready to give up having it play music or podcasts or anything else - I can't spend time memorizing even more complex syntax and it's just easier to control on my phone. What a shame.",

  "Hey all,\n\nSo I\u2019ve come up with a pretty cool routine (feel free to copy it!) but I\u2019d like to make it better, so any advice would be appreciated. I listen to the news (audio only) on TuneIn a lot, and the ads are SUPER annoying. I used an Echo button to trigger a routine (see screenshot) that mutes audio on all devices, waits 3 1/2 minutes (typical ad time), and then resumes the news on TuneIn. \n\nBut now I\u2019d be interested in having it fill that 3 1/2 minutes of silence with music or something. Maybe even the first three minutes of my flash briefing? Does anyone know if this is possible? I know I can set it to play audio, but can I set it to play audio for exactly 3 1/2 minutes and then switch back to what I was listening?\n\nAny help would be appreciated! \n\n[Screenshot of Mute Button Routine for Alexa](https://imgur.com/gallery/JfbJkTd)",
  "Is there a way to turn off the Amazon news updates and the Alexa tips, recipes, etc... on the Echo show? I just want to see my pictures",
  "How do I set a routine for Alexa to open \"News by Fire Tv\" app ??",
  "Hope they will be in development soon. \n\nWhat I mean by this is  a routine that can branch into two or more actions based on conditions.  The simplest example would be I say alexa good morning, and if it is a weekday, Alexa does abcdef, but if it is on the weekend Alexa does abcxy.\n\nFor example, when I say good morning,  Alexa turns on the TV and tunes to a specific news channel; I want her to do that each weekday, but I don't watch TV on the weekends so I would prefer she not turn on the TV then.\n\nI could imagine situations where I would like different actions to the same phrase depending on the time of time.",
  "So here the situation. In our room we have a tv on one wall that\u2019s closest to the door... this is important because that means it\u2019s close to the hall where the kids sleep... opposite wall from the tv is our headboard for our bed. On each nightstand we have an echo dot 3rd gen. so basically these echos are about 25 feet from fire tv... I wanted to hook them up as a home theatre so that at night when we want to watcha show we don\u2019t have to crank the sound to hear it in bed... basically, when working, we have the sound come out the echos on our nightstand and can clearly hear the plot of our favourite shows or the news.... \n\nHere\u2019s the issue. That setup will only work about 10 percent of the time then will get all digital then cut out... once cut out there is no way to reenable the sound unless I forget the home theatre set up and do it again... I have tried every combination of the sound settings in the fore tv... low stereo ...hi stereo etc. What I can\u2019t change when enabled is the Dolby digital plus.... is there something I can try to fix this. All devices are varying the latest updates... Wi-Fi signal in my room is decent.... can I hook these up via Bluetooth instead??? Would that help?",
  "Hey everyone, to provide a little context, I'm helping a disabled individual troubleshoot an Amazon Alexa in their assisted living facility, so I have no physical access to the device. The individual was recently moved to a new room in the facility and is now experiencing some issues with their device. Originally, the Alexa will play podcasts, news, music (Prime Music + Spotify), etc. though at some point (usually around an hour or so later), will stop playing. So the user will request a song, podcast, news, etc., Alexa will respond saying \"Playing ... from Spotify\" (for example), but will not actually play anything. So a response is given, but nothing is actually played. Interestingly, the device WILL play jokes, weather, and even provide information from Wikipedia, but no songs, podcasts, or news. The only way to get the echo to continue playing media is to unplug the device, and plug it back in. But the issue usually re-occurs within an hour. \n\nSome example scenarios:\n\n1. Ask for the Weather: Alexa will return the current weather\n2. Ask for Every Breath You Take by the Police: Alexa will return \"Playing Every Breath You Take on (person's) Spotify\", but nothing actually plays\n3. Ask for a Joke: Alexa says a joke\n\nThe users device is registered to my Amazon account, so I went into the Alexa app and saw an option to continue playing the last thing the user had been listening to. It acts like it is then playing, but it then stops and I get a weird loading prompt, etc. and the user never actually hears anything playing.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is potentially a weak WiFi signal in the users new room. That being said, I'm surprised it will respond and play certain commands, and not others. Does this behavior make sense in the case of a weak WiFi signal? Any other things that we should try? I have confirmed that the device is up-to-date, and all skills are also on the latest version. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

  " \n\nGood afternoon Reddit.\n\nSo over Christmas, I purchased 2Amazon echos one for my office one for the kitchen.\n\nI have been enabling lots of different skills and all it great, however, it can sometimes be annoying that the same skills are enabled on all devices, for example, I don't want sports news skill in the kitchen Alexa i just want it in my office alexa as the rest of the family will never use it and when they ask for the news because its enabled they will get sport news regardless.\n\nI know you can just say skip but it can be a pain when there are a few you need to skip through.\n\nBottom line is, Is it possible to separate skills on each device.

I then figured out that Alexa had given me the prior game's score.\n\nI have also had a couple times where I ask what the baseball score was, and it told me it couldn't find any games even though it was during a WS game.\n\nI asked Alexa what a few NFL team's records were and it gave me records that were 1 or 2 weeks out of date.\n\nIn a non-sports related issue, I had five days of the same news update.

  "Hi,\n\nWe\u2019ve long been looking for a way to be able to send quick messages to my mother-in-law. She is absolutely no interest in computers & doesn\u2019t have SMS/texting on her cell phone. \n\nI\u2019ve wondered about a smart assistant device w/ display. We mostly use Google/Nest in our place but I\u2019m also considering the Echo Show. The assisted living facility where she resides has a captive portal free WiFI & they have several of these around for the residents, so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s compatible with their internet.\n\nI have a few questions about the Echo Show that I cannot answer since I don\u2019t yet use it myself:  \n  \nIs there a way that we could send her messages to the Echo Show and have them show up on screen or at least tell her that they are available so she could ask about it? She does NOT have a smartphone but we both have iOS/Android devices so we could use the Alexa app to send messages. Does she have to have a smartphone to receive messages on the Echo Show?  \n  \nWhat would I need to do to set things up so that we could do calling, video calling, and messages via text (I don\u2019t need it to be SMS, just a short message on screen using whatever protocol).   \n  \nWould she also have access to any music on this without paying extra? Our household has Prime but she does not. She wouldn\u2019t want any popular music but might like some older stuff, hymns, etc. Is there a child sharing option for the free Prime Music or video?\n  \nIs there a way we could share photos to her Echo Show?  \n  \nIs there anything else that can be done on the Echo Show without paying a monthly fee or could we attach her to our Prime in some way? I\u2019m wondering about audiobooks, podcasts, video, news, etc. She has no TV or newspaper and isn\u2019t online so this might provide some interesting connection for her.  \n  \nAre there any \u201csafety\u201d features that could be enabled - for instance, if she ever fell in her studio apartment, she could call the Echo for help? I seem to remember this being an option without additional fees.\n  \nAre there any added features that do cost extra and might be worth paying for? If she can\u2019t afford it, perhaps we could take care of that.\n  \nWhat is needed to setup/configure her Echo Show? Can I do it without having one myself? I could maybe get it sent to me first, I guess or are there other options?  \n  \nThanks so much in advance! Sorry for so many questions I just have no way to figure this out myself since I don\u2019t have one (yet!). :)",

  "Hello there, I think this would be a pretty common discussion but I haven't found an answer that satisfies me on Google. I came across a few suggestions, and so far the best one was this:  [https://voicebrew.com/voicebrew-22/](https://voicebrew.com/voicebrew-22/) \n\nI like the idea of a smart assistant, but still find little use for it on a daily basis, and would like to power up my utilization of this device.

Now I just bought a Show (the one with a screen) to place it at the bedroom, with the intention to use it as alarm as well as play music in my bedroom and the tasks that the Google routine has been doing for me on the phone.\n\nHowever, I can't really find other daily uses that I want to do. I'm not currently interested in easter eggs, such as Star Trek's \"Computer\", or some snide question that's bleeped out, or Chuck Norris' facts, which are fun for a few minutes, but after that they are forgotten.\n\nTo put it simple, I'm looking for ideas on stuff I could do normally to start using it a bit more, because my creativity doesn't really go beyond \"Alexa, play music\" or \"Alexa, what's the weather like today\". I'm looking for those hidden gems that are probably there, but I never knew about. Like when I explained to my mother that she could watch TV on the internet through Netflix and she had no clue until then.\n\nAlso sorry if this has been debated to death, I certainly can't find an answer that covers what I really want.",
  "Hello!  I have seven 2nd-generation Echo Dots in my home and about half of these are connected to a Bluetooth speaker (all are connected to the same make/model of speaker, which is a \"Oontz Angle 3 Ultra, made by Cambridge SoundWorks).  I have had no issues using my Echo Dots in multi-room music groups whilst connected to Bluetooth speakers at all, for the past year or so.  Some of the speakers have latency issues/lag, but this was easily fixed with the speaker synchronization feature within the Alexa App, in the settings for Multi-Room music groups.\n\nToday however, one individual Echo Dot goes silent when I ask Alexa to play music on a multi-room music group of which that Dot is a member of.  All the other Dots/BT speakers play fine, but that one speaker is silent.  All dots have the latest firmware, are on the same network, have excellent WiFi signal, etc.  I've hard-reset the Dot, have deleted and recreated the Multi-Room Music Group and have added the Dot back again and it still won't play.\n\nWhen I called Amazon tech support (well, they called me after I'd been on the chat feature with two different associates - you still can't directly call them), I was surprised when the associate told me that multi-room music does not support Bluetooth speakers and that has never been a feature, and that it was only a feature for Sonos speakers because they'd specifically designed mutli-room music to work with Sonos but that in her 2.5 years at Amazon she'd never heard of anyone ever being able to play multi-room music via Echo Dots connected to Bluetooth speakers. This was news to me - why is there even a speaker synchronization feature in the Alexa app then?  The sole purpose of that feature is for Bluetooth speakers, to correct latency issues.  And why are my other Echo Dots working just fine with Bluetooth speakers and multi-room music?  Also, I shared with them [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/9lhofp/new_app_update_says_bluetooth_speakers_can_be_in/) which shows their own update release information clearly stating that multi-room music does now work with Bluetooth speakers.\n\nDoes anyone else have any issues with their multi-room music & Bluetooth speakers?  This is clearly a feature and has been for over a year now.  I found it very strange to be told it has never been a feature.  She checked with her engineering/tech team and they said the same thing - that it's not a feature.  But it is a feature, in the US anyway, and has been since October 2018...",

  "I rather get the feeling that Alexa's developers don't read this subreddit, but, by the way, if I ask Alexa for something simple such as to tell me the time or to tell me the temperature or to set a timer, I do not want Alexa to say, \"By the way,\" and then offer to tell me the news or to tell me the pollen count or to entertain me while \"we\" wait for the timer with a story.\n\nThis is just useless venting, I know.  I have already set Alexa to brief mode.  I have already submitted feedback, multiple times, with the Alexa app.  I have already posted on Amazon's Alexa forum.  I have already tweeted to the stupid Alexa marketing Twitter that only posts pre-scheduled Alexa marketing drivel.\n\nAnd I have also ordered a cheap Google Home device to see if it's as annoying as Alexa.  If it's not, I might throw every Echo I have out and start over with Google.  Though that's probably not going to happen because I'm sure Google Home can be annoying too.",

It's horrible.  Half the time when you ask Alexa to play a specific show she says \"Playing (insert name of show here)\" and then just goes dark/silent.  Once it turned out to be a weird delay because after requesting the show three or four times it started right on cue, and then about 3 seconds later, the same show started again so that both shows were playing simultaneously 30 seconds off...  There is also a podcast  called \"KidNuz\" which is a daily 5 minute \"flash briefing\" of stories and headlines curated specifically for kids, but its nearly impossible to get Alexa to play it because she sees it just as it's spelled (KID-NUZZ instead of Kid News).  When I did get her to play it via Stitcher, even though I had it set up in the favorites list to play newest episodes first, she played episodes from January.  Here are the shows I'd like for my daughter to be able to call up the most recent episodes of whenever she wants:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* KidNuz\n* Wow in the World\n* Eleanor Amplified\n* Warrior Kids\n\nDoes anyone have a good solution for this?

  "Hey guys. Time for another Alexa Newsletter review. Link to the post is at the bottom for more detail.\n\n## Takeaways\n\nHere\u2019s how the new commands break down for this week\u2019s newsletter:\n\n* Donations: 1\n* Timers: 1\n* Information: 2\n* Alexa Skills: 4\n* Smart Home: 2\n* Jokes: 3\n* Music: 3\n* Alarms: 1\n* Audible: 2\n* Productivity: 2\n\nMusic, Audible and ambient sounds are the main themes this week. We have only one updated command for the pandemic, so we\u2019re now seeing a slowdown in updates there.\n\n### Music and Ambient Sounds\n\nMusic and ambient sounds had a big showing this week. Amazon really wants users to know about Alexa\u2019s Ambient Sound abilities. And with added commands for changing the equalizer, we\u2019re seeing more emphasis on music quality.\n\n### Audible\n\nAudible seems to get at least one command each newsletter so far, with this week being no exception. One of the commands is very much a bust, while the other could be useful with your kids at home.\n\nAmazon tends to push Audible too hard on Alexa users. WIth one command, it feels like Amazon is using the notion of \u201cfree\u201d as an opportunity to upsell.\n\n### Alexa\u2019s Xbox Integration\n\nAlexa has very solid integration with Xbox. This isn\u2019t too surprising these days. Microsoft has stopped using [Cortana to compete with Alexa ](https://www.cnet.com/news/cortana-reborn-microsofts-digital-assistant-becomes-less-alexa-more-productivity-app/)which benefits Alexa users in this case.\n\n### Productivity Weaknesses\n\nAmazon has a built-in to-do list with Alexa that doesn\u2019t seem to integrate with any other known productivity systems out there. Although it does work, I find it pretty lacking. Just having a to-do list in Alexa isn\u2019t compelling enough for the average user to switch from a system they already use, like the iOS Reminders App. Amazon needs to step up their game in this space.\n\n### Donation Awareness\n\nThere are many organizations that accept donations that don\u2019t actually use the money for what they say. This week\u2019s donation command is a solid example. Although it says Coronavirus Relief, we don\u2019t actually know where that money is going, or what it\u2019s doing. Amazon doesn\u2019t provide that information. Your dollars may not go to the right people to make an impact.\n\n## Next Newsletter\n\nThat\u2019s all for this week! Let\u2019s see if we get another newsletter before the end of April. I\u2019m thinking a monthly roundup of all the newsletters for the month might be useful, especially if we continue to get a weekly update from Amazon. Let me know if that\u2019s something you would be interested in reading in the comments below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-april-10th/](https://smarthomeexplained.com/keeping-up-with-alexa-april-10th/)",

  "I have a routine on my Echo Dot to wake me up in the morning. It goes like this:\n\n1. Turn on bedroom lights\n2. Say a \"good morning\" phrase\n3. Tell me the weather\n4. Play the news from my Flash Briefing\n\nI bought the Samuel L. Jackson voice yesterday, intending to have him read me the weather and news with my morning alarm routine. However, *after* I purchased it, I learned that in order to have him read me the weather, for example, I can't just say \"what's the weather?\" I have to say something along the lines of \"Ask Sam to read me the weather.\"\n\nI've gone into my routines on the Alexa app to try to find somewhere to type in a voice command as an action, but if that's a possibility, I can't find it. In my routines options I have the option to have Alexa read me the weather, for example, but I can't create a specific command to have Sam read it.\n\nSo basically I'm looking to have my alarm routine do this:\n\n1. Turn on bedroom lights\n2. Say a \"good morning\" phrase\n3. Have the Alexa act as if I've said \"Ask Sam to read me the weather\" (so that he reads me the weather)\n4. Have the Alexa act as if I've said \"Ask Sam to tell me the news\" (so that he reads me the news)\n\nI've read that I can use Tasker and Autovoice with IFTTT to make this happen. I downloaded all three apps, but I can't figure out how to do that. I spent a good hour and a half yesterday trying to figure it out.\n\nCan anyone help me? Thank you :)",

  "I have an echo show 5 and I like to set routines that play the weather and news after my alarm goes off to ease me out of sleep. I would actually prefer this as the alarm, if that's even possible.\n\nThe problem is that there is no option tied with alarms to do this. The only alarm tied option in the routines is \"when alarm is dismissed.\" I try not to dismiss alarms because I only set one, so I end up snoozing them by default.\n\nI currently have the routine set to go off a minute after my alarm rings, but then I have to adjust the routine time manually if I decide to wake up earlier or later in the day.\n\nI know you can use ifttt to tell when an Alexa alarm goes off, but I can only see options to control the hue lights, nothing about Alexa routines. \n\nIs what I want to do possible?",
  "While I am aware of the \"an alarm is dismissed\" trigger in Alexa, I'm wondering if there is any way to dismiss an alarm as an *action* opposed to a *trigger*. An explanation of the two problems I'm trying to address will help if it isn't already clear:\n\n**First,** I like the idea of saying one thing in response to an Alexa alarm in the morning to get my routine started. Right now I'm using the \"an alarm is dismissed\" trigger to begin my routine when I say \"Alexa, stop\" in response to my morning alarm. Some mornings, though, I don't use an alarm and instead say \"Alexa, good morning\" to start the same routine. At present, this requires me to keep two identical routines. Not the biggest deal, but a tad annoying when making adjustments to the routine and having to do it twice. The **second** more unforgivable problem is sacrificing the ability to use alarms at any other time of the day, lest I trigger the morning wake up routine. If I set an alarm for anything else later in the day, I consequently end up changing my room lighting, playing the news, etc. \u2060\u2014 not desirable.\n\nThe solution to both of these problems would be to add a \"silence current alarm\" action within my morning wake up routine. Unfortunately I have not found such an action in the Alexa app nor have I found any advice online. Has anyone else arrived at this issue and/or have a suggestion on how to accomplish this?",

  "I have a very specific issue with Alexa I hope someone can help with. In the meantime, I think I have found a work around - I added the NPR Up First specific skill to Alexa and rather than using the \"play music/podcast\" action, I tell it to play a news briefing (with just Up First as my only active source).\n\nFor the past year, I've been using a morning routine called \"Start my day\" in Alexa via my Sonos One. The routine is really simple. First it tells me the weather. Then it plays \"Up First\" which is a daily news podcast (about 10 minutes long) via Tune In. This has always worked well but starting a few months ago, it would play the exact same episode over and over. I would have to manually go in and correct it. The only special thing about this particular episode is it is a special report, that is not part of the normal daily briefly. In other words, Up First has 1 episode a day, but this was an investigative report that was a bonus. \n\nAnyway, has anyone experienced anything similar? A routine that doesn't play the latest episode/news briefing, but instead gets stuck on a particular one?\n\nThank you.",

  "The iOS version of the cloud intelligence app, which I use to control 4 plugs via alexa, got an update which forced me to log back into it.  This isn't unusual, plenty of apps will do this sometimes when they update, but when I tried to log back in, it refused.  It kept telling me I had either my email or password wrong.  They weren't wrong and trying to do a password reset told me that they couldn't even find the account!   I hoped into an old android tablet, loaded the app and was able to login just fine, so I couldn't figure out what was happening.  Also, the plugs continued to work under alexa.  After some testing I found out that the only way to get the app to load under iOS was to create a new account, but using my phone number.  After the new account was made, the app then asked for local network, bluetooth and location permissions.  Once I got to the main screen, I used the app on the android tablet to grant the new account on the iphone access to the same devices.  So now I have to use two accounts just to access these plugs using their app which I can't add any to unless i use the android tablet to do so.  \n\nWhen I get some time, I'll remove the plugs from the android side and add them one by one to the iOS side (using the new app) and then I'll switch the account alexa and google use to control them, but what a hell to go through just because they made one change on the iOS side.  This new app won't accept an email address for the user name, even though it's supposed to and does on the android app!

I called Amazon tech support, and they had me verify that the correct street address was shown for each device. The problem continued. So, they had me do a hardware reset on one device, then set it up again in the Alexa app on my phone. That device now gave me weather alerts for my apartment complex's name, not the wrong apartment complex. I had to go through the same procedure for the other Echo Dot. Apparently, when you set up an Echo Dot, it gets your physical address, probably through cell tower locations instead of the phone's GPS, because the initial setup when I bought the devices had my location incorrect.

For instance, does the sidewalk feature really work well? My kitchen is centrally located and I have a Ring floodlight camera above my garage which is at the other end of the house. Both the Echo 4th Gen and the Ring floodlight have sidewalk enabled. Do you think the Echo 4th Gen is actually communicating with the Ring floodlight via sidewalk? Would I see a drop in stability with my floodlight cam since in theory the Echo 4th Gen can communicate with it over longer distances using sidewalk?\n\nI\u2019m also not sure if the Echo relays signal to other smart devices like my hue bulbs. \n\nOverall - I\u2019m not 100% sure what connectivity features of the Echo are actually being utilized and if sidewalk is that great to begin with. I wouldn\u2019t replace it with a Sonos One if those features actually do something or do you think I would even notice? Just not sure how impactful sidewalk actually is.",

Also video chatting on Show 5 i always get complaints that people can't hear me, again, because i'm talking to the front of it not the top of it.\n\nIf the show 15 has front facing Mic's i'd be interested in replacing my 5 with a 15.  But if the 15's got crappy mics like the 5, it's a hard pass .",

  "I have yet to implement some of these, but I was considering daisy chain routines-toggling-routines for higher order logic.\n\n**Goal AND Logic:** if Condition A, AND Condition B, AND Condition C, then Routine D Triggers Action\n\n**How**:\n\n* Routine A1 - if presence of Condition A, enable Routine B1\n* Routine A2 - if absence of Condition A, disable Routine B1\n* Routine B1 - if presence of Condition B, enable Routine C1\n* Routine B2 - if absence of Condition B, disable Routine C1\n* Routine C1 - if presence of Condition C, enable Routine D\n* Routine C2 - if absence of Condition C, disable Routine D\n* Routine D - if Trigger, then Action (add a cool down period)\n* Routine E - Any trigger (ie time of day) resets system by disabling Routine B1 and C1\n\n**Where it breaks**: For this logic to work Condition A must happen before Condition B, then before Condition C. Also Condition A through C will have to happen a second time (in order) once Routine D is triggered, to trigger Routine D again. Satisfaction of Conditions A-C cannot persist.\n\nExecution will be slightly more difficult because custom actions to disable routines must be done as separate routines.\n\n**Complex examples**:\n\n* If Button 1 is pressed, then Button 2 is pressed, then Button 3, then Button 4 (in other words, a password is entered), the front door will unlock.\n* If the forecast calls for rain, an wake up alarm is dismissed between 0400 and 0800, then the front door is opened, Alexa says \"Don't forget to bring an umbrella to work\" with a cool down period of 12 hours. Resets at 11 PM. IFTTT required for weather integrations.\n\n**Simple examples**:\n\n* If location leaves house, then motion is detected inside the house, play Security Alarm Siren and send a drop-in notification \"Intruder detected\"\n* If location arrives home, then use a time trigger to set the thermostat to cool to XYZ (Scheduled thermostat settings while home only)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Goal OR Logic:** If Condition A OR Condition B, then Routine D Triggers Action\n\n**How**:\n\n* Routine A1 - if presence of Condition A, enable Routine D\n* Routine A2 - if absence of Condition A, disable Routine D\n* Routine B1 - if presence of Condition B, enable Routine D\n* Routine B2 - if absence of Condition B, disable Routine D\n* Routine D - if Trigger, then Action\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nYes, you can (and I have) use routines to toggle routines. You can disable/enable routines by voice command if you give them a simple name. Name Routine D in the above examples a two digit number only (i.e. '11'), then use the Custom Commands for your Routine A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2 logic with the explicit language 'Alexa, turn off the ## routine' or 'Alexa, turn on the ## routine.'",

Siri Shortcuts doesn\u2019t do this as far as I know. \n\n5) in the \u201cAlexa\u201d app we have location services for such things as weather, but not for the use of smart home devices.

When you go out of your geofenced area the lights could turn off or when you come home they turn on to the desired setting with a routine. \n\n5) Make volume on echo devices a percentage rather than 1-10 for more flexible volume control when using \"Alexa\".\n\n6) Make timers alert on multiple Echo and mobile devices in case you are away from the echo you made the time on. \n\n7) Support all smart home cameras for Live view in the \"Alexa\" App.",

  "Hey y'all, hoping I can get help in resolving a very infuriating situation. Let me go over the topography:\n\n* I have 2 properties, let's call one *Garfield* and the other *Mark*. They are about 6 hours away from each other and before the Pandemic, I would spend part of the week in one and the rest of the week in the other.\n\n* In *Garfield*, I have just an Echo Dot. In *Mark*, I have an Echo Dot, 2 x Echo Shows, and 2 x Echos.\n\n* Each property has their own respective Hue Hubs to control Hue lights - i.e. one hub at *Garfield* and the other at *Mark*.\n\n* For property *Garfield* with *Garfield_Hue_Hub*, I have Hue bulbs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 along with a Hue Dimmer Remote.\n\n* For property *Mark* with *Mark_Hue_Hub*, I have Hue bulbs A, B, C, D, E, and F along with a Hue Dimmer Remote.\n\nTable:\n\nProperty | Hue Hub | Bulbs | Accessories\n-|-|-|-\n*Garfield* | *Garfield_Hue_Hub* | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 | Hue Dimmer Remote\n*Mark* | *Mark_Hue_Hub* | A, B, C, D, E, F | Hue Dimmer Remote \n\nNote that until June 2020, I only had items in *Garfield*. It wasn't until July 2020 that I started outfitting *Mark* with Hue stuff.\n\nThis past weekend, I, for the first time in over 6 months, returned to my *Garfield* property to find my Hue lights weren't being recognized by Alexa.\n\nI noticed Alexa group *Garfield_Room_1* had lights 1, 2, A, B. I edit the group and remove A and B and added bulbs 3-6. However, upon saving, bulbs 3-6 are not added. Instead, bulbs A-C are. I remove bulbs A-C and save. That just leaves bulbs 1 and 2 which is fine since those 2 are in the correct group, in the correct location. I go back in and add bulb 3, hitting \"Save\" and intending to add all *Garfield*-specific bulbs individually. Instead, Bulb A gets added. Repeat this multiple times until I get frustrated and unlink the skill and re-link it and run discovery. That seems to work and I'm able to add all *Garfield*-specific bulbs to the group and eventually control them.  \n  \nHaving returned to *Mark*, I am experiencing the exact same thing, except at this property! In *Mark_Room_1*, I have lights A, B, 2, 3, 4. Just like in *Garfield*, I removed lights 2, 3, and 4 and lights A and B remain, exactly as it should be. I go to add light C to the group, hit save, and light 2 is added. Repeat this multiple times with the same result - I am unable to add lights C-F as lights 2-6 get added whenever I save.  \n  \nWhen I tell Alexa to \"turn on *Group*\" (in property *Mark* with *Group* having just light F), I am met with \"Sorry the hub that device *Group* connected to is not responding. please check its network connection and power supply.\" However, I can turn on the individual light F.  \n  \nLooking in Alexa's groups for the property (*Mark*), I don't see a group called \"Hallway\". So I create a \"Hallway\" group and add light F to it. Upon saving, Alexa is showing \"Hallway\" as having light 4. I just tried, now, to add light F to the \"Hallway\" group but only light 4 persists. She somehow thinks light 4 *is* light F.\n\n  \n**Regarding Hue**  \n  \nWithin the Hue app, I have 2 bridges with \"Out of home control\" enabled. I did read the little notice regarding \"Out of home control\", namely \"Note that per account you can only use one Hue Bridge\". I interpret this as you can only control one bridge at a time, which is on par with my experience. Both bridges are Gen 2.  \n  \nI am incredibly frustrated. Can someone tell me what the hell I'm doing wrong? Note that I will be crossposting to /r/Hue to see if anyone over there has any ideas as well. This is incredibly frustrating and any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

  "I've been away from home for the last several weeks and have a camera set up in my living room. I checked in on it the other day and, by chance, toggled the mute off and heard music playing. It was pretty loud, which was concerning. I was like, has this been going on since I left? Are the neighbors going to kill me? Based on the volume, I guessed it was playing through my Sonos speaker (which is hooked up to an Echo Dot for voice control). I was able to disable the Sonos speaker remotely, which seemed to stop the music. A friend then stopped by and unplugged the Sonos. There was definitely no music playing when he showed up. \n\nHowever, I checked back in today and sure enough the music was playing again, quieter this time. In my Alexa app, it showed Spotify playing through the Dot. Both instances have been around the same time of day (morning), so it seems like a routine? But I only have two routines set up--one to turn lights on and one to turn them off, both in the evening. There is nothing related to Spotify or music. And music was not playing when I left. \n\nWhat the hell is going on? I don't think it's a Sonos issue because I don't think there even are routines through Sonos (though the app is disabled unless I'm on my home wifi so I can't check it). I use Spotify on my phone and laptop in my current location, but the music playing at my home is nothing I've ever listened to (that I can recall). I don't see anything off in the Alexa app, but it's so bloated that it's very possible I'm missing something.\n\nAny ideas, besides ghosts?",

  "Okay, this is bizarre and unsettling...I am going to be super detailed.  I seriously didn't know whether to put this here or the paranormal reddit lol  \n\n\nWe have Alexa devices throughout our house.  Occasionally we'll get a random delivery ding, but they're otherwise well behaved.  Last night when I got home from work, my wife and I were sitting in our living room discussing our days.  The tv was turned down low, the house was quiet.  In the living room is an Alexa device; five feet from where we were sitting.  Adjoining the living room is a large dining room (no Alexa) and adjoining that is our kitchen (Alexa Show).  There is 20 feet and two walls separating the living room where we were seated and the kitchen Alexa device.  \n\n\nAs we were chatting in the living room (point of reference, you cannot hear conversations in the living room from the kitchen) Alexa in the kitchen starts sounding like it is having a conversation.  WTH?  Right?  So I get up and walk towards the kitchen when it starts to play what I would later learn was a song called \"Sad!\" by XXXTentacion.  (Another point of reference, I've never listened to the artist and have certainly never asked Alexa to play him or his song).  I told Alexa to \"stop\" and it did.  I returned to the living room, \"Well, that was bizarre.\"  And laughed it off.  I really figured it had glitched or something.  \n\n\nSo, as I'm laying in bed last night, I found myself thinking about it.  And then the thought hit me, \"The app keeps track and records whatever triggers Alexa.\"  So I pulled it up.  \n\n\nSure as shittin' there was a recording of a voice that said, \"Alexa play Sad\".  A song by a dead rapper about suicidal thoughts.  Super.  Here's the really creepy part; the voice sounds like me.  If you played the recording without the preceding events and asked me who was on the recording, I would have a hard time denying it was me; except, you know, I've never uttered those words to Alexa...or anyone for that matter.  \n\n\nI called Amazon this morning and the rep's response was, \"Oh no, no, no.  Nope.\"  She thought it was creepy too.  They are \"investigating\" and I haven't heard anything back yet.  \n\n\nAfter the call, I decided to do an experiment.  The recording has a lot of interference in it, so I decided to wake Alexa from various distances and locations.  Afterwards, I would play back the recording.  In each of the experiments, the recording was crystal clear.  I even woke Alexa through an exterior door from the porch and standing a few feet from an exterior window; crystal clear.  \n\n\nAnyone have any thoughts?  Have my devices been compromised?  Do I need holy water?",
  "Hey everyone, I recently changed from google to Alexa, and I\u2019m having some problems setting the smart home devices on the new app. \nOne of them is the smart plug from Xiaomi. \nIt used to work just fine with google, but if doesn\u2019t work with Alexa.

While I engaging in a conversation, I suddenly realized that she had found the device, and was giving me instructions, I think as to how to phrase my voice commands, but I missed more than half of what she said, and I am really curious as to the details of the announcement.     \nI made some educated guesses and got the device responding to my voice commands, but I am really curious to hear or read exactly what she said. Obviously, asking Alexa to repeat what she said didn't work, so I turned to Activities in the Alexa app and could find nothing relevant there.  \nDoes anyone know if verbal announcements and instructions like these are recorded and retrievable somewhere? And if so, where can I find them?",
  "Just Watch - Voice App (International Edition)\n\nA couple days ago, i [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/giyc1s/i_made_this_alexa_and_googlehome_voice_app_to/) about a voice app i created for Google Home and Alexa. The response was overwhelming and i received a ton of great suggestions, feature requests & around \\~2k users. Hell, the post got so popular that [Android Police wrote an article about it](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/14/you-can-now-talk-to-justwatch-on-google-assistant/)!\n\nSo i got serious and **gave the voice app some superpowers** and i'm back with a shiny new version. Here's the complete description of what this voice app can do now.\n\n# \u2b07\ufe0f Install\n\nIf you have it already installed, you're good. Don't need to do anything. You'll automatically get these new features when you invoke it again. Otherwise,\n\n* Amazon Alexa/Echo devices - [Download/Enable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088FJ7W1M)\n* Google Assistant on your Phone/Google Home devices - [Download/Enable](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/0000006c8cbb036a)  (not really needed, it just works.. read below)\n\nP.S : You can fire up Google Assistant app on your phone and say \"Talk to Just Watch\" to start using this without installing anything. Seriously. Try it NOW!\n\n## \u269b Features\n\n* Find where to stream your favourite movies and tv shows in an instant. No more logging into each of Netflix, Prime Video et al to check where a movie or tv-show is available.\n* Direct, one-shot Invocation for Alexa (Google Home soon, hopefully) - Eg: \"Alexa, ask Just Watch to search for The Matrix\"\n* Ability to specify your preferred country, regardless of your device language or location.\n* Ability to Limit search results to your preferred offer types (subscription/rent/purchase).\n* Ability to announce prices with offers.\n\nMore details [here](https://vinaywadhwa.github.io/just-watch-voice/) !",
  "Hello,\n\nI had to unplug my hive hub and hue hub today to a different location and now alexa is being awkward with hive commands.\n\nI can no longer say alexa turn my heating off and it does it, instead she says you have hive enabled do you want to open it and then if I try instead alexa ask hive to turn my heating off she just beeps at me but doesn't do it.\n\nAny ideas on how to fix? Tbh I want to get the original commands working as I don't want to \"ask hive\" to do anything.\n\nThank you",
  "So I have one Amazon account, setup with my student discount. I setup my parents home with smart lights and Echos and such. I recently bought a new place of my own and I\u2019m looking to give myself the same setup with smart lights and Alexa devices. Is there a way to setup a second home in the IOS Alexa app? Seems impossible to create a second home location and I don\u2019t want to mesh the echo devices between two separate homes. Any advice or solutions?",
  "Originally I assumed it was my wi-fi connection, and fiddled with that for awhile to improve the signal, but that didn't help. My other Alexa devices are located *further away* from my router than my Echo Show, and they all work fine -- so I'm starting to doubt that it's a wi-fi issue?\n\nAnybody have any pointers? Thanks!",
  "I tried reinstalling but it doesn't help. I live in Germany but I want my Alexa app to be in English. My phone, amazon account and all locations are set to UK. \n\nWhenever I tell alexa to play music or news she starts playing German stations...\n\nAny idea what might be causing this?",

  "I had my echo dot in my room since I got it, but was gifted a google home and decided to give my Dot to my mom. The device is now located in the room next to mine. Problem is that Alexa REFUSES to use my moms phone for Spotify, only mine. My mom does not have premium and I do; but I don\u2019t think that matters. I deleted the Alexa app off my phone, forgot the device on both my phone and Spotify, and even deregistered the device from my Amazon account and switched it to my moms, and STILL when we ask her to play a song, it switches right back to Spotify on my phone. I have dug through settings on her phone and mine and I cannot figure out why she will only use my Spotify despite me trying to sever all ties. Can anyone help??",
  "I started having issues with Alexa loading. The screen comes up, but the ability to press anything and do anything lags behind a SOLID minute. So I tried deleting the app and reinstalling, which is annoying because I have to re add Echo Auto .... I was so flustered that I actually FACTORY RESET MY PHONE over this. That didnt help, and in top of it not helping my routines are not behaving correctly.  Some actions in the routine happen and some dont. And routines triggered by location dont work AT ALL. I feel like I have gone above and beyond what should have to be done and I have a LOT of money and my time invested in the Amazon/ Echo/Alexa environment. What do I do now? I am pretty tech savvy and I am at my wits end here.",
  "I got my first Echo 2-3 years ago.  It was limited in what it could do but it got things right most of the time.  I feel like now the goal is to have *some* answer, rather than the right answer.  And there are tasks that it just seems to struggle with that are fairly simple.\n\nExample:  I have a Vizio TV (named \"Vizio TV\") and I use the PlutoTV app a lot.  If I say \"Alexa, open PlutoTV on Vizio TV.\" I may get a response saying there are several skills that could work, or it may say it doesn't understand, or it may launch it and say \"Getting PlutoTV on Vizio Smartcast.\"  OK, fine... So next time I say \"Open PlutoTV on Vizio Smartcast\" and it has no idea WTF I'm talking about again.\n\nHue Lights are another struggle for Alexa.  I'll have to repeat myself several times and sometimes she just plain ignores me.\n\nAlso, she'll answer a question just because the response has ONE single word that matches what I asked, usually prefaced by, \"According to another Amazon customer.\"  Is there a way I can turn that feature off?  Because I could not care less about the opinion of another Amazon customer when I'm trying to get the answer to a question.\n\nFinally, she's going deaf.  I'll be standing 1' from my Echo downstairs and talk in normal voice and the one on the 2nd floor in my bedroom will respond?  How TF do you confuse the location on these two.\n\nIn short.  I have several Echos and I am starting to hate them.  It's getting to the point where they are more of a frustration than helpful.\n\n**ETA:** I forgot about this annoyance until just now.  Her rambling answers to simple questions.\n\n*Alexa, what is the date of this Friday?*\n\nFebruary 29th, also known as Leap Day or Leap Year Day, is a date added to most years that are disivible by four such as 2016, 2020, and 2024.

  "ALEXA AND FEIT SMART BULBS\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI have been working on home automation with Alexa for 2 yrs. Last year I bought my first Smart product: 4 Feit Multi-Color 60 watt LED WiFi bulbs. I live in a one bedroom apartment and placed 1 in bedroom, 2 in Living room (30 ft on ends of room) and 2 in Kitchen (in one overhead fixture-2 light sockets.) Setup and connection was great. Save for one issue, my lack of attention. Once I resolved my user error ( I replaced the old bulb with the same old bulb instead of the new WiFi Fiet. Then spent an hour trying to get it to connect.) Once the correct bulb was in, connection was easy. I followed the instructions for connecting to Alexa, success. Created routines, grouped based on room location and, with the exception of one issue, no complaints and  no other problems with Alexa, Fiet or lighting. \n\nISSUE: I have a hard time keeping the Fiet app and Alexa synced about what is going on with the two lights in one fixture in the Kitchen. Originally, I did not have these grouped so I grouped them. I\u2019ve disconnected/reconnected the bulbs to Wi-Fi. I have done a reset many times for Alexa. I even tried changing their names so the word Kitchen was not in multiple groups and devices. No matter what solution I\u2019ve tried within a week of any fix, Alexa will start doing a multitude of things with these 2 lights. Ex.: I give command to turn Kitchen on/off and they don\u2019t come on/off (this comes with Alexa reporting the task complete), or one comes on/off and one does not. Sometimes Alexa says she doesn\u2019t recognize the device, or can\u2019t find it, but it  is connected and discoverable. Once in a while I get silence, like Alexa didn\u2019t hear anything, despite me standing 3 feet from my Alexa sound bar. If I do nothing about this issue it will continue to get more frequent until I\u2019m having to run Kitchen lights manually from my phone every time. This is usually fixed by doing a reset on Alexa. But again it only lasts about a week before it starts again. The kitchen lights are located closest to my router of any of the bulbs. Although they are slightly behind it but with nothing (wall, cabinets, etc.) obstructing. \n\nAnyone have any suggestions of a fix for this issue? So I can be 100% satisfied with my lighting system! Trying to work this out because I bought 4 more bulbs that will be 2 per lamp, located close to each other like the Kitchen. I\u2019m hoping avoid this issue on the additions.  Other automation available: Siri Shortcuts, Appelscript, Mac Automator, IFTTT. All suggestions appreciated .",

  "We have two locations we use Alexa.   Currently we are using WeMo outlets and when adding devices at either location Alexa recognizes outlets at both locations which makes things quite messy and confusing in the Alexa app.   For instance if I\u2019m at location A, the Alexa app shows all of the WeMo outlets at location B and shows then as unresponsive.  Not the same situation with Sonos as Alexa only shows the Sonos devices at each location.  \n\nAre there any smart outlets that respect location or any suggestions as to how I resolve this?",

  "Hey guys, I've been in love with my Philips Hue bulbs paired up with my Alexas but one light stopped being paired one day.

I tested this by removing the plus from the \u201ceverywhere\u201d group and that group then appeared in Spotify, but then disappeared again when I re-added the device.\n\nThe even stranger thing is that the \u201ceverywhere\u201d group still works to play an internet radio station on all the speakers, just not Spotify.\n\nI\u2019m pulling my hair out trying to figure out what has changed so any help would be appreciated!",

  "Hi,\n\nI am setting up my Smart Home having recently moved into a new property and thought perhaps Alexa would be a good way forward to become the primary voice assistance, after days of trying I've come to the conclusion that while the Echo devices are in general pretty good and have lots of skills and great integration with Home Assistant (with Alexa Media Player) that for natural voice control Alexa just doesn't cut it and for this I just don't want to compromise.\n\nWhat I have found is that for some crazy reason and even through Alexa knows she is in a specific room (or Group) with a set of named devices that there is no logic check that if I request a device with a device that has the same name elsewhere inside and outside of that group Alexa can't handle it and will flip flop between switching that device or the other... its crazy and very frustrating.\n\nHere is the setup:-\n\n**Group: Living Room**  \nLiving Room Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nTable Lamp  \nFloor Lamp  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both lamps above passed through from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Hall**  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Master Bedroom**  \nMaster Bedroom Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \nBedside Lamp 1  \nBedside Lamp 2  \n*Lamps* (light group that contains both bedside lamps passed from Home Assistant)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Bedroom 2**  \nBedroom 2 Echo (This is inside the group)  \nTV  \n*Lamp*  \nPlay Right (hue lights)  \nPlay Left (hue lights)  \nMain Light\n\n**Group: Landing**  \n*Lamp*\n\nHere is what happens:-\n\n**Lamps example**  \nI know that currently Alexa can't distinguish between Light and Lamps say either one and all the lights come on in the room, so to get round that have a specific lamps device that is a light group exposed to Alexa from Home Assistant.\n\nSo I walk into the Master Bedroom and I say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and she turns on the lamps because there is a light in the Master Bedroom called lamps... great it works there, I turn the lamps off with the command... it works. Next I go downstairs into the Living Room and say \"Alexa, turn on the lamps\" and the lamps don't come on and its like nothing has happened BUT actually it has cause shes actually turned on the lamps in the Master Bedroom with that command despite it being requested from the Echo in the living room group which also has a device called lamps. \n\nNow within the Living Room say \"Alexa turn on the Living Room lamps\" and the lamps come on, why does it need Living Room Lamps, she knows she is in the living room group.\n\n**TV Example**\n\nExactly the same scenario above but with TV, I say in the Master Bedroom \"Alexa turn on the TV\" but nothing happens in the Master Bedroom but it does in the Living Room cause she's turned on the TV in there. If I stay in the Master Bedroom and say \"Alexa, turn on the Master Bedroom TV\" it works fine calling that specific group for that specific device.\n\n**What I tried**\n\nResetting Alexa, Deleting All Devices from the APP and the Alexa website, renaming all devices so they would be unique enough (Master Bedroom TV, Master Bedroom Lamps etc) and no matter what I've tried I run into an issue. \n\n**My Conclusion**\n\nOf course course I could name things like Table Lamp, Floor Lamp 1, Floor Lamp 2 which is fine to control individually and that works but if your a guest or if you don't know the house then you need to know what that these commands are and then it requires three voice commands or more, then another three to dim those lights because I can't just ask Alexa to set the lamps to 50% so she controls that light group from Home Assistant.\n\nIf you want natural voice control that is going to be intuitive to people that interact with Alexa it seems thats not possible.\n\nGroups seem somewhat pointless and to be able to put Alexa into that group so she is group aware if the logic is to first look at all of the devices attached outside of the group first and then just action on that first device with that name rather than staying within the group first and controlling that device and only going outside of it when a specific group device is called.. from the Master Bedroom.. Alexa turn off the Living Room lamps.\n\nI can then only imagine this getting worse the more devices that are added.\n\nI like the echo speakers and the integration with Home Assistant but if such a simple thing can't work then its out, I have been testing with HomePod Minis too and with this same setup in HomeKit and it seems to work exactly as expected one voice command for Lights, Lamps and controlling them in the room I am requesting them for.\n\nIts a shame I have to return my 5 Echos as I had some good automations and TTS setup with them and actionable notifications but they where primarily for voice control and Alexa has failed to integrate on this occasion.",

I want the little hygrometer in my cigar humidor, so I can check on its humidity from anywhere, any time verbally through my Alexa smart home.\n\nIt WAS working with a Chinese no name sensor I had for about two weeks until last weekend.

It wouldn\u2019t respond to stop, turn off or any commands.\n\nAlexa does something wrong or incorrectly maybe 30-40% of the time. There\u2019s still not the simplest feature to limit her talking (brief mode does nothing) or uncouple her volume level from your music volume.

I was wondering if anyone has the same/similar situation with an Alexa-only device and was able to find a workaround with IFTTT, Tasker, etc. I'm heavily invested in the Google ecosystem (4 minis, 2 displays, 1 full size speaker, Chromecasts, Pixel Phone, etc.) so I don't feel buying a cheap echo would be practical.

  "Hi guys\n\nWhat is the best way to manage my commands?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Create all scenes in SmartThings, import to Alexa and just create a routine for each one so they triggers them using voice?\n* Or create in SmartThings only the commands not compatible with Alexa and create all the rest in Alexa Routines?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr is there a better option?

  "First, I am quite new to the Alexa app and automation in general. So forgive me if this is a basic question, but I can't find an answer to this exact situation.\n\nI have:\n\n* a four-head mini split A/C+heat system (Senville brand)\n* the Alexa Android app\n* NO Alexa device (e.g. Echo)\n* NO \\[separate\\] smart thermostat(s)\n\nThe mini split system has plug-in dongles that are Alexa capable. I got them all plugged into all four head units and connected to wifi, and the Alexa app on my phone recognizes them.\n\nWith the Alexa app itself, I can go into each of the four devices, turn it off/on, set the temperature, set the mode, and set the fan level. Basic but perfectly functional for what I need.\n\nI have also created routines so that each unit can turn on and off at predetermined times. Great!\n\nBut while I can adjust the temperature in the Alexa app on the phone, there is no option that I see when creating a **routine** to change the temperature. It's simply a binary on/off.\n\nNow, I won't invest in smart thermostats. It's not worth it to me, since I have most of what i need already. But am I missing something? Is there a way to get an app or enable some function or skill that will allow me to set the temperature on each unit **in a routine**, in addition to turning it on/off?\n\nThe basic idea is that, in winter for example, I want to turn down the bedroom but keep it at some minimum temperature (say 60F) all day until bedtime. I don't necessarily want to turn it off entirely.\n\nThanks for your help.",
  "I recently moved in with a friend, her house is already set up with alexa and I brought mine. I have attempted to connect my system to hers so I can control the lights without going into her bedroom but I have no clue what I'm doing.

It gives back kinda silly responses but fine.  \n\nThe problem now though is that they can\u2019t use any other Alexa device in the house.

I think this can be done in an alarm, but I don't see how to cause an alarm to wake with a radio station.

There is NO connectivity issues with any other devices in the house and I have a high end prosumer level router with gigabit synchronous fibre.   Connectivity isn't an issue.   Even if I reboot the router and related Alexa units they often fall offline again sometimes only *minutes* later.

  "I have a Prime account and my wife is part of my \"Amazon household\" to share all the benefits and our digital purchases. Maybe I misunderstood how Alexa works, but I assumed part of that \"household\" sharing extended to Alexa.\n\nSo we each have the Alexa app installed and we can control the smarthome features and see all of the Echos in the house.\n\nThere are however 2 big problems:\n\n1. Every new device seems to need to be added by BOTH of our Alexa apps. Otherwise, saying \"Alexa turn on the X light\" will only work for the person who added it (e.g. me) and the other person would first need to say something like \"Switch to <other> account\" first. Same goes for grouping devices into rooms. We can get out of sync if her app says light 1 is in room 1 but my app says light 1 and light 2 are both in that room, then turning on/off room 1 will do different things.\n2. Spotify is a mess with 2 accounts. I tried adding my Spotify to \"my default music\" and my wife added her Spotify. But then when we try to say \"Play X on Spotify\" or \"Play X on Y's Spotify\" it always defaults to my account. For now I've unlinked my account so only my wife has it linked. But that is bad too because I can't even go to the Spotify app and select any of the Alexa devices to play on.\n\nSo is there a better way to setup Alexa in the house for 2 people? I saw recently (not sure if this was always a setting) that there is a \"family\" setting in the app where it shows my profile only (not my wife). And her's shows just her profile and not mine. Should I add a profile for her? Would she be able to manage that profile? Or would Alexa still be in this weird split brain mode?\n\nIdeally I'd like:\n\n1. We both have our Spotify accounts linked and can play music from our accounts on the Alexa. With a default to her account with \"Play X on Spotify\" voice commands\n2. Our smart home devices work after setting them up once.\n3. We each have the app on our phone to control devices/view the shopping list/etc.",

  "Hello,\n\nPreviously I was using only one Echo Dot 4th Gen to control my smart home devices. I give 15-20 voice commands on a daily basis. Occasionally, I've noticed that alexa becomes unresponsive, but very sporadically and then it fixes itself. Here is how it always goes. For e.g. If I said \"Alexa\", the blue light appears, I say \"What's the time\", the blue light remains On for about 10-15 seconds, but Alexa doesn't respond.\n\nI say \"Alexa\" again, the same thing repeats.\n\nHowever, on the 3rd time, I've noticed that it does becomes responsive and starts working. It's like they've built some reset for the 3rd time internally.\n\nIt works but this unreliability that happens once or twice a day was getting very annoying. So I decided to buy another Echo Dot and make the setup \"highly available\", as in if this issue occurs in 1 device, the other device should pick it up.\n\nAfter this, the issue reduced by half, but didn't completely go away.\n\nThere is no problem with my internet as I am able to easily stream 4k videos without issues. It could be that there is too much interference in my room and that echo dot isn't designed to properly handle it.\n\nSo I was wondering, is there a 1st party/3rd party alexa voice assistant speaker that supports ethernet and is relatively inexpensive? I believe an ethernet would get rid of any interference.\n\nThe Sonos One and Fire TV Cube are too expensive.",

So I googled it and read I need to turn off \u201cbrief mode\u201d. Whatever that is. So I did. NOW Alexa says \u201cok\u201d AND plays the flutey jungle sound at the same time. I\u2019m so over it!!! Just turn off my freaking light and shut up while you do it!! How do I make it stop??",
  "I want to add an action to a morning routine I have configured. It would be the MyChevrolet skill. I want to have it start my car. It works, but the issue is that Alexa asks for my pin (the pin used to access the MyChevrolet app) verbally. What's the point of having a pin if I have to announce it to those around me? Is there a way to bypass this? I was considering using IFTTT to answer the prompt but that wouldn't work cause that would end the original command of starting the car, I'm assuming. Any help with this would be much appreciated.",

There's a dedicated skill to it. \nIt works like this: \"Alexa, tell Roborock (the skill) to start vacuum cleaning.\"\n\nThis sentence literally kills me, tongue-twister vibes tbh. I was thinking about a workaround for example: \"Alexa, clean\" which executes the needed command \"Alexa, tell Roborock to...\"\n\nI can't seem to find anything on how to do this, not even in routines.

  "We've been using Ambient Sounds (pink noise) as background noise for our baby while he sleeps in his room.\n\nUsually we turn it on via voice command and turn it off once he wakes up in the morning, however I've noticed that it has somehow switched itself off in the night a couple of times.\n\nAs I don't want to go into his room to turn Ambient Sounds back on (and wake him up in the process), is there a way I can turn it on through the app?\n\nAlso how do I create a voice routine involving turning on Ambient Sounds?",

I live in an apartment and I have a neighbor that complains that my music is too loud sometimes and I'd like to be able to cap my max volume as half volume so I don't accidentally turn the music up too high and bother him again. I use Spotify with Alexa. I know, I can monitor my own listening habits and easily just turn the volume down, but I have a bad habit of blasting the music when I'm listening to my favorite bands, like Oasis. \n\nIf there is a way on the Alexa app on my iPhone to cap my volume at half volume that would be great. I'm going to look on Google for a solution to this and see what I can come up with in case anyone else goes through the same problem as me. I want to be a respectable neighbor and not force the other people around me to hear what I'm listening to. I usually keep my TV volume low so that doesn't seem to be a problem, it's only on Echo Dot and Echo Show devices which this seems to be a problem. \n\nIf I have to go through a 3rd party app to do this, I will.",

  "**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use a the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called \"Everywhere Turntable\" specifically for that purpose. Now I can use the \"Everywhere\" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.\n\n**********************************\n\nOne of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.\n\nNamely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).\n\nI've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and \"working on a fix\". But that was almost a year ago by now.\n\nMy only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?\n\nEDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue.

Do I just say \"Alexa, connect phone to stereo pair\" and it will connect to both echoes? Or do I have to connect my phone to just one echo, which will know it's part of a stereo and play the music on the other one, too? Or does playing music from a Bluetooth source work in the first place in a Echo stereo pair?\n\nAlso, since I use Alexa for other things like turning the lights on and off, and given that both echoes would be in the same room, will both echoes hear me and do stuff when I talk to Alexa?

Giddy with glee, and feeling slightly invincible, I went ahead and added a 2nd custom action\u2026then a 3rd\u2026then a 4th! Needless to say the routine saved and runs all custom actions smooth as butter. \n\nEspecially for us limited non-hubbers, this opens the door to a plethora of bulk automation options. For example, you can now enable/disable several routines with one trigger. What will you create with this newfound freedom? Thanks in advance for any suggestions. Merry Christmas! \ud83c\udf84",
  "Hello All,\n\nI want to know if there is something I'm doing wrong. I have the Toshiba Amazon FireTV edition. I am able to control the TV with Alexa, however, there are a couple of functions I think it \\*should\\* have that Alexa says it doesn't. These functions are the play/pause. I can ask Alexa to play certain things, volume up and down, on and off, but not play/pause.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this?\n\nThank you,",

  "Hi, this has me stumped, help appreciated.\n\nMy three kids now have their own Alexa dots, 4th gen. Xmas present. \n\nI'm trying to get it so each Echo dot is linked to their own Spotify (family account), so they can each play songs without impacting each other. It works fine on their iPads,l where I registered individual iCloud accounts for them, but I can't get it working with Amazon Alexa and the echo.\n\nWhen I try the path of creating a family account using Alexa app, there doesn't seem to be an option to link a specific child or device to a specific individual Spotify family account.\n\nAmazon mandates every new account must have a unique phone number. They won't let me unassign the number temporarily from my main account to use to create annother account. So I can't even create separate accounts per child either.\n\nSo, I'm not sure how I can get this to work. It seems to be a choice of a family account battling over a single Spotify, or buying some SIM cards to get multiple phone numbers so I can register as individuals. \n\nUsing a separate music service per child/device isn't workable either.\n\nAnyone know away around it? Have I missed some way to do it?",

  "Sometime between 3 and 5 weeks ago (November 2022 time frame), a new update was sent out for the Gen 2 Echo Dots, causing a whole passel of issues:\n\n1. When the G2 Dot is rebooted, the volume begins at level 10+. Now I have to always ask for it to reduce to 7. It no longer remembers its volume prior to the restart.\n2. The G2 Dot ring light sensor is now disabled. The ring light always runs at 100% brightness.\n3. The WiFi stack in the G2 Dot regularly crashes leaving the Dot unable to communicate with the router. This happens once about every 24 hours or so, forcing me to unplug and reboot every single one of the G2 units. I don't have time for that.\n\nThese are just the problems I've found.\n\nI have 4 of these now useless G2 devices in my house and every single one of them is behaving identically. My guess is that someone at Amazon pushed out an incorrect firmware update that wasn't intended for the G2 Dots. Now these Dots are barely functional because the firmware is incorrect for the G2 units. Amazon needs to fix these problems.\n\nFor the record, I have several G1 devices that still work fine. I also have two G3s, one G4 and an Echo Input all behaving correctly and without any issues.

The bulbs are not turned on.\n* When I say \"Living Room on\" everything in the living room including the fan gets turned on.\n\nWhat I want is to be able to say \"Living Room lights on\" and have it turn on the overhead, or \"Living Room lamp on\" and have it turn on the lamp.\n\nEssentially, it can't seem to tell the difference between \"Lights\" and \"Lamp\" but somehow it knows that the Wemo is a Fan vs. a Lamp because it knows \"Living Room Lamp\" vs \"Living Room Fan\"\n\nIf I create *another* group called \"Living Room Lights\" with just the bulbs in it, will Alexa be able to tell the difference between that and the lamp?  Or do I need to ditch room-based groups?\n\nHoping some one can point me in a direction, thanks!",

I was attempting to follow some instructions where I can give each one a particular location so that if we say, \"Alexa, play (whatever) in the office\", it will play it on the office device. Same with the \"living room\" device. So, I did that, but when we ask for a particular Echo to play something at it's location, it is still interfering with the other (they don't both play the same thing, rather it just stops playing music on the other device altogether). Am I misunderstanding that I can't get the results I am looking for and this cannot be done? Or am I doing something wrong?",

  "Alexa has been getting worse and worse. It has been so great in years past but constantly running into issues now. I just need to rant as maybe someone else has the same issue or knows how to address.\n\nAs of 12/1/22 the Alexa iOS App updated to v2.2.510211.0 This is all fine as there are updates just about biweekly and many haven\u2019t caused issues for me but some surely have. It\u2019s always related to third party like ADT, Hue, Feit, etc. This update was the latest and exactly when things stopped working.\n\nI reached out to ADT and they assured me there are no outages etc. ADT Control App updated three weeks ago in mid, November. Since that ADT Control App update there have been no issues. \n\nThe short of the issue is that the Alexa App updated five days ago which has killed the ADT Control Skill. I am able to arm stay, arm away, and disarm via Alexa or the ADT App itself.\n\nThe issue arises when you are arming or disarming in relation to routines tied to the skill.\n\n-Alexa Arm Stay or ADT Control App set to Arm Stay.\n-Security Panel Arms\n-Routines however do not kickoff once armed/disarmed.\n-Lights don\u2019t turn off, doors don\u2019t lock, thermostat doesn\u2019t set etc.\n\nI have done everything. Checked profiles, unlinked and linked skill again. Deleted routines and recreated from scratch, and everything else. It\u2019s easy to see the recent Alexa App update broke some API call somewhere between it and ADT. \n\nI\u2019m just super annoyed that I\u2019ve committed to the Alexa ecosystem. As Alexa isn\u2019t making Amazon the money they hoped for, it\u2019ll likely be tossed on the back burner. Amazon can\u2019t seem to understand that anyone using these features is also a Prime Member and can go elsewhere. \n\nJust really thinking that it\u2019s time to make an ecosystem jump as much of a pain as that would be. I\u2019m just sick of paying a premium for service and getting f$&@ all in return. \n\nSo yea, I guess I\u2019ll just sit on my thumb and wait to see if this is fixed. Zero guarantee that it will be either, that\u2019s the worst part. What is the point of skills and routines if you can\u2019t use them and have to open many different apps to turn off or adjust all your things?\n\nI did contact Amazon Support and received the run of the mill \u201cdid you do this or do that\u201d.

  "There's something I'd like to use Alexa for, but I don't know if it's possible.\n\nWhen I cook beef stew on the stovetop, I need to stir it every 15 minutes. Right now, I just tell Alexa to \"alert me in 15 minutes,\" because there's nothing else I'm setting generic timers for. The problem is, I've been cooped up alone with Alexa for so long, I'm becoming inured to her, and now I'm prone to just telling her to \"stop,\" without actually getting up and stirring the stew. So I'd like her to stay on my case about it until I've set a new timer; setting a new timer would indicate that I've stirred the stew, and I need to stir it again the next time. (And for whatever reason, I've never been a \"snooze\"-er; if I set a 7 am alarm, I just also set a 7:05, 7:10, and 7:15 alarm, because I know I'm not going to snooze the original alarm.)\n\nMy first thought was to create a routine that would trigger off of the alarm dismissal, and would remind me every minute to go stir (making Alexa speak, not another alarm, or I'd be triggering the routine again), repeatedly--an arbitrary number of times (since I don't think routines have goto loops). And when I've taken care of the stew, I would tell it to end the routine, allowing it to restart after the next new timer that I then set. But my understanding is that, despite it being a requested feature in a handful of threads on the official forums, it is impossible to stop a routine that is already in progress. It also appears that dismissing a timer does not satisfy the alarm dismissal trigger.\n\nSo, can anyone think of a way to do this with a routine, with other Alexa commands, or even with other tools altogether?",

I sometimes play songs off my phone though and I can connect to both speakers via bluetooth simultaneously but the music (Samsung Music App) will only ever come out of one speaker. I don't want to bring the speakers closer (I know this might be one solution) because that defeats the purpose of buying the second Dot. I like that I don't have to yell and I have my living room and bedroom now connected.\n\nDoes anyone know how to get audio playing from a phone to both  Alexa Dot speakers simultaneously?\n\nEDIT UPDATE 1: I figured it out. I had slide down on my phone and click media output, then click the second speaker. Both devices were paired, but the audio was switching between them until I went to this media output and enabled the 2nd speaker. Thank you Samsung for dual audio. Now, if I buy a 3rd Alex Dot can I run 3 speaks off my phone...?\n\nEDIT UPDATE 2: They call it Samsung Dual Audio for reason.

Is the office echo somehow \"prioritized\" over the kitchen echo?

This detail is important. I have daily routines set up for my kids to tell them to clean up their things and then another 30 minutes later to go brush their teeth and get ready for bed. While on the line with 911 a freaking reminder kicks off and interrupted the call. So was trying to do the heimlich and hear what the operator is saying while Alexa is telling my kids it\u2019s bedtime. Seconds matter in these scenarios. Thankfully we were finally able to clear his airway, but it wasn\u2019t looking great for a minute. \n\nI started a chat with Amazon customer service to see if something can be done or if my device was faulty. He said to add 911 as an emergency contact and that shouldn\u2019t happen. When I asked for help with that it turned out it couldn\u2019t be done. He said he would submit it as feedback and I could continuously check the Amazon website to see if this has been fixed. I would not receive notification that my issue had been resolved. So I called customer service instead. \n\nThe next guy I spoke with gave me a few more options. He said I could simply disable all of my routines. Boom. Problem solved. Well, I kind of like that feature. I mean that really eliminates some of the basic features. Then he suggested I go look for my phone and call 911 from that next time. He said to be sure I\u2019m always from the device or turn it down. That way my call won\u2019t get interrupted. *Really??* He was literally inches from the device. It was the closest thing capable of calling emergency services. Don\u2019t worry. I was also offered the solution of not calling 911 or to have the emergency outside of my scheduled routines. Not helpful either. It gets better. Finally, he argued with me that my device couldn\u2019t even call 911. It\u2019s not a feature that you can use. He said it couldn\u2019t connect to government numbers. I explained that I just did, and it was in fact the second time I had done so. It was actually a feature that I really appreciated given the fact I\u2019ve had to call 911 three times in the past few months. He had control of my device and I showed him the voice history proving myself right. He hung up on me.\n\nSo here we are. Is this something that is specific to my device?

Now since then its uploaded her photos to her amazon drive no matter how many times she has a new phone. A few times I have cleaned out her amazon drive that has gotten full. Now Amazon drive is going away at the the end of the year. Amazon Photos are staying, but since she still has the 'free' version of photos/drive it will still fill up because of her photos. I want to shut off her phone to drive thing. She has apple icloud so she doesnt need it.",
  "Something in the profanity filter changed because I have a workout routine reminding me to \"go extra hard on your core tonight\" and now it's \"Go extra \\[beep\\] \\[beep\\] your core tonight...\" \n\nThis is stupid and obnoxious and I want to turn it off.",
  "Hi guys. How do i enable autoplay for Spotify on Alexa? When i play a specific song like \"Alexa play song XY\" it just plays the song and stops. I have autoplay enabled in the settings and it works on my phone and pc.\n\nI would really appreciate it if you guys can help me out here.",
  "I have a few Shelly devices and a dozen smart bulbs . I have around 20 Alexa routines set up, mostly for the lights. Things generally work okay with Alexa commands but sometimes there is some lag. \n\nHome Assistant seems to be the next step for home automation, but what would it really buy me?",

  "Hi there,\n\nSeems I've acquired a hell of a bug.\n\nI have one lighting group called \"lamps\" which is two lamps on an amazon smart plug and one lamp on a Kasa smart plug.\n\nI have another lighting group called \"kitchen\" which is a bunch of lights connected to a Lutron lighting bridge.\n\nIf I ask Alexa to \"turn on lamps\", my lamps turn on as expected, but random lights in the \"kitchen\" group will turn off and back on right away or just turn off entirely.\n\nI've double and triple checked that the respective lights/lamps are in the right groups within the app, and I've rebooted the Echo devices, with no change.\n\nI've confirmed also there's no routine getting triggered by the command which could be causing this either.\n\nAny light in the kitchen group turns on and off properly, as expected. \n\nI'm trying to avoid a factory reset, but I suspect that may be my next step.\n\nAny other thoughts?",
  "I have an Alexa device for both my car and my home. I use YouTube Music which I love but it has no 3rd party support. I can connect to my Alexa devices with phone and play my music just fine though. I just can't tell Alexa to pause or skip, etc. Has anyone found a workaround for this? I don't need anything complicated like asking her to find a song. Just simple pause and play and skip like I can with my Bluetooth headphones. Asking her to pause just makes a ding noise and nothing else.",
  "Hello, i had a samsung TV which i could already use my echo to control, pause, mute, play etc. But have recently purchased a Firestick tv thing which i connected to my Samsung TV. \n\nIt now seems to have messed everything up and i no longer can control either. I just keep getting TV doesn't support that. Or if i ask to mute the Firestick, the echo mutes itself. \n\nI have managed to link the firestick to the echo, for example my living room firestick linked to my living room echo show. Just cant seem to get it working at all. \n\nWondering if anyone has similar issues or any way around it? \n\nMAny thanks",
  "Alexa is Schizophrenic, when i ask her the weather she starts to reply and does so. When she is finished i am able to ask an addition question as i have her set so that i don't need to say Alex again. I can ask an additional question within 3 seconds or so. So here is the issue. I ask what's the weather, when she is finished i ask the second question which usually is the time or the weather tomorrow.  This is when the issue occurs. She begins to answer the question, but another response is:- i am having trouble connecting to the internet, please try restarting your router, etc, etc. There are two Alexa voices going on simultaneously? One answers as if all is well while the voice in her head (Device) replies that she cannot connect to the internet. WTF! lol  Its funny but i feel she needs a shrink.",
  "Hello,\n\nSo I have 4 Alexa's at my house and I was going to get a couple for my older parents just up the road from me.  Should I add those to my account to manage or create a new Amazon account for them?  I was even going to setup their wifi with the same network and password to make it really easy.  They have no wifi or computers at all, so getting internet next weekend.\n\nMy main concern is if they are up there playing music or whatever they want to do, will that interfere with my own Alexas?   They are on different physical networks but are still in the same account.\n\nThanks,\n\nMatt",
  "Has anyone done this yet? My mom and step dad have a eero web mesh system I set up for their house about two years ago. We upgraded it from 5 to 6 awhile back. I know its simple to add another eero to it. However she ordered a new Alexa 5th Gen dot and since Amazon owns both it has eero built in.\n\nSo has anyone set up the eero features in a 5th gen dot before? No idea if I add it with the alexa app or the erro app.",
  "For two years, my lamp, wife\u2019s lamp, both WiFi bulbs, in group \u2018bedroom lamps\u2019 in group \u2018bedroom\u2019. Main ceiling light and fan both WiFi switches named \u201cbedroom lights\u201d and \u201cbedroom fan\u201d both in bedroom group.\n\nAll fine for 2 years calling for bedroom lamps vs bedroom lights. But this week \u201cturn on/off bedroom lights\u201d turns on/off the lamps.\n\nIf I rename \u2018bedroom lamps\u2019 group \u2018bedroom test\u2019 then both work properly. Likewise if I rename \u2018bedroom lights\u2019 both work. So it seems Alexa is simply using the word \u201clamps\u201d as \u201clights\u201d. Argh! Rant over.",

  "So, this just started a couple weeks ago.  When I ask to play a song or station, Alexa replies that she will play the song, but then nothing happens.  I\u2019ve figured out that if I ask to play the next song(which Alexa replies back this function is not supported with this stream) and then say \u201crestart \u201c the song or station will play.  This is all pretty wonky to get a song to play, so I\u2019d like to get it working correctly.\n\nI only have Amazon Music set up, and my other devices work fine.  I\u2019ve tried restarting the device, but I haven\u2019t tried a factory reset yet.",

  "I've just installed an Amazon smart thermostat to my wall mounted AC/Heat unit. It works fine to control it, but here's the issue.\nI want to set it so it doesn't use its own internal thermometer to decide if it should heat or not, but rather use one of my gen 5 dots in other rooms to determine if it should heat or not. Or better yet, have it set temperature based on average house temperature between all gen 5 dots. \n\nThe use case for this is that because I don't have central air, the thermostat (previously built into the unit, now smart) can only feel the temperature where it is physically positioned, but that means that while the living room stays at a perfect temperature, the bedroom and office get overheated or cold, depending on the outside temperature and use of the room. I'd like to be able to control the thermostat based off of those other rooms temperature rather than the thermostat."
