I thought I'd share my project with the Sonos community.

We moved into a new home (to us) that had a 20 year old Elan system in several rooms.  There had been some remodeling, and a couple of the rooms no longer had in-ceiling speakers, but most of the rooms did.  There was wiring (but no speakers) in an outdoor area, and all bedrooms had speakers.  The family room had wiring for in-ceiling surround speakers (and stereo speakers behind a cloth panel - replaced with a sonos soundbar and sub behind the cloth panel), and an office area and basement space also had in-ceiling speakers.

When we did the walk through, I knew the Elan system was probably non-functional.  Wires were EVERYWHERE and the old wiring closet was in disrepair.  A step-ladder was resting on top of at least one cat-5 control cable, and the insulating jacket had been pulled from the RJ45 connector.  I found Tyler's hack and decided to go all-in with it.  I'm really glad I followed in his footsteps as I'm extremely happy with the outcome.

In the end, I used 9 Symfonisk bookshelf speakers.  I printed the enclosure Tyler designed - which worked perfectly.  The stereo zones I replaced are mono as there's just 1 channel of output from the modification.  I'm fine with this as you'll never be sitting in a perfect position for stereo audio.  I pulled out the 2 x Niles 12 channel amplifiers and multiple zone controllers / preamps and intercom / integration units.  7 of the amps / symfonisk guts ended up in the wiring closet and 2 ended up going into the family room for surround sound for the existing sonos system.

Lastly, I was able to remove the old Elan wall control units and I replaced with the Lutron pico controllers.  This has been fantastic to retain the ""ease of volume control"" in every room.  Super easy to play / pause / adjust volume without needing to pull out a phone.

A couple of really nice benefits - 1.) Sonos thinks they are Symfonisk speakers.  Trueplay works wonderfully.  I'm shocked at how good the speakers sound.  I'm fairly certain boxes are behind the in-ceiling speakers.  I'm not sure how they would have gotten the bass response without some type of enclosure.  2.) Pairing the surrounds with the playbar and sub was super easy.  3.) AppleTV lets you redirect the audio to airplay speakers.  Because the Symfonisk bookshelf gen 2 speakers are airplay2 compatible, I can redirect audio from the screened-in porch appleTV to the in-ceiling speakers.  No, it's not optimal for movie viewing, but it sounds SO much better than the pitiful TV speakers.

Let me know if you have any questions.  After doing 9 of the conversions I learned a lot about the ""order of operations"" and I'm fairly confident in my ability to help if needed.  Oh- and when all the zones are playing + some existing sonos gear / subs, it'll thump pretty good."	0	[]
1682643101.0	27-Apr-2023 17:51:41	Need help with setup	Used_Employer_3072	1	131cypo	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/131cypo/need_help_with_setup/	"Hello! 

I'm having an issue and was wondering if anyone can help me. I recently got married and tomorrow we're hosting a large party for our friends/family. The venue we booked already has a Sonos system throughout their establishment. It was setup on their guest wifi and has multiple S1 Ones. 

I brought two of my Play 5s, two Era 300s and a Sonos boost hoping to use them for the party. When I get on their guest wifi it causes complications between the two separate systems. I can momentarily see my boost and Play 5s but after awhile, the wifi signal drops. Then when I go back to the Sonos app it starts showing me the venues already established system. 

I can manage to play music on the Play 5s for a little bit but it'll eventually lose the wifi connection. I'm thinking it's because the app is registering both systems intermittently causing issues. Another issue I come across is with the venues S1 speakers. The app tells me it's incompatible with my S2 speakers and wants me to forget the venues Sonos system, which I cannot do. 

I'm just not sure what to do to trouble shoot this issue. Is there a way to maintain the connection to my speakers, while leaving the venues system alone? 

Any thoughts or suggestions would be awesome."	1	[]

I have two Sonos systems both under the same Sonos account. I can link one of my Google Homes to my Sonos acciunt and connect it to the Sonos system in that location, and thereby use my Google assistant to play music through the Sonos system. When I try to link the other Home in the same way it seems to disconnect the first one.

After a few hours of troubleshooting, I was finally able to get it working.

I have a PS5 connected to a HDMI Splitter connected to Arcana connected to a Dell monitor and to the Sonos, but the audio output is always 2.0, not matter what settings I change on the PS5. I tried to set the audio to AV Receiver and the channels to 5.1 (and even 7.1), but the output is always 2.0.

Changing the audio output to Linear PCM, Dolby or DTS also makes no difference.

I know this isn't Arcana's sub, but if you guys have a similar setup and could help me it would be amazing!  I tried different settings on the Arcana, enabling and disabling features but none did work.

Any help is welcome!

Thank you in advance!

Right now, I have an Arc, Sub, and Amp with two in-ceiling speakers as the rears wife's approval to get rears for my surround sound.  We have an open-concept Living, Dining, and Kitchen, and she wanted to avoid rears interrupting this. With that being in mind, here is what I am thinking...

Kitchen - Sonos Move so that I can move it outside if we have guests or I am grilling

Office - Sonos Era 100

All other Bedrooms - Sonos Era 100's

Garage / Gym - Sonos Move - Currenly use and really enjoy (Can also bring outside if need more music)

&#x200B;

I also have a random old sonos play 3 that I will put on top of my built-in's in foyer since the only time I will use that is when we are having guests/party.

&#x200B;

is there any need for Era 300's I am also thinking of doing the 100's mounted high on the wall, will that mess up the sound?

Thank you in advance."	4	['chfalin: You don’t need era 300s unless you want to play atmos music. Just a little note: If you group a non-atmos capable speaker with the era 300, the grouping will default to playing non-atmos for all speakers. Of course, you would be able to group the era 300s with your Arc/Sub/Surrounds, and still get atmos.  As someone who doesn’t care that much about surround for movies and tv, I think I like my era 300s as a stereo pair more than using them as surrounds with the Arc.\n\nThe Move is always a good choice. \n\nThe Era 100s are great because of their versatility.  I originally put a play:1 in every room, then added another for a stereo pair in some places, and moved some to a surround configuration. Like the Play:1 and One, the Era 100 will be very versatile. The Era 100s will sound great, have wifi6 (but not use SonosNet), have Bluetooth (I hate Bluetooth), and a line-in option.\n\nMounting the Era 100s closer to ear level will give you the best sound. A little higher will be not too bad. Like HIGH on the wall, the sound will be…different. I had Play:1s mounted up high on the wall in the kitchen and hallway, and it was fine, but the reflections can do some weird things with the sound, and the sound can be a bit less inspiring. \n\n\nI have the Move, Era 100s, and Era 300s, and I think they’re all great.  Your plan with a Move and Era 100s sounds like a solid one. I love my Era 100s, even though I’m using them as surrounds with a Beam 2.\n\nYou could also look at the ikea symfonisk speakers for places you want to maybe not spend as much.

Obviously it’s not going to blow away a dedicated stereo system with a fancy preamp and DAC, but I get mixed feedback on if it’s any good at all. 

The alternatives (Beam, Arc, pairs of 100s/300s) all have their merits, but the 100/300s won’t hook up to a TV and the Beam/Arc don’t really deliver the goods in terms of music quality (I do listen to TV and music, but I care more about the quality of music than I do TV).

I have a Sonos sub in the basement which is connected to the ceiling speakers in the living room. I have a sub in this room which i want  to pair with the AMP but i run into stability issues when using it. The sub pairs fine with other speakers. 

Reading on one the forums, i understand that the Sub create a separate 5HZ channel with the AMP and does not use Sonosnet or Wifi for this connection. Which is a bummer but explains my scenario.

But when i checked with Sonos support yesterday, the agent said that's not true and the Sub also connects using Wifi and Sonosnet just like other speakers

So this leads to my question
1) Does anyone for sure know how they connect?
2) If infact via a separate channel then i am screwed. Can i use a workaround such as hard-wiring the Sub if it helps? and how do others use their AMP with the SUb with this limitation?"	2	"['Noobgamer0111: >Does anyone for sure know how they connect?\n\nYes.\n\nThe Sub can use Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or SonosNet to connect to your System.\n\nSonosNet (as you might already know) is the exclusive mesh WPA2 PSK 2.4GHz network that is automatically enabled when an Ethernet cable is connected AND the wireless radio is enabled.

I’ve had the same setup for about 2 years, and I regularly play music via my premium Spotify account. I have made no recent changes to the system or Spotify, but when I tell the Sonos to play music it says, “Ok, playing ____ on Spotify,” but no music plays. The same thing happens on every device. 

I have tried unplugging devices and plugging them back in, reauthorizing the Spotify account, and even switching to Pandora as my default music, but nothing has worked. Of note, when I switched my default to Pandora the same thing happened; it said “playing ____ on Pandora,” but nothing played. So it seems it’s a problem with the Sonos or Google assistant, not specific to Spotify.

All other commands seem to work. I can have it control lights, etc.

I’m not sure how to fix the problem. Has anyone experienced this?"	2	['TheWitcher1989: https://status.sonos.com/', 'bcmd15: Ah thanks!']

i have a smallish tv on which i watch movies and play my ps5. however, i listen to music basically every waking hour. i’m looking for a pretty simple speaker setup that will sound good for both a wide range of music genres and a less wide range of movie genres (i don’t watch many modern movies, i’m pretty much entirely a criterion channel/mubi asshole). 

initially i was looking at two homepods but the potential lag with games and lack of upgrade path scared me off. i have very nice smaller speakers and headphones, so this doesn’t have to be “audiophile” grade, but i am slightly picky with sound. i am unlikely to ever add a sub due to being in an apartment however i have considered the possibility of adding two fives to tie my vinyl setup into a sonos system. 

the living room is an “open” plan that is a 17’ x 11.5’ area with an additional 12’ x 14’ combo dining room/sunroom directly behind it. my tv is small (42”) so i will not be sitting much more than five feet away. 

any thoughts about whether the arc would be overkill? i’m sure it is based only off my movie habits but if it’s significantly better for music i’m happy to pay the extra."	13	"['GuitarSuperstar: With a 42"" TV and sitting 5 feet away, I would get a Beam (Gen 2).

Further complicating things is that I am considering going with a pair of Era 300s instead of in-ceiling speakers for the family room zone. These would be wall mounted at about 8' (probably inverted), and the reason why I am considering them is they may work better in the room with the ceiling we have.

**The Floorplan / Room Design**

This is an open room approximately 40' long by about 14' with raised ceilings sloping from the right down to the left (if looking towards the TV). The raised ceilings don't start until about 1.5' into the room (thicker top dashed line in the picture) due to existing overhang/support of the second floor, and then they shoot up to 10' 10"" before sloping downwards at \~14 degrees until hitting the back wall at 8'

My plan was to create two zones - one for the 'family room/TV' and another for the 'kitchen'.

https://preview.redd.it/rrk1ot6j09wa1.jpg?width=1813&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8776575c644c0594af5d27cb4a01d3c6d95e5089

**Zone 1 - Family Room/TV**

This will be the primary TV-watching area - there will be a Sonos Arc and Sub -  either paired up with a pair of in-ceiling speakers (blue circles) powered by a Sonos amp or with Era 300s (red circles.) I

If going with in-ceiling speakers, do I get Sonos+Sonace pair to take advantage of TruePlay tuning, which may (or may not?) help with the raised, sloped ceiling? One speaker would be about 10' above the floor, while the other (due to the slope) would likely be closer to 8' 6"" give or take. I don't know how this might impact the listening experience and if TruePlay could compensate for it, or if the TruePlay capability of the Sonace speakers would be negligible. If not noticeable, I'd rather save the money going with cheaper in-ceiling speakers and being able to maybe pair with an older Sonos Connect:Amp (S2-capable).

Depending on the final placement of the couch and support column, an alternative option would be a pair of Sonos Era 300s wall-mounted upside down about 7' 6"" off the floor and angled down towards the back of the couch. I don't think it looks as clean as in-ceiling speakers, but the cost is about the same (or cheaper compared to going with Sonace+Sonos in-ceiling), and I *think* the sound might be better. While framing is going on, I will have the ability to ensure a clean look with cable management and power supply.

**Zone 2 - Kitchen**

My plan was to put 4 speakers in the ceiling here that would be used for background/ambient music, but may occasionally be grouped with the family room zone both for music listening or occasionally for TV (e.g. hosting people and watching a sporting event.)

Where I am stuck... do I attempt to set up a stereo pairing here, keeping the left channel running along the north (top) wall and the right channel along the southern wall, or if I'm better off setting these up as dual mono to fill the space without stereo-bleed and knowing that where someone is in the kitchen when watching TV might not always be left/right (there will be some barstools in lower right-hand corner of island, not really facing the TV.)

If I go with the dual mono setup in the Sonos app, what changes as far as wiring these in parallel and with regards to the type of speakers I should be looking for? Do the speakers need to be individual stereo models to support dual mono?

Also, would it sound weird if these are dual mono and get grouped with the stereo left/right in the family room? For example, if eating around the table and having light music playing in the background of both zones.

I decided to invest in a pair of Era 300’s for my home office setup (based on the feedback on this sub it seems like using them as rears for my arc is a bit overkill). 

Does anyone know how a stereo pair works with the side firing speakers? I.e if the speaker on the left will stop firing the speakers on its right to avoid muddying the Atmos sound coming from the right speaker?

If so, does that mean that the left speaker would only fire it’s left speakers, front and top, and the right fire it’s right speakers, front and top?

If so, is it a bit pointless to have them stereo paired and instead just get one a sub mini?

So far the audio has been really good versus the one’s they replaced, but the Atmos isn’t as enveloping as others have described from single Era 300s.

I'm torn between the beam and the arc and I need some advices. Here are some things to keep in mind:
-I have young kids so I don't want wires everywhere
-I only want the sound bar so no sub or satellites
-I live in a semi detached house with a neighbor on the other side of the party wall so I don't want to make the entire building shake.
-I am not a big audiophile
-The sound bar will be used to watch regular tv, music and some tv shows or movies from streaming.

So with all this in mind, here are my questions:
1: Is the beam enough for what I'll do with it or should I go big with the arc to match the quality of my tv?
2:When the kids are asleep, will I have a hard time listening to tv with the sound on low without waking them?

But not marginally better, diminishing returns are big and your ears are in equation too.\n\nArc costs twice as much, but you may be satisfied with beam gen2 as well.\n\nSo, the questions:\n\n-\tDo you want to pay twice as much for only 30-40% better sound (generally)?\n-\tDo you consider the option to buy the Beam gen2 first, if it suits you then OK, if it’s not enough but still good, move it to the bedroom and buy the arc later\n-\tYou said you won’t expand on the sonos line up, are you really sure you won’t? Why sonos then? Answer this for yourself.\n\nAnyway, I think it comes down to your budget and worthiness of sound quality and “fullness” of the sound.\nNot gonna throw parties, low volume always, just want better sound, no upgrades and not really picky about the sound quality? Beam gen2 suits you well, with arc you won’t notice sound bump so much, but you will surely notice a price bump. Beam gen2 is good value in sonos ecosystem and sub mini complements it a lot in terms of value upgradability. \n\nPersonally, when I bought lg c2, I wanted the sound to be **on par** with picture quality, so I went full arc-sub-surrounds. Even though the sound never exceeds 30% mark, I’m happy. But objectively speaking, beam gen2 and sub mini combination is more valuable.\n\nAlso, arc looks better on 55+ tvs, keep in mind that.', 'Electrical-Street-16: Beam or ARC you will get Dolby Atmos. ARC will be the better choice. Why\n\nIn the Sonos app you will be able to enable Sound night and will reduce the sound. This option again with any sound bar Gen or ARC.\n\nIn the future you will never know you decide to upgrade you will be ahead of the dound game.\n\nJust my honest opinion \n\n✌️', 'brainegg8: Arc']

I am torn on which speaker to go with; Sonos one vs Era 100 vs Move.   I've been very happy with the few Sonos One's in non-stereo for smaller rooms, but have one room that doesn't have anything in it yet.  I never use the voice assistant items, nor really care about bluetooth, or have the need for stereo support in this room, so all are non-deal breakers for me.

I'd considered purchasing the move as a portable speaker, leaving it in this room in question, when not in use, but have heard rumors the Move is planned for a refresh this fall, so I've been hesitant making that purchase.

I've heard conflicting reviews on the Era 100 vs the One; where the Era 100 loses out on midrange, conflicting feedback on lows, but highs are non-debate that the Era 100 wins.  I also noticed that the Era 100 loses ethernet port and that would be an extra $40 to add an adapter (call me a grandpa, but I love having a hard wired connection).  I've heard some are maybe using a different adapter with success, anyone have more info on that?

What are you thoughts on what I should go with?"	4	"[""j_nak: I have all three.  I would say the Move is slightly better than the 100 in bass and loudness, but the 100 is slightly better at stereo separation and imaging.  They are pretty equal in most other aspects.  The 100 is quite a bit better than the One in all areas.  \n\nIf you want a wired connection, the Move is out.  \n\nI would lean toward the 100 as it's quite a bit cheaper than the Move, unless portability is a must."", 'redditgriller: I like having the Move so I can place it outside and have the same music playing inside and out when guests are over. Just something to think about.', 'Avectasi: I own a pair of the moves and it’s really great! Although to be honest I thought I would use a lot of its portability but most of the time I have them docked I’m wanting to sell them so I could upgrade to a different Sonos product. Although I’ve also heard more rumors about a different move so to be honest I would wait a little longer and see what happens..', 'stromb0li: yep -- that was my thought too, but if rumors are true and they are going to release the next generation/refresh of it in this fall, might be worth waiting?']"

Is there any written guidance/analysis on what methods of playback are capped at what streaming quality based on different music services?

In short - trying to determine if playback quality is maximized by launching songs via the Sonos app always, or if there are certain instances where it makes no difference when using AirPlay with Apple Music and/or Amazon Music.

The User Interface of the Sonos app is a little less convenient for browsing playlists and your Library can only be sorted by Alphabetical order as opposed to Date Added. I would just use the native Apple Music & Amazon Music apps if it makes no difference in quality, but not sure the case.

I do realize that Dolby Atmos requires songs be launched from the Sonos app, not asking about Dolby Atmos songs in this case."	5	['TheNthMan: Both Airplay and Sonosnet S1 max out at 16 bit 44.1khz. Airplay 2 and Sonosnet S2 both max out at 24 bit 48khz.\n\nHowever “Airplay” is a bit of a hodgepodge, and acts differently under different situations.  I believe in general, though Airplay 2 supports up to 24 bit 48khz, in practice it largely maxes out at 24 bit 44.1khz.  Then also, depending on audio source, airplay sending device, how you airplay, they all can make a difference (eg on OSX vs iOS, different lossless/hi-res streaming sources with different file types, bit rates, locally stored files, airplay from an app vs a system on OSX) in how Airplay behaves in terms of transcoding into AIFF, maintaining a bit perfect stream or not, etc.\n\nIf you airplay just right, Airplay and Sonos should both sound comparable, but if you don’t hit the right combination with Airplay, Sonos could have an edge.

I am not sure how much clearance i need in order to get the best out of the era 300s.

And the centre driver doesn’t fire at all. \n\nI have 300’s that replaced Ones at about 40cm from MLP at 45 degrees and behind. \n\nI love them now, but it took a couple of weeks to get used to the huge rear surround bubble that replaces the highly direction Ones as rears.  Would not go back to One’s. \n\nOnce you trueplay and tweak the Surround settings in the app… the 300’s are surround monsters IMO.', 'Dhand875: I’ve spent hours perfecting the location of the 300s. I have an Arc, 2 subs, and 2 300s. The 300s should be facing directly towards the tv, they should not be angled into the listening area. If they are angled it throws off the side surrounds and rear surrounds. If you can imagine angling the speaker into the listening area the left and right surround would then be facing the wall further into the room and the rear surround will be at a sharper angle behind you. Each 300 is about 4 feet from the edge of the sides of the couch.  They are 13 inches from the side walls to the center touch button of the speaker and they are about 4.5 inches away from the rear wall. They are about 4 inches above my ear level using the height adjustable sanus mounts. The subs are on opposite sides of the side walls about 3 feet from the tv. The arc is mounted to the tv using the sanus tv bracket mounted to a fully articulating tv mount. I found that pulling the arc out further from the tv sounds significantly better.  When trueplay tuning, tune the listening area. Walk slowly and wave your arm slowly as well. Bring your phone close to the ground as it will help tune the subs. Don’t get too close to the walls, don’t get too close to the speakers. If you can go about a foot behind the main listening area. There is no sense it making the software and processors adjust the sound profile for a part of the room in which no one ever watches tv or sits.

You can\'t say ""and 6 total drivers when used as surrounds"" if only 5 are playing audio. \n\nSome people (like myself), don\'t have ideal placement methods, so my Era 300\'s are basically directly behind the main 2 listening positions (I\'m married so we take up two seats on the couch), and I can\'t get a 45 degree angle to the left and right. Due to this, the rear surround audio isn\'t ideal. If you\'re sitting on the right side of the couch, both rear surrounds sound like they\'re on your left, and vice versa. \n\nThat isn\'t a deal breaker for me because the soundstage is so wide that the surround bubble is still great.

Me, I kind of feel if it used the front woofers judiciously it could be a “Sub Micro” and replace the need for a Sub Mini in apartments. \n\nBut yeah IMO for the majority of HT setups, Sonos did make the right call in terms of not firing the front speakers.', ""Fun_Frame_1070: I think it's more when you play standard stereo music and you want the rears to just behave like a normal forward firing speaker.

If recommendedto get the atv4k, how would i connect them all? Currenlty have the arc in the eArc slot and the ps5 in the other 4k hdmi slot and there are 2 other slots. Would the atv4k need to go into a 4k slot?

If i do get the atv4k, is that what i should stream everything from as i currently stream from the tv.

Once properly added to the app and paired as stereo, only the left one plays music although the right one controls the volume on the left one ... I tried a hard reset twice, unplugging for 15-20 sec, removing them from the app, removing the pair then adding it again, resetting my internet connection, updating iOS and OS apps, different music sources and I still get the same result.

I'll call tech support tomorrow but I wanted to try here first.

On another note and FWIW, I'm satisfied with what I think is an improvement over the Ones I had previously as standalone speakers. I prefer the bass and I think clarity is better at higher volumes.

After demoing the Sonos speakers in the store, I felt the era 300 was by far the best speaker out of everything they offer right now. Intially I wanted to go with the Arc, but decided against it as the era 300 blows the Arc away when playing any kind of music.

So ideally I would want to use a pair of era 300s as stereo speakers for my projector, but… no hdmi inputs. Now I’m left wondering what my best course of action is. Should I just get the Arc with the Eras just for the hdmi input? But then the eras would act as surrounds which would be a terrible waste.

Is there any way to use the era300s as mains speakers without the arc? Or is there a way to combine it with the arc, but set them up in 3.0 instead of using them as surround speakers?"	3	['early_rejecter: Does the projector have an analog output you could send to the E300?

They are much better for music in stereo."", ""Han-Yolo44: I played around with the era 300s as a stereo pair before they settled in as surrounds in my HT. The E300s have good bass, but not as deep as the fives.  If you like bass, they could benefit from a sub.\n\nIf you are streaming over airplay though, it doesn't support Atmos.  The soundstage for stereo content is a lot more indirect. The outside firing woofers aren't angled towards you and are designed to bounce off walls.  Because of this the room impacts its sound stage far more than having a pair of traditional speakers like bookshelves pointing at your listening position.\n\nFor stereo music, I far prefer a pair of Sonos fives and they don't need a sub (it's a luxury for further bass extension).   If you want atmos for music and will change from using Airplay to using the Sonos app, that's where the E300s plus a sub may make more sense."", 'Denslayer: Curious about this as well', 'allinwlk: !thanks that’s very useful. I’ve no interest in using the Sonos app and it will prevent me from air playing to other devices in the house so I’ll re-consider fives or the passive route.', 'Han-Yolo44: Yeah I far prefer just doing airplay personally, it’s just quicker and more convenient. Open plan I don’t think you’ll be disappointed with Fives but the passive route is great too as you’ll have lots of options and ability to customize. \n\nOne other cool thing to consider I’ve seen others do is to go with 4 Sonos ones or 100s. So two stereo pairs placed in a large room but grouped. Just place them so that the rights and lefts are on the same sides. Works really well for a more immersive experience but with stereo content.']"

At least, at the time I purchased (a couple of years ago), the Sonos version has a more square shoulder profile (and therefore not much of a bezel) while the MAG6R has something like a quarter inch bezel. Also, the hole pattern is slightly different; they are about the same size (and the resulting color is very similar), but if you are up close to them, then you can see that the Sonos version has sort of a spiral pattern to the perforations while the MAG6R has what looks like a normal grid pattern.\n\nI have a mixture of them in my house, and it works just fine, but I figured I would point that out.

I’m sure it does more in other environments, and I am sure that someone with a better ear than mine could tell the difference here in my home, but I don’t find it to have a dramatically positive effect.

So one speaker will probably be around 10\' from the floor and the other might be closer to 8\' 6"" give-or-take.\n\nMy thought was maybe Trueplay could help with balancing this out as it\'ll be the main rear stereo pair for watching TV. Unfortunately, there is no way to place anything closer to ear level as my wife does not want speaker stands, and the back of the couch will be in the middle of the room, which I understand. \n\nIf I didn\'t go with Sonace and got their mid-tier or whatever MAG6R are, it would also let me pair with a spare Connect:Amp (Gen 2/S2) that I have, it\'s more a $1,000 savings - more than enough to cover the cost of the Arc.']"

I have a customer who is experiencing trouble with one surround system in their master bedroom (only). they have 3 surround systems in their home, all wired the same (1-Arc, 1-Sub, 1-Amp with a pair of speakers) and 8 other Amps with pairs of connected speakers on them. The Amp and Arc are both wired to the LAN. They are experiencing disconnections of their surround where the Arc (only) play when the TV is on. I suspect the Sub is also playing, but know the ceiling speakers (Amp) are not. The issue came up about 3 months after they moved into the house and had been using the system successfully without any issues. Initially the Amp was not wired to their LAN because I was told that only one Sonos device needed to be wired to the LAN for the entire system to operate properly. After this issue first appeared I was told that the Amp in this room needed to be wired, which I was lucky enough to do (in this now finished home). 

Support tells me that the Wi-Fi for this amp needs to be turned on, even though it is a wired Amp and this is only so it can be troubleshot with them. Four trips to the site, now and each time the issue is resolved only to come back again after a week or two or three.

Why is this happening? What is the resolve for it? Calling support should resolve an issue permanently minus site changes or wiring issues (which there have been none). 

I appreciate any insights. 

Thank you,

But it hasn’t worked in months.
I can’t use the Port/turntable at all. (It just doesn’t work. No sound.) Even if the Port is just plugged in but not in use, the whole system goes down. 
I can’t actually listen to more than one speaker at a time, as soon as I group the rooms at least one of them cuts out. The volume dances all over the place. Constant “unable to connect to system” error messages. Halfway through a song and one speaker will cut out, comes back on and another one goes. It’s rare that I can get them all going at once.

Miss_Aerith	3	12w6zm6	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12w6zm6/beam_sub_mini_or_arc/	"Hey all, I got a Sonos Roam a few months ago and have been addicted to using it. My parents have a few Sonos products at their house and I wanted to get into the Sonos eco system. I've been wanting to give my apartment a bit of a sound makeover, and since I'm starting a new job soon I figured I'd start thinking about it. Right now I have a roughly 50 inch TV with a Polk S1 soundbar underneath it. I mainly use the TV for playing games, watching Youtube and the occasional blu-ray. I'm thinking of upgrading my TV setup, starting with the sound. My main question is, should I go for an Arc or a Beam + a Sub Mini? My biggest concern is living in an apartment, I don't want to disturb my downstairs neighbors with a subwoofer, though good sound quality and immersion is important to me. I could go with the Arc, however I'm afraid it would be too large underneath my current TV. My room is small to medium sized with the TV placed on a media cabinet about 8 or so feet from the couch. I suppose another option would be just a Beam with something like an Era 100 in another room for more coverage of the apartment in total as I like to listen to music a lot.

Any feedback, tips, or ideas would be appreciated.

Edit: I went to a Best Buy with a Sonos demo and listened to multiple combinations. I think I'll go with the Beam + Sub Mini or a Beam and an Era 100 for another room just to add coverage through the apartment. The demo gave the option to disable the Sub mini and the change wasn't massive, however this was in a store and the demo content wasn't super bass heavy to begin with. So most likely I'll just start with the Beam and expand it as I feel the need to."	8	"[""jmbroady: For a small to medium sized room, the Beam Gen 2 with a Sub Mini will do wonders for you.  It really is a great little system.  Then eventually get some One SLs, Era 100s, or even Ikea Symfonisk bookshelf speakers for surrounds.  \n\nYou also have to consider what model TV you have and if it has eARC otherwise there's a chance you won't be able to use either the Beam Gen 2 or the Arc to its fullest potential."", ""Small_Assistance5944: For more immersive TV sound that won't disturb your downstairs neighbors, you may be better off starting with a Beam, then add surrounds before you get a sub. I have an older Beam Gen 1 with two Play:1s for surrounds in my 10 x 20 ft. carpeted living room which sounds great and I really don't feel the need for more bass. I also have Beam Gen 1 soundbars in two bedrooms which sound very good by themselves. If I was getting started with Sonos now, I would probably get the current Beam Gen 2 for my living room TV and two Era 100s to try in different rooms. For dedicated TV surrounds I would get a pair of Ones or Ikeas.\n\nFor dedicated surrounds you could save some money by getting Ones on sale or refurbished, or a pair of Ikea Symfonisk speakers. The Era 100s may be worth it if you really want the added bluetooth functionality or the optional line-in/ethernet adapter. Most reviews and listening tests suggest the Era 100s' improved sound quality is noticeable when they are used by themselves but not so much when used in stereo pairs or as dedicated surrounds.\n\nIf you add a pair of surround speakers you still have the option of switching them back and forth between dedicated surrounds, or separately with  grouped playback with the soundbar for fully independent volume control.\n\nWith the Arc and sub you may not get your full money's worth unless you have a large room and everything you watch or listen to supports dolby atmos and spatial audio. There's also a good chance you won't be able to get your money's worth out of an Arc and sub without turning it up loud enough to bother your neighbors."", 'Vise_9999: I just installed a Beam + Sub Mini + Ikea Symfonisk setup at our cottage/lake house and it sounds fantastic.  We have a 49"" TV limited by wall space so the Arc was overkill.  \n\nHighly recommended as it sounds fantastic... even got the wife\'s approval too.  :-)', 'tempturnipseller: I have a 55 inch TV and Arc looks just about right under the TV. If it’s 50 inch, Arc might be too wide. \n\nAlthough I had a Beam Gen 2 + Sub Mini prior to upgrading to Arc. I didn’t like Sub Mini that much because it really rumbled the floor and I don’t think the sound improvement is worth the risk. Arc sounds better for me and made me at ease.', ""Miss_Aerith: My current TV only has ARC, the TV I'm planning to replace it with has eARC. So at least for the time being, only ARC. I'm leaning towards the Beam Gen 2 with the Sub Mini. Figured I'd get some outside input. Thanks for the advice :)"", ""Redinho83: Do you think it's even worth getting a beam 2 if you don't have earch? Would you get benefits from music quality over beam 1 still?"", ""Miss_Aerith: Thanks for the input. I think I'm going to go for a Beam alone at least for now and maybe an Era 100 for another room in the apartment. I demo'd multiple combinations of speakers at a Best Buy and felt I'd be best off with a Beam."", 'diggardens: This is the correct answer. The ikea product is the best value/bang for buck in the ecosystem. I rate the Arc, at best 15% better than the Beam and the full sub at best 20% better than the mini. Go w the Beam - Mini Sub and add Ikea bookshelves as you go.\n\nAnd I have most modern Sonos products. Including a full Arc setup and a full Beam setup. Etc etc']"

I am planning my new home. And thinking of adding music options through out the house.

The house is ground + 2 floors with garden. 2nd floor will be guest bedroom so we can skip it.

My use case are
- Bedroom on first floor: Very low music at night for 30 mins in my bed room. Currently I use airpods for it.
    - My bedroom and kids room is upstair so announce everywhere e.g the food is ready will be a good option but not a very big use case. Currently I use facetime call for this purpose.
- Bathroom on 1st floor: currently I listen it on my iphone but I want to upgrade from that experience.
- Kitchen on ground floor: some light music while cooking.
    - May be having a screen in kitchen is good for recipes. I use my ipad/iphone for it currently and is mostly satisfied.
- Garden
- Smart speakers can act as doorbell too. 

I have couple of options:-
- Buy a move and take it everywhere with me in home. Only issue I find with it is that it may be on the other floor and I will have to go and fetch it many times during the day. The music quality with it will be great for my use cases. Costs 400 bucks.
- Buy 3 symfonisk and put one each in kitchen, bathroom and bed room. Garden will be missing. Will cost around 300 bucks.
- Buy 3 homepods and put it in bathroom and bed room. And put the kitchen homepod on battery dock and take it in garden on demand. Will cost 300+50 for battery dock. 350 in total.

Chubasc0	2	12vcn2d	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12vcn2d/single_same_configuration_for_tv_watching_music/	"Having researched easy to use setups for my technology challenged parents, I think the Sonos “Immersive Set with Beam” (includes Beam Gen2, Sub Mini, Era 100 x2) might be a solution for both watching TV & listening to music.  However, I don’t have personal experience with Sonos components, so appreciate any help or insights you might share.

I’m assuming setting up / configuring the audio for TV watching will be very simple using the Sonos app (I’ll do this for them).  But I’m unsure about whether the configuration should (or can) change for listening to music (ie disabling the sound bar).  Again, given that my parents are not tech savvy, any configuration / mode change (TV <-> Music) would need to be extremely simple…preferably using universal remote instead of Sonos app.

CONFIGURATION (planned, haven’t purchased yet):
- Television HDMI Arc or eArc to power on/off and volume control the speakers.
- Prefer to avoid using A/V receiver, instead using TV’s HDMI Arc functionality.
- Components connected to TV via HDMI include Sonos sound bar, cable TV box, AppleTV, Blu-Ray / CD (music) player.
- VHS tape player possibly connected via RCA cables (weird, I know…but parents are old).
- Wi-Fi connection for all components (TV, speakers, Cable Box, AppleTV).
- Music to be played via Bluetooth (from phones) and HDMI (Blu-Ray/CD player).
- Aside from initial setup, unlikely to use Sonos app.

Thanks in advance!"	1	['GuitarSuperstar: The Beam isn’t Bluetooth compatible. The Bluetooth feature is disabled on the Era 100s when they are used a surround speakers. But they could connect to the Beam using AirPlay with an iOS device.']

I own two Sonos One and two Sonos Five and a sub, all gen 2. We have an open floor plan so I have one Five in the kitchen and one in the living room. The sub is in the living room next to the TV.

I use the Ones in our cabin, one in the kitchen there (useful) and one in a bedroom (pretty useless). 

I am considering buying a Move for our cabin, to use in the kitchen for better sound but also outside on our deck. 

I don’t really know where to begin with planning what to place where, and I’m wondering if anyone could help me with how I should be using this probably pretty decent starter kit to get the most for my money. Thanks!"	1	['blackarrow7302: i am guessing all your speakers are used only for music and none for home theater. the ones can be paired as stereos and you can add the sub for your musiccin your living room. you can use a five in your kitchen and another five in your bedroom. and as you said, you can buy a mive for your cabin.']

We did our backyard last year and at the recommendation of install team decided to go with Sonos.

Both systems work great independent of each other.

Is it possible to combine these two systems so that they play the same music inside and outside the home at the same time?  

If yes, is this accomplished through the Amazon Echo or through the Sonos app?"	4	['GuitarSuperstar: No, this isn’t possible.', 'Doazanz: Feed a Sonos Line-in with an Echo Dot and group everything.

 YES you can in fact link your Era 100 via Bluetooth to a TV as use it as the audio source.

And yes, you can also set them up as a Stereo Pair and STILL link them via Bluetooth to your TV for audio output. The sound will work in Stereo.

Now, this won't apply to everyone as it's going to really depend on your TV, however ALL the Sony Google TV models from 2020 onwards support this.

Unable to try other brands, so if you're able to test sending audio from your own TV to headphones via Bluetooth at home and it works, please post the TV model below!

Either way, using the Era 100 as Bluetooth speakers is entirely possible from the TV and latency is practically non existent in my own testing, your results may vary! Turning the TV off switches the speakers immediately back to WiFi only.

Turning the TV back on, the speakers immediately switch back to Bluetooth so no input required. Remarkably smooth."	8	"[""WinterPublic2445: Using it on a TCL Android TV.

1682155163.0	22-Apr-2023 02:19:23	What to do with my OG Playbar?	TheLordNyuk	2	12v0eqd	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12v0eqd/what_to_do_with_my_og_playbar/	"Hey there /r/sonos,

Long time Sonos user and I love it, but have managed to tie myself in knots over the ongoing role of my OG Playbar in my system, so thought I would turn to the community for a sanity check.

First – a bit about my setup overall.

All this is in a small townhouse, so physical room space is not massive.

**Living Room / Kitchen:**  Currently 5.1 - Beam / Sub Mini / 2 x Play:1 as surrounds. This is attached to a Sony Android TV with HDMI ARC. Main video use cases are the Android apps for streaming services (Netflix, Stan, Youtube, MLB TV) and very occasional terrestrial TV or casting using to the TV using the built in ChromeCast. No external DVD/BluRay/Cable boxes.  Spotify Connect to the Beam is the major music use case, or using the Sonos app directly for a network attached music library – but we will also use the built in Android TV apps for music too, for example when we have company and the visuals are useful. We don’t use Apple Music, which I feel is important to this scenario.

**Guest Bedroom / WFH Office / Gaming**– This room wears a lot of hats - the joys of small townhouse living. Currently just a One, for music use only – mainly podcasts while I’m working. The room has another Sony Android TV, also with HDMI ARC, which gets similar video use as above, as well as being my WFH monitor and my PS4 gaming screen. Both my WFH docking station and PS4 are connected by HDMI. WFH PC Audio through speakers is mostly irrelevant but would be a nice to have. Another gaming PC or next gen console might happen up here in time, but I’m not counting on it.

**Other useful info:**

* We very infrequently use Alexa anywhere in the house, but wouldn’t want to rule it out either if possible – except I disable the mics in bedrooms.
* We would like our guests to be able to play their own music, or use the guest TV with good surround sound too. I do have a guest VLAN on my Wifi, but it's mostly trusted family who stays.
* Most other rooms have a One for Spotify Connect / Sonos music – we get the whole house bouncing on cleaning day. :)
* I’m more an IT guy than an AV guy, so while I’m no dummy, I’m not completely up to speed on all the various supported protocols, standards, etc between Optical/HDMI, DTS, Dolby, etc.
* I’m definitely entrenched in the Sonos ecosystem as you can see.. but I’m not really looking to add anything else (like an Arc for example) right now… got a wedding to try and pay for first!
* I've used the upgrade credit from the Playbar to add the Sub Mini - relevant if I'm considering selling the Playbar.

I’ve had my Playbar sitting in a box for a while now, as in my old house (and before the Beam) this was my main living room soundbar – of which I vague have memories of not being use with Spotify Connect as well as the (expected) AirPlay, without grouping it with another AirPlay enabled speaker first.

I was thinking I’d sell the Playbar, but it's just such a good system, so I’ve just unboxed it and set it up again, and I can now use it with Spotify Connect – or maybe I could all along?

So, my **questions** are:

* Where is the best spot for my Playbar?
   * Even though I’m quite happy with the Beam setup, am I better off putting the Playbar back into service in the living room in place of the Beam?
   * Or should I connect it up in the Guest room, and if so, will I get the audio passed through from the PS4 or laptop connected to the TV by over HDMI through the TV optical to the Playbar?
   * Could I also pair this with some Symfonisks to have an over the top guest room / very reasonable PS4 setup – but I'm not sure - will surround audio get passed from HDMI inputs over the Optical output and to the Playbar?
   * Is the Playbar better off connected to the TV with the least number of external inputs (eg zero, in the Living room)?
   * Is selling it and finally saying goodbye to the device that started it all the right move?
* I don’t use anything that relies on AirPlay2… right? Sometimes various apps get a bit confusing in iOS as to whether you’re using AirPlay or another method – confusion I want to avoid for my fiancée, and my own by extension, my own wellbeing.
   * I could add an AirPlay receiver app (such as AirReceiver, which I've dabbled with) to the Android TVs to bridge any gaps there, I guess.
* Is there anything else I haven’t thought of?
* Am I overthinking this? (Answer: Almost definitely yes)

Anyway, I hope there is enough info here to help set the scene, and I look forward to some input from you all – if you have any questions about it all I’m happy to add them in replies :)

Thanks in advance! :)"	1	['TheLordNyuk: Anyone? Bueller?']

So I could listen music in stereo +sub and then switch to movie beam+sub. The space is small so I could put the mini at the center so that would make sense but  I wanted to know if this is possible for the system and would it be seamless?

I received my Sub Mini yesterday, and having some trouble connecting it to my system. 

When I plugged it in, the status LED is white, so I supposed I need to reset it.

Plugged it out from power, hold Join button (the only button on Sub Mini) while plugging it in. The status LED began to blink white, but after a while it just came back to fixed white light.

I have tried this many time, but still haven't been able to reset it in order to pair with my system.

I then plugged ethernet port in to it, and was able to find its IP in my network, and Web Interface (port 1400) works just fine (REPORTED as Sub Mini, too!), so it's not totally dead, but it seems like there isn't a way to reset it from Web Interface.

Have anyone experienced this problem (on both Sub Mini and other devices), and any tips? Appreciate.

Cheers!"	0	[]

Tairc	1	12uqgu0	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12uqgu0/alternatives_to_sonance_ceiling_speakers/	"I'm doing new residential construction, and will be using Sonos Amps for in-ceiling audio (I've already got a ton of Sonos stuff). The [Sonance in-ceiling speakers](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/ceiling-speaker-pair) are fairly pricey - $650 or so for a pair, or $400-something if you buy the strange Amazon listing.

Online forums seem to like the [Polk RC80i's](https://www.polkaudio.com/en-us/product/in-wall-in-ceiling-speakers/rc80i), while my local AV store wants me to consider [Bowers Wilkins CCM632's](https://www.audiolab.com/bowers-wilkins-ccm-632-in-ceiling-speaker-pair/).

Any suggestions or thoughts?  I've got a few areas to cover (Sunroom, Kitchen, Dining Room, Living Room, Atrium, Bar, Hot Tub) - I'll likely end up with the Polks in the Hot tub regardless (moisture) but really don't know how to tell which is 'better' without buying them all and trying them all - which seems extreme, and wasteful."	7	"[""oktoberrust11: I've done a couple of residential whole home audio systems, and am about to move in to my 3rd house with in ceiling speakers personally.

Quicheanon	1	12uomzv	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12uomzv/arc_upgrade/	I know I won’t get the upgrade discount - but thinking of going from Beam2 to Arc.  I have pair Era300 as surrounds and a Sub Mini. One of the reasons- and please tell me if I’m wrong- is I was listening to Dolby/Atmos songs and the eras and sub were great but I could tell the Beam wasn’t on the same level. Feels like there needs to be more separation from the main source speaker. Drums/voice/bass compacted in there and then you’d get this incredible flourish of guitar or keys or backing vocals from the Eras. The Arc would solve this, yes?  More speakers= more separation? I know a bug determining factor is the room itself. It’s big. 20x20 but the ceiling is vaulted - but only about 5 ft, maybe less. Knowing that - will the difference be noticeable if I go with the arc?  Thanks for any advice in advance	4	['legallypurple: I think that makes sense. The Era 300s obviously can pair with the Beam, but I think it is meant to go with the Arc.', 'GuitarSuperstar: Yes, the Arc will make a big difference especially with the height channels.

DrivingDegree	0	12uny0f	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12uny0f/is_sonos_a_good_fit_for_me/	"I am looking for a better speaker/surround system than what I currently own while reducing cable clutter, and Sonos seems like a good option. My budget is around 1000usd.

My setup is a little weird. I have a small room which is around 12x12ft but may move to a bigger space in the future. Current Speakers are Logitech Z906 (I know, not well regarded among most audio communities), connected to:

1. Windows PC via Optical using a Soundblaster X sound card, which provides permanent DTS and Dolby Digital audio.

2. 2019 TV via Optical (it also has ARC, no eARC, but I have never used this feature), which is also connected via HDMI to my PC, and I sometimes use it as a secondary display for gaming or even watching content from my PC.

3. Chromecast Audio via 3.5mm Jack to enable the speakers to do Spotify streaming from any device within the same Wi-Fi network.

From what I have read, I am thinking of a Beam Gen 2 + Sub Mini, or Beam Gen 2 + 2 Era 100's, but I am not sure if any of these would allow me to switch between my PC and TV.

Any opinions or suggestions?"	2	['formerswimmer32: The sonos beam has one connection via HDMI (with an optical adapter for those that use that connection). Unfortunately there is only one so if you wanted to switch between wired connections that wouldn’t be possible.

Note: I have a beam V1 so they may have added additional HDMI ports.', 'DrivingDegree: Thank you! I ended up getting a Beam and Sub Mini :)']

Sound is great. I wanted to add surrounds and my wife knew that so she got me a pair of ONE SL's (white of course). I hooked them up even after debating returning (because the Era line came out a week after purchase). First thing I did was true play them. They're mounted about 5 feet behind the main center couch on the walls behind. (10 foot ceilings) mounted about 7 feet up, angled down toward listening area. First thing I tried was music. System sounded awesome! Huge improvement. However watching regualr TV is very underwhelming (music is probably 20% of the usage  in the family room)  . Watched a couple scenes in atmos of  several action films on Netflix. (I realize the ones don't use that)  and sound was better at a higher volume. They are set up as ""surrounds"" but it's night and day hiw much better the system sounds with music compared to movies/TV.   I also have the five in my screened in back porch and that speaker is incredible even as a stand alone. 
I'm considering switching up my setup. Would the Era 100s be much of an upgrade to the ones as surrounds? Or 300's?  Or maybe even 2 fives as surrounds (is that even pososble) 

If I did make a switch. Could I use my ONES in my bedroom by themselves for tv watching? Or do you need a soundbar first connected to the TV to be able to add the ones?

Anyone with a Beam 2 specifically running into issues? That’s what I have and noticing most people here seem to be adding it to an Arc and loving the improvement.. I’ve been having to tinker non-stop to get the sound balanced. Basically, quiet scenes are too quiet and loud scenes are too loud, with surrounds needing to be maxed out in the app to even get much of an effect from them.. that’s not even touching on how quiet they sound overall for 5.1 content.. is this just me or due to the Beam maybe? I want to love these so badly but my honest review right now is the Ones I had before were just easier to use and generally sounded better for the majority of content in 5.1 and stereo, with definitely some improved performance on 7.1 Atmos, but overall experience just doesn’t feel worth the cost right now.

My non-audiophile guess is these haven’t been calibrated very well for home theater rears and also need the middle driver to be activated at least a little bit?"	8	"['Electrical-Street-16: Yes, I notice after the latest update 15.3 volumes needs to increased, however I did TruePlay.

Having said that, I have read posts where people have used the 300s as surrounds for the Beam and really liked it.', 'Think_Juggernaut8968: Most likely it’s a bug, i think i’ve read it somewhere that there are issues with volume control on IOS devices with ERA’s', ""Comfortable_Ad3005: I really haven't experienced volume issues with the Era 300s (paired with Arc) leaving them at 0 for TV audio after Trueplay. If you're upgrading from the Ones, you're not going to always notice sound coming from the 300s, especially in stereo content, because they aren't constantly beaming audio directly at you. So if you crank the volume up to +10 to make sure you're always hearing something, it's going to be too loud when they are really supposed to kick in.\n\n\n While the switch to the 300s was jarring at first because I had gotten used to the Ones, it really is the Ones that don't operate well as HT rears in my opinion. The 300s offer a much closer surround experience to what I used to have with a traditional Klipsch 7.1 setup and I definitely don't want to go back to the Ones, expensive as the 300s are. When there is ambient noise or other effects that call for the surround channels, the 300s produce a wider and taller soundstage that the Ones simply can't compete with."", 'deorex33: Yep I have the mini sub and it’s very hard to calibrate a balanced listening experience where the bass and overall volume is stabilized watching a film, in quiet scenes you think you need more “oomph” but then if an action scene kicks it it can get comically loud and so it’s just a constant game of moving the dial around in the app for volume, surround and sub audio levels, I don’t think there’s a way to currently have one setting make the experience feel good for all different media/scene types so it’s just a lot of Sonos app twiddling these days lol', 'deorex33: Yeah considering doing the same but kind of ready to just throw in the towel, I added the sub mini like 2 weeks before getting the Eras in and that was a feeling of joy as it immediately made the setup feel enhanced and I think did a good job allowing beam + ones to focus on the finer details, but adding the Eras has just been a totally different experience so far and for the cost just doesn’t seem worth it at the moment.. I have a feeling they’ll get it right eventually but we’re like at least 4 months away from any significant updates as they’re going to pull in our user data (including return rates) to analyze and correct issues, and I just don’t think this amount of investment should give you a product tester experience, they should have done a lot more QA before marketing them as rear surround replacements, they don’t even seem to have consistently messaged how to position them in user manuals/marketing materials so feels like maybe they don’t even know what’s best, and I do think the center driver being disabled seems like a decision that will get tweaked eventually, some of these issues do seem to come from that choice.']"

1682110429.0	21-Apr-2023 13:53:49	Decided to jump to the Sonos train, €500 budget. Where should I start, Era 300?	Stonneddd	9	12ui06i	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12ui06i/decided_to_jump_to_the_sonos_train_500_budget/	"I currently have an Edifier 1280DB hooked up to my turntable and my iPad via Bluetooth, which I have really enjoyed so far, at least for its price.

Recently, the wife said I should spoil myself, so I decided to jump on the surround sound system train. The thing is, my budget is €500 (+/- €100) at the moment, and I am really confused about all the Sonos options. I can spend another €500 next year if I am satisfied with the experience.

My main focus is to listen to digital and vinyl music and have that room-filling sound. I will probably listen at low volumes, as I live in an apartment. I also have an Apple TV 4K, but I'm not really concerned about TV content at the moment.

My room is about 7×5 meters wide (could be smaller, like 6×4, not really sure)

1. **Single Era 300 or Single 5 (2nd or 3rd gen)**  
First, I've decided to buy a 2nd hand Play:5, but then I realized there is a new model called Era 300, which in theory should be more future-proof with the Dolby Atmos support and all the reviews I've read mentions its mind-blowing performance. Then I leaned more to Era 300.
2. **Two One SL's or Era 100 or Any Combination Ikea Symphonisks**  
Then I saw people recommend buying 2 pairs of speakers instead of just buying one to have that surround experience, which supposedly makes a lot of difference. But I am more impressed by the premise of the Era 300 (I also want to experience that experience of “mind-blowing sound”) and want my setup to be as future-proof as possible. And  it would be hard for me to replace systems along the way since Sonos is not officially in Turkey and 2nd hand market is very limited.
3. **Sonos Beam + 2 Ikea Symphonisk Bookshelf as Surrounds**  
Then I realized I can buy refurbished Sonos Beam 1st gen and 2 IKEA bookshelf speakers as surrounds, then I would have a nice budget home theater setup. But in this case my turntable would be useless, and I am not really sure how can I add an Era 300 or Five in future to this combination on a single room because surround setup of the soundbars are supposedly limited. (1 sub + 2 surrounds AFAIK). In that case, the turntable speaker would not be included in the home theater setup, then it would be an overkill investment for just listening vinyl.

**TL;DR:** I have a €500 budget with a possibility of another €500 in the coming year and I want the best of Sonos experience.  My room (apartment) is around 30 square meters (322.917 square feet) is and has one TV and one turntable. What would you do/buy in my position?

I get the error, that Amazon Music is in use on another device, when I play Amazon Music via Sonos App. It happened on the second day on my new Era300 and only Sonos product so far. It worked seamlessly on the first day.

- Delete Amazon Music account in Sonos App.  
- Remove authorization in Amazon account.  
- Remove any registered devices in Amazon.    account 
- delete Sonos App.  
- remove era 300.  
- reset era 300.  
- install Alexa app and add Sonos as skill.  
- disable/enable Sonos skill in Alexa app.   
- reset Alexa, Amazon Music links and apps.  
- all of the above and start completely fresh.     
   
Result at any point is the above error, with one exception:   
As soon as I removed Sonos App and afterwards the  Amazon Music app, the Era 300 started playing a Amazon Music song of my playlist. I was unable to change anything, because I wasn't connected to the Era 300. This only happened once and I can't reproduce it.   
As soon as I installed everything again, I couldn't play any song.   

I can play Amazon Music from any device: Laptop, Smartphone, Desktop and stream it to Chromecast. The error appears via the Sonos App only.  

Can anyone help please?  
Thanks in advance.

This  is in no way meant negatively... but what led you to believe the much less expensive sonos setup would sound better?\n\nIt should be producing better directional sound on sources that support it, but that's still not going to replicate the actual quality level of those KEF speakers. Certainly, stereo sources like music wouldn't come close. Sonos against even similarly priced standalone speakers won't sound as good.

I use the Google voice assistant on a Sonos One speaker. Twice in the last weeks, the Google assistant has spontaneously started speaking about dogs. The first time, it said something along the lines of ”I sometimes wonder what it feels like to be a dog”. The second time, it said something about the wonders of how dogs fall in love.

Both times, this occurred while I was watching a tv show, leading me to think that the assistant was inadvertently prompted by a voice from the tv. However, these events are not listed in the My Activity-history. All other voice activated events are listed. So I’m not sure what the hell is going on.

I'm familiar with it cause of family who have it but they have older models.  

I have this really old speaker system for my bedroom a lg  LFA840, just two speakers. The've held up well and have a ton of  bass. But they are overdue for a replacement and I think slowly breaking. 

Would like to keep stereo audio which means pairs of era 100s. But worried about the bass which is why I like the idea of the 5. I could  go with a pair of 100s with a mini sub but then I lose out on the volume if I want to really turn it up. 

Good bass is key for me as I like  house/electronic music. I seem to have made up my mind already due to budget and desire for stereo audio. I thinking two era 100s and buy a mini sub at a later date when I get more money. I can deal with the quiet 100s vs a 5 simply cause I'm still living in apartments etc.

Obviously not fair fight, but stereo is all I think I'm missing. The lgs handle their volume a bit better and have way more bass but I can feel they are warping the audio adding in almost a reverb and tons of bass whereas the sonos feel more neutral. Stereo pair would be nuts."", 'CuzFeeshe: Yes, that is what the sub mini is for.  Once you add that in the balance will most likely shift.  Sonos subs are very nice.']"

Long time Sonos owner. I had a full s1 system with 1 incompatible product (original play 5). I've been in the process of moving and the whole system has been boxes. 

I bought a new Arc + sub and setup s2 and been using my TV. I hooked up my old Beam and play 1 both s2 compatible and tried to upgrade it to s2. It failed with it trying to open the s2 app seeing the arc already and not doing anything. One time I s2 app actually only showed me be and play1. I got upgrade and now those 2 devices show up correctly in my s2 app. However now I can't see my arc and sub.

It is a nice mount and is more robust than it looks (the way it locks into the bracket I was worried but it is solid).

Just in case anyone desperate maybe Sonos UK have the singles in stock..."	2	"['zugshad: do you like the look of it on the wall mount vice the shelf? I thought about ordering the mounts, but instead of paying 130ish for it, I found a nice pair of floating shelves that only cost me 35 and I actually like the look. also lets you ""decorate"" it a bit more for a nicer look and feel in the area (for the spouse).', ""plocktus: I did get a floating shelf that fitted nicely, but I prefer the cleaner look of the mounts I must admit. I think it's because one of the Eras sits on a display cabinet unit and with the other on a shelf it looked slightly odd versus with the mount""]"

I'm just curious as to what the advantage is other than louder bass? If so, wouldn't that be achieved by just adjusting the sub volume higher?  Is this mainly done for larger rooms? My setup is currently an Arc with two One SLs and I'm saving my shekels for a Sub.	28	"['CuzFeeshe: It’s a luxury for sure…. But does sound pretty amazing.  It isn’t generally for more bass, but to spread the bass sound out evenly in the space.  I have 2 subs - one for the bedroom and one for the living room.  When Sonos started supporting 2 subs in a system I moved the one from the bedroom into my living room system just to play with it.  The results were very cool.  I ended up eventually buying a sub mini for the bedroom and permanently moving 2 subs into the living room.  I use one facing toward the seating positions from the front of the room, and the other behind the couch in the rear of the seating positions.  Necessary?  No.  But very cool sounding.  Takes it up to 11!', 'bondbig: Adding second sub can actually make bass less heavy, but instead provide more even room coverage and higher overall quality of bass (smoother frequency response).\nSo if you are into loud booming bass - no need to add more subs, just shove it in the corner and crank it up to 11.\nIf you want to have better bass throughout, even on lower volumes - then 2 or even 4 subs (not with Sonos though) is the way to go', 'D_K21: I don’t know about a world of difference, but it makes a difference if you have uneven bass response in your room.

You'll also see quite a few people saying overall audio didn't improve. You'll also hear people who are just sub biased---you can read that they get the ARC and say get a Sub next. It's almost an advertisement for not understanding surround sound audio. you buy an expensive sound bar (ARC)--you want surround sound to sound better---you would add rears which are rear surround.\n\nMany of us here write and report plenty of bass from the ARC and our rears.\n\nThe sub decision is really about one's desire to have more bass and perhaps a felt bass. \n\nThere are other writers that talk about the sub redistributing sounds within the existing Sonos  system so that the other speakers can do a better job. I'd recommend first trying your soundbar and rears and playing with bass, ambient, loudness. All of this is done not to get more bass but to get the system sounding the way you like it.

When I added the second, it was even throughout, and it didn't matter anywhere I was sitting or standing in my living room, it evened out.

Thinking about getting a Sonos Move for traveling. I currently have a Roam but want to get bigger sound from the speaker. 

I wanted to ask anyone with a Move for some feedback: 

1- How do you like the sound? Lows, highs, etc.

2- How much does the sound differ over Bluetooth versus Wi-Fi? 

3- Do you have any issues trying to connect the Move to. Hotel networks? This will be bought for traveling so will always be on new hotel networks. 

4- It’s certainly a bigger speaker, so what are your thoughts on its size for portability, and it’s build quality as it’s going to get thrown around a little during travel. 

Thanks for any help!!"	16	"[""j_nak: The Move is much, much better sounding than the Roam.  It is much bigger and more expensive, so I would hope it sounds better. \n\nWifi sound is a bit better, but Bluetooth is pretty decent.  Not big enough of a difference to tell with casual/background listening.\n\nEven travelling with my Roam, I don't switch it to the hotel wifi, It's a bit of a pain.  Just use Bluetooth and put your phone on hotel wifi if you don't want to use data.  \n\n I don't travel with the Move as it's too large. Plus, travel always risks damage and it's a lot easy to stomach some dings on the Roam vs the Move.  The grill on the Move is prone to dents - mine has a small dent from an unknown and unnoticed incident.  I think the Roam is better suited to travel."", ""PenoineAddict: i pack it in my checked bag when i travel for work. \n\nIt's worth the hassle/cost for the sound. Wifi is better, but as a bt speaker it is the best bt speaker i've come across. You can stream upto 24bit/48khz only with wifi. \n\nHotel wifi will not work seamlessly bc of the typical hotel wifi portal login screen. You can get around this two ways. \n\n1)Spoof the mac of the move to your laptop, provision hotel wifi on ur laptop, turn off ur laptop wifi and unspoof mac. Then connect ur phone and provision hotel wifi and then you need to connect ur move to the network like normal. \n\n2)Set up a local wifi network with a portable router/ap. They cost like 40$ and ur move will always auto connect no issues. \n\nIt is heavy, but the battery kicks ass and the weight gives it a very dense/expensive vibe. i've left mine out on my balcony during a snow storm and a few other rainy days; it's working just as great. I have dropped it over the last couple years soo many times and it just has a single ding on a corner. If you plan on bringing it on ur carry-on,and it fits inside the carry on, then you'll be fine if it's a two day trip. Anything more and u want to check a bag bc u need the sonos move and the charger for it. You can not use most usb c charging bricks, i have never seen a device so particular on the power source. \n\n\nThe highlight for me is that the battery is replacable unlike every other speaker.

I set the SSID and password to the same as my home network and the Sonos Roams connects to it without having to update/change anything in the S2 app. 2 Roams in stereo is not a bad combo. I would try that before getting one Move. 2 Roam SL's is still cheaper than 1 Move. \n\ngetting the AirPort Express set up with the LAN in the hotel is usually another mess if there is no LAN cable port in the room, but the best way I have found to do it is connect the laptop to the hotel wifi and internet share from the laptop to the AirPort Express with a cable to create the personal wifi network that my Roams can connect to (this is all on Mac OS). \n\nIf your travel is not hotel based (ie camping/hiking), then all this is a moot point and the wi-fi stuff is not important and 1 Move on BT will be much better (but also much heavier and bulkier) than 1 Roam on BT (2 Roams can't be stereo or even doubled on BT, which does not make sense to me)."", 'kidtexas: I love mine. Sounds great: a lot better than the Roam and a little better than a One. I’d take it on a car trip but not a plane.

This is my very first day as a Sonos user. I've bought a pair of Era 100, a Sub Mini, and a pair of Moves. Everything sounds really good and I'm really really excited. 

On the other side, I'm a bit struggling with the use of AirPlay. 

What I understand is that you have to have all devices connected on the WiFi, together with your mobile device (I have an iPhone). The songs are streamed directly from the device to all selected speakers.

If I turn off the WiFi on my phone (or my phone gets randomly disconnected) everything drops. That's annoying.

I'm coming from an older setup, where I used a pair of passive speakers wired to an amplifier (Onkyo). The amplifier is a network stereo receiver that supports various audio streaming services, including Spotify. So basically, I can select any song from my phone, send it to my Onkyo and then let it play. All without the phone being connected over the WiFi (it could be even turned off). 

**Question: is there any way to do the same with my Sonos speakers?** 

Also, having the songs played out of my phone, it consumes all the battery rather quickly...

The Sonos Ones that I ordered on EBay for $200 arrived today. I ran home from work to set them up and try em out and wow - pretty amazing how awesome they sound along with the Beam!

Any input is greatly appreciated! Thanks!!"	2	"[""GadgetronRatchet: You want to try to keep them mounted near ear level!

I am considering returning the era 300s and going back to the Ones for a couple reasons and was hoping someone can talk me off the cliff…
(Before anyone asks, everything is setup correctly in my system)

1. I am not a fan of the design and my wife objects to the size of speakers (eyesore in our main living area)

2. While (luckily for me) price isn’t a huge factor, I just don’t feel it’s worth the $1200 upgrade (including stands). I would say the 300s definitely sound better than the Ones, but just not $1200 better imo. Maybe my ears aren’t as fine tuned as others though especially as it relates to the upward firing speakers. 

3. The content I mainly watch isn’t in Atmos to fully utilize the 300s. I’m a big sports and TV show watcher (HBO type tv shows), and typically those items are 5.1 max. 

Just my two cents. I will say, the second sub made a huge difference for me (one sub in the front and another behind my couch). I would prioritize that upgrade over the 300s."	65	"['Dutch_Bartman: Seems to me a clear decision. More cons than pro’s. And making wife happy probably counts for two!

Looking at getting a soundbar for home tv & films viewing. 

I can get a good deal on a Sonos Beam (gen 1). Other option would be soundbar & subwoofer and rear wireless speakers, something like the [Sony ht-s40r](https://www.whathifi.com/news/sony-launches-the-ht-s40r-soundbar-with-wireless-rear-speakers). 

Which would I get a better audio experience from? I'm not likely to buy a Sonos subwoofer as they're crazily expensive.

Seems like Atmos tracks are significantly more bassy than the usual stereo ones. To the point where I am slightly worried about pissing off my neighbors...

While spatial audio does sound good with my Arc + Sub Mini + 2x One SL, the equaliser seems to be all over the place with a clearly V shaped sound profile. Does the Sonos system even use the equaliser when playing Atmos content?

Edit: Tested the following tracks on Apple Music (both Atmos and normal stereo), also tested against Spotify for good measure

2. Take on Me by a-ha
3. Anti-Hero by Taylor Swift

Over the years I have bought a lot of sonos speakers, a sub and a couple soundbars. My decision to stick to sonos for all things audio has been primarily driven by convenience and sound quality. I don’t really care about the voice assistants.

I am looking for just 1 new speaker for my office room and am confused between Era 100 and 300.

I hardly use sonos app for music playback. This is not a problem for my existing arc, sub and 2 ones as I have Apple TV that can route Spatial Audio or Atmos content to this setup.

However, for my office room, I would want a speaker that will primarily play from my phone or mac over airplay. 

As spatial audio over airplay is not supported, should I get the cheaper Era 100 over the 300?

Or should I break out of sonos and buy the HomePod 2?"	7	"['GuitarSuperstar: If you are only connecting over AirPlay and don’t care about music in spatial audio, get a stereo pair of Era 100s or a pair of One SLs.', 'bitsnotatoms: Or consider a 5, if you want only one speaker and you pan to use it only with Airplay.

I’ve read various forums that talk about how Sonos and Unifi do not play well together… but shouldn’t a hardwired connection be flawless?

Sonos uses the original Spanning-tree protocol (STP) and your unifi devices are probably running rapid spanning-tree protocol (RSTP). It's possible that even with multiple hardwired links, it is still using the wireless between speakers rather than utilizing your wired links. Specifically I would see if you can set the priority on your Unifi devices from default of 32768 to 28672, and change it to use legacy (STP) path costs, if that isn't possible then you could try switching the unifi from RSTP to STP, still change the priority."", 'DogTownR: My approach has been to hardwired as many speakers as possible, use UniFi Wi-Fi for the remainder, associating them explicit with the nearest AP.

I ordered several Symfonisks due to the new reduced pricing. I just received three speaker covers and am quite happy with them (this isn't sponsored in any way). Happy enough that I've ordered three more Symfonisks and will be ordering more covers.\n\nCaveat that I'm no audiophile, but to my ears they sound just like the Ikea covers. I don't notice any difference in sound quality. There are a couple of other places making covers but they seemed to be located in Europe and, since I live in the US, it seemed easier to order domestically to minimize shipping issues.\n\nThe quality of the printing seems great. I mean, it's on fabric so it's not going to look like a regular print. Maybe there are some colors that won't come through well but I'm pretty happy with how mine turned out. I'll be curious to see over time if it attracts dust or what not, but should be super easy to run a handheld vacuum over it.\n\nThe first order I placed came damaged; UPS had bent the package badly and the cardboard backing for the covers was bent beyond my ability to straighten it. Symfonx was super responsive and sent out replacements, and changed their packing to be more robust. I was really grateful for the quick response.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions. But the executive summary is that the covers look great and sound great (to me, anyway) and the customer support seemed top notch. I'm still thinking about where to mount them permanently, so I apologize for the poor quality pictures."", 'pbsurrey: Unisk have a good rep and seem cheaper for the custom option.

I am planning to replace two Sonos One surrounds with a couple Symfonisks once I figure out the best way to mount them. The sound bar is an Arc and I've got two subs there as well.\n\nIt's unlikely to be ideal, because the wall on which I'm mounting them has a sliding barn door which limits the mounting locations for a picture (my Ones are on stands), but like I said I'm not an audiophile and my TV room is definitely not ideal for acoustics regardless.""]"

1681826899.0	18-Apr-2023 07:08:19	Spotify songs skipping (I may have stumped Sonos support)	ylenroc	2	12qo97r	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12qo97r/spotify_songs_skipping_i_may_have_stumped_sonos/	"I'm taking a shot here that maybe someone else has had a similar issue/problem. I am a long-time user of Sonos, with a decent size setup (roughly 17 Sonos devices scattered about the house). I have not had many issues over the years, but one has recently cropped up that is making me crazy.

One of my main uses for Sonos is to combine songs from multiple sources into one big queue, using the Sonos (S2) app. For example, I’ll have a queue that is made up of roughly 15,000 songs from my music library (hard drive on my home computer); roughly 9,000 songs from Spotify (7 Spotify playlists that have in the neighborhood of 1200 songs in each); about 100 songs from Bandcamp and another 100-150 or so from Amazon music.  The queue is in shuffle mode and played on multiple speakers in my house, usually grouped together.

The issue is this – when a Spotify song follows a song that is from my music library, Amazon or Bandcamp, it will play for 30-45 seconds and then skip to the next song. No error message or any other kind of popup. If that song is followed by another Spotify song, that subsequent song will play fine. All non-Spotify songs play fine.

This started happening about 2 months ago. I’ve had no change in ISP (Xfinity 1.2GB) nor any additions/deletions to my Sonos setup in that time. One of my devices is a Boost hard wired into the gateway. I spent several hours with support where they noticed IP conflicts and some interference. I ended up replacing the ethernet cable from the Boost to the Gateway, rebooted many of the individual Sonos speakers and subwoofers and even used an Xfinity Xfi mesh extender pod to hard wire my Playbase. I also re-booted my gateway many times during the whole process, sending them diagnostic reports along the way. All of the interference and cable issues went away, but the Spotify skipping problem still exists. Frustrating, to say the least.

Although the support techs were very nice, I simply couldn’t spend any more time with them (I have a job), so I thought I’d throw it out here to see if anyone else has had this, or similar, issues.  Any advice? Thanks!"	11	"['Johnnybarlowww: App and speaker update released today.  15.3.  Update your app and the speakers to see if it fixes it.', 'deanso: Kind of the same issue here.

Previously Era 300 played spatial via Sonos app (Apple Music inside the Sonos app) only?

Can't see any update for my Era 300 so it will be playing spatial directly from the Apple Music app. 

Where is the magic that it could not before and now it can?

Tried songs from Sonos spatial playlist directly with the Apple Music app and they sound pretty spatial to me now:

In both setups, it blew us away. We tested using following

* TrueHD (i.e. 7.x and not Atmos over DD+, validated in Sonos app About System) with Atmos , all of them were significantly better than with the ones, some scenes were jaw dropping in the sound difference. We tested using 4k Blu-ray player, Shield 2019 and X Box Series X Plex. All incredible
* DD+ Atmos (e.g. streaming services), noticeably different as well vs ones, however TrueHD is definitely a more richer sound (as expected)
* Apple Music Atmos, definitely notice difference as well versus the ones (note some Atmos tracks are not great examples to demonstrate)

The biggest difference we notice is that prior with the ones, the spatial sound was front biased (as expected given the ones are not positional). However now, the positional sound is 360. As noted in another comment, the sound is so good that our cats even look around the room in response to some of the testing we did. Additionally, we haven't even bothered with proper positioning of them yet, which we will do when we get the proper wall mounts (using a temp solution for now).

As many have commented, make sure you test with proper sources, got your TVs etc setup to pass through properly, and most importantly the source has to be an adequate quality (and actually Atmos) to enjoy it fully."	6	"['zugshad: Nice Congrats, I just did the same this weekend as well replacing my Ones with the 300\'s.\n\nWe definitely love the sound more, specially when it is Atmos.  The upgrade seems ""slight"" when planning normal 5.1 or music at times as the family was like ""seems almost the same"" but when I put on some Atmos, they were blown away,,  Daughter and I watched the final episode of Carnival Row and were amazed when heard/felt some running/dripping water start behind us when we didn;t see and then as it came on screen and forward, could hear/feel it pass over our head then to the Arc. So much nicer.\n\nAs for testing, I have been trying to test. Not sure I have anything/seen anything come in as TrueHD or 7.x so far,  is it only achieveable via blu-ray disc and such? \n\nWhen streaming, I am getting mixed. I have seen some come as Atmos, and then some shows that said Dobly Vision or Atmos, the app reflected as DD 5.1,  when I streamed some music that was supposed to be Atmos, i had mixed.  I tried Youtube Music and all of theirs that said 4k came back I thnk as DD 2.1 or something like that,, know it was a 2.   Amazon Music that was Atmos I think also came in as a 2.1 on the app,  might have been 5.1\n\nWhen I streamed from my phone via Amazon music, I think that was the one that might have been 5.1, and same 5.1 I think when i did sonos musci, but I don\'t have their HD plan.. the HD from them is the same bitrate and qual as Amazon Music. Amazon shows that the soundtrack was 24bit and the 14.4 (something like that) hz but said the max for the device was 16bit with the 14.4.\n\nHaven\'t tried streaming from the PS5, but the Sonly is the 85k series and think it ""should"" stream better from a quality sake than the PS5.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nany thoughts/suggestions to test better?  I did confirm that the Arc is in the eARC slot and the PS5 is in the other 4k ARC slot. both do 120hz', 'facialmast3r: Sonos needs a way to let you use your 300s as stereo pairs for music, but use them as surrounds for movies without having to manually remove them. The 300s sound amazing for music in stereo pair. But it’s a marginal improvement for 5.1 content as you stated, and even for Dolby atmos content I dunno, I don’t notice a night and day difference from my era 100 surrounds. It’s maybe 10-20% better? Come on Sonos give us this feature', 'plocktus: For TrueHD, it is Blu-ray yes. Streaming services are at best DD+ Atmos (which is max 5.1, 768kbps I believe, vs max 18mbps from memory). That is where you will really notice the difference both because of the 7.1.2/7.1.4 output and the bitrate. Alternatively, you could use a ""rip"" of your bluray with TrueHD soundtrack on Plex (direct play) with an appropriate device. Unfortunately, most TV apps will not always passthrough TrueHD (only DD+ at best), so you may need to use an external device (e.g. Xbox, Shield, note the PS5 only supports Atmos from bluray and not apps or games). \n\nNote for your PS5 as above, the PS5 only supports Atmos on Blu-ray only and not apps and games. The Xbox Series X does support Atmos in games and apps (some of the Atmos enabled games sound incredible, like MW 2.0).\n\nTo see if you are getting TrueHD passed through correctly, in about Sonos you should see the following under your Arc speaker;\n\n`Audio In: Dolby Atmos (TrueHD)`', 'zugshad: Thanks,\n\nyeah, tracking all on the PS5..  Though the PS5 does ""spatial"" audio and I know you can get it on headsets via the games, and I\'d have to test it and see if it works through the sonos.\n\nwith the new 300s, we get ""7.1"" type sound vice the 5.1  or only if it is trueHd?  still new to the differences. Like, thought I read/heard that the arc+sub+2 Ones was 7.1 but the max sonos would give is 5.1??  then read that now with the 300s, its ""true"" 7.1 (or whatever the numbers).. \n\nwas having a discussion with coworker,  if you are playing in Atmos, does 5.1, 7.1, 9.1 even make a difference?\n\nI will have to see if I ahve any blu-ray discs laying around to see if any are in atmos to  maybe try it out in the ps5', ""plocktus: Yes, you still can get a TrueHD input irrespective of the rears. What the Eras do is unlock 7.1.x plus provide positional sound from the rears (which will benefit 5.1 as well). TrueHD works as input on Sonos arc and beam gen 2. Beam gen 1 is DD+ max, play bar DD and Ray DD+ I think from memory. \n\nIn my situation, I guess there's 2 main variables at play which makes it difficult for me to distinguish a weight of what causes the improvement, is it the Eras vs Ones or  7.1 vs 5.1 with the ones, but I am pretty sure most of it will be the speakers themselves over now having 7.1.x, if that makes sense."", 'zugshad: yeah I agree,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think for your latter,, it is both. I went in and listened to each speaker individually before I did the upgrade. the 300s are much better sounding just on their own regardless of the set up. .so changing them out, im sure will always be better.. the only time i the Ones are supposedly ""better"" is if you are doing the music in stereo but thats the only time i think they might be better (based on pro reviews)']"

Are there any known major issues with the speaker? I have 2x Ones and 2x Play 1s that I currently use. Thanks!	19	"['padphilosopher: The Roam falls off the system a lot and is just in general quite finicky. The sound is also not that great. If the primary use is travel and outside use, I’d get a normal bluetooth speaker, such as a JBL. \n\nI use my Roam for bathroom use. Before that I had a One on my bathroom counter. The One sounded much better.\n\nThere are two things which I’ve liked about the Roam. Every now and then I bring the Roam out onto the patio with me, and for that use it’s been nice. My partner likes to play the news in the morning via Bluetooth (long, boring story why she likes to do this), and the Roam allows us to share this with all of our other Sonos speakers so I can listen to the news in the Kitchen when she’s getting ready in the bathroom.', ""zugshad: For me, I am a bit different than the other comments so far. I personally love my Roam for it's use. I haven't had any of the connection issues that most are discussing, when the speaker is not in use, it will shutoff/disconnect, but I have not had any issues going into the app and seeing it and playing through it.\n\nSound wise, I love the sound. I have owned several JBLs (mostly the flips, which I would say is the comparison model based on size and such) and I think the Roam sounds better than the JBL. I have used both as a pc speaker, music, movies, etc and the Roam just seems to outshine the JBL every time,  family agrees.\n\nLike the others said, since you have a Sonos ecosystem, the Roam seems like the nicer choice as well to fit into it and you can  use in the house as well, outside, whatever, and even group if needed.  \n\nI'd say if I was going to buy again, I might go up to the Move for the portable aspect, but only for home or maybe taking to park/beach/etc, but for traveling I am not sure I'd want to fly and all that with the Move,  the Roam would be the nicer option for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust my thoughts"", 'natespartakan: Reddit hates it.  I think it’s good.  JBL is probably a little better but it doesn’t fit into the ecosystem.  I’ve only had mine for 6 months and it’s a bathroom speaker for me.

It obviously gets used a lot more because I can use it to extend sound from the existing Sonos system at home (on top of outside use on BT). \n\nI think the preference for the JBL is because it goes louder and seems to have more bass, however I find the Roam more balanced and the vocal clarity especially. Considering the size I typically don’t push volume that loud to begin with so on the JBL I was at 40 and comparatively go with 60 on the Roam.   \n\n\nApart from maybe once or twice it disappearing from the system I haven’t had any other issue (in almost 2 years of use) and those only required a reboot.', 'kameradhund: well, my „problems“ so far are: \n\nthe on/off button is strange because most of the time it doesn’t react as it should\nthe battery drains fast when sound level is higher than 50%\nthe sound is not good under 50% sound level but is fine when at 60-80%\nit can’t do sonosnet (!)\nit sometimes looses connection for a few seconds \nthere is no manual true play option via ios device (!)\n\nover all i think that roam is too small and move is too big. no idea why they didn’t make a speaker in the middle.\n\nfor 100€ it is fine, for 200€ definitely not.', 'LISCoxH1Gj: I like it.

I don't like the idea of some products being forcefully retired to be able to upgrade to something new.

It'll work, but it'll be clearly surpassed by what's new. With speakers, a speaker that sounds great today will still sound great in 10 years, and the performance between it and a new product is going to be quite small. You won't be retiring it because it doesn't hold up anymore. You're retiring it because you have to if you want to add current products in the ecosystem. \n\nI think Sonos can do something about this, and they choose not to. S2 may have paved the way for a lot of new technology that just wouldn't work in S1 products, but streaming music is streaming music and there's no reason that can't still happen across generations. Instead of dividing ecosystems, they should be finding a way to incorporate legacy devices with limited functionality. Make legacy products only support legacy audio formats, I'm 100% fine with that, but let me group them with my modern products for when I'm playing a format that both support (aka most music).

I look at my 10 year old phone, which has spotify on it and it can't connect to the spotify server, my guess is because the protocols have changed. Now my phone has no option to work, stand alone or other. At least with legacy Sonos products they can still function  by themselves, and you get a 30% upgrade option if you want.

The tracks John Coltrane's *Blue Train* played in Atmos when grouping an Arc + Era 300 surround set, Era 300 stereo pair, and Beam Gen 2 + Sonos One surround set.

When I then grouped a Sonos One stereo pair the music dropped very briefly, the Atmos logo disappeared from the Sonos app Now Playing screen, and the music resumed in stereo. The difference was definitely audible and a downgrade.

It's disappointing to have to downgrade to the lowest common denominator if I want to have music playing throughout my home.

I'm going to read through the [iTunes Package Format documentation](https://help.apple.com/itc/musicspec/#/itcc9a9d50d8), not sure if it will provide any insight.

For anyone wondering, and I’m sure that’s a small few, many modern sonos systems will be using Wi-Fi and not the older solution, SonosNet.

Seeing that the CR200 setup screen requires a connection to a Sonos product for setup, and not the usual mobile/desktop app, I assumed that it’s using SonosNet to connect to such a product.

And after a quick check, Yep! The CR200 uses SonosNet and has no perception of Wi-Fi and therefore a pre existing SonosNet network is required for its setup. The people who found that they could only add a CR200 if they already had another CR200 set up are in that position because SonosNet was already running for that existing controller, and so it was instantly ready for another one.

I found that my ZP90 and Play 1s were not connected to ethernet, therefore using Wi-Fi as usual, and so the usual ‘Press the buttons on the nearest product’ didn’t work, as the products weren’t visible to the CR200 without SonosNet.

Simply plugging in an Ethernet equipped sonos product to your router would enable SonosNet throughout your S1 system, and therefore pressing the Play/Pause and Volume Up buttons on THAT product when prompted would allow the controller to connect.

So…

1. Connect an Ethernet enabled product (in my case, the ZP90 (Connect)) to an Ethernet source.
2. Restart said product if it doesn’t already by itself.
3. Follow the CR200 setup instructions (pressing the requested buttons on the Ethernet connected product from Step 1)
4. Voila! Enjoy your dates controller in all its glory.

PS, if you’re worried that your CR200 is on a lower firmware than mine (7.5), don’t worry, so was mine originally. As I connected it to my system, an ‘update now’ button presented itself on the Home Screen. Updating isn’t required, but won’t do any harm either.

If you already knew this, Great! I’m just making this post to refer people who are unaware.

However I'm not quite sure where I would put them. Our basement isn't massive, and we've filled up the space with a big couch and a long desk for the kids behind the couch (see photo). Right now the Symfonisks are placed on the end of the desk and on a TV tray in the very corner of the room, which works pretty well. But, I know that the Era 300s like to be placed a bit closer together, and shouldn't necessarily be angled at the listener like the Symfonisks are. I feel like the ideal placement is to put one of the 300s right where we have a walkway to a bedroom... any thoughts?

In this photo the TV (not pictured) is centered on the couch, so the center seat of the couch is the ""ideal"" listening location. The floorplan is also a mirror of the actual room.

I listen to a lot of jazz in my small 120 sq ft office. I bought 2 era 100's cant decide if i want to return them and get 2 era 300's or order the sub mini. they sound good in the space but a little more bottom end would really add a lot of warmth. If i understand how the system works the sub mini would take over the low end leaving the era 100's to handle the mids and highs. If they are working less with the results for standard audio be better than 2  300's?	27	"[""zugshad: If you're not taking advantage of the atmos/spatial then I think your best bet is actually the fives (if price not a problem) as the #1, then the next choice is the era100s from what i have heard and read. those both work better on your non-atmost/spatial audio.\n\n300s would be the best if your going to take advantage of the atmos/spatial..  heard they are planning to release era500s to replace the Fives,, so you could go cheap now with the 100s and then in future go for 500s"", ""asdfjkl826: Everyone is different, but I think adding stereo sound will make the biggest impact.  The second biggest impact will be adding the Sub Mini.\n\nI have a bunch of Sonos equipment that are joined together in various ways through my house.  I have a single Era 300 in my dining room, a stereo pair of Ones in my kitchen, a single One in my bathroom, and a Sub Mini with a Beam in my bedroom.  Honestly, while the era 300 sounds great, I think the stereo pair of Ones in my kitchen sounds better than the single era 300.  I've actually ordered an additional era 300 because I think I'm not doing the speaker justice by NOT having it in a stereo pair. It's just... missing something - and I think the something it's missing is being part of a stereo pair.\n\nI'm basing my recommendation off of my experience with the Ones, but if I were you I'd 100% keep the era 100's and add a sub mini.  The sub mini is PERFECT in a smaller room, and this will really complete the setup.\n\nAlthough, another commenter recommended doing a Five stereo pair?  That's DEFINITELY something to consider.  With two era 100's ($499) and a sub mini ($429) you're $928 invested.

My living room is a long one split in two sections, so it wouldn’t be great to have the speakers on stands right behind the couch, i.e. in the dining area and in the middle of the room. 
Resuming the unobtrusive placement of my old Play:1’s, turned towards the x, seems like a bad solution because of the side firing drivers.
The couch is sitting 12 ft / 4 m from the TV and 16 ft / 5 m (!) from the windows directly behind it, where I could place them on the window sill. I’m considering if mounting them upside down above the windows in the back might help the sound overcoming the distance.

I currently have a homepod 2 and while it sounds great I feel like I want something more deeper in bass, I’ve been reading that the five is more immersive but it also lacks the 360 degree audio that the homepod provides. People are also saying that the Sonos five is really good ONLY if you have the volume cranked up really high. I will be using it strictly for music, and I don’t mind too much about any smart assistants (Siri, Alexa, etc). I know that these speakers are incomparable to some, but I just wanted to hear some of your feedback. Cheers!	10	['toodeephoney: Sound is subjective, but imo, the Homepod 2 is good, but the Five is godly.', 'littleempires: I have two play 5s set up as a stereo system and the sound for music is immaculate. Get the five and save up for a bit to get a second one, you won’t regret it.', 'legallypurple: Get another HomePod', 'namkawaiiki: Homepod is good but 5 is god', 'TwizzledAndSizzled: Get the Sonos Era 300. Compare the two and see how you feel. \n\nThat’s my recommendation—I just did the same thing, bought the Era 300 and compared it to my current set up, and I’m super happy with it. \n\nThe five is great but it’s missing some really nice features for long term. The Era 300 is more like a “grown up HomePod” so I’d shoot for that if I were you.', 'berryman10: I’ll look into it, I’ve heard about the Era 300 going around and people seem to enjoy it a lot. Thanks for the recommendation!\n\nI’m terms of the play five not being long term do you mean that is in Sonos creating a speaker to replace the five, or it lacking a smart assistant, atmos, etc.', 'DanielDeni: Latest Five launched in 2020. It only has WiFi 4 (just like HomePod), no Bluetooth, no Mic and has only stereo audio support. At low volumes it doesn’t sound dynamic at all.\n\nEra 300 is WiFi 6/BT5 and supports Dolby Atmos music from Apple Music. The Atmos from the Era 300 is a lot better then the HomePod. In the bedroom we have it at 5% volume and it’s still dynamic with enough bass. And if you want you can also add a Sub Mini that extends the low range further than the HomePod can ever go.\n\nRecently replaced all my HomePods with Era 300 around my home. Haven’t looked back.', 'berryman10: That’s sick! I didn’t even know Sonos had a mini version of their subs. \n\nI’m definitely leaning towards Sonos now, I just need to find out what I want. I’m not too sure why I’m so fond of the five but maybe the Era 300 + Sub mini will blow the five out of the water.', 'ReasonPleasant437: Agree. The Five is dated in so many ways and you have to get to at least half volume to really hear what it can do. I don’t normally play my volume that high. It’s also not great at mid-range without a sub. A little muddy which a sub clears up. I much prefer the Era 300 and 100s in a stereo pair and returned four HomePod gen 2s for that reason. The HomePods have an uneven and in many ways harsh sound plus aren’t reliable on the network. I really wanted to like them but for stereo two era 100s sound great and the era 300 is quite a bit better for spatial.', 'CuzFeeshe: Peter Pee has some great info on all of this on YouTube.  Comparisons with the Fives and Era 300, sound and feature comparisons with HomePod 2.  As well as review of sub mini.  He is one of the leading experts, you may want to check out his videos before making a purchase.  I have all of these speakers.  For music, my preference would be Era 300 with ability in the future to expand to 2 Era 300s and a sub mini over time.  However, Era 300 also requires specific placement for best affect, and needs space around it including space above.']

I’m torn between the Eras 300 and HomePods (2023), upgrading from stereo HomePod minis:

* I use Siri on HomePods to start/stop playback, change volume and skip/repeat tracks - is it possible to integrate Sonos controls into HomePod Siri and have similar experience? I have Home Assistant and HomeKit bridge installation (if that matters) and if I opt for eras I'll keep one HP mini just for Siri/HomeKit in the same room
* Excluding the Dolby Atmos support, is Sonos Apple TV connectivity comparable to HomePod? Will I be able to output Apple TV stereo audio to stereo paired Eras 300 wirelessly, same as I do it with HomePods? Will it be significantly worse than the Dolby Atmos enabled Apple TV+stereo HomePods setup?
* Is the Youtube Premium (not necessarily Yt Music) experience on Sonos better or worse than on the HomePods (where I'm forced to stream content from my phone/tablet via AirPlay)? Do I still need to Airplay 2 or can Sonos stream from YouTube directly?

I have Apple TV 4K 2022 connected to older non-eARC projector and I use Apple Music subscription for audio, YouTube for everything else and Overcast via AirPlay 2 for podcasts."	2	['legallypurple: From your use case, I’d go with the HomePod Gen 2s.', 'lifereinspired: Take a look at the Soro App on iOS AppStore.

So, I wall mounted my tv. Is this not an option for you?  \n\nAfter mounting the TV, I didn\'t (nor the wife) like the gap between the TV and the ARC down on the stand. So, I went to lowes (or HD) and bought a 70"" wood shelf and some brackets and then mounted that on the wall to put the ARC on it. Aesthetically it is wayyy better and I think it also sounds better as well. The Arc is just below eye level when sitting back on the couch and we used trueplay to tune it. For us, no issues with this.  If anything, my TV mount should have been slightly lower and we would lower the shelf by a few inches a well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope helps some.']"

I’ve been a Sonos user for quite some time now and currently running a setup involving a Playbase and two Play:1 speakers.

Because of space and design reasons my wife brought up changing our TV for a projector/beamer.

I now find myself in a situation, besides lighting, wiring etc, where I have to rethink sound.

We will have to ditch the Playbase as it just doesn’t make sense for us in this case. Of course the Arc or Beam would make a great fit, but with the new Era speakers I at least want to see if there are any alternatives out there.

Tl;dr: Would the following setup work and kinda make sense? Model for the projector is not chosen yet: 2x Era 100 as stereo speakers, one of them connected via line to the beamer, completed by 2x Play 1 as rear speakers.

Thanks!"	4	['GuitarSuperstar: No, that setup will not work.\n\nGet an Arc or Beam (Gen 2) and connect it to your TV via HDMI ARC or optical.

1681671328.0	16-Apr-2023 11:55:28	I am experiencing repeated audio cut outs when using the Xbox Series S with the Sonos Beam Gen 2 (no issues with the PS5 and Apple TV). Any ideas on how to resolve this issue? More details below.	Spoggi99	2	12oktv6	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12oktv6/i_am_experiencing_repeated_audio_cut_outs_when/	"I know this sounds weird, but I have an audio problem that is definitely caused by the combination of Sonos and Xbox.

When I play something on the console, the audio cuts out for a few seconds every 2 minutes or so, which is quite annoying. I've tried different audio settings and even reset the console - both to no avail.

As mentioned in the title, this only happens when using the Series S combined with the Sonos Beam. The problem does not occur with my PS5 or Apple TV. I also tested the Series S on a different TV (without a Sonos system) and there were no problems.

Above that my Sonos system made a loud popping noise and then rebooted three times over the course of two months (I also have to reconnect the Sud Mini). This seems to be a known issue with the Xbox. Could there be any connection between these problems?

Frankly, I've run out of ideas and need your help.
Any tip or insight is much appreciated :)

But, should you wish to switch to more Atmos focused system later on, you can either move the Symfonisks to another room (or resell) and purchase the Era 300. The point being, no other system allows you to upgrade piece by piece and use the speakers elsewhere or standalone (even a setup like the Sony soundbars, the rear surrounds can ONLY be used as surrounds with a Sony system). Also, if a Vizio rear surround dies, you lose the whole system (unless they can still repair/replace the speaker).\n\nAlso, the Sonos system has far more smart integration than any other I’ve seen. If you use the Soro app on iOS, it adds support for basically every Sonos setting which you can use in Shortcuts. It’s great for creating a nighttime listening mode (you can change the rear surrounds levels, the EQ, turn on night mode, turn on voice enhancement, etc…all with a single click or voice command). I’ve been looking for other systems which can do this but have found none. Even the flagship Samsung Q990b with SmartThings integration has nothing like this.\n\nEveryone’s ears hear things differently and people have different preferences but I wills say that in my opinion, the Beam Gen 2 punches well above its weight in terms of price and even size. It’s pretty amazing. Vocal/dialogue clarity is better than the Q990b or (in my experience) even than the Arc.

I am planning to buy one SONOS ARC and one SONOS ERA 300 and to always use together (both TV and Spotify streaming).

On official website, ARC is always selled with a PAIR of speakers (either ERA 300 or something else), so I wonder if such configuration is possible with only one ERA 300.

What would happen installing two ""spatial"" speakers at such position (blue), as they would both send some sound to the right/left/up/down?

Shall I better install a pair of SONOS ONE at the opposite of the ARC (green)? Then what advice for the kitchen?

Thanks in advance!

To get true dolby atmos or spatial audio surround sound with the Era 300s, you would need a pair of Era 300s.\n\nIf a pair of Era 300s is more than you want or can afford to spend, you may be better off getting a pair of Era 100s and save your money until if and when you\'re ready to get two 300s. If you really want to save money now, you could look for discounts on a pair of Ones or buy the cheaper Ikea Symfonisk speakers to use as surrounds. Bear in mind that you don\'t have to replace or retire any of these speakers when you upgrade. If you add a pair of 300s later, you  could move your existing pair into other rooms and have a multi-room sound system. \n\nIf you do go with three rear speakers you should have the matching pair on either side and the third speaker in the middle. The third speaker in this setup would not be a true surround channel speaker. You would have to use grouped playback to have the third rear speaker play in sync with the soundbar and surround speakers.

For best atmos, put 2x 300 for your surround.  if price is an issue, then next option going down (based on pricing) would be 2 era100s, then 2x One SL\'s,, and then lastly the Ikea ones from highest to lowest.\n\nFor the kitchen, You could move that 3rd speaker in there.  since won\'t be atmos (unless you put 1 300 in there by itself and only run off that speaker) you could just put a One or One SL (depending if you want voice assistant or not) or you could add a Roam or Move in there... then if you are wanting to hear what is playing on your surround at same time, any of these options you could ""group"" them and still listen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a thought', ""cyril_dewez: Nice thank you very much for your help.

I just added a Sub Mini to my Beam 1 and 2x ONE SL Surround Setup and was very thrilled. I heard so much about the jump in quality when adding a sub, wider soundstage, better mids and highs for the beam and of course a nice but gentle bass. 
And now…
Nothing. 

I tested various positions, in front, right, left, a corner, left of sofa… did truplay… 
I can barely hear a differnce when turning the Sub on and off in the App. Only when I turn Sub Level up to 10 and more, I can hear the deep mumbling. But I definitly cannot hear better mids or highs… 

Deeply disappointed here. But before I Return it: what am I missing? How can I improve the result? 
I am not looking so much for the deep oomph, my desire is to improve the sound for the system as a whole. Especially for Music.

Other posters in this forum say this is not possible without annoying delay but I don\'t notice any delay or sync issues on my system.\n\nIf there is a slight delay or sync issue it will be less noticeable when your speakers are in separate rooms or far enough apart that you\'re really only listening to one at a time.

Delay issues will be more noticeable for dramas and talk shows where you watch people talking on-screen most of the time.\n\nAny ""Bouncing"" echo or vibration effect on my system only happens when the distant speaker is being played a lot louder than the nearest one. When all speakers are played at nearly the same volume, or the distant speaker is too low to be heard, there is no echo effect. If your soundbar is not loud enough to be audible or decipherable in your kitchen area, you should be able to listen on a kitchen speaker without annoying echo or overlap.\n\nThe thing I like best about having a whole-home sound system is being able to listen to my TVs and music all over the house at a consistent volume without having to turn anything up loud enough to be annoying or create distortion from echo and vibrations.']"

People are not going to get away with aimlessly choosing to place them where they fit, as they have done with one’s, with the 300s.\n\nMy opinion is, if you can place them where walls will recreate reflected audio in a 7.1 audio configuration that Dolby demonstrates in imagery - then do it.

Ones have a very simple a defined use of just pointing at the central sitting position. 300s, because they require correct position for both the inside drivers and outer drivers to correctly emulate the channels, are far more susceptible to be incorrectly placed. Maybe omnidirectional isn’t the correct term in this case, but I would argue that  most spaces are far more optimal for a single direction speaker as compared to one that requires two directions and wall bouncing. Having played with both the ones and the 300s extensively I can make the Ones sound great in lots of different positions behind my couch, the 300s can go from amazing to terrible both with minor rotation and positing changes. Which is I guess my point, Ones are a safe bet to sound great.', 'plocktus: Yes, there was directionality in that scene', 'MrZeDark: Def more spaces are far more able to support singularly directional speakers.\n\nI just keep seeing the poor placement of speakers, regarding the 300s - whilst also making complaints to the experience.\n\nWas trying to elaborate in greater detail your opinion. My only correction to your statement was that they are not omnidirectional.  Omnidireccional is like how a sub is, no matter where you place it you hear it, with little too no regard to the direction a sub faces.

1681597666.0	15-Apr-2023 15:27:46	Added a sub and cannot hear any difference. What am I missing?	tacocopy	26	12nl3nv	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12nl3nv/added_a_sub_and_cannot_hear_any_difference_what/	"Current setup is an Arc + 2 One SLs for the rears. I recently added a mini sub and could not hear a difference at all. Turning the sub mini on and off made virtually no difference in the audio.

I blind tested it with 3 other friends and they could not hear a difference either.

Next, I returned the sub mini and got a Sub Gen 3. Again, I cannot hear a difference.

If anything when the Sub is off, there's more bass since the One SLs are handling the frequencies.

Tested it again with 2 other friends and they couldn't hear a difference either.

I've tried moving the Sub audio from - 15 to +15 and they sound the same at both ends of the spectrum. 

From every comment here, they say the Sub is a game changer, what am I missing?

Could something be broken with my Arc or Sonos setup?

EDIT: It was because WiFi was disabled on my Arc. I thought since Arc was hard wired I didn't need to enable WiFi.

The sub works great now!!

Turns out I am a dummy, and had the speakers turned on their sides, which somehow makes them not connect using Trueplay. So I placed them with the Sonos logo on the front face of the speaker, oriented toward the top.

Just wondering if I am the only one with this issue, or if someone has resolved the problem. I have the ARC, two sub's, and two Era 300's, which replaced my One's. Everything is working fine, it all shows as connected to my network and plays media just fine, but the only thing that does not work now is Trueplay. It gets to the point where it would normally have you turn the phone around, and instead it says ""Trueplay Problem"" with no details.

If I unplug the Era 300's Trueplay works fine. Trueplay works fine in my other room on my Beam and One's setup also. I have updated all the apps, network software, unplugged and rebooted all equipment, and still not working. I did notice that while my Era 300's say they are connected to my network (in the ""About My System"" section, they do not show any network icons in the Era 300 tab, unlike the One's do. Maybe a network issue?

Hopefully there is some simple fix for this. Thanks!"	4	"['Comfortable_Ad3005: I ran into this same issue.

I have a 55 inch TCL Roku TV. It has served its purpose well, but since I just went full Sonos for sound, it’s a good time to update the TV. Here are the general parameters for the TV:

-	65 inch
-	OLED
-	eARC (that should be a given for new TVs, I assume)
-	4 HDMI ports
-	plays well with Sonos
-	preferably no Alexa, or the ability to remove/shut it off
-	4K (don’t need 8K)
-	does not need to be the latest model

I watch only streaming content through my Apple TV 4K. I very rarely play games on the PS5 or the Switch. 

Price isn’t an issue, but I doubt I would want to spend more than $3K for TV, because that seems obscene.

iPhone 13 Pro Max

iOS 16.4.1

Sonos app: 15.2.1 build 72239220

Sonos Era 100 speaker: I don’t know the firmware level.

Issue:

1-I’ve been playing my Amazon Music source via the Sonos app for over a month. Everything was running fine, connection on the network was working. No issues.


2-Yesterday, I went to play “My Likes” playlist from Amazon Music and it came back with a message “Unable to add to queue.”


3-I scanned my network and saw the speaker was connected to my network and detected as online. Things still weren’t working so I looked around online and was shocked to read from a Sonos support site that the recommended step by Sonos to resolve this is to REBOOT YOUR ROUTER. A client device is failing so shutdown the entire network! Are you kidding? I also read somewhere on the site that this is a recommended action to take every month to prevent future problems. This is like saying, “reboot your router every month to ensure your laptop and everything else will continue to be able to connect to the network!” This sounds like the Sonos speakers go into a zombie mode and become unavailable to the Sonos app if they’ve not been used in a couple of days. I presume if the speakers go into a power saving mode, the Sonos app would be designed to “wake” the speakers when the app was opened.


4-So, I had no other choice but to gracefully shutdown all the devices on my network and reboot the router. You can’t just blow every other device off the network. If they rely upon any DHCP assigned address, that’s one thing but those that don’t it can cause major issues during router reboot. The last time I needed to reboot my router was maybe 4 years ago! When the network was back the Sonos device was still discoverable on my network. It seems like an API issue between the Sonos firmware in the speaker and the Sonos app.


5-I went to play my music and got the same error message as indicated in point # 2 above.


6-Next, I deleted the entire Sonos app from my iPhone including any data associated with the app.


7-Reinstalled the Sonos app, completed the addition of the Sonos Era 100 to the app and to the network, and approved the Sonos app to access my Amazon Music source.


8-When going to play music as I’ve always done before, I still get an error message. After reinstalling the app, I now get the message “An error occurred while adding tracks to the Queue (701).” A slightly different message but it still makes reference to an issue with the “Sonos Queue.” That seems to be the source of the issue.


9-Then by accident I discovered something weird. Via the Sonos app and still using Amazon Music as the source, it could play all of the other playlists I created on Amazon Music which were 20 songs or less. But, for some reason it wouldn’t play the “My Likes” playlist on Amazon Music which only has about 120 songs. It can’t be the size of the playlist as it’s very small and has been working fine for weeks.


10-I used the Amazon Music app to play music on the Sonos speakers and it worked, except it was relying on an Airplay or Bluetooth connection. Wifi would provide the best quality for home use which is what was being used.


11-So, in conclusion there is no detectable issue with the router, the network, or the speaker. I very highly doubt that the Sonos speakers determine what playlists can be played and what can’t be played on them. This has to be an issue with the Sonos software.

I still cannot believe they want you to reboot your router. Anyone come across this same issue and found a resolution?

In need of some help or suggestions from redditors.

I have a very small setup currently in my basement… with arc, and the sub.
Trying to get a full surround by adding either ones or maybe new set of eras or in ceiling sonance speakers connected to amp.

The problem is that I have 2 poles  behind my couch and no outlets behind the couch unless it’s against the wall. 

So having speaker stands I would need away to hide or handle the power cord. The ceiling speakers would be the cleanest since I can fish that to this location.

With ceiling speakers should it be directly above the seating area or behind? If behind, note there is a beam so not sure if the sound would bounce off that.

The basement ceiling is a little over 6 ft.

Anyways hope the pictures are sufficient for an advise or suggestion.

I most recently purchased an Era 300 and, while I really like it, I want a stereo pair since I do a lot of music listening with it.  It's in a room with my turntable and CD player.  My dining room is my ""old school"" room where I'll spin a record and read a book or write in my paper journal.  You know - do analog things.

But, with the 20% off coupon, why not get some Fives instead?  But I also really like the Era 300, so maybe I'll add some surrounds to my bedroom instead.

Oh, Sonos - you're such a slippery slope.

(Note, the space for surrounds in my den and bedroom are fairly limited, so I have no plans to use Era 100 or 300 as surrounds.  I'll keep it as the One/One SL's for now).

First time getting into Sonos and I'm looking at replacing my LG SP11RA setup which keeps flaking out in various ways and hasn't delivered promised features (TV Sound Mode Share does not work as advertised, never did).

I have an LG C1 TV and I mostly watch streaming content from an Apple TV 4K and some gaming on PS5. The TV does eARC, and Atmos works with my existing LG SP11RA setup.

I'd like a surround system with Atmos.

So I'm thinking either:

1. The Premium Immersive Set with Arc which has the Sub (Gen 3) and Era 100s for rears
2. The Ultimate Immersive Set with Arc which has the Sub (Gen 3) and Era 300s for rears

I'd slightly prefer the Era 100s just because they are smaller, and the rears are going to be sitting on end tables next to the couch. It would be better if they take up less space. Also I have highish vaulted ceilings so I'm not sure the uprising of the Era 300s is going to do me a whole lot of good.  


But, does the Arc with Era 100s as rears still do Atmos? The marketing page for the set seems to imply yes, but I know the standalone Era 100s don't.  


Does anyone know for sure?"	6	"['GuitarSuperstar: Yes, the Arc and Era 100s support Dolby Atmos audio. It will be a 5.1.2 Dolby Atmos setup.\n\nSince you have high ceilings and are seated so close to the surrounds, I would go with the Era 100s.', 'frazell: As /u/calmkelp mentioned it would do Atmos as the Arc soundbar supports Atmos on its own. \n\nThe ERA300 will give you a more immersive Atmos experience and the difference is large enough to me to be valuable.\n\nYou have vaulted ceilings which are usually a challenge for Atmos setups with upfiring speakers and with a less punchy up fire on the Arc you might find the Atmos lacking on it. How do you find Atmos on your existing up firing LG soundbar setup? As that is likely a good way of gauging how much your ceiling will impede.', 'lifereinspired: Era 300 will support an inverted mounting method which doesn’t require bouncing off the ceiling.\n\nEra 100 will support Atmos but you’ll get no Atmos height effects from them, if that makes sense. If an Atmos object moves through the rear area, you’ll hear it via the Era 100 but only the Era 300 will support rear upfiring Atmos effects.', 'calmkelp: Thanks! this is very helpful.', ""calmkelp: I find the existing LG system fairly immersive.

You can do that, turn down the volume of the HT and turn up the sub volume if you want the music mostly playing from the fives and the sub. \n\nThere are apps that can automate those steps and automate a return back to the normal settings so you get the best of both worlds.

Frustratingly, the 300’s stop steering if you add any surrounds to them (whether 2 more 300’s or two One’s).

RevBingo	3	12m4hhf	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12m4hhf/sub_mini_very_quiet/	"I spent a few days at a holiday home that had a Sub Gen 3, and it immediately convinced me that I needed a sub!  My lounge is about 3.5m x 6m, and I'm not after an audiophile performance, so I felt I didn't need to go the whole hog, so I ordered a Sub Mini.

It arrived the day after I got back, I excitedly paired it with a Beam (gen 1), found a banging dance track, waited for the drop and.... nothing. Ok, maybe a little bit of something, if I stuck my head a couple of inches from the sub.

After a bit of playing, I've found that if I put the Sub level up to +15 it's roughly the sort of sound that I was expecting.  If I leave it at the default level 0, I literally cannot tell the difference between the sub being on or off, and I've done blind tests with a couple of other people who reported the same.

I've put the sub in a different room, and paired it with a Play:5.  I've tried turning other units off and on again.  I've tried Trueplay tuning. Same results. I chatted with support who told me the diagnostics looked fine, and of course then we get into ""your room is the wrong size/shape/colour"".  But it seems to me that if I can't tell the difference between the thing being on or off at the default settings that's surely a problem?   Or has the Sub Gen 3 somehow spoiled me and I have unrealistic expectations of this thing???

I try and reset it, and my phone recognizes the Sonos Arc, but when it tries to connect to the internet, it always fails. This doesn't happen to any of my other Sonos products, which I have many. I called support and they were having difficulties figuring out the problem, so they moved me to level 2 support, whatever that means, that I have to schedule. I'm thinking of just buying a new Arc, but am afraid of this occurring again. My system is hung up with a Sanu mount and the wires are hidden in the wall, so it's not easy to move. Does this have something to do with my wifi and the Arc itself? I use a Verizon wifi 6 router. 

Another thing that is weird is that despite it not connecting to the  wifi, all of the wireless speakers and subwoofer still work until I reset the arc and have to reconfigure everything, which I obviously can't."	6	"['controlav: It’s your router.', ""PanicLogically: I'm also going to go with your router---I had similar issues--the separates worked great but the ARC is a mother ship to speak to the other units in the same room.

Just replaced my Sonos Beam with the arc in my surround system, and it sounds great when watching movies, but when playing back music - the arc sounds very soft / low volume.

Have a dozen or so speakers including a small Beam/Sub/One HT setup in our loft and a Port connecting our primary living room HT. We're about to kick off a major kitchen remodel and as part of that replacing our flooring on the main level. With all the upcoming changes, the wife and I have been talking about aesthetics in our living room and what our options are for replacing speakers. You can see what I'm dealing with from a space/layout perspective in the pictures. We're probably 75% Movies/TV and 25% music with the occasional karaoke party with friends/family. Existing fronts are Definitive Technology bi-polars with 10in powered subs. They're over 20 years old, but surprisingly still sound pretty amazing. The center is a DT Mythos (had to downsize when we moved due to space on the mantle) and the surrounds are DT bi-polars mounted pretty high up on the rear wall behind the seating position and above the bar. 

Have been kicking around the idea of replacing everything with Sonos, but I'm just not sure the juice will be worth the squeeze. Forget for a moment that I'd have to hire someone to wire the electrical for the surrounds and find a way to properly mount them in a way that was aesthetically pleasing, would they work effectively that high up on the wall? Then there's the Arc. Replacing two front tower speakers with a soundbar sounds nuts. Right? I'm slightly less concerned with low end, as I'd buy two Subs. 

All that said, I'm looking for some sage advice. Should I keep looking to find a passive speaker series that is smaller, more visually appealing while still capable of sounding great? Do you think I'd be happy with Arc+Era300+2xSUB? 

Thanks in advance for any feedback.

As the title says just looking for some advice on what to do next with my set up. Due to move to our new home soon and had sign off to upgrade the sound system.

Presently rocking the arc with 2 symfonisk acting as rear surrounds. I am going to get the sub gen 3 to add in and I was looking at the era 300s as rears. However they will be right against the back wall with the sofa in front of them so very little room for the sounds to bounce which I have read they need? The sofa can’t be moved or relocated.

Also I was planning to hook up my turntable to one of the eras as well but I have also read to my dismay that if they are used as rear surrounds the line in is disabled.

So revised plan I’m thinking of is 2 of the era 100s to act as the rear surrounds, add the sub and then either a five or era 300 for the turntable? Other option is to leave the symfonisks as they are for rear with the sub added and just upgrade for the turntable?

Welcome any thoughts please 🙏"	8	"[""thearsenalinn: Quite a bit to unpack here.\n\nFirst, my era 300s are against the same wall as the sofa. They don't project forward, just up and to the side. So I find the surround noise works perfectly.  I came from Arc, Sub gen 2 and symfonisk lamps gen 1, and i find the era 300 a great upgrade. For the right content - atmos movies and spatial audio. honestly for anything else they are no better.\n\nHowever you've said you want to plug in your turntable. How often? if it's regularly enough that having to ungroup your surrounds and set up each time is a pain, and this is something you really want to be able to do then I wouldn't use era 300s for surrounds.\n\nIf the choice is an era 300 or a five for the turntable, get the five. As a stand alone speaker it knocks the socks off the era 300 from what I've been told.\n\nI don't think i'd bother upping the symfonisks to the 100s. just dont think its a significant upgrade but i'm happy to be told otherwise."", 'RiseSoggy: So a little update for you.

The frames are quite unique (don't be put off by the ugly patterns for covers, you can buy from third party , other covers. ) Really cool music sound.

I had never thought of hooking up the turntable to the tv to output that way!!! Definitely going to be looking into this thank you. \n\nI am with you in the symfonisk and have always been very pleased with the sound that comes from them. I have them in the kitchen as well for music and they have filled the room so well and so easy to place. Lots more research to do I think', ""PanicLogically: Keep us posted. It's odd, for the TV I own, what I can plug in and output. Turntables of today are not like the turntables of yesteryear. Some are self amplified.

While the [HD badging](https://developer.sonos.com/build/content-service-add-features/hd-badging/) system is nice to have, it does not distinguish between Dolby Digital Plus with Dolby Atmos and Dolby TrueHD with Dolby Atmos at all.

I felt a bit sad about it, but then realized I still have my 100 days free return/satisfactory guarantee.

I have spoken to Sonos, and they are fine with me sending back the One SL's. To switch my One SL's for two Era 100, I'd need to pay roughly €150 more (I used the 30% trade up, hence the ""low"" difference). Since I spent over €1000 for the system, I feel it is not that big of a deal.

My question is for those of you that have used both the One SL and the Era 100, would you say it is worth ~€150 to get the Era 100 over the One SL? I've read some reviews and people are saying they are better - i just want to know if they are €150 better. Is it a no-brainer, an okay trade or do you think I should stick with the One SL?

I hope to have neutral opinions here even if i'm in Sonos space :)

I'm the owner of an 10 years old Klipsch G17 speaker. I want to upgrade especially on the connectivity side (only airplay 1, no BT for example) but I'm scared to loose on the audio quality side! Am I right or speakers have improved drastically in 10 years and no matter which recent model I pick up I will feel a positive difference.

Thanks for your help!"	4	"['RaymondBumcheese: The G17 isn’t really an audiophile speaker so, at a guess, if you swapped it for a 100, even if you were to lose some fidelity it would be made up for with enhanced functionality. \n\nIf you consider what you paid for it, 2x 100s would come in at less money and absolutely blow it away.', ""Small_Assistance5944: This G-17 Air Wireless speaker looks much bigger and a single Era 100 probably isn't comparable.

Listener tests and reviews indicate a single Era 100 would be a big improvement over pretty much any bluetooth speakers of similar size. If you're looking for a bookshelf speaker alternative, the Five would probably be the best choice for music sound quality with a single speaker, but you wouldn't get the added bluetooth. Two Era 100s can also be linked as a stereo pair for more power and better stereo imaging.\n\nIf you're worried about bluetooth, bear in mind that with Sonos' streaming music integration there's a good chance you may not really need to use bluetooth around the house."", 'No-Efficiency-4055: For the price of two era 100 and sub mini you could try an SVS Prime Wireless Pro that sound much better (audiphile level)...

Frankly I can't compare the sound quality of separate speakers (w/ fairly high end specs) to Sonos\n\nBUT for the best to my ears, soundscape, Sonos won over competitors. Within the Sonos speakers, it's up to one's ears. if you're using an ARC (sound bar)--and into music, check out the fives. I'm speaking to the wealth of music that is out there that is non ATMOS. Ikea has the Symfonisk line which were made in partnership with Sonos.

I finally pulled the trigger and my Arc arrived today. I connected it with my sub gen 3, ran truplay and adjusted EQ and height channels before popping in Dune (4K Blu-ray). The moment has finally arrived and my anticipation is through the roof! 

My first impression is that the dialogue sounds very crisp and clear; however, I soon realized that the Arc’s sound is just more hollow. Even with the lossless max bandwidth  eArc and Atmos, it can’t compete with how my Playbar and sub fills and shakes my room and maintains a warmth. The playbar sounds more full. I switched between the Arc and Playbar with the opening scene and first sandworm encounter scene and after playing them back to back, the Playbar surprisingly sounded better despite no atmos/eArc.

It’s worth noting I do not have rears set up yet so I’m wondering if a full 5.1.2 arc setup will sound better then playbar 5.1. I have a pair of era 300s on the way so we will see with the 7.1.4 but right now I’m leaning towards returning the Arc. I’m sure the 7.1.4 will be an improvement but maybe not worth $2k.

However, I've hit a bit of a roadblock in terms of setting it up with my non-eARC projector. I'm hoping someone here can help me out.

So here's the situation: my projector doesn't support eARC, but I don't want to get rid of it since I'm happy with its performance. That means I need to find another way to get audio to the Sonos Arc. I've been considering two options: getting a new streaming box or a device to extract audio from HDMI.

Initially, I was considering getting an Apple TV, but then I realized that my current one is the last one to support optical audio. So now I'm a bit confused about my options.

Has anyone here had a similar setup? What streaming boxes with optical audio  or audio extractors do you recommend? Are there any other solutions that I might be overlooking?

Non-Atmos Surrounds (Ones, Fives, 100s, Play 3s, Symfonisks)	Han-Yolo44	12	12l4v7o	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/12l4v7o		1	['Han-Yolo44: Posted last night about my Era 300 surround set up and there have been questions about Stereo Music and how it sounds compared to non-atmos surrounds. I see this come up in other posts too.\r  \n\r  \n**My answer is not that it is better or worse than ones, fives, symfonisks, 100s or play 3s, but different when it comes to stereo music. Wanted to visualize what is happening so hopefully helpful for someone considering purchasing 300s as surrounds and what the trade-offs are.**\r  \n\r  \nThe eras bounce the stereo music off walls rather than pointing directly at you. The side firing woofers and tweeters do the majority of the work in concert with the arc. The inward facing woofers/tweeters and height tweeters of the 300s are dialled down and the center tweeter is off.\r  \n\r  \nWith the 300s, the soundstage for stereo music is wider to my ears than before (I had play 3s previous as surrounds) and more emphasized to the front/sides.  If you don’t have walls to bounce off of or it is very open, it might not sound great for stereo music. \r  \n\r  \nWith non-atmos speakers (ones, 100s, fives, play 3s, symfonisks), they are pointing directly at you from behind so at default levels and set to full (not ambient) the soundstage is often emphasized to the rear/side depending where you placed them.\r  \n\r  \nI suspect if you lean more towards stereo music and non-atmos content and are used to non-atmos surrounds playing music at your ears directly, the 300s could be disappointing.\r  \n\r  \nFor atmos music and movies/shows, the 300s are absolutely a better experience to me. I personally prefer how they sound with stereo music also because I like the soundstage emphasized to the front/sides.\r  \n\r  \nOutside of a home theater setup, the Sonos king of stereo music is a pair of Fives (+ a sub) facing you from in front.  The sub isn’t necessary for a great stereo music experience, just a bonus for a larger room and if you love bass.  I tried my 300s in a stereo pair with a sub and the fives (even without a sub) win for stereo music.']

First, a bit about what I've already got:

* Receiver - Onkyo TX-RZ730
* Speakers - Polk Audio LSiM703
* Phono Preamp - Pro-ject Tube Box DS2
* Turntable - Pro-ject Debut Carbon Esprit DC SB

OK, with that out of the way, here's what I was thinking about buying, and how I intend to set it up:

* Sonos Port
* Sonos Era 100 x2
* Sonos Era 300

So I don't care about surround sound at all - this is strictly for music.  Each Sonos speaker will be standalone (no stereo pairs) and will be spread out through the downstairs of my house.

The goal is to be able to listen to any streaming service or the turntable through any combination of the Sonos speakers + the Onkyo/Polk/Pro-ject setup.  I will note that my phono preamp has 2 outputs, so I was thinking this signal chain made the most sense:

* Turntable -> Preamp -> Preamp Output 1 -> Receiver - this will allow me to just listen to a record without involving Sonos at all
* Turntable -> Preamp -> Preamp Output 2 -> Sonos Port -> Receiver - this will allow me to listen to a record through any combo of speakers

Does this make sense?  Am I forgetting anything?  Any mistakes I'm about to make?

Thanks in advance!"	1	['damgood32: I see no reason why this wouldn’t work']

My HDMI cables are all new, high speed cables. My source is an Apple TV HD.

Connections:

AppleTV - HDMI port to the HDMI-switch input 1  
HDMI-switch -  HDMI-output(ARC) to the Projector HDMI\_input1  
HDMI-switch optical to the Sonos Beam, using Sonos optical/HDMI converter  


This will give 2.0 PCM audio. Even though the media is 5.1. If I replace the projector with my TV, the Beam receives 5.1. Regardless of using the ARC port in the TV or not.

On the HDMI switch, if I move the HDMI cable running to the Beam away from optical, and connect it into the HDMI port on the switch marked ""Audio Only"" the Beam reports ""No signal"". Same if I try with the TV connected.

I talked to the company I bought tha HDMI switch from, and they said that it should work. They even replaced the HDMI switch because they suspected it was faulty. But the new one behaves exactly the same.

In the bedroom we have a tv on a stand right at the bottom of the bed, I was thinking about adding another sound bar to this just to have Sonos in all the rooms really.

It would be so close that I'm pretty sure the Ray would be good enough, but then I'm thinking to myself if I get a ray will I be tempted to get the Ikea bookends or frames later making it pretty expensive for something I'll probably only watch casual late night tv on.

So I guess I'm mainly wondering does the beam 2 actually work really well as a Dolby Atmos speaker to push the sound above, behind and to the side so back speakers aren't needed? Or is it not worth the extra cash?

I know there\'s some logistics there and the woofers would have to stay the same volume to cancel out vibration, but I don\'t think it\'s as much of an issue of vibration with L/R tweeters not being the same volume. \n\nAnother thing would be giving the user the option to switch the rear surround ""inside"" tweeter in favor of the ""front"" tweeter. Unfortunately due to my living room, my Era 300\'s are more so directly behind the listening position rather than to the left and right of the listening position, so the rear surround isn\'t aligned very well.

For this you need two of the same speaker; i.e., a pair of Ones or a pair of Roams. ""Grouped"" playback is for getting synchronized sound on separate speakers; usually in separate rooms for a multi-room sound system. For grouped playback in separate rooms or locations you could get a Roam and a One.\n\nIf you want a relocatable speaker to use around the house and can afford the extra money, I\'d suggest considering the Move. The Move is like a little boombox that is powerful enough to fill a room, deck, or patio space. The main limitation with the Move is that it can\'t share music with other speakers if you are using its bluetooth, but when you\'re streaming your music around the house you may never need the bluetooth anyway.\n\nI have two Moves and decided not to get the Roam because the only time I need a small and portable bluetooth speaker is when I\'m away from home.

My question is basically, does music have to be played through the Sonos app to pair speakers?

Seamless surround field and more noticeable and dynamic height channels.  The 300s blend in with the arc nicely so it's a very balanced system. Feels like these were the surrounds the arc was always meant to have.\n\nFor music, some people will prefer this and others will like it less than the other Sonos surrounds. For stereo music, you get more emphasis on the front of the soundstage and is wider than before. The non-300 surrounds will give you more direct audio for stereo music (pointed right at your ears) which some people want.  For me, Stereo music is still best with two fives and a sub.\n\nAtmos music, this set up is amazing.

For now, no plans to upgrade.', ""Han-Yolo44: Yes I replied to a few others on this as I did do the sub crawl and tested a lot of different positions.  Short answer is, aesthetics, practicality and my preferred sound profile.  I think everyone with a sub or two needs to try many different positions, retune with Trueplay and pick the one that works best for them. \n\nThe most intense bass was when I had the front left sub on the floor in the corner and the other on the opposite corning in our dining room. However my wife and I both didn't like how it looked there and the kids kept wanting to climb on the subs. Once I pulled a toy out of the sub port it was time to move it. The second sub already made the bass much more enveloping and it is very present and room filling in this current position.\n\nI tried one or both subs behind the couch and it sounded good but both of us actually liked the subs on the same plane just behind the TV.  Behind the couch it didn't feel like the bass was all around us, it felt very clearly like we were sitting on it."", 'Han-Yolo44: Yup tried that for sure and it does sound good and you feel the vibration more.\n\nA sub actually fits really nicely under the console table between the metal frames, we just preferred the sound profile of the subs in front.', ""Han-Yolo44: Totally just weird camera perspective because I used the wide-angle lens on my iPhone.

My wife and I just preferred the subs both in front, the one behind the couch made it too obvious we were sitting near a sub, you got the rumbles but the bass was less enveloping.

Short answer is much fuller surround field and height channels are more dynamic. A significant improvement from 5.1.2 to 7.1.4, atmos movies/shows and music really shine. Even 5.1 content is more full. Balances very well with the arc. Hard to compare against the new Nakamichi dragon because it’s not out yet.

The center tweeter is deliberately disabled by Sonos when the 300s are used as surrounds. As I understand it, it's because the 300s are meant to be parallel to your TV (like how I have mine placed). Placed like this, the inside facing surround woofers and tweeters become your rear surrounds in 7.1 and point directly at your ears from behind.

I literally walked around the room paying attention to where sound was coming from as I was testing and placing things.\n\nWith the 300s, the outside woofers/tweeters work in concert with the arc side firing to emphasize left/right pans and widen the soundstage.  The result is a bigger sound stage, the sound is bouncing off walls and less direct than having 1s or Fives or Play 3s or 100s pointing at your ears.  The sound stage is more emphasized to the front which I personally like. With my old play 3s, the soundstage for stereo music at default trueplay levels was emphasized to the rear and I had to turn them down.  If you turned around, it was like just listening to the Play 3s (or ones in your case) in stereo by themselves but the left/right flipped.\n\nBack to your question, I think it could be interesting if Sonos allowed the center tweeter to be turned on or off.  I'm not sure if switching on the tweeter (without a matching woofer) would sound good. For now, it's a choice they've made and I'm fine with it.\n\nIf you like the way your current set-up sounds for stereo music, all I can say is that a setup with 300s would be different. You may not like it.  Now play some atmos music, and the 300s make the experience far better."", 'Han-Yolo44: Just replied, let me know if that worked.', ""Han-Yolo44: Looks like my shared links were blocked, here's the name of the table on Amazon Canada.\n\n  \nsogesfurniture Entryway Console Sofa Couch Table Sofa Table Console Table for Entryway Accent Wall Table with Shelf for Living Room, Black BHCA-DX-122-BR"", 'Han-Yolo44: I didn\'t want to replace my floors when I moved in so I had a carpeting company make me a custom ""rug"" using the same carpet we had put in in another part of the house.

This is my current setup with the ones on either side of the sofa facing inward and balanced on the center cushion. While the wife is at work, that’s my go-to spot for playing PS5 and it sounds excellent. However, when the whole family is home (which includes my other dog), I’m usually relegated to the recliner on the right hand side and the surround sound there really is more of a point source. 

The Era 300s are a surround upgrade in a lot of areas, but I was hoping the wider soundstage they provide would help make that recliner a more viable seat when watching movies or playing PS5. If I keep the Era 300s in the same spot as the ones, will the recliner be included in the soundstage? Should I move the surround to a spot behind the recliner? If I do that, will it impact the balance at the center spot of the sofa? 

Obviously, the feng shui that my wife recommends would be the ultimate decision point here, but I’m curious what others have experienced on this. 

Thanks in advance to all those who went through this trial and error with your 300s. I appreciate it!"	1	['adayinalife: This is that I would do: move both your couch and sofa forward a bit, and to the right (so the sofa is not next to the wall. Place o300s behind (the more room you can leave the better), one near the corner (but leaving at least a foot of space to the wall). Place other 300 to the right of the couch. Both 300s facing forward. This will be likely your best scenario. You do have an open living space so the side with the wall have a better surround effect but unfortunately you cant overcome physics.']

For movies in stereo or 5.1, the 300s and Fives are similar. The Era 300s will give you a wider soundstage in the back of the room, but the Fives will give you more direct surround playback because the front-facing drivers on the 300s are disabled when used as surrounds.\n\nIf I were you, I would test the 300s for yourself.

My living room is an 18 feet x 12 feet rectangle, and I have a neighbor to my left wall. My living room setup will be like this crappy sketch lol.

Green: where I plan to place the speakers, maybe 8-10 feet apart

Blue: sitting area; loveseat, and two chairs

Red: entrances to the living room, where foot traffic ends up being

All of the music I listen to is stereo, not Atmos, but that *could* change in the future, but not convinced. I also listen to CDs and have been planning to get a record player to play some vinyls. All signs are pointing me to getting the Fives. However, in my living room I mostly listen at a lower volume. My current Arc + Symfonisk surrounds + Sub gen 3 is set to a volume limit of 50% and I rarely go above 50 (so that would be like 25 volume normally with no volume limit set?).

I've read a bunch that the Fives don't come alive unless you crank it up, but I really want to know *how much* you would realistically have to crank it up to get good performance out of it. I don't want to have to set the Fives's volume super high or anything since my listening area is not super big and the wall separating myself from my neighbor is not super sound-proof.

I was thinking about the Era 300s and know that their bass response is not as strong as the Fives, but I also have a sub mini that is currently being used with an Era 100 in another room that I would be okay with adding to the pair of Era 300s to fill in that bass.

So what do you think? Are a pair of Era 300s + sub mini comparable to a pair of Fives at low (\~25-30) volume? I'm not an audiophile by any means so if the difference is small, I doubt I would notice.

Many reviews fail to fully understand that. \n\nYou can use them as a music stereo pair, permanent output for AppleTV, and use AppleTV eARC to have them be permanent output for other TV peripherals such as Xbox. \n\nIf your max budget is $600 and you use AppleTV, that’s a compelling proposition. With Sonos you need a Beam, $500 by itself, to use ERA 300 for home theater. And then they are locked out from being mains for music. You’d need to buy a second pair to use them both ways. \n\nI’m fortunate that I can afford to use Sonos for home theater. But basically Sonos starts well above where the HomePods are budget-wise if you want both a music and a HT setup.', 'Odd_Charge219: Unless AirPlay2 support was dropped from the era line, you can set them as the audio output for an Apple TV and it will compensate for the network latency.

In fact the CEO stated that Era 300s are used in studios to preview Atmos enabled tracks. I use them for music listening, I tried the HomePod and the Era 300 in stereo. I returned my HomePods and stick with the Era 300. They are great for Atmos music, especially well recorded Atmos music tracks. I recently also added a sub mini to the stereo pair, and while it is double the price of 2 HomePods, it creates the best music listening experience that truly fills every corner of the room. \n\nI mainly listen to ambient music, classical music and classic rock. I’m loving my setup with no complaints', 'uglybudder: You won’t as of right now unless you are airplaying through the appletv connected to a atmos sound bar', 'MrZeDark: heh', 'MrZeDark: I’m happy, you should love them.

Finishing our basement and will have an 85 inch tv in the living room for kids to play videos games and for family movies. I have the option to run wires for a traditional speaker set up but I’m favoring a Sonos surround set up for ease of use for the kids and to reduce clutter.

I pulled 8 hdmi cables from the tv location (4 to my rack, 4 to the media stand). So much cat-6. At least two pairs to every light switch, speaker, with maybe 8 going from my tv to my rack, same again from my rack to my media cabinet. Subwoofer cabling? Of course! The longest piece of optical you’ve ever seen? You bet. Good old fashion RG6? At least 4. So.much.cable. \n\nBut I felt good.

There is ARC and all that, but it doesn’t always work the way you want it to. Electronics are only awesome when everyone knows how to use them. \n\nA Sonos system would eliminate any conflict of operation. It never has to turn on or off or switch inputs. It always works…with the tv remote. \n\nI would spend the couple hundred or whatever it will cost to run all the wires.

I went to bestbuy with a magnolia home theater section and listened to surround systems with dedicated overhear atmos and I agree the sound is superior to the sonos set up. I posted on AVS and several suggested I go ahead and put in 4 atmos speakers and in wall surrounds and fronts for for a 5.4.1 system. This will cost about $2000 + the cost of a 9.2 channel receiver. Seems like a reasonable plan but then I started looking into tv stands that work well with an AV receiver , I don’t want to sit the AV receiver on top of the stand because the toddler and little kids will play with the buttons. Placing a receiver inside a cabinet behind a closed door is a must but then I need a specialty table that is deep enough and has enough ventilation to not overheat. These range in price from 2-3.5k. The total cost and complexity will far exceed a Sonos set up. The more i look into it the more I realize a dedicated home theater set up is going to pose a lot of challenges for what this room is , a second family room used by many people and a kids playroom. As much as I would love to have a dedicated home theater with 4 atmos channels overhead, I just can’t see it not being a headache at this stage in my life. I appreciate everyone’s input thus far. I think the most reasonable approach is to run speaker wire and leave it concealed behind the walls and get a Sonos surround system for now.

With receivers,  you plug in everything to the receivers multiple HDMI ports and only have one HDMI going to the TV.  With HDMI, you get CEC signaling which always you to use one remote for turning off and on and adjusting volume.  The thing to think about is, the Sonos ARC is only 3-4ft long and you are relying on small woofers to hopefully bounce off the walls to get left right separation.  With home theater, my left and right speakers are 6-7 ft apart with of course the center channel in the middle, so you get way better separation.  Don’t get me wrong, the Sonos sounds great, just not home theater great and you can get a decent home theater set up for close to the same price as all the Sonos stuff you would get.', 'National-Elk5102: Oh, a Sonos Port.

My dad is a bit of an audiophile, musician, and just overall music lover.  I'm trying to steer clear of a full AVR setup with different zones, etc as its just a bit too much for my 75 year old parents to handle.  The builder is trying to sell them on this whole-house audio setup, with a 7.1 home-theater setup, but I think that is just too much going on for them.  

They basically only listen to music in the living room/kitchen, backyard, and maybe front patio.  My idea was to just get a 5.1 Sonos arc + sub + one rears for the living room, and then two Era 100's as a stereo pair mounted up under the patio. Then they can add another era 100 to whatever other room they might want, or a roam or move

I settled on Sonos because I've heard good things about the user experience and just overall reliability.  I am their tech support, so I want something that will cause them the least amount of issues, and in turn, I get less calls about it not working lol.  Ease of use is the most important factor, sound quality second, and price is the least of the three concerns.

Is there a better system out there, with the priorities listed above in mind?  I know there are tons of sound bar options out there, I definitely want something that is going to sound amazing for them.  But I also want them to easily be able to use it, be able to easily play audio in the right room, and have it be relatively issue-free.  Really appreciate any advice here."	38	"['diogeneticism: As an old guy who’s been into high end audio gear for over half a century and just experienced Sonos gear in the past 10 months, i say go for the Sonos gear, especially in the living room.

I gather there are lots of “radio” options, too, but i’ve not explored those.\n\nI have a lot of technical experience with electronics and computers, but i really like just doing stuff, not figuring out how to do stuff. So i love both Sonos and Apple gear.', 'modelcitizen_zero: I think HomePods are still too flaky to recommend. The ATV experience is good but has to be re-connected in settings. Stand alone music playing is good IF they have Apple Music account and really is only quickly accessaible using Siri (and she is terrible)', 'Confident_Ad4212: The Arc does a solid job. Yes you could use the 5’s as rear surrounds. \nI just happen to prefer the Arc + Sub + Era’s for surrounds. Then I have a 2nd setup within the living room which consists of 2 Fives + Sub. I’m just super picky when it comes to music.', 'Originalarchive: No worries. \n\nI guess the beauty of Sonos is you can get music in via lots of routes. Personally I find airplay subjectively the worst. Great for friends / guests in the garden but for day to day use it wouldn’t be my preferred option:\n- lower volume \n- lower quality than direct service streaming\n- eats battery on the sending device\n\nMy in-laws use airplay to a Bose system from their iPad and cope. But only because Apple Music isn’t an available service. \n\nNow my folks are talking about adding a second and third HomePod to extend their music. Three minis are only a little more than the price of a single era100. Food for thought if the home is small and music is of secondary importance. \n\nI don’t really want to put you off Sonos - I do love it over all. It’s just that (hardware) control issue does frustrate. You will hear many on the interwebs bemoaning the Sonos app. \n\nYMMV :)', 'icey-yoe: To answer your question about Sonance over other brands when using the Sonos amp… (sorry I forgot in my comment) Sonance allows you to utilize Sonos trueplaytuning, which can make a significant difference in sound quality. It’s overall just easy to use. \n\nSide note..if you consider Sonance: If the drywall isn’t attached to the ceiling yet, maybe give wiring a shot to if you’re up for it. After just one YouTube video, they’re pretty easy to run, just zig zag the wires across the joists. Installers could do the rest once the dry walls up, and get the speakers perfectly aligned so they look pretty. This would save about 50% of the install cost.', 'icey-yoe: The Sonance connect to the Sonos ecosystem very well with the Sonos amp. As far as other speakers, I’m unsure. \n\nTypically, this set up on a budget would be one amp for the 4 speakers(kitchen/porch), and one amp for the two living room speakers which can act as surround sound. If you wanted 3 zones, then I believe you would need 3 amps. \n\nI agree that Sonos speakers sound better at ear level, especially with the new spacial audio technology. Having speakers outside of the wall would be the easiest option. \n\nThat being said, if they prefer the in wall route, definitely consider the Sonance. They sound surprisingly good for being above you. Also consider the amount of insulation their home has. If the interior walls aren’t insulated well, then you may get some annoying sounds bouncing around under you if you’re trying to sleep upstairs.', 'diogeneticism: Definitely at least one ethernet connection in every room, and don’t skimp on electrical outlets. We moved into a new house recently, and the shortage of outlets is continually frustrating, requiring annoying & uncool outlet strips.', 'icey-yoe: Sorry for chiming in again.. \n\nRegardless if you go with traditional speakers or not, running ethernet is always a good idea! \n\nAlso.. Low voltage 06 license is all that’s required to run speaker wire through ceilings. The amp however, has to be outside of the wall/ceilings. The 10 zone, 20 speakers would be absolutely overkill lol', 'mhatrick: Thanks for your input here. It sounds like Sonos would be a great option for them', 'mhatrick: But, with voice-control, you should be able to say ""hey sonos, lower volume on the patio to 50%"" or somethign to that effect right? or is that hit or miss?', 'mhatrick: OK, so you could splice in two pairs of speakers into one sonos amp? that is actually a huge deal if true, since my dad was grumbling about having to buy (3) $500 dollar amps for every set of speakers they would pre-wire.', ""mhatrick: Yes, i've told them about adding an outlet to the top corner the left and right side of the patio, so you can plug the sonos right in without running cable. Also, add an outlet where the rear surrounds will be"", 'Originalarchive: Yep, that works. I think it’s my folks that don’t! It even works asking a speaker with mic to change volume/music on a speaker that doesn’t have a microphone.\n\nI find getting Hey Sonos to play the correct album I want is a bit average. The max volume / 100% command fails because it then asks if you really want it that loud. Even if you have a volume limiter set on the speaker. \n\nPause / stop / play is solid. \n\nRandom play x artist is the best use of this assistant. \n\nI actually think Sonos have done a pretty good job with the voice assistant. Some nice natural langue stuff.', 'icey-yoe: Correct. On Sonos’s website they recommend fitting 2 wires for each speaker through the terminals. However, what we normally do is run a 4 gauge wire from the terminal, and run a 2 gauge for each speaker.', 'mhatrick: OK cool, I\'m hoping i can get the hey sonos stuff to work, or use the Alexa or google assistant.  I know you can have some Siri integration as well, if you add the speakers to the home app.  I wonder if Siri could handle volume control and media controls as well.  That would be ideal, as they already are semi-comfortable with ""hey Siri"" commands', 'Originalarchive: Google assistant has been removed from the latest generation. \n\nAlexa is ok but not a patch on Hey Sonos. Unless you need to control lights and other smart home stuff. Then you need Alexa. \n\nI use Lyd app from Apple Watch. Fantastic. \n\nSoro app can add custom Siri commands. But really that means learning a bunch of new statements. I’m not a fan. \n\nHey Sonos is your best bet but honestly the Siri integration and melding with Apple products is not ideal. I’m only really happy because I have every room in the house and garden covered and I wouldn’t want that many HomePods (sound quality and network not as robust as Sonos). \n\nJust to add to the fun - you will also read about lots of people having issues with Sonos playback. 99/100 it’s the home network not being robust. Fix that and Sonos is pretty fantastic. Bad home network and Sonos will be a nightmare. I didn’t feel I could cope with that kind of support at my folks home!!! Though I find Sonos’ tech support team to be amazingly helpful. \n\nCheers!']"

My first issue is that when I add the Connect to the TV room it creates a separate TV Room 2.  I'd like to just add it to the existing room but it doesn't seem possible.  

When music is playing via turntable to connect to tv room setup, the EQ with the Connect doesn't do anything for the sound.  It is only when I go to the speakers playing the music, tv room, I can change EQ settings.  Id like to just have something set for the turntable as it needs a little more bass and don't want to have to change EQ settings when switching back to TV.  Basically TV Room 2 EQ doesn't work at all.  

Can I just add the connect to the TV Room?  

Can I have a separate EQ setting just for the connect?

We also have a Move that we use in other rooms wherever we are. The Connect has a CD player and our turntable fed to it through a switcher. We go from the Connect to our receiver. Why, if that causes a 2 second delay? Because it permits the Connect and Move to not be out of sync which sounds incredibly annoying in the apartment.

What I want to know is whether there is any way to send the audio from what's being watched on the TV (which itself is fed through the receiver as well) to the Move. Theoretically, this would require the receiver which is producing the TV audio to then be sent out in a sort of loop out to the Connect. That probably isn't gonna work.

If you're in the same place in life and your budget permits, you may want to consider the larger sub and simply turning down the bass. \n\nWe had actually downgraded from 2x Era 300 speakers and went with Era 100s as rears.

I have just built a little surround setup in my living room (as well as some One SLs sprinkled throughout the house). 

My current surround setup is Arc, Sub, two Sonos architectural speakers in the ceiling hooked up to an Amp. 

I’ve recently plugged my record player into the Amp and realized I need to unpair the ceiling surrounds to get it working (wish I could automatically do this somehow, seems like a silly goose may have designed this setup). 

I can live with that annoyance but the next step drives me a little crazy. I add the surrounds back and need to retune the room even though the surrounds obviously haven’t moved. 

Is there a better way to do this? Can virtual rooms be setup that I easily switch between and it remembers the settings? Or how can I avoid the ridicule from my wife for spending so much on a sound system and looking like a dork tuning each time I play a record?

Thank you thank you!"	3	['GuitarSuperstar: You have to redo Trueplay tuning every time you remove the Amp as surrounds. Or get another Sonos device with line-in like a Port or Era 100.', 'paleposeidon: Oh nooo that is bad news. Appreciate your answer! I’ll look into both.']

How are they supposed to know that you want 4 clicks in the kitchen for every 1 click in the living room? And then how are they supposed to assume that for every person that owns a Sonos speaker? Maybe I personally want 2 clicks in the kitchen for every 1 on the living room? The group volume slider only functions as an extension of the individual sliders. The individual sliders are digital representations of the physical volume controls on the individual devices. To have the physical buttons adopt the group slider function would require way more information than the single button press can provide. That\'s why the group slider is in the app that has all of that information being fed to it. Even still if you move large enough amounts in the group slider it\'s not even perfect at scaling everything together because of room acoustics and personal preferences.

Something tells me it would not be as simple as an intern crapping it out in an afternoon. That something is all of my ""melodramatic"" responses about how every room\'s acoustics are different, everyone\'s preferences are different, none of the speakers move the same amount on the slider to get the same change in volume, none of the speakers have the same minimum or maximum output, the currently existing group slider isn\'t even perfect at doing what you want, and no amount of smart tech is gonna be able to juggle all of that at the same time and make every customer happy. Sure they can put the ""change group volume"" option on a speaker\'s settings page. That doesn\'t change any of the other stuff you\'ll have to already do in the app to get it right where you want it every time before that feature is actually doing what you want it to do. So now the solution is ""just make preset groups and then make a preset volume for the preset groups"" and it has already become more complicated than some dude just adding it in their spare time. Could it be done? Yeah, probably. Is it simple? Probably not as simple as you\'d think. Does it make the speakers or experience better? Questionable at best.

They have the function in the app. I like it and I use it often. but you’re over thinking it. I don’t work at Sonos and I’m not a coder, but I do have an engineering degree and work in tech. They can very easily have input on the physical slider control other speakers because they already have the code that makes all the speakers go up or down. \n\nSonos tech is very impressive and I promise you they could do this if they want to but choose not to. It would be nice in my very specific situation, and the OP clearly thinks so too. In fact, I almost guarantee that the code for this feature exists, was tested, but they decided against implementing it. Compared to their other software this would be really really simple. \n\nI know they can do it, and in my specific situation, I would like it. If the product manager wanted to do it and the research said it would be a good move, they would do it. That’s all I’m saying.', 'JTOremus: It had better be your last comment because you\'re literally bringing nothing to the table. ""I want it"" and ""I know they can do it"" don\'t help your argument. Even if it was as simple as just taking the one app feature and letting you assign it to a button there are multiple other pieces of the app that would need to be amended to make it work the way you want that you\'re just entirely ignoring.']"

The sound isn't comparable (wired being better)."", 'Maleficent_Move_2617: I’ve been using and buying Sonos products since they first came out, but for years I had a wired HT system for my family room while the rest of the house was Sonos.  It was a pretty decent set up: Paradigm speakers made it a 5.1 system and I used an Anthem AV receiver.    Wires ran through my basement and I drilled holes through the floor to get them into the family room  AND THEN I did my best to hide the speaker wires in that room - PITA but looked ok for an HT setup.   The Anthem took up a bunch of space and I had problems with it every couple years and needed to get it fixed.   The fronts also took up a lot of real estate.  \n\nI swapped it all out for Sonos: arc, sub and ones for the rears.   A lot of people say wired sounds a lot better, but to be honest it really depends on the room and your options for speaker placement.  My family room is a rectangle with the TV on one long wall and a couch against the opposite long wall.   Because of the space, I don’t have the option to set up rears behind me and cutting into an 80 year old plaster ceiling for height speakers was not a practical option.  So in my case, I can’t say my wired system sounded better than the Sonos for TV/movies.   However, with the Sonos HT I freed up a ton of space and got rid of a lot of eyesores.  And, knock on wood, I’ve had less headaches with it.   Even wired receivers can have problems.  \n\nThe wired system did sound better for music, but that was only when I sat right in the middle of the couch and pulled the fronts away from the TV wall.  You get much better separation (for obvious reasons) when your fronts are spaced out.   That said, I rarely listened to music critically in that room.  Most of the time when music plays in this room it is when guests are over or I’m moving around the house doing things.  In these cases, separation and whatnot doesn’t really matter since it’s background music and you are generally not optimally positioned for listening.   \n\nBut now with the Sonos HT system, when guests are over I can more easily fold in the family room into the other Sonos zones when playing music.  \n\nI’m also looking at the era 300s for rears.  If I do pull the trigger, I will just use the Ones in different rooms.   This is in contrast to my old wired rear surrounds.   They were only useful for HT.  So when I switched to Sonos HT I had no use for them.  That is a really nice feature about Sonos - it is very simple to add onto and to move their speakers around the house - just unplug and plug back in a different room without having to worry about an integrated receiver and speaker wires.  \n\nMy two cents: if you  have the want, the budget, and are able to design a HT room, go wired.  Otherwise, go Sonos.  \n\nI have slowly added onto my Sonos system over the past 10-15 years and currently I am running Sonos through most of my house, on the deck, and in my garage.  I use it almost every day.  The only thing that’s not Sonos is my office, where I have a pretty decent near-field system set up at my desk.

I need to do more tests (it’s a pain to switch between one speaker and a pair), but so far :

- I feel like there’s great Improvement when playing stereo music, especially for sound separation. I’ll listen again to just one, but maybe for quality too? Not sure though. 

- The jump quality seems less apparent in Atmos. One 300 is already so great in Atmos, if there’s an improvement, it’s small (except the fact that you can go louder of course).

It's just that the improvement isn't as impressive as going from 1 One to 2, or going from stereo to atmos on a single 300. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The improvement in stereo when you pair the 300 seems actually a bit more substantial. When I compare to a single Five, the Five still have more clarity, but not outrageously so. And the Era 300 have a much better soundstage. In stereo, some will prefer the Five, some will prefer the pair of 300 (a single 300 was just no match).

Is this a correct assumption?	2	"['GuitarSuperstar: Yes, you will probably get more out of the 100s using them as a stereo pair for music rather than using them as surrounds.', ""Small_Assistance5944: The Era 100s should do a better job projecting sound to fill a room like what you probably need in the gym. I use a pair of Play:1s as surrounds with my Beam Gen 1 soundbar and they sound great.\n\nDedicated surround sound speakers only get used for specific sounds that creators, producers, or providers, assign to them and sometimes don't get used at all. For most non-atmos 5.1 surround sound, high quality speakers' sound processing capabilities don't get fully utilized and it's really not necessary or helpful to use the best speakers for this purpose.\n\nMost listening tests and reviews say the Era 100's quality improvement is most noticeable when used as a single speaker, but the improved projection design should still help fill the room better when used as a stereo pair.

TLDR: What is the cheapest/oldest Sonny’s speaker I can find to pair as surrounds with my Beam Gen 1.

I’m looking for the most budget friendly - cheapest 😂- way to add surround speakers to my Beam Gen1. I went to buy what was advertised as a Gen2 on FB marketplace but was able to talk them down to $175 when I saw it was a Gen1 so I figured at that price, it’s a great deal!

This is my third Beam, but I always seem to lose them in the break-ups 😂 😂 and I’d really like to level-up my setup with surround speakers. The Beam is in a small, rectangular room that is roughly 10’ x 12’ with a 48” LG OLED A2 TV. It sounds great, but I thought I’d look on EBay for some old Sonos 1 or Play:1. 

Can anyone help me sort out which would be the cheapest route to go for 2 surround Sonos speakers to pair with my Beam?

**What is the best, cleanest way to wall-mount the Era 100s???**

I purchased a [pair of the Sonos mounts](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sonos-era-100-wall-mount-pair), but I still haven't seen any photos of these mounts actually installed, and other than having the power cable go through the opening in the back/bottom of the mount, it is unclear to me where the cable is supposed to go from there.

I definitely do NOT want to have a looped together / zip-tied power cable visible if that is at all possible to avoid!

Thank you!!"	1	"[""DaddyFennix: in the past when I wall mounted Sonos play:1s, I poked a hole in the wall right behind where I wall mounted them, and ran the power cable in thru the wall and down to a light switch and hard-wired them to power in the closest junction box. So generally if you put them above where a light switch or receptacle is, you'll have easy power to work with. I think I used the original power cord, but just tripped the (male) pronged end to work with the bare wires.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course this isn't the way to do it by code, so only do it the way I mentioned if you know what you are doing or have an electrician that you are cool with. I believe the rule that it breaks is that you aren't supposed to run extension cords or power cords through a wall. Ideally you get a SHORT power cord and install a single receptacle in the wall behind your speaker, but of course that is a lot more difficult. Also you could do a similar setup, but go to a switch in a junction box in the ceiling (instead) of a receptacle) that way you can hardwire the switch (to the speaker) and have proper cabling in side the wall TO the switch junction box. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few way to do it, depends where you are flexible.""]"

I used to have a One to listen to music and radio in the background. No complains. But now have moved it to another room on a surround setup. Now the space in my office is empty and was thinking on getting a new speaker to replace it. I am between a Roam a One and a 100. I have even considered the IKEA symfonisk which will blend nicely with the books. Size-wise I think the roam will do just fine. The 100 is in the mix because I was thinking on running a cable and plug it directly to my laptop’s dock. The One well… works as well. 
What would you guys think? What do you recommend me?"	1	['Han-Yolo44: Hm, there’s no clear answer. Each of those options have pros and cons. It depends on your use cases. \n\nRoam, is the weakest sound wise, but you can take it to go. It will sound lacking in bass compared to your one. If having the ability to take it to go is a priority, pick a roam or move. The move is a nice balance between the roam and one.\n\nEra 100s. Stereo and line in and newest. I’d pick this over a one. It’s slightly better sound wise and offers line in if that matters to you. Not portable tho if that matters to you. \n\nSymfonisk bookshelf. Great value. You can find a pair used for pretty cheap (for the price of a single 100) and they sound pretty good with trueplay. Not as good sonically as the 100s or Ones overall. No line in and not portable.  Almost always I think a stereo pair is better than a single speaker.  The bookshelf has a ported woofer so the bass profile is different. \n\nI wouldn’t pick a one since a 100 gives you better sound and gives you more options. \n\nOther option is a Ray or Beam since they can act as PC speakers through optical or HDMI. You don’t get lag like you do with the 100s, 300s or fives through line in. \n\nFinally, if you are mostly plugged into a computer in that space, consider some non Sonos bookshelf speakers. I love Sonos, but there are other options that may make more sense for you plugged into a pc or Mac all the time.']

but when I review the frequency response from rtings and compare the beam gen 2 alone vs ( beam gen 2+ sub mini +one sl), I can’t find no difference in the frequency range but the sub ( 60 hz and below) , mids and highs exactly the same.

can anyone explain the benefit of adding sub ( and rear (other than lower sub response and more immerse surrounding)?

When hearing music or tv audio you have at the same time both high and low frequencies.

But, at end of the day, the point is that virtually everyone who has compared the two configurations agree on the fact that sub makes the whole experience significantly better.', 'd0nd: It’s not about frequency capacity per say but what power is available to the drivers.

I’ve moved my TV and sound system recently. Since moving, my beam won’t connect to my TV. It previously worked without problem. Any suggestions on how to fix this?

What Happens when Trying to Connecting
1. Sonos Beam is connected to my app, plugged into power and connected to my TV’s Arc HDMI port
2. TV says Audio System Active
3. In TV settings, switch audio output to Audio System
4. Video continues playing but no audio comes through. About 10 seconds later it reverts back to TV audio


Steps Taken to Rectify:
1. 📱In the app, tried to carry out TV Setup under settings. After following the steps to test, it says “Audio System not connected.”
2. ♾️ reset the Beam as a new device. Still the same problem with no connection,
3. 🔌 used a different HDMI cable. Still the same problem with no connection, 
4. ⚡️ connected an Ethernet cable from Modem to Beam and tried connecting the Beam then. Still the same problem with no connection.

When I look at one SL vs era 100s  vs Symfonisk Frame (esp considering Symfonisk lamp is at 250 and bookshelves are at 125) wondering if the frame is a bit of a bargain. Anyone’s compared the frame to one SL ? 

Use cases
1. Stand alone speaker in an office / bedroom. Frame vs era 100 ?
2. Stereo Pair in a bedroom: 2 frames vs 2 era 100s? 
3. Using this is a secondary / extra room tv set up where you wouldn’t want to add a sub - but use ray / beam with 2 surrounds : Frame vs Era 100s ? 

Wondering which uses the eras win vs the frame. If there’s a solid reason for going for era 100s for the extra cost. (The Bluetooth might be a deal changer for stand alone speaker ? ) 

Not sure if anyone else is thinking of going down this route.

I live in a small two bedroom apartment in NYC. In my living room, I have a Beam Gen 2 and Sub gen 3. Additionally, I have a one in one of the bedrooms.

My ultimate goal is to have a speaker in each bedroom and then have the beam/Sub/surrounds for my living room setup. 

I want to use the aforementioned living room setup not only for movies/TV but also for music.

I’ve done a lot of research but I can’t decide what surround pair makes the most sense for me.

Lets get the first thing out of the way, I am not upgrading to the arc at this point. 

I am leaning towards the 300’s since they support Dolby Atmos which seems to be the driving point along with the spatial audio component. My plan is to have to airplay music through soundbar and it play with both the sub and surrounds.

1. If something (music/movie/tv) isn’t capable of Dolby, there probably won’t be much of a difference between the ones/100’s/300’s?

1. Can I still use voice control (Alexa) if I have them as surround sounds?

2. Am I getting the full potential out of these speakers even though I have the beam? Yes, the Arc would be better of course but my question is, there isn’t a technology limitation with using 300’s as surrounds with the beam. For example, only 4 of the 8 drivers are functioning or something if I use it with the beam or something like this.

3. is it going to be an issue that my surrounds might be parallel/ only slightly behind me? My living space is small so I unfortunately can’t put the surround too far behind me. Basically my couch is against the wall and then rear speaker would be either wall mounted or on a side table all the way to the back.

Thank you for your help!"	10	"['Fit-Implement9480: What I have learned is era 300s have a wider soundstage but less fidelity, lots of bugs and poor quality control.  Save the cash and go the 100s', ""herrmo1: If I remember correctly then you can't Airplay Atmos content to Sonos speakers. You would have to use Sonos/Apple Music Apps to start the streams on the speakers. Maybe an Apple user can confirm this."", ""Comfortable_Ad3005: 1. Era 300s are across the board improvements over the One SLs in my experience, so probably the 100s as well, but they're going to shine more with dolby Atmos. But for a Beam setup with placement off to the sides, the 100s might make more sense. You can always repurpose them later to other rooms if you choose to get the 300s later. \n\n\n2. Voice control still seems to be possible, but really you'll just be using the Beam for that anyway. When pairing speakers as surrounds, you can't use them only for music playback without unpairing them first. You can choose ambient vs full playback for the surrounds, but they'll always play together with the Beam.\n\n\n3. Era 300s will use 3/4 tweeters with either the Beam or Arc. The center one doesn't seem to ever play anything. People have opinions on this, but I don't find it negatively impacts performance as surrounds at all. I've heard others report the Sonos Fives also disable a tweeter when used as surrounds or stereo paired, so this may be a pretty standard thing with Sonos if you choose to use their more premium speakers outside of single units.  I honestly don't know about the 2 bass drivers on the 300s and whether or not they are being used all of the time. I haven't seen anyone talk about whether or not the 100s are using both tweeters or one.\n\n\n\n4. For the 300s, wall mounting them behind you would probably be the best bet. With trueplay, I'm sure they'll sound good off to the sides, as well, but not ideal. It does seem like the 100s might be a better fit for your space.

I have a TV with HDMI ARC or optical out. Right now I am using a simple (medion) soundbar. 
I have several problems/issues/thoughts: 

* The room is a bit bigger. TV is on one wall, sofa on the opposite wall.  
* I dislike loud sounds/having the TV on a loud setting. Also not a fan of a lot of bass. 
* Due to these two reasons we have often trouble understanding the dialogue 
* I assume using rear speakers would improve the understanding while maintaining a cleaner and quieter sound environment
* The rear speakers could be placed near the sofa at the back. But we are not always sitting there. 

Is the Ray with two Roams a suitable solution? I hear that they are not capable of stereo, but stereo is actually bad for the dialogue in my setup, right? 
Or should it be two Era 100s? 

Sound delay is no problem because of possible settings in the sonos app, right? 

Any recommendations? Am I missing something? 
Thanks!"	3	['toodeephoney: You need a soundbar for the TV, so a pair of Era 100s is not an option.\n\nAlso, the Roams can’t be used as surrounds, so that’s also not an option for you.\n\nSo, tldr is neither, but props to your for doing your research beforehand.', 'Mirthgiver: See if you can get hold of two IKEA symfonisks or a pair of Sonos Ones.

Currently using Arc/Sub (Gen1)/2x Play 3 surrounds in my home theatre.

But they're not necessarily  going to stand out as the new centerpiece of your home theater, so take that into account. No surround speaker needs 6 drivers either and Sonos has disabled the center tweeter when they are paired as surrounds. You may not get the same focused directionality as the play 3s as a result if you have those pointed directly at you, but the Era still projects sound all around you and behind you in 5.1/7.1 content. I think the soundstage is better, more detailed, and you won't constantly be reminded you have rear speakers beaming at you.\n\nIf you're budget conscious, $850 speakers are overkill as surrounds, hence the center tweeter not even being used, but if you're looking for the best surround speakers they offer today, I think the 300s are clear winners."", 'creativemercenary: Thanks for this.

New to the Sonos squad :)

I recently bought a second hand Sonos Beam. Overall sound quality has been a phenomenal improvement over what I had previously (particularly for dialogue quality).

When I did a bass frequency test on Youtube, I found an issue between 55-70 hz where the right subwoofer will produce a ""rattling"" sound which was driving me nuts, particularly during scenes like when a rocket takes off, or a low note is played in the soundtrack. I checked my desk and made sure it was not coming from a loose item or a cable hitting the wall.

Currently contemplating buying a Sub Mini, if it can fix my issue since I was told it will take over the hard work of producing bass from the Beam.

PanicLogically	0	12g52ld	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12g52ld/limitations_of_comparing_speakers_on_a_sonos/	"**I went to Best Buy and finally got to see and listen to the 300s. I found the size to be fine, shape as ok--I've never had aesthetic issues with the speaker, understand the innards.**

**So listening in Best Buy was an comparison of how things sound in Best Buy. I could only listen to the speakers as stand alone units. Zero capacity to hear them in a sound bar with the ARC or Beam Gen 2.**   

**For sure, for music--better than the 100s, the 1. I definitely liked the 5s BUT the 300s did have a wider sound stage which was appealing. The 5s had a lusher fuller sound. The 300s had the wider sound stage but were brighter. I wanted a bit more bass on the 300s, bit more low mid.  Bass output was better on the 5s with whatever the display control had these set up with. The demo did not have rock and roll or classical music to listen to. If I was in the market for a single unit speaker, I would have likely chosen the 300s though for that wider stage with music and the capacity with the app, to just up the bass a bit.** 

**I am a dual purpose Sonos user and want to have these with my ARC.  It had me interested in the 300s as rears--but for the price and knowing the Symfonisk line of speakers, I'm not there yet--- Ideally , for this money, I'd want to hear them (the ERA 300s) in a pair in a sound room with an ARC, with the flexibility to turn the Sub on and off. I would then compare them to the 5s. I will wait these out a bit , for Sonos to hopefully retune them a bit and figure out that center speaker they've toggled off.**"	1	['Mirthgiver: I think that’s the only way to know for sure.

Mlrakanishu	1	12g446y	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12g446y/sonos_beam_upgrade_path/	"I purchased a Sonos Beam (Gen 1?) around 2020 and absolutely love it. We always hypothesized getting a couple Ones and a Sub but held off due to costs and lack of power points / places to put the Ones. 

We’re now getting to the point where we could add to the setup, and since then seems options have changed quite a bit. What would you all recommend as a next step? 

I’m open to replacing the Beam if it stands to improve things the most. We have quite high ceilings, around 320-330 cm, and the room is fairly spacious as it’s an open kitchen and living area. Not sure how that weighs into things with Atmos.

Edit: 

Thanks everybody who responded already. It seems the leading recommendation is just to upgrade the Beam to an Arc, not purchase Ones + Sub. Kind of exciting - although I was expecting the Beam to last us a bit longer."	15	['GuitarSuperstar: Is your ceiling flat? How far are you seated from the Beam?

I can get a picture if it’s required. We’re seated usually about 260 cm from the Beam. TV is a Samsung S95B 65”.', 'Mlrakanishu: Sounds like everybody is in favor of the Arc over anything else. Wasn’t expecting that! I’ll perhaps move towards buying later this year, as it’s $1500 AUD + a new bracket and install. Pricier than the original plans for 2xOnes would have been.', 'GuitarSuperstar: Your ceiling height is a little high but not horrible. And you are seated at an ideal distance from the sound bar. I would upgrade the Beam to an Arc. Then add a Sub and surrounds later. The best option for surrounds would be the Era 300s, but Fives or Era 100s would also work great.', 'Conscious-Bonus-8076: it just seems the obvious upgrade path, going from beam to beam gen 2 isnt going to be as big of a difference. but you can always start somewhere else. \n\nyou can add the ikea speakers as surrounds (get 2 for the price of a single One) & maybe add the sub mini. Later down the line upgrade to the Arc & then further down if you want to add era 300’s you can & then move the ikeas wherever else.\n\nyoure not going to benefit much from having Ones vs the Ikea symfonisks for surround purposes. I have the ikeas with my arc & sub gen 3 & dont find anything lacking. Maybe ill eventually get the era 300’s but im plenty happy with the $200 investment that they have been.', 'Mlrakanishu: So the most meaningful upgrade is actually the Arc? Not going for Subs and Era 100/300s? \n\nOur Beam is mounted. Wonder if the mount is an easy swap or if we have to change that up in the process.', 'Mlrakanishu: My original ask wasn’t to upgrade the Beam, but where to go with my Beam as a starting point. I mentioned I was open to replacing the Beam if that was the answer.', 'GuitarSuperstar: You would need to use a different mount for the Arc.\n\nI think the Arc would be more a meaningful upgrade because it supports Dolby Atmos and has a much wider and taller soundstage than the Beam (Gen 1). The Beam is also limited to standard Dolby Digital audio.\n\nBut if Dolby Atmos isn’t important to you, then keep the Beam and add a Sub and a pair of Era 100s as surrounds.', 'damgood32: I think since you have a Gen 1 beam you cannot add ERA 300s. That limits your options a little. The Beam is great but it does seem like the Arc would be a better upgrade for you and that still gives you the option of Eras 100/300 and Sub down the line.', 'Conscious-Bonus-8076: i get you, then for your use case like i said id recommend the ikea speakers as surrounds. take the savings youll have from not getting Ones & put it towards a sub or sub mini whenever you are able to get that. Those things alone will make a drastic difference & improve the sound of your beam as well, since the sub will be taking the low end off your beam giving it more oomph in the mids & highs.\n\nlater down the line, when youre able to, upgrade the arc or just wait maybe another couple to few years for the eventual arc upgrade. sonos usually upgrades its products every 5 years, so arc should see one no sooner than 2025', 'Mlrakanishu: Honestly I’m not sure what I’m missing with Atmos, so hard to say?', 'Mlrakanishu: Was just thinking - would soundbar placement factor into the ceiling height concerns? Ours is around 230-240 cm from the ceiling.', 'GuitarSuperstar: Get the Arc and test it out for a few weeks. Watch a few films and listen to some music in Dolby Atmos. If you don’t like it, you can always return it.', 'GuitarSuperstar: That’s a good ceiling height for the Arc. Try to keep the Arc about 2 feet from the floor and sit around 8-9 feet from the Arc.']

Then around the time the Five (3rd gen) came out I was able to get the second gen 2 new for like $399 at MicroCenter.  Having 2 of them with left and right channels is incredible and highly recommended.\n\nEnjoy your speaker!  They are great.', 'GuitarSuperstar: Yes, the Five is Sonos’ best speaker for listening to music in stereo.

Of course, the more you pay the better they sound - but the drawback is that they are all wired (mostly). For a wireless system, Sonos still offers best sound/price/quality, and has a great app and a very reliable connection. \n\nA few years ago, I still refused to get sucked into the Sonos ecosystem (pretty stupid in hindsight), and bought a Harman/Kardon system which sounded really great. The app was crap, Spotify wasn’t supported despite announcement upon launch. Eventually the app wasn’t further developed, also the connection of the speakers was lost all the time. Only good thing was the line-in which I needed for my record player. In the meantime, Sonos’ new speakers all have line-in as well. So, basically this is what Sonos is up against… no surprise it’s best in class in its category.', 'woolattis: Completely agree with the statement about the 300s.  People want them to be what their marketing touts, but in auditioning them, they just fall short in the surround  configuration (acting as rear speakers).  Sonos has completely neutered the 300s as rears (both during TV and music playback) in this set up.  \n\nThey do sound pretty great as stereo pair, but I would go with the Sonos 5s for music listening.', 'Bacon_00: The word investment is not reserved purely for a financial investment that you are expecting a financial return on.

I decided after so many years to venture into the Sonos ecosystem, and I love it. There will be more Sonos to come, since it’s essentially a long term commitment lol

Right now, I have a 7.1.4 setup in my bedroom. It’s an Arc + sub mini + 2 Era 300s. The sound is fantastic, and I find myself listening to more music without headphones in the last week than in the last 5 years. It’s been a lot of fun. Adding the sub mini was the right thing. There’s plenty of bass, and it’s amazing how adding it really help the other speakers to tighten their sounds. Next to complete this bedroom set up for the near future is the wall mounting for the 300s as well as upgrading to a 65 inch OLED TV.

As for other Sonos, I will do my office next, and that one will be 2 Era 300s + sub. The idea here is that I likely will swap out the sub mini for the office and bring the sub in for my bedroom.

Thanks again for all your input. It really has been a great learning experience, even when I did not adapt the suggestions fully.

Here are my settings, based in part by recommendations from Peter Pee. Let me know if you have any suggestions differently

Bass: -1
Treble: +4

Well it turns out my old Gemini is broken and as I tallied up the things needed to get it operational and I just decided I might as well just get a cheap new turntable. I came across the Sony PS-LX310BT Bluetooth turntable and it had pretty decent reviews. I also liked the low price and its minimalist look. I know it's an entry level turntable and not gonna compare to the higher priced options out there, but the interesting thing about it is it has a built-in pre-amp for line-in as well as bluetooth connectivity.  So I hooked it up to the Sonos Era via both Line-In dongle and Bluetooth.

I know that line-in should be better quality than Bluetooth in theory, but when I A/B them I really can't tell much of a difference. I'm sure that there are many factors contributing to this (including the quality of the cheap turntable and my untrained ear), but I was curious if anyone knew the real differences? I know Sonos supports SBC and AAC codecs via Bluetooth, but how does the Line-In USB-C adapter convert the signal? Is it similar to how Bluetooth compresses the signal or completely different? Also I'm aware my issue is most likely on the turntable side. How does the turnable compress and send the Bluetooth signal and how does the built in pre-amp output the signal?

The obvious advantage of using Bluetooth is that the speaker doesn't have to be physically next to the turntable and I could put the Era 100 anywhere in my place, including potentially using it as a rear speaker (if I get another to make a pair) for surround sound on my home theater (I'm aware that surround kills Bluetooth on the Era and switching rear speakers from surround to stereo is a somewhat annoying process in the Sonos app - forcing you to re-set up surround again every time) but I'd like to know my options.

I've search the internet far and wide for more technical info or comparisons of the line-in vs bluetooth and haven't found much except that the assumption is that line-in should be better in theory. Would love it if someone with more technical info could weigh in here. Thanks!"	4	"['GuitarSuperstar: Other than audio quality, the line-in connection usually gives you more reliable audio playback especially when grouping other speakers with the Era 100.\n\nHave you set the Audio Compression setting to Uncompressed in the Sonos app?', 'stevieG08Liv: hey OP, i know this is not related to your question but since I have the same turntable, how did you connect your turntable to Era100?\n\nDid you do by Usb b to Usb c or Rca to 3.5mm?

But whenever I turn on the turntable it auto-connects via bluetooth to the Sonos era, so if you just want to use line-in I recommend not pairing it via bluetooth otherwise you have to reset the Sonos so that it forgets the Bluetooth connection.']"

bedroom - 2 sonos era 100

Shower - 1 sonos roam

kitchen - 1 sonos move

living room - arc + mini + and eventually 2 era 300 (will get 300 later in june)

Do you recommend i change something up (besides living room... def will get that)? Maybe theres a cheaper yet equivalent/better speaker i can have for that room. I def want at least 1 portable so i can bring with me to the apartment rooftop or lounge etc. I'll be listening to only podcasts and music in all the rooms other than living room (living room will be movies, shows, and games). Bedroom is kinda small and the kitchen and living room is attached without walls. Apartment is 694 sq ft. Thanks!

Edit: after the suggestions from ppl here, I’m realizing a speaker in kitchen is unnecessary. Living room speakers are enough for kitchen. Also it seems roam sucks lol.

I've seen this question been asked several different ways but would like to get input on my situation. I live in an apartment and have bought a single Era 300 to play music only, and I placed it in the corner of my living room so I can hear it into the kitchen and dining area. 

It sounds really good I'm wondering if maybe I should get 2 100's and place them across from each other in this space. This way, I get audio coming across the entire room and truly filling with music.

The spatial audio sounds good but I've been primarily a spotify user and would have to switch to Apple Music after my trial. At this moment it's only for music but maybe in the next 2-3 years I'd get an Arc so not really taking into consideration. I feel that with the 100's I'd have more options in the future. 

Also, if I went the 100's route, should I pair them as a stereo pair even though they are across from each other OR leave them as seperates and just play the music into both?

I have a pair of speakers in my apartment (One + SYMFONISK picture frame partnership with Ikea) and I am almost ready to sell them off for Google or Apple alternatives. 

***The problem:*** Neither me, nor my partner successfully plays anything from Spotify (in Sonos app or Spotify app) for longer than a few minutes before the ""Unable to play song X"" pops up and it abruptly stops. That's if it connects at all. Sometimes the app will just skip to the next song and start it, only to freak out and stop playing that song to skip to the next one. It's a nightmare and is completely random and unpredictable when it will occur. 

&#x200B;

***What I have tried:*** 

\- Complete system reset, updating the app and starting over

\- Unplug and plug back in; got off wifi and back on; ethernet cable from One to router

\- moving speakers around the apartment. Conducted Wifi speed tests (independently) and connection issues (none - in **the Sonos app it rates** **the connection as Excellent** for both speakers to the Wifi**). I have the highest bandwidth available from my provider.**

\- I have moved speakers and router away from any interference metal or otherwise - minimum of 5 feet away from microwaves or other metal in the kitchen.

\- I tried calling the customer service team (**twice)** and both times have waited on the line for 15 minutes to get a dead line on the other end. It sounded like someone picked up but no one said a word. 

Not a single one of these has provided a prolonged solution. I moved the One farther away from the Frame and it seemed to help with connectivity, but then yesterday it went back to the same shit. 

Sorry if this seems bitchy but I am so fed up with this garbage that I paid hundreds of dollars for that is supposedly the top of the line in the market. My partner had better success with her $80 Amazon dot speaker that spied on her. I really want to get the new speakers but not if I will continue to deal with both horrible connection and customer service.

I purchased 2 Era300 and 2 Era100 for a comparison with a Beam 2 gen and Mini Sub on a home theater system.

My impressions:

I played a Dolby vision + Dolby Atmos demo of.the tv:

Seems more detailed the sound coming from the 100's.

And I played later a movie badged ""Dolby Atmos"" on Netflix.

On a scene where there is an helicopter flying from the left side the sound is very similar to the 3O0's.

U don't feel the different effects of the Dolby Atmos.

Even thought SonoS app reports me ""Dolby Atmos"".



I also moved through different places of the room and, still, do not feel the  sound difference from the 2 types of speakers.

So i've created a personal automation on the shortcuts app. The automation is run when the sonos app opens and turn off the wifi, then wait 30 seconds, the turn the wifi back... et voilà, lock screen controls working.

I had to set the 30 seconds wait because otherwise it won't work, probably because ios takes some time to ""forget"" the airplay devices... it may take less time on other phones.

Major drawback is the automation gets run everytime the sonos app is open, even if it's already in background, and i haven't yet found a way to avoid that, but i'm not a a big expert in ios Shortcuts, so any idea or suggestion to avoid this will be welcome"	1	['cea002: Big help, I have always wanted the Lock Screen controls to work but not at the cost of AirPlay on a dozen devices.\nWill try your hack (without the widget) and hopefully that’ll allow it for me.\nCan do the toggle manually. \nAppreciate the post.']

You can keep using your existing speakers in a home theater setup with your TV or in every room of your home. With the great price you got for those Ones, it would make a lot of sense to keep them for possible use with other Sonos speakers.\n\nFor use with your TV, you really need to look at the Ray or Beam soundbars for your TV. With one of the soundbars you would have the option of using the Ones for grouped playback so you can hear your TV and music in both rooms, or use them as a pair of rear speakers with the TV and soundbar for really great surround sound.\n\nEveryone says the cheaper Ray soundbar sounds great but with only an optical line-in connection, it is inherently limited and unable to produce dolby atmos. The Ray is a soundbar that may work great now, but you may wind up wanting to upgrade it sooner and move it to a secondary TV. With an HDMI connection and simulated dolby atmos, the Beam will sound great now and have better prospects for long-term use.\n\nA better use for Era 100 speakers would be for adding speakers to additional rooms. As single speakers they are considered a major improvement over a single Sonos One, but early testers and reviewers say they're similar to the Ones when used as a stereo pair or rear surrounds with a TV and soundbar.   \n\nIf you're looking for more discounts you can check Sonos' refurbished section where prices are usually 20-30% lower than brand new but still come with the same 1-year warranty that is included with new speakers."", ""jmbroady: The only way you'd be able to use your pair of One SLs with your TV is using an Apple TV and manually setting your audio output to your Ones via AirPlay everytime you turn the TV on.

You can also get a legacy soundbar on Ebay or Marketplace such as a Beam Gen 1, PlayBar, or PlayBase and pair your Ones to that as surrounds.  Typically you can find one of the legacy soundbars for $200-$300.

The 100 with up firing drivers instead of stereo tweeters could not be playing Atmos.', 'skywake86: Ugh, I really hate this sub sometimes. Yes, Atmos is not just upward firing drivers. Atmos, along with DTS:X, is a different way of encoding audio that allows you to place channels freely in 3D space rather than some fixed channel position. Which is why there are things like Atmos for headphones. However, given the previous standards allowed at most 7 channels at the same height and Atmos now allows speakers to be anywhere in 3D space including above and bellow you? The height channels are the differentiating feature\n\nThe Era 100 doesn\'t support Atmos. There is no reason for it to support Atmos. When it\'s in use with a sub you have a 5.1 setup so, you can just send it 5.1. If Sonos had instead made an ""up firing One"" there would be height. Which is something that doesn\'t exist outside of Atmos and DTS:X. So therefore such a product would require Atmos\n\nAlso FFS, ""We don\'t know this""? Come on. Don\'t play naïve. This is a standard corporate strategy for product releases. Look at how NVidia releases GPUs for example. You drop your flagship product into the market. People rave about how great the bleeding edge is. Some people spend more than they otherwise would have spent getting it. Then once the hype has died down a bit you release your lower tier and cut-down products. Sonos has done this regularly\n\nIf they had released ""up firing ones"" on day one I can tell you now, less people would be considering the Era 300.

I’m saying the one with up firing driver would only be useful in Atmos setup. It couldn’t do Atmos by itself as you agreed so it would be sold as a surround speaker mostly? It would be tough to put up firing drivers in the form factor of the one/100 and still maintain the control buttons too.  I’m not sure Sonos would make this product at all. Hence I’m not on board with your “we all know why” language.', 'skywake86: You can very definitely have ""Atmos"" with two speakers in any position. While 1.1.0 would be anaemic compared to full Atmos it\'d still be Atmos. And a pair of such speakers would be 2.2.0. I don\'t buy your argument here\n\nSame deal with the form factor/buttons. I don\'t see how there\'s a limitation there. If they can fit L/R tweeters they can fit forward/top. Also looking at photos/teardowns the Era 300 upfiring tweeter only takes up \\~10x4cm on the top. The One form factor is 12x12cm on the top. Could well be done\n\nI will concede on that last bit. Clearly we don\'t all know this strategy, if we did it wouldn\'t work as a strategy. Hell I\'m well aware of it and still fall for it. But still, it\'s most definitely a thing. Again, the Era 300 is a very premium product.

Sonos' suggested setup, as documented here: [**https://en.community.sonos.com/home-theater-229129/sonos-era-300-wall-mount-positioning-6881248**](https://en.community.sonos.com/home-theater-229129/sonos-era-300-wall-mount-positioning-6881248), seems to contradict any recommended layout for Dolby Atmos, which can be found here: [**https://www.dolby.com/siteassets/technologies/dolby-atmos/atmos-installation-guidelines-121318\_r3.1.pdf**](https://www.dolby.com/siteassets/technologies/dolby-atmos/atmos-installation-guidelines-121318_r3.1.pdf).

After purchasing a pair of Era 300s, I decided to run some tests and found that the recommended positioning appears to be less about clever engineering and more about a sacrificing choice made by the designers. It seems that the priority was fitting the speakers behind a couch in a small apartment, which led to the decision to place the rear left and right firing speakers furthest from the listener, as seen here: [**https://imgur.com/KNXFdcY**](https://imgur.com/KNXFdcY). Unfortunately, this makes the speakers incompatible with certain setups, such as this one: [**https://imgur.com/Q0p7CxQ**](https://imgur.com/Q0p7CxQ), as the speakers output to the reverse positions.

To solve this problem and achieve better sound for cinema, the speakers must be turned around, resulting in an aesthetically unappealing setup, as seen here: [**https://imgur.com/zydvtz1**](https://imgur.com/zydvtz1). It's disappointing that the product's quality has been sacrificed due to this decision. A simple solution would be to enable switching the left and right speaker firings via software. In my opinion, the lack of this feature is borderline moronic.

Edit: In a senseful setup, you would have thought Sonos was aiming for something like this: [https://imgur.com/kQWv40y](https://imgur.com/kQWv40y) Unfortunately, it seems that the outer speakers are performing as their rears in dedicated Atmos test tracks, and the outer speakers are performing as rears. Hence, they are reversed for some crazy reason.  


Edit edit: Well, this is more interesting. Someone in another forum had mentioned re-pairing the surrounds. After going through this, I have new results. The surrounds are now working as expected where the outer channels are the left/right and inner channels are rears making it possible to place against the wall. From this, and other posts I've been reading, it sounds like there's a few bugs that can occur upon pairing leading to undesirable results."	23	"['therealhamster: The inside facing drivers are the rear surrounds.

I’ve been super curious what Sonos’ take is on how the Era 300s are supposed to work when in rear surround mode. I spent a long while on the phone to Sonos tech support learning how the should work with various content. Here’s what I learned:\n  \n1) Stereo: the stereo field is split across the soundbar and around to the Era 300s. The Right 300 handles that right side portion of the audio, and vice-versa on the Left. All the drivers in the 300 are supposed to be used with the exception of the center front (as we know).  \n2) 5.1 Content: This was the one I was most curious about after hearing the OP’s experience and the one I was least clear about how it might handle things. The reason being, from what I’ve seen there are two potential ways for 5.1 to be encoded:  \n3F2M/LFE (3F: front R, center, front L, 2M: R/L side surrounds, LFE/Sub) or\n3F2R/LFE (3F: front R, center, front L, 2R: R/L rear surrounds, LFE/Sub) I was thinking that if they chose to route the side or rear surround channel data to the corresponding outer driver (for side) or inner driver (for rear), this would mean that much of the rest of the speaker drivers wouldn’t be used. Sonos confirmed that it does NOT work this way. They said that all drivers (except for the center front) should be playing the surround channel info - whether that’s encoded as side surround or rear surround.  \n3) 7.1 Content: this is relatively straightforward channel routing on the Era 300. The outer drivers work with the Arc (or Beam G2) to play the side surround channel data and the inner drivers play the rear surround data. The height driver joins the inner drivers to play the rear surround data (which when you realize that the Arc’s side firing drivers are also playing the side channels, it makes the most sense to assign the height driver to the rear surround channel otherwise there would be Arc side firing, 300 outer drivers, AND the height driver all playing the side surround which would likely sound unbalanced).  \n4) 7.1 Atmos content: this is probably the easiest since there are clear mappings of each channel to drivers. Outer drivers (side surround channel), inner drivers (rear surround data), height driver (height data).  \n5) 5.1 Atmos content: this one was not explicitly covered but extrapolating from the above, the inner and outer drivers would play the surround data (whether that’s encoded as side or rear surround) and the height driver will handle any height metadata.  \n  \nThe person I spoke with was very specific saying that the speaker should NOT be playing just the outer or inner drivers (with or without height involvement) with 5.1 content.', 'thecodingart: I didn’t have them setup incorrectly, but if you read the post edit.. apparently there’s some known bugs on initial pairing 😢', 'GuitarSuperstar: Are you 100% certain they were assigned correctly in the Sonos app when you added them as surrounds?', 'Bigmanjapan101: Very interesting, glad it’s working as intended now for you.   do you like them?', 'jjDevt: Yes, as when playing 5.1 or 7.1 test files, left and right are clearly identifiable.', 'thecodingart: With the re-pairing, I do.

MioGeo	64	12drvba	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12drvba/underwhelmed_by_300s_as_rears_just_me/	"So, I upgraded my rears from Ones to 300s (with the official Sonos stands) and I gotta say... a week in and I'm underwhelmed. I think as standalone speakers for spatial/Atmos music they're probably amazing (and that's what tech reviewers have focused on), but as rears for movie heads (paired with my Arc and Gen 3 Sub) I haven't experienced a huge difference from my Ones.

Watched quite a few Atmos-heavy 4K-Bluray movies and was a little disappointed that I wasn't getting that over-the-head sound I've been dreaming about. They're definitely louder and bossier (and the side channels are definitely a lot more immersive feeling) but that's where it ends. My room is a perfect square shape, ceilings are about 9-feet high, speakers are positioned about 1.5-feet behind sofa (can't go any further back than that)... Perhaps my ears aren't sophisticated enough or perhaps I've not messed with the settings enough?

Sadly I can't return them (store I bought them from won't give refunds on open boxes) but am thinking of putting them on eBay UK (or DM me if you are in UK and interested in the full set) and going back to my Ones as they looked much less noticeable in my minimal space (the chunky 300s on their slightly taller stands look a little too \*there\* if that makes sense).

Am I alone in this opinion?"	115	"['Obi_Charlie: I can tell a difference listening to Atmos stuff. Overhead effects come through more pronounced.

It doesn't show up in the app at all (when I used to have them set up as a stereo pair it would show as Left+? but now I don't have them as a pair so the missing speaker just won't show at all).


If I try to add the missing speaker back in, the app does not detect it.

When this happens, if I unplug the ""missing"" speaker (unplug from power) from wall, wait a few seconds, then plug it back in, it will then reappear already set up in the app.

I've tried many times completely setting everything up from scratch:

- remove devices from the app
- uninstall & reinstall app
- add speakers back to system
- re-set-up all my voice commands, Spotify, etc

My extensive review of relevant posts in this sub suggests he *might* be right, but i’m very interested in feedback, not least because he didn’t offer a way to transmit the photo.

The photo was shot from the edge of the 77” LG C2 tv. There’s an Arc below the tv, and a Sub3 next to the sofa, on the photo’s right. The only places to put the surrounds would be on stands in the alcove. Aesthetically, the 100s would be preferable, but i’m wondering about which speakers would be sonically preferable.

The room is not large, but it was designed by an interior architect, and the parts not visible in the photo are really cool.

Will used for 40% gaming, 30% movie and 30% music

- Bose Smart Soundbar 600 + Base module 500
- Sonos Beam Gen 2 + Sub Mini

Check with some store pricing wise Bose is cheaper a bit than Sonos. Went to showroom to try both still can’t get a clear decision. Current own a Bose SoundLink Revolve.
For me Bose had better clarity in mid and high while Sonos had better clearer bass produced. Bose had true physical upper firing speaker for Atmos but Sonos don’t have. As far I know from internet review Sonos prompts towards its ecosystem and perform music better. Had gone through a lot YouTube and web review but still can’t point out which setup to go with.

Would like any of you guys to share opinions. Appreciate!"	3	"['GadgetronRatchet: Honestly, this call is going to decide if you\'re going down the path of a Sonos ecosystem vs a Bose ecosystem. You\'re in the Sonos subreddit so I think most people are going to recommend you go with Sonos. \n\nIMO, this decision should be which companies\' product offerings across the board you like more. Most people probably haven\'t heard the Beam & Mini, vs the Soundbar 600 and Bass 500 side by side. You can probably find something on YouTube that compares Beam vs Soundbar 600. I think because of actual upward firing drivers, the 600 will likely have better reviews. So if all you care about is the better soundbar and subwoofer, it\'s probably Bose at that price point. \n\nThe difference is which one can you build out better? Are you ever going to want to add surround speakers? Bose\'s ""surround speakers"" don\'t hold a candle to an Era 100, much less the Era 300. They are also stuck as surround speakers, if you want to upgrade them, they can\'t later be used as a room speaker like an Era 100 or Era 300 could. \n\nSonos has more modularity in their system, which makes all their speakers more ""upgradeable"", you can upgrade a speaker and find a better place to put the old one. This makes Sonos\' speaker have more long term value. So what do you think?', 'UnderstandingAway119: I think you are right, thanks for such useful comment!', 'Mirthgiver: I bought a Bose 700, the surrounds keep dropping out, I’ve tried everything I can to fix it (changing networks, moving the receiver closer, removing interference sources etc). It seems to be the distance (normal room, about 9’ from the soundbar). Bose includes about 5m of “extra” cable between the wireless receiver and the speakers themselves so I guess the way to get them working is to have the wireless receiver sitting next to the soundbar and have wires going to the surrounds just like an old fashioned AVR setup?\n\nJust don’t do it. It’s not worth it. Bluetooth rears suck, I did it and regret it - don’t repeat my mistake. The soundbar is fine and I like the sub (though I haven’t listened to the Sonos sub to compare) but the rear speakers really detract from the experience. We found we actually preferred to leave them off then listen to them stutter. WiFi rears are the only way to go.\n\nThey don’t have to be Sonos, lots of the premium brands (Nakamichi, B&O etc) support better connections to their rears.']"

I was originally planning on ordering them the Arc + Sub but after learning about the Era 300s, I'm thinking two of them with an arc in surround sound may be the better choice. 

More info that may help with suggestions:
I've been slowly hooking up the ceiling speakers throughout their house with Sonos amps and all of the ones that they care to have hooked up now have an Amp attached. Currently their main TV has been hooked up through ARC to play through the ceiling speakers in the room. That's the room that would be getting the Arc + whatever extra is decided on. My only concern is that due to the fact that the house has a very open floor plan and that the room has very tall cathedral ceilings, I don't know how that will impact either of the choices.

The side question I had is due to a switch yesterday to an LG OLED. They previously had a pretty basic 65"" Vizio TV but I found a pretty great deal on a new, open box 77"" LG G2. The business that sold it to me told me that it was only open box due to them opening it to verify function but I was able to get it for a little over $2500. I had some initial issues with the Vizio +Sonos AMP setup but found online that factory resetting the TV and not hooking up wifi fixed the issues for whatever reason. Now that I switched over to the LG it worked instantly and immediately switched over to the Amp over Arc. After starting to watch some content, there was a pop through the speakers and then all audio cut out. The light on the Amp didn't change or indicate anything but it would just stop working for a bit and then repeat the cycle. They previously used a Firestick with the Vizio and are now using an Apple TV with the LG. I have read of some similar issues happening with the Arc instead of the Amp but I'm going to attempt the fixes I saw recommended tomorrow. I just figured I would see if anyone had a similar issue and wanted to see what worked for them.

Thanks for any input you can provide!"	6	"['legallypurple: I think the recommendation I see more often in cases like this is to get the Arc + Sub first and then add the Era 300s (or some other Sonos surrounds) later.', 'vuerito89: I think it depends on what content they watch, whether to listen to music and what kind of streaming service they use. Eg Netflix requires the premium Abo to stream Atmos content.', 'schristo43: Arc, sub, grab a used pair of ones for the rear. \n\nLG… bitstream output, pass through, proper hdmi cable on earc', ""TheOneTrueRobin: Thanks for the suggestion! That seemed like the more common approach but I wasn't sure if it was solely due to the fact that the Eras are so new or because it's still solid advice."", 'Alekz87: Yes. This is the way to go. Arc is always the starter. Then go for the sub. And add surrounds later on if money is an issue.', ""TheOneTrueRobin: I definitely should've included that info but it just slipped my mind. They'll mainly be using it for TV shows, movies, and sports in that order. As for streaming service they use a mix of everything (HBO max, prime video, Apple TV+, Plex)depending on the show and do have a Netflix premium sub. I'd guess that realistically anytime they're going to be listening to musing it will be through the ceiling speakers in the house and not with specifically with the Arc + whatever. They may play it through the in addition to the ceiling speakers but it wouldn't ever be just sitting there listening to music in that room.""]"

I have a Connect Amp (one of several in my system) that’s worked fine forever, but suddenly stopped working at some point in the past couple weeks.  It no longer shows up in my system and the white light on the front will flash *on* for 4 seconds, *off* for 18 seconds, *on* for 4 seconds, and so on… (yes, I used a stopwatch…because I’m a huge nerd).

I tried unplugging and re-plugging.  Same behavior.

I tried rebooting it (unplugging for 30 seconds, replugging while holding play/pause).  Same behavior.

I called Sonos support.  We tried the above two steps above.  Same behavior.  She told me my unit was out of warranty, offered me a coupon code, and told me she couldn’t offer any other fixes.

Can anyone suggest additional things I can try to get this fixed?

Thanks so much!!"	0	[]

I actually replaced a pair of fives in my living room and have 0 regrets. I have been listening to Atmos on both Apple Music and Amazon. I have to say, I think Amazon takes it. For my tastes it has some titles Apple doesn’t have in Atmos (Jagged Little Pill, Future Nostalgia are two great examples). I also find the quality superior (Two titles that sound great on Amazon and not so much on Apple are Golden Hour (Kacey Musgraves) and Blue Neighborhood (Troye Sivan).

I'm here to sing the praises of /u/davidc_sf and his [https://symfonx.com/](https://symfonx.com/) product. I bought a custom art panel for my Symfonisk picture frame speaker and the whole experience was fantastic.

I was hesitant to purchase something from Unisk because my custom art was dark/bold and I was worried the colors wouldn't be saturated. I saw where David had posted about his company here on Reddit. I sent him a DM and he was super responsive -- just great customer service all around. He answered all of my questions, sent me pictures of other panels he'd produced, and even sent me a picture of mine before shipping it off! 

Installation with their magnet-based system was a breeze and the art sits flush in the frame. It's beautiful!

Production and shipping were insanely fast. I ordered on February 21, it shipped out to me on March 1, and I received on March 4th. This is a huge plus if you're a US-based customer and don't want to deal with Unisk overseas.

This review is unsolicited but I am so very happy with this product, and I had a hard time finding this kind of info when I was looking.

I am not trolling - but want to give my assessment, having spent good money for the Eras as well as mounts and why I am returning to the Ones.

I do watch lots of atmos movies through Plex using my Nvidia Shield.  Using the Eras, the surround and height effects were bigger than the Ones, but this was not always a plus.  For whatever reason the sound field could work great on one film and then be overwhelming on the next one.  I always found myself having to play with settings on every film.  Previously with the Ones, my system was basically plug and play.  Never having to tame the audio to work for me.

One possible reason this may be the case is that the Eras produce surround sound on the exterior that can bounce off the side walls to reflect back.  My right surround Era had such a wall but the left Era did not - therefore not having the ability to reflect the sound back to the seating position.

Whatever the case - Im back to the Ones and everything sounds clean whatever I play.  No more fiddling.  I guess my point is - if you plan to upgrade to the Eras give yourself some time (and a return window) to make sure they work in your current environment as mine was problematic."	49	"['lifereinspired: Interesting.

It’s not posted on the product page, just an obscure post on the Sonos forum. Given the “plug & play” nature of the Sonos ecosystem, most people who purchase it aren’t going to be scouring the Sonos forums or Reddit to try to learn that one of the recommend mounting methods isn’t yet supported before they follow those instructions. I mean, why would anyone? This was all just plain badly handled. Period. Whether muting the center driver was the “right move” for the best surround sound or not, it simply was handled poorly - and it still is. I’ve not changed how I feel on this. I just haven’t posted about it as much as I got tired of the fanboys continuing to say I’m being unfair, unreasonable, & then distorting what I said when I tried to talk about it.

For the P3, it was because the shape and profile of the speaker made for an in even soundstage. For the 5 in stereo, they wanted a wider effect. Not saying they’re right or wrong, but that’s the reality of a sw driven company- they can change the speaker profile and they have the audiophiles and engineers to ensure there is a valid reason for it.', 'Obi_Charlie: I agree.

So--an advertised and promoted expensive 6 speaker unit with only 5 speakers working and no company transparency, quality control issues and yes the Fan boys going wild .

I’m also really surprised by a company with the positive reputation and brand following that Sonos has, releasing a new product in a new product category (something they have been stressing to their investors in earnings/update calls) with multiple strange issues. Transparency would have quelled much of the confusing and frustration around the oddities.\n\nHonestly, it’s almost felt like a “beta” release. Like the early adopters are essentially beta testers. I have no problem with this in concept - just needs to be clearly stated and not at full retail price. As you said, a product at this price point shouldn’t be having any issues or negative “surprises” or “gotchas”. From what I’ve seen of Sonos in the past, they will, as you said, sort things out. But I also agree that pressure from owners/buyers must continue to ensure this. \n\nI think consumers are getting a little tired of marketing obfuscation on tech products. I just watched a video on YT by Caleb Denison from Digital Trends about Hisense. They are putting a ton of effort into their North American division to increase market share. He asked the team straight up what their plan is, in addition to their recent partnership with the NBA. They said they are going towards straight up info with no futzing or marketing terms (like “ClearMotion 480hz on a 60Hz TV panel). Printed on each Hisense TV box will be clearly labeled info on what you get: 60Hz, 120hz, or 144hz panels, the brightness clearly printed in nits (600 nits, 1000, nits, 1500 nits, etc), and clearly showing what type of backlight (LED, mini LED, etc). In addition, he asked about their conservative brightness measurements. The “nit” numbers posted are actually not what professional reviewers and TV calibrators are measuring…the Hisense TVs are actually *brighter* than what’s listed. Hisense’s response was that for too long the TV industry as over promised and underdelivered. They want to be known for being the brand that measures conservatively and over delivers on them.\n\nI think this is a really interesting marketing strategy and one that will likely do really well. I think consumers are tired and worn out of hearing essentially meaningless tech terms that have been created the thrown around the last few years. Things like QLED, QNED - which I’ve always though was supposed to trick unsuspecting folks into thinking it was related to OLED, given the similar look to the first letters and then the aforementioned proprietary terms for the motion smoothing or “soap opera effect” like ClearMotion or AutoMotion Plus or TruMotion or MotionFlow with a ridiculously high Hz number behind it making people think it’s the actual panel Hz. Consumers are getting savvier but it’s also getting to be more and more work to research and decode all these marketing terms. People don’t want to feel “tricked” in their tech purchases and the higher the price of the item, the worse they feel if it seems that happened. I think Hisense has a good chance with this approach and it may spur other TV manufacturers to do the same.\n\nI’m bringing this up because, essentially, Sonos didn’t take this route. And, after the firmware issues from mid-2022 (where it broke some instances of the Sub and Arc, etc), and the frustration that caused without warning or user choice, they could have benefited from more transparency with the Era release. Or that’s my feeling, anyway. I hope they move forward and fix these issues as soon as possible and do more to explain it than a single Sonos employee answering questions on the web forums.', 'DrZuben: Some fair call outs- they do it when it makes sense to them. So for play:1s or ones, sure, you’re right. 6 drivers in the Five though, and there is definitely at least a tweeter off when set as rears. But they don’t advertise the seemingly complex. Which is why you can’t find things like wattage or THD on most products.\n\nTheir classifications are nuanced. IKEA is independent, while they’re the tech backbone, it is its own category. Arc and beam would be considered a home theater. And absolutely they apply the same concept across the portfolio, just more frequent in all in ones. Center channel turned off on home theater when you’re playing music as an example. They advertise sound experience and stop as quickly as they can on the decisions as to why the experience is that way.', ""wiggum55555: Seems odd/unlikely that they would not have updated their poster-feature to accommodate new speakers they have presumably been working on in-house for a year or more... \n\nBut I do agree/hope that they will further improve the TruePlay experience for ERA's after a month or two of have hundreds of thousands of new data-points -  telemetry from all of us new ERA users - to further refine TruePlay.

Funny enough I had two Hisense TV's (same make and model, fire tvs, with EARC ports). I bought them in 2022, but they were models that were 3 years old, readily available on Amazon, Big Box sites. \n\n they were both purchased for the future when I would put the ARC in.  There were quite a few things not working right. When I called Hisense--They had me read serial numbers to them--which I did , from box and TV--they said they couldn't find the serial number matching the model I gave them (I would read my serial number--in duplicate from the box and rear of the TV). Turns out, both these TVs had the wrong innards inside. They wouldn't produce ATMOS anyway. During that time period three years ago, they must have released hundreds or thousands of these non quality control models. I even had an engineering buddy fascinated by this , as he worked quality control in another company and could almost see how things broke down on the assembly process to just mass produce. \n\nTHEN I got there U7H and U8H (2022 models)--everything clearly documented, clearly marked, consistency in manufacturing (excluding how many they make) and blam--provided all features as advertised. I didn't give up on Hisense. I think they are getting better and better. one day I'll just go LG top end but I don't have that kind of dough.

It's no where near what I had in a big space consuming, wired up house (separates) but it's pretty damn good. \n\nSonos doesn't lose with this early release of the ERA 300s. They clearly know their market. They got away with the ARC release and figure we can get these 300s out and they're getting free market research--here, their owner forum, the myriad set up calls they must be getting from anyone creating a new Sonos system (ARC or Beam, 300s and maybe a sub or something).\n\nSonos does lose in a way. I've had great support from them--to date. I call and someone really does answer, walk me through a solution and I'm happy but as a product delivering on quality as advertised (w/ what you and I have summarized--advertising a 6 unit speaker, no matter how folks here want to cut it, and with a soundbar you get 5 (and we never told you). Shame---it feels so much like the Automotive industry.\n\nstill waiting for Sonos to evolve these ERA 300s or issue an truthful statement, or for the press to get a hold of this, or a reviewer that doesn't have teeth in sales. --and yes--good for Hisense, LG upper end, other companies that are working to insure quality, improve quality and not living off of Call it quality , deliver mediocrity."", 'Thebrotherleftbehind: No I mean based on user feedback', 'lifereinspired: Wow! You’re not kidding…we’re definitely on the same page. That is amazing. We’ve also been moving away from our separates system for a simpler, sleeker, wireless setup. We live in an apartment and the amount of space and even power in the separates just didn’t really make sense. Our sub was turned down all the way to where it wasn’t even being used to try to not disturb our neighbors. So, those issues, along with some oddities in how our AVR worked with our particular TV (CEC-HDMI handshake issues) had my spouse super frustrated. Even our Harmony remote setup wasn’t getting the system able to startup without my having to troubleshoot. A spouse that feels they can’t turn on and watch a TV show doesn’t make for happy times (rightfully so). \n\nI got into Sonos not for the multi room audio but the ability to create our own system w/reasonably priced wireless surrounds and without adding sub (our bedroom shares a wall with a neighbor’s bedroom and even a small, cheap sub goes right through the wall). We wanted to add surrounds for our bedroom last year because our apartment building had to gut and rebuild the floor below us. The rear surrounds let us crank up white noise so we could tolerate the noise. We chose the Beam G2 and two Symfonisks for rear surrounds. Once I started having all the issues in the family room, I wondered how the Beam would sound a larger space and decided to set it up in there for a day or two. I think that was about 8 months ago now. :D For the size/price, the Beam is quite remarkable and punches well above its weight. The ease of use/simplicity, losing the wires running around the room, and getting space back more than make up for moving away from the separates. We decided to get a soundbar system for the living room (and move the Beam setup back to the bedroom) but it’s proved a little more difficult than expected. We tried two systems over the holidays (after dealing with multiple family emergencies). One was the Sonos Arc/Ones, and the other was the Q990b. The Arc had issues that I can only assume were defects. There were issues with the highs being physically painful (never had that with any system before) and I couldn’t tune it out and the dialogue wasn’t very clear. I found some other people with the same issue and they also concluded it was defective (it didn’t sound like the many Arc demos I’d heard) so it went back. Then first Q990b wasn’t even a Q990b - someone had returned a 5 year old Samsung system for a “free” Q990b upgrade (I didn’t enjoy doing that return) and when we actually got the replacement, we has the issues with the rear AND sub disconnects. I also wasn’t impressed with the audio (despite this opinion being in the minority, given all the glowing reviews). Atmos effects weren’t as pronounced as I had expected and there was a thin and hollow quality to the mids that I couldn’t EQ out. There were also several other oddities (and similar marketing tricks) that I didn’t love. Also, dialogue was difficult to hear and Samsung’s voice enhancement is awful (all vocals sound like robots and a lot of other audio was affected, too). Truthfully, I was spoiled by Sonos’ voice enhancement which truly does a good job. So, it went back and our Beam/Symfonisks are still being used.\n\nI was also looking at the JBL Bar 1300/1300x that came out in Feb. It has a lot of interesting features and the sound is supposed to be good. But there are things that Sonos has that has kind of spoiled me. I love the ability to integrate into smart home and change my Sonos settings with the Soro app. Even the Q990b with the SmartThings app had nothing like that. The JBL doesn’t have any night mode, you can’t turn off Harmon Pure Voice (last I heard) and the height, bass, and surrounds have only 3 or 5 total volume settings. Sonos offers way more than that. I knew I wanted a system with upfiring rear speakers so when I heard about the Era 300 release, I began to wonder if that might not be the solution. Add the 300s to our Beam for now, maybe add a Sub Mini at some point, and wait for the Arc’s Gen 2 update someday. But some of their, shall we say, lack of transparency and the mixed reviews have me waiting for now. \n\nOur TV also has to be replaced in the near future. Ours is from 2017 and is developing some hardware and panel issues (DSE and the ARC port starting to go). It’s really interesting to hear the turnaround that Hisense has made in the last few years, from your experience. I’ve not had one (yet) personally but they’ve been in some Airbnbs that we stayed in and I was pretty impressed, especially with these being from their budget line. I’m really looking forward to the 2023 U7 and U8. I dream about going for a top end OLED but we leave TV on a lot and often even sleep to some white noise video on YouTube. I’m not sure I’m ready to be concerned about burn-in. I see tons of posts saying burn-in is not an issue at all and people are worried for nothing and other posts and videos saying it’s real (even the early rtings.com burn-in test is showing it’s real). We also have a bright room so it would either need to be MLA or QD-OLED… or mini LED would be a great choice. \n\nI’m also waiting (and hoping) that Sonos will offer some update or make statement about some of the lack of transparency and the issues we’ve both been bothered and frustrated to see. They seem to do so much research on certain things that other companies don’t even think to do to make sure their speakers sound great. So why this? I guess the truth is that I want them to live up to being the company I’ve believed them to be. But I think that’s fair, you know? I also wish we could get this talked about by reviewers or the press, as you mentioned. I’m truly shocked that almost none of the major reviews that I’ve seen/read have tried the 300s as surrounds. A few did but it was basically an afterthought…a footnote near the end of the review. I thought that would be one of their largest market draws - at least based on the number of times I’ve seen comments and posts from people asking for Sonos to make upfiring rear surrounds. I guess all we can do now is wait and watch - and hope.', 'wiggum55555: Lets give them some time...  would rather they gathered real world data, and real world feedback, decide on a ""solution""...  write and test the solution internally and then release an update in 1-2 months.  No point rushing something out after two weeks of public release & use.', ""PanicLogically: Yes Yes Yes. I learned the hard way, again that not all EARC ports would produce ATMOS--so a better two TVS came into my home.  It took a day to figure out my wifi changes, the TVs were bogus and voila Sonos worked. In my efforts to get an all in one living room--I did splurge on the ARC. More speakers, fairly decent specs on each individual component. They were not my old Klipsch, Mordant Short, B and O, stuff.\n\n BUT wow to be free of wires and towers and heavy stuff. I'm older. I have headphones for audiophile moments . I was , despite being a late 2022 ARC purchaser --not totally impressed with the sound. I listened and oddly--the Symfonisk Bookshelves are great rears (as are the lamps for some rooms) as are the Frames (unique sound dispersion layout). \n\n I knew--don't go sound bar then sub--that's the big box mind here on reddit-it's silly. I found plenty of bass in the Symfonisk rears and the ARC with just moving the slider , toggling down treble a bit and loudness on. I was disappointed but alas it maybe true to learn this paradigm that adding speakers to the ARC (the sub) does somehow redistribute audio and you get better fidelity--shouldn't be that way. So I have the sub like you but it's not really turned on too much. Yes the overall audio got a few notches better with the redistribution. \n\nI'm happy for the folks buying ERA 300s as stand alone pairs--they get a good system but for folks like you and me, dual purposing TV sound bar, rears and wanting adequate music production--the existing 6 or so options get that job done. I do want the 300s--I look at what's crammed in the box and it's impressive. I will wait till the company comes VERY clean on what happened. I think their style though is to admit nothing. I have no doubt though , from following them closely--it was never intended to shut off a speaker. I see so many turn coats here (the cult of Sonos) that have / had posts up proudly talking about the 6 speaker units as rears and now knifing anyone that would suggest that's how they are supposed to be. Even one of our most famous reviewers-video guy every one bows to--talked up the 6 speaker thing and now acts like that wasn't his own excitement just 7 weeks back."", 'Thebrotherleftbehind: I mean that’s what I’m saying, gotta like that wine breathe baby!']"

Coming from a Beam only, to adding the Era 100s as rears I have been loving the audio. For music and telly, it's been great. Tuneplay worked wonders too.

To get Bluetooth working you can't just press the Bluetooth button to get it working. There's no feedback/noise from the speaker that this doesn't work either. In the manual, right at the bottom of Bluetooth section, it says you can't use Bluetooth when surrounds.

So I turned off surrounds in the room, tried again, nothing. Instead, I had to remove the surrounds. This turned off Tuneplay. Then I connected Bluetooth, managed to add the other Era 100 and also the Beam (which I didn't know), and listen to some music via Bluetooth.

Then I switched it off and turned on the telly. Surrounds needed to be re-added. Tuneplay is off now and the sound is worse now I'm used to it. I can't just switch it back on, I have to do the manual process again.

This just seems really poor UI and I'm not thrilled I'll have to do this anytime I want to play anything over Bluetooth.

One thing I did find, however, was third-party weatherproofing on select products including Sonos Beam and Arc. 

Being an existing Sonos customer this would essentially be exactly what I'm looking for. But ... I'm leery. I live in TX so although the space is covered and is unlikely to directly come in contact with water, it'll still be exposed to heat, cold, and humidity.

Also my living room and dining room is an open space, each equipped with a One.
But they don’t sit right next to each other, so making a Stereo pair out of these two doesn’t make any sense.

I have just received my white Era 100 to use in my bedroom as a single speaker. Here are my thoughts:

The look of the speaker - nice looking although I actually prefer the outgoing One (I have 2 sets of them).  The metal grille of the older speaker looks more premium in my opinion. The 100 is still nice mind you.

The set up - very easy as I have excellent WiFi in my home. Did not affect my SonosNet speakers in any way. My app now also reflects the WiFi signal feature on this and my portable speakers which is nice. 

The sound - definitely an improvement on the Ones but not as bigger difference as I thought it would be. Just goes to show how good the Ones are! I would not recommend anyone replaces their Ones, but if buying this size speaker for the first time, then get the 100. Mainly due to the added connections (Bluetooth and line in).

—-

This might have (probably has) been widely discussed but I haven’t seen it…

Firstly I’ll start by saying I love the Eras as surrounds for Atmos, much more immersive experience and I will definitely be keeping them.

It’s really distracting when you’re watching TV."	11	['Stilitzkin: When I was first setting my Era 300s up as surrounds to my Arc and 2x Sun gen 3s, as I was running Trueplay, the Eras were dropping in and out- then I realized I was doing Sonos-Net with an Ethernet cable in the Arc.

With full it sends the entire left front to the left rear, and same for the right channel. So since vocals are in those channels, you'll get vocals out of the rear.  If you select ambient, it takes sounds that are in both left and right channels, but out of phase, and puts them in the rear.   \n\nIf you've got 2 speakers and stereo sound, if the sound is in phase, it sounds like it's coming from between the 2 speakers, out of phase makes it hard to place where the sound is coming from.  It's how Dolby pro logic could take the stereo soundtrack available on playback devices in the early days of home theaters and make surround out of it."", 'Momo411176: Agreed.

Unfortunately, it's just not worthwhile for me to constantly be pairing and unpairing depending on what I'm listening to.

I've moved them to other parts of the house.\n\nI do listen to music but its not my main thing and wouldn't consider myself an audiophile. I do feel the overall experience is better with the Era 300's than the Ones even for non atmos music.  \n\nOn non-Atmos it felt previously the Ones either overpowered the Arc when set to full or didn't help envelop the room when set to ambient. It does feel like the Arc is freed up, my uneducated guess is it is freed up from doing some of the virtualization surround sound. In Rocket Man with the Ones I felt the vocals kinda of got lost in the mix and could be overpowered. I feel its much more even and much more clarity now.\n\nThe hardest thing to qualify is what the level of improvement for its value. I totally understand why some people think its a big change or not a big change for the money. The way I think about it, buying the Era 300's is about improving on the Ones, improving the arc, and the whole ecosystem. Since the Era 300s don't have its center driver firing when paired as surrounds it isn't really the featured speaker. The Arc is. But the Arc is made better in my opinion. You also do have to crank the 300's Tv/music levels to about 7 (halfway, maxes out at about 14).  So the expectation of the Era300s blowing away the Ones isn't quite right, when its about improving the overall surround sound experience. Hope that makes sense.\n\nThe whole Sonos Arc, Sub, Era 300 vs say a discounted Samsung Q990B is not a great value proposition. What you're paying a premium for is the most stable system, most supported ecosystem (Era 300's will likely get better over time just like the Arc. In a weird way Sonos showed this when in trying to improve dialogue clarity for the Arc/Sub they accidentally broke trueplay Bass profiles for like 3 months before fixing it all). Also Sonos has the best resale value. So if I suddenly decide to go for the Nakamichi Dragon next year, I'll probably recoup money the best with Sonos. And of course the modular approach lets me repurpose or resell the current rears if I want. \n\nThe Samsung systems are good but basically lose half their value in less than a year and have you trying to figure out if next year's upgrade is worth it. It was annoying it took Sonos so long to come out with upfiring rears, but hopefully I'm good for the next while."", 'satinygorilla: Yes they do add, in my opinion, a decent amount as rears for music', 'legallypurple: Not sure what you are asking. I like listening to music or watch videos with OR without Atmos. \n\nThe Sonos ecosystem is new to me. I got the 300s, liked them and decided to get the Arc. I’m glad I did. \n\nBut can I tell when there is little or overwhelming contribution but the rears? Yes, I’ve been tinkering with the settings and can definitely see the difference.', 'legallypurple: Yup. I had the Era 300s before I got the Arc.', 'PanicLogically: Thanks. very helpful.', 'Comfortable_Ad3005: I agree. At first things felt ""off"" because the center driver wasn\'t firing directly at me like my One SLs were, but I\'ve listened to quite a bit more stereo music with the 300s as surrounds now and I think they\'re better sounding than the Ones. They blend much better with the Arc while the One\'s always felt separate, which kept me from listening to much music before unless I had ambient turned on and the surround volume way down.\n\nThe Arc is still center stage with 300s as others have noted, unless I turn the surround volume way up, but I don\'t find that to be a pleasant listening experience myself.', 'DBZ86: I have found the Arc to actually be improved. In your opinion do you find this to be the case? I think vocals in music sound more detailed and clear for example.', 'OHHMiii: I’m still at the mindset of waiting until they update a new version of the arc and also allow the era300’s to be enabled instead of disabled and have the choice of which I prefer. Do they sound good for movies which is what I prefer as I’m not big into music or music in atmos? I’m sure they do, but maybe they would sound even better with the main driver enabled? Nobody can say that they sound better either way because it’s not an option. I’m not going to take anyone’s word for it or as the yt guy says “Trust me” they sound better disabled! How can anyone know that if you can’t compare?', ""Comfortable_Ad3005: Yes, for sure. Music playback across the board just sounds better in my opinion. To the OP's original point, Atmos music is better when the 300s are paired on their own--vocals especially feel fuller--but Atmos with the Arc is still a great listening experience too, especially if you play through the Apple Music app on an ATV4k."", ""Comfortable_Ad3005: Yes, 5.1/7.1 mixes in movies get a big boost with the 300s. What I've noticed the most is getting more sounds wrapping around me and also really impressive height effects despite not being Atmos. \n\nChasing dragons around in God of War Ragnarok on my PS5 was a lot of fun because you can hear them flying overhead. \n\nWhether Sonos gives you the ability to mess with that center driver or not, the Era 300s are the best surround speakers they offer hands down. You just have to be OK with their full potential as a music speaker only being realized if you pair them on their own. Maybe one day they'll release a surround speaker built first and foremost for a home theater setup that doesn't need to be 450 dollars, but outside of soundbars, they always seem to be focused on music first."", ""PanicLogically: So many of the yay sayers, you can see their posts just weeks ago, touting the 6 speaker design, no knowledge it would be turned off and yes no ability for them to ever guage how it worked. \n\nIt's a mighty expensive purchase to have a decision to get surround sound with 6 speakers and get 5 working speakers. Not everyone wants to buy these for surround and then be told, they'll sound great as a separate pair. \n\nI never take anyone's word--it's nice to read feedback but our own ears, our own listening rooms."", ""DBZ86: Hmm interesting. Music is secondary to me so I haven't tested the 300's on their own vs part of the Arc, sub system. \n\nI would have assumed the 300's are worse when added to the surround sound system because they're not going to be the focal point. But that the Arc/sub/300's experience should be better than just the 300s on its own. Sounds like that's not the case."", ""PanicLogically: I think, when I read the 300 reviews, across happy owners or people feeling it isn't what they expect, especially with folks paired with a sound bar----I get the sense that people are expecting Sonos to retune, figure out that turned off center channel."", 'Comfortable_Ad3005: I think the biggest boost pairing them on their own is the true physical separation you get between the 2 speakers, which the Arc can never truly replicate. The phantom center with two Era 300s is really impressive and the Atmos effects still get beamed all around the room, including above and behind you.', ""PanicLogically: so far it doesn't seem the case--folks with the 300s as a standalone system seem very impressed. The impact of 300s integrated into a soundbar for music (non atmos) or TV sound non atmos hasn't been as rousing as I would expect. \n\nSonos must be reading all this as free market research."", ""Comfortable_Ad3005: Maybe they will. They certainly tuned the Arc over time. As for the center driver, it's pretty easy to come to the conclusion  that's just going to make them sound more like the One SLs with upward firing drivers, which is just going to limit what you hear from the side firing drivers, so it's kind of doomed to piss some people off either way. After 2 weeks, I can say without a doubt I do not want them to sound more like the Ones, regardless of content."", ""PanicLogically: We have no idea what they sound like--they shut the center speaker off. Hypothesizing about sound without hearing just is not working. Remember how everyone hypothesized positively just weeks ago when they thought all 6 would work w/ in a single unit? Remember all the yay sayers counting those speakers and saying how radical the surround would be with all 6. For memory failure you just have to scroll through this sub to the past 6 weeks. \n\nNo doubt they were not marketed nor initially designed and manufactured to be shut off. I've never seen any audio product do this frankly."", 'Comfortable_Ad3005: Maybe you\'re right. I\'ve said it on other threads: I\'m not going to complain if Sonos wakes up and says ""oops, that driver should have been on"" and suddenly they sound 900 dollars better, but it\'s a 7.1.4 system and the marketing was clear on that. It seems to me the only option for the front drivers is for them to always play the left/right surround channels in tandem with the outside firing drivers that are already doing that. Otherwise how would the processing possibly work to only fire them some of the time? If both drivers are playing the same channels that close each other, they\'re just going to cancel each other out.\n\nThe other thing I would say to those who haven\'t heard the speakers is the physical design does seem to play a big role in how they disperse sound, so I don\'t think Sonos was just trying to push a trendy new aesthetic with this hourglass shape. On paper, it doesn\'t seem to make sense that the outside drivers are the main left/right surround channels, but when they fire, the sound isn\'t just shooting straight out to the side, it\'s wrapping around the speaker in a way that it sounds like the driver is higher and more front facing.\n\nThe front driver has its purpose, but it doesn\'t seem to be needed in a surround pairing, and I don\'t think it\'s a stretch to conclude it would actually be a detriment.']"

I'm considering buying a second one to create a stereo pair for music, but also so I have the option of linking them to my Beam Gen 2 as surrounds when I want to watch a film. As I would be using the two Era 300's 99% of the time for music I have two questions:

1. Is a stereo pair of Era 300's significantly better than one?
2. Is the process of hooking up surrounds to watch a film, and then disconnecting them afterwards to just have them as music speakers easy?

If this process involves a few clicks in the Sonos app that's fine, but I don't want to have to redo the Trueplay tuning every time or something. The speakers won't be physically moved, so I'm hoping this won't be the case.

I'm in the process of upgrading our Sonos system.
Please bear with me as I'm not a super knowledgeable audiophile.

I have a Sonos Beam connected to a Sony Frame. 
I am looking to add L and R Sonos Era 100 speakers behind our couch. 

My question is: Can I also connect the two Era 100 speakers to my turntable via line in (no pairing)?

I'm thinking:
Turntable with built in phono stage
connected to
2 channel amplifier
connected to
RCA out left to 3.5mm to left side Era 100 
RCA out right to 3.5mm to right side Era 100

Will this work as intended?

Thanks in advance!"	7	"['GuitarSuperstar: If you connect the Era 100s as surrounds to the Beam, it will disable the line-in feature on both Era 100s.

Mad_Pinckerton	0	12c46j8	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12c46j8/the_era_300_everyone_is_asking_hint_if_youre_an/	"Everyone should first listen to it. At home or a local audio store & hear it. Test yourself or ask them to play non dolby & dolby atmos music, sports, movies.
It does matter. 

Don't take anybody's opinion at face value. Including mine. It's your money & ears only you know what you like.

I did just that & found out quickly it's a totally evolved way of listening. 
You have to retrain yourself & ears to something new. Your traditional senses are front impact.

This is why some people say it's weak from the front grill or their fives hit harder from behind as rears.

It does sound just a tad weaker with normal 2 channel stereo music & non dolby atmos content. 

It sounds lower & no mid weight to those tracks. Switch it to dolby atmos music & atmos content
Yes, then the Era 300 comes alive. I get it now. 

You now hear it's intent. The highs are sparklier mids come from everywhere & the bass just pops in areas where it's intended.

Now it's definitely odd at first but if you stick to these atmos tracks one after another it grows on you.
It's new to you & you're not sure if you like this sound or hate it.

Side note: some atmos tracks sound awful & echo. Not the speaker's fault it's the recording sucks. 

So here's the rub. Right now Apple Music is really the best way to get the full sound out of these Era 300's or if you have an extensive locally stored dolby atmos music library already made. 

I don't & plenty of you don't either. 

So the question of is the Era300 worth it? Should I upgrade? Can I just buy one? etc. Well its nuanced.

If you are in the apple ecosystem, use apple music only, occasionally spotify, really like dolby atmos music tracks, & movies. Can retrain your ears. Then yes, absolutely to all of the above.

Keep in mind for movies, some gaming (was kind of hard to test games) sports & tv for this Era 300 to truly shine it must be dolby atmos content also. Standard def or non trueHD content you will not get the true benefits of this speaker & that will become apparent if you own fives or ones as rears & upgrade. 

Here's a recommendation list from my experience.
Try the Era 300 for yourself but here's who I think this works for. All of this is subjective of course. 

- As Book shelf speakers -   No, sound will not radiate inside a bookshelf. Unless bookshelf is small 3- 4 shelf & you can put the era 300 on top. 

- Stereo Music Pair only -   Yes, if you're all in on apple dolby music & spatial audio. No, if you listen to most anything else.
The Fives sound fuller, meaner, bit flatter. The highs & dynamics not as bright as the Era300.
The Fives clean up poorer recordings better especially lo-Fi tracks. Tracks recorded better Era 300 sometimes.

The Fives bass is a bit bolder. It just works & sounds  better for any non dolby atmos music tracks. Feels like a hollow sound is in the center of the Era 300.
. 
-Turntable-  If you have a good one. The Fives in stereo pair all the way. Not the Era 300's wheelhouse.
It's not even close. 
One Era 300 might work for a starter budget turntable in a tiny room. It will get the job done pretty well. 

-Home theater-  Medium to large room- Yes, get Era 300's if budget no issue, want Apple Dolby Atmos music, bigger atmos surround bubble & spatial audio. Arc & full Sub recommended this way. Its needed for best results.




Small -Medium room - Can get away with Beam2 & sub mini just turn the bass down on the Era 300's otherwise will drown out the sub mini. 

Sound from behind you will be slightly less dramatic because bulk of sound it radiates around & above you not directly. 

If dolby Atmos music or spatial awareness not a priority & spotify is your bag, you watch a lot of sports, stick with what you got. Large room use Fives, or Ones as rears with Sub & Arc. Medium room use ones or new Era 100's with sub mini & Beam 2. Upgrade to arc & Sub only if you like it extra boomy & loud. Era 300's you'll dislike the performance, compared to your old ones. Especially for non hd stuff. Trust me.
Small room- Ray & sub mini Beam 2 & sub mini. add Era 100's if budget allows. All you need. Not enough Dolby Atmos content yet to justify price for Arc or jump to Era 300's benefits would be wasted in such a small space. In my opinion. 
Desk & office. - 2 era 100's with sub mini best results or 2 Fives. 2 era 300's spaced out as stereo pair placed on opposite wall from desk or corners best results only if apple dolby music is a must. 
Apologies on long rant but I figured I'd inform some people after really testing these out in 2 locations. I also tested these against regular wired systems. Many sound better at half the cost with non dolby atmos content when stacked against the Era 300's. You really have to want that airy around you sound to get the most out of them. For me I will not be getting them yet. I am not that into the Apple ecosystem & dolby atmos music has a long way to go. Over 153 albums I want to play are not available in dolby atmos music or on the apple music app. So I'll wait for more progress to justify these Era 300's. They are good for their intended purpose but that purpose is a niche one with a high premium for entry. Just my 2 cents.

There's a learning curve to configure them correctly, but a properly mixed, lossless Atmos track paired with the arc and two G3 subs is another level of music. I have found myself listening to music more than i have in years. 

I've been following threads closely on this forum and there are some ""gotchas"" that aren't immediately obvious. This is a quick list/brief explanation of what I've learned since receiving mine. For the ultimate listening experience, there are some obvious and not-so-obvious steps:

1. Use Apple Music
2. Use Apple TV 4k for lossless Dolby Atmos 
3. Make sure your TV is configured to enable Passthrough audio

**Spotify vs Apple Music**

Currently Spotify doesn't support lossless or atmos. This is a huge bummer because I've been with Spotify for a long time but now I'm considering the switch. 

Apple Music offers lossless and Atmos but there are some caveat's. Apple Music currently has the best selection of Atmos music. 

**Apple Music via Sonos App versus Apple Music via Apple TV 4k**

Testing both, I have found there is a noticeable improvement when playing audio through the Apple TV via the Music app. It does not appear that when Queuing music from Apple Music via Sonos app, we are getting lossless audio. 

Music sounds more full through the Apple TV

**Audio Passthrough**

Today this thread was posted [Do you notice your Era 300s not clearly separating Atmos or rear side/back surrounds?] (https://old.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12bqzi3/do_you_notice_your_era_300s_not_clearly/) and when i made this change, i noticed another leap in improvement.

The best way to describe what i was hearing before this was ""muddy atmos"" where the channels were less clear. 

Once all these are configured, some recommendations:

Benny and the Jets remastered:

Made for Spatial Audio playlist from Atmos
https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/made-for-spatial-audio/pl.154af9931b214278a64274c410046e69

One thing i have noticed after mulitple true play tunings is my right rear speaker seems quieter than my left. But the vaulted ceiling is much higher on the right and the ""space"" it's filling is more voluminous so I think Sonos will need to give us a per speaker audio level adjustment (even beyond True play) for asymmetrical vertical spaces. 

Enjoy!"	31	"['sft007: Good tips on the pass through. However there is no such thing as lossless Dolby Atmos on Apple Music. Not sure where you’re getting that from. You can get lossless on the ATV 4K via the Apple Music app on it but Apple does not offer Atmos Music at lossless quality, at least currently. It’s either regular Atmos or non Atmos lossless.\n\nAnd no offense to most posters but if you think you can tell the difference (via a blind A/B test) between a lossless and regular Apple Music AAC on consumer grade Sonos speakers and soundbars you’re probably going to be surprised…\n\nEdit: one other thing. If you’re noticing a different sound profile playing the same thing from Apple Music via the Sonos app directly vs playing it from the ATV 4K what you’re noticing is the different tuning your soundbar does when playing something over HDMI. I recall reading that Sonos tunes the sound to be more suitable for movies when anything is connected via HDMI and it’s a different profile than when playing music via the Sonos app. Which makes sense when you think about it.

I know the movie is in 5.1, but I was genuinely impressed with how the sound reflected off the roof and created a similar experience to surround sound, despite the roof being sloped.

I could hear the sound of the light discs flying past my head 😄 I highly recommend testing from 1:22:22 in the movie. I have TruePlay turned on.

Listening to music on Amazon Music sounds absolutely amazing and shows just how good the speakers can be...however I am finding that when playing anything on my TV I get drops in audio every few seconds on the 300 only. Would this be due to using ARC and not eARC? I have checked all the settings I can think of,  paired / unpaired and tried different devices (Sky box / Nvidea Shield) plugged in to TV with different audio types (atmos /5.1/ stereo PCM) all with the same drop outs on the 300. I will be borrowing a TV that has eARC next week but just wonded if there is anything else I can check in the meantime or if this is most likely the bottleneck causing the issue.

When I do (hopefully) resolve the above issue I was wondering when using both Arc and 300's should they both be set at the same volume level for the best experience as when I have tried this it sounds a bit off... this could be down to the previous issue! I've found that having the Arc on around 30 and the Era on about 10 seems to sounds good (apart from the aforementioned dropouts!)

Finally when changing the volume on the TV it will change on the Arc (as expected) but the 300 will stay at the same volume. Does this mean that the only way to change the Era is to open the app and change it through there? I have also tried to mute the TV (and therefore Arc) and the 300 carried on at the same volume. Haven't fully tested this yet to see if that happens on all audio types.

Thanks in advance for any help / advice / pointers !!"	14	"['lifereinspired: I don’t have the Era 300s but it almost sounds like you don’t have them configured as rear surrounds but as grouped in the same room. This is a very different setup and you wouldn’t get fully multi-channel surround. When they are configured as rear surrounds, the TV volume will change the volume of the soundbar *and* rear surrounds together (at the same proportion that you have them set). You can change the level of the speakers as rear surrounds separately (from -10 up to +10) but once you have that setup, the audio levels should change using just your TV. You can use the Sonos app but it should only be one slider for the system not adjusting them separately.', ""glynnjamin: I'd return the 300 and get two ones or 100s.

I know there have also been others wishing that a single Era 300 can be used as a surround (with the drivers on each side handling the surround data for those channels). I think it would have been complex for them to code that entirely different setup in the app and I think most people have two surrounds in mind anyway.\n\nAt least you have a plan for now.

If you have surrounds configured or a sub configured properly and attached to that soundbar, the soundbar only needs to rebroadcast those specific channels to each of those devices (ie, bass channel to the sub, Rear right to the right, rear left to the left). The way you have it set up, you're trying to have your soundbar stream all channels to the 300. That's a lot of processing for the device and a lot of bandwidth is needed, especially if it doesn't encapsulate everything into basic stereo streams.\n\nI guess that's to say that if you stream music to both at the same time without issue, there isn't anything wrong with the devices.

This will give you a more immersive audio experience. Grouping speakers with the Arc while playing TV audio is not recommended because you will probably experience a slight audio delay from the 300. Streaming music will be in sync though.\n\nBecause the Era 300 is just grouped to the Arc, you cannot control the volume on the 300 using the TV remote. You must use the Sonos app or a voice assistant to control the volume.\n\nThe reason why the 300 is dropping out when playing TV audio on the Arc is probably because there is some wireless interference in your room. You might try moving the 300 to a different spot. If possible, you can try wiring the Arc to the router with an ethernet cable.', ""GadgetronRatchet: To piggyback on what Guitar is saying, I personally just wouldn't group the Era 300 with the Arc at all for TV audio.

1680637980.0	04-Apr-2023 12:53:00	Differences in Era 300 rear separation when playing atmos test sounds from Apple Music from Apple TV vs Sonos app	jimmyzh3ng	7	12bueg4	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12bueg4/differences_in_era_300_rear_separation_when/	"So I tried testing out this Atmos test track https://music.apple.com/us/album/dolby-atmos-channel-id-7-1-4-corners-lfh-rfh-lrh-rrh/1610540054?i=1610540061 on Apple Music on the Apple TV and Sonos app. What I noticed is that on the Sonos app, I’m getting distinct separate sounds from side and rear surrounds on both the left and right rear Era 300s, and I also get distinct front (from the arc) and rear left and right height channels. However, when I play the same track on Apple Music via Apple TV, there is no separation between rear and front height channels and it sounds like both rear and side rear channels come out from the side rear channels. 

Based off of my analysis I’m wondering if Atmos Apple Music is processed through channels differently on the Apple TV vs the Sonos app? Could explain why people say they can hear a difference between the two platforms. Also explains why some people might not hear a clear separation on their rear speakers if they are playing Atmos music/sounds on Apple Music via Apple TV. What’s weird is that when I play actual Atmos music on Apple Music via Apple TV, I swear I can hear separate rear and side surround channels, but that might be a placebo effect.

I also have my Sonos arc connected to the LG B7A, which is able to pass through Dolby Atmos, but does not use the new eARC standard. It is able to process DD+ (lossy atmos), which I’m not sure if it’s capable of 7.1.4, maybe just 5.1.2.

1680631067.0	04-Apr-2023 10:57:47	Do you notice your Era 300s not clearly separating Atmos or rear side/back surrounds?	6over6	41	12bqzi3	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12bqzi3/do_you_notice_your_era_300s_not_clearly/	"See if you have your TV Digital Audio Output set to “Auto”. If so change to “Pass Through”.

I’ve been testing sound test after sound test, pairing and unpairing, factory resetting, and moving around the room, and trying to see if the speakers were having issues. 

In my tests using 7.1.4 sound files as many have recommended here, I noticed rear Atmos channels were being shared with Arc Atmos, and the rear side-firing speakers were blended together (no distinct separation), also the rear inside firing channels were never firing. 

Chatting with others in comments and reading feedback from others in here, seems I was not getting proper HD sound output. So I changed the output on my LG CX to “Pass Through”, and sure enough, I suddenly had clear and separated channels. Sounds obvious but I forgot I had set it to Auto a while back to deal with what seemed like another Atmos issue. 

I now have to go back and test other audio tests to see if it improves overall listening, and I have a feeling it will.

Now i am going to import sonos sub mini which cost me around 670$ in my country. The whole sonos system cost me around 1300$. 

Now i am really confused between sonos and Samsung because in Pakistan, Samsung q930b sold around 940$.

I loved atmos effect and deep base which are very good on q930b compared to sonos beam 2.

The only advantage i got from sonos whenever any product dies, I easily replace it but in Samsung whole system got replaced.

The option i have,
1. Sold sonos beam gen 2 and ikea speaker and bought q930b.
2. Obviously stay with sonos but the amount i spend on this system its not value for money that's what I am thinking.

I need advice from you guys what should i do now ?"	1	['RichardDerek52: If you only want a home cinema set, then it’s what ears tell you!\nI have a Beam,  play 1s for surround and sub mini with my TV.

(4) Sonos One SL's (one in the lobby, two in the large production area and one in the small production area with an Echo Show to control them through Spotify.

I'm sure there is a better solution, and have even researched 70w hardwired speaker systems, but I really like the idea of wall mounted, wireless speakers and the Sonos ecosystem.

I'm currently using a Samsung HW-T650 with a pair of rear speakers (I think SWA-8500) and the subwoofer from this set. It's not bad but it does not support Atmos and sometimes it is not starting along with my Sony Bravia. Aside from that I would like to have a general better sound quality.

So I'm upgrading my setup now. I'm unsure whether it should be the Sonos Set (as mentioned above) or the Samsung one.

I could get both for about 1000 Euros.

Would be great if someone has experience with the set ups or can give me any advice in general whether the Sonos or the Samsung is better.

I'm searching for a good surround experience and clear dialogue.

Thank you in advance!"	2	['lifereinspired: Oooohhh, this is a really hard one. You have to start by knowing that any soundbar system will be room dependent and one that sounds great in one room may not sound good at all in another (and vice versa).\n\nI’ve had both system (well, the Q990b in the US). I purchased it in January and was unlucky enough to get a system that had BOTH the L rear surround AND sub disconnect issues, despite a manufacture date that should have meant it was passed the issue. At one point, I had to repair everything manually but other than that, the disconnects were varying lengths and reconnected themselves. But it was hella frustrating and totally pulled us out of the moment. The Samsung will have true upfiring height drivers (4 channels). The 11 channel ear level will mostly be upscaled from 7.1. The SmartThings app has some of the controls inside it including EQ and channel levels. It boasts a 7 channel EQ but what they don’t tell you is that is ONLY when on Standard mode (which is only 7.1.4 NOT the 11.1.4). When it’s in the upscaling modes to use all it’s drivers (called Surround or Adaptive), you’re limited to 2 channel EQ: bass, treble. That’s it. It does have the two additional HDMI ports but I don’t know how important that is to your setup. They are 4K/60Hz. These also have HDR10+ and Dolby Vision passthrough (an basically unpublished tidbit).\n\nThe surround is quite impressive. But we found that dialogue was a little difficult to hear at times. The voice enhancement didn’t work for us as it made voices sound robotic and pushed everything in that EQ span (other system do this to, but with different degrees of success). Ultimately, I couldn’t get it tweaked so that it sounded good. There was a “hollowness” to the mids that I couldn’t fix or get past. When I tried to use the 2 ch EQ to fix this, the dialogue got muddy when I pushed up the low end (trying for more warmth) and was just to thin for me without it. Also, Adaptive mode does some odd things like scramble the L/R height channels so that they are both playing the audio from both channels (there’s no L/R separation in the height any longer). I never did get blown away by the feeling of height above me, even when I tried to use the recommended test scenes and made sure Atmos was playing.\n\nIn the end, it went back. I had heard a lot of negative stories about dealing with Samsung warranty support and didn’t feel comfortable with all the disconnects. My experience is far from unique, there are people who haven’t like the system if you read through Reddit or other forums by, as I’m sure you’re aware, most people love it. The other thing to know is that other than very basic control (like off/on, not sure about volume), there is no smart or integrated control via SmartThings. I mistakenly thought this might be the case.\n\nCheck out this video starting at about 1m 25s. This isn’t a perfect example (and please listen to other examples if you can find them) and I’m not bringing in the JBL to get you to consider. But put on headphones and listen carefully to the two systems. I can hear the hollowness I was trying to describe when it switches to the Q990b. https://youtu.be/_jwxLANnn1E\n\nAs far as the Sonos goes, on paper, you’re getting less. But you’re getting a very different ecosystem, too. The Beam G2 is better than it has any right to be for the size or the price. Dialogue is very easy to understand and for those times when it needs a boost, I don’t hesitate to use Sonos’ voice enhancement. None of the robotic issues that Samsung had and I also don’t notice other audio in the same EQ range getting pushed up like the Q990b. It has virtualized height channels (no actual upfiring drivers). It feels wider than it is. The Symfonisk bookshelf speakers have decent low end (they’re actually a little larger than the Ones or even 100s) and they have nice warmth and clarity. The surround is great. Most of the Sonos surround options (other than the new Era 300) will be more directional than the Samsung w/ it’s front and side firing drivers). It’s not something to worry about - you get great surround. The Symfonisk also have multiple mounting options, thanks to IKEA.\n\nI think most people would say that Sonos has better fidelity in their speakers than Samsung. Obviously, Sonos has its own multi-room ecosystem but also works with Apple’s AirPlay 2. This means you can group any other AirPlay 2 speakers and have multi-room sound that way too (the Q990b also support AirPlay 2 and I think ChromeCast). One thing to consider is that you can upgrade in pieces with the Sonos, in the future. Want to upgrade your Beam to an Arc (say Gen 2 when they release it someday), you can either sell your Beam or move it to a different rooms and keep your Sub and surrounds. Or, want to keep the Beam and upgrade to the Era 300 someday? Just move the Symfonisk to other rooms (now you have multi room audio) or sell them and you’ll have true upfiring drivers and 7.1.4 audio with your Beam. If one Symfonisk dies at some point, you can replace it, etc. Obviously, there are some limitations but you get the idea. If you get the Samsung, you’ll have an amazing system but that’s the system you’ll have. No upgrading the surrounds later and if a rear surround goes after the warranty, you’ll be working with Samsung to to try figure out a replacement. Also, Samsung does very little on firmware updates once the new version is out from what I’m told. Sonos will continue to support via firmware updates (and even new features at times) for years. They have two very different approaches to audio systems and their business.\n\nSonos is also supported by a lot of third party companies and apps offering additional integration. Only you know if this is something you might be interested in. In addition, there is an iOS app called Soro. I’ve used this myself and it’s pretty great. It costs $7-8 (one time) and it exposes pretty much all of the Sonos settings and adjustments to Siri Shortcuts. For instance, you could create a “Night Mode” Shortcut. With a single button press or voice command, you could turn on night mode, turn on voice enhancement, reduce the bass EQ setting by say 3, reduce the sub volume by two. You can create another one that reverses all of this. Everything from the EQ settings to surround levels, sub levels, pretty much any of the Sonos system settings can be tweaked. But it doesn’t have to stop there. Since it’s Siri Shortcuts, you could go further and have it actually turn on your TV, Apple TV, change the Sonos settings, dim the lights, etc. It’s about the most useful $7 you can add to a Sonos system. And I think the cheapest part of the Sonos ecosystem. ;) Also the app is great and features like “Night Mode” really do work well.\n\nI wish I could help you decide. To be honest, I’ve been in the same position as you for quite awhile now trying to figure out the best option for us and our space. We still have our separates system that we’re selling and moving to a soundbar with rear surrounds. We live in an apartment and wanted something with less wires and less complication for my less tech inclined family members. I ended up “borrowing” the Beam G2 and Symfonisk surrounds that we had in our bedroom because I thought it would be interesting to see how they were in a larger space. Except for the couple of weeks trying the Q990b, we’re still using it like 8 or 10 months later. ;) I totally get the attraction to the Samsung system. It pretty much has everything you want in a single unit, it goes on sale regularly, and it’s easy. I honestly thought it would be our dream system. But there are trade-offs. I still haven’t found what we’re going to go with long term. I won’t be getting rid of the Beam. I’d move it back to the bedroom again. But I’m currently considering the JBL Bar 1300 and more likely, adding the Era 300 to the Beam. I may add the Sub Mini and eventually upgrade to the Arc. I’ve just been trying to learn more about how the 300s work with various content.\n\nI don’t know if you’re able to hear either of these in person. It won’t give you a perfect example of how they will sound but it will give you some idea. The other thing is to try to purchase from a place that will allow returns, if you can. As frustrating as it is (and potentially extra work, too) nothing will beat trying the system in your own space. Hope this has been helpful. I know it’s long… Post back and share what you decide. :)', 'jutlax: I’m not OP but I’m currently weighing up the same thing and this post was really helpful. Thank you']

I've bought a Sonos arc a couple of month ago. Very glad for the purchase, it just works seamless with my TV and phone. 

Except a few things:

* Randomly it recognize someone saying hey Google, even sometimes when the room is completely quiet. It happens 1-2 times a day, which is super annoying.

* There is a delay on volume change. Both when streaming Spotify and changing the volume through the Spotify app and when we use the TV remote to change volume. Delay is usually a second or two so we often find us turning it too much down or up and having to adjust again.

* We have scheduled an alarm that acts as a radio every morning 7-8.30am. About once every week it doesn't start the radio, but instead starts an alarm which just continues to ring for 1,5 hour until it shut down.

If anyone have suggestion on how to fix these issues, that would be amazing!"	7	"[""PanicLogically: Hi, i shut my google stuff off, can use a phone to do that stuff, that problem is solved. Can use other smart speakers. I don't like all that anyway.

I have no idea why? Hisense TV"", ""GadgetronRatchet: Pretty much all smart devices accidentally go off during the day, especially when similar words are said. \n\nI'm not sure about the delay on volume change, I know there is a delay when I used to use spotify as well. I don't have the same delay with Apple Music, I believe because Apple Music supports Airplay 2 and Spotify doesn't. As far a delay with TV remote, I've never had that problem. Are you using the TV's ARC or eARC HDMI port for the soundbar? \n\nNever tried an alarm with Sonos before."", 'TVIXPaulSPY: TL;TR For alarm issue, try a different music source to stream from, Pandora is less taxing on internet connection and wifi/sonosnet. Make sure your internet connectivity is good. For GA check for vibrations that might be triggering GA. \n\nYour alarm issue and volume delay might be related. Cause could be your internet/wifi connection. I have had our Sonos systems set to turn on music every day at 6am. In the five years that I have had our system turn on music as an alarm it has only failed a handful of times and played an actual alarm rather than our Pandora station. Every time this was related to a connectivity issue (internet went down, power went out, etc).\n\nGoogle issue, could be subsonic vibrations triggering Google Assistant. Try locating source of vibration.', 'Rallerbabz: Thank you for youf reply\n\nIs it normal also to register Google assistant when there is no noise in the room?

If it's too bothersome you can always disable the microphone while you're watching TV, or not using the assistant. \n\nARC and eARC are the same thing, eARC just allows more bandwidth. I'm not sure why you're getting delay with the TV remote, that shouldn't be happening. At least not in my experience."", 'lifereinspired: This is what I was thinking. If it’s bothersome, you can disable it.

I like to tinker so I was wondering if I bought a portable DAC to work with my iPhone and plugged it into the “Line In” with the Sonos adapter, would I be able to listen to high rez lossless music on the Era300s from Apple Music? Also, I realize that I am listening to Apple Music Atmos now when using the Sonos app, but would I be getting a better “higher rez” experience by plugging the DAC in directly to one of the Era 300s please?  Thanks in advance.

That’s about as lossless as possible.', ""herrmo1: And even if the line in would be active I think the plan to use an additional DAC on the line in wouldn't result in better audio.

By using the Sonos app what is the highest resolution one can get? I am just curious. My hearing sucks anyhow', 'JASelzer: Thank you for explaining that', 'adayinalife: Agreed. Too many DACs / ADCs in the chain', 'chillaban: I believe Tidal on the app supports true lossless (HiFi option), not sure if the other apps do. Apple Music and Spotify all deliver high bitrate AAC I believe. \n\nIf you aren’t an acute audiophile honestly I don’t think it’s worth fretting about. 256kbps modern AAC is so good that the differences are going to be subtle compression artifacts in certain sounds (like cymbals clashing), I don’t think it will affect your listening experience. That notion dates back to those little 10 dollar MP3 players and low bitrate MP3’s which sound like you’re listening to music over a cell phone. \n\n\nToday, the processing algorithms (computational audio) of how to turn stereo into something played by the 20+ discrete speakers between your Arc/Eras makes the biggest impact on your perception of how the music sounds. NOT whether or not the source is 100% lossless or not.', 'JASelzer: Chillaban, thank you for that extensive explanation. Sometimes I just ask these questions because I want to learn about these things rather than truly wanting to hear the highest resolution possible.']"

1680582563.0	03-Apr-2023 21:29:23	Changing the surround level in app with Era 300s does NOT change the rear surround volume.	therealhamster	29	12b8y20	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12b8y20/changing_the_surround_level_in_app_with_era_300s/	"I’ve tested this multiple times with different audio channel checks and changing the level of the surround in the Sonos app only affects the side surround channels, not the rear surround channels.

I’ve unpaired and repaired the Era 300s to the setup and no matter whatever way I try it, the rear surround channels do not change volume.

I find the rear channels much too quiet and there’s seemingly no way to change it. I’m not sure how no one else has mentioned this (unless I missed it).

I’ve done it with and without Trueplay, different channel checks, unpaired and repaired surrounds, etc. The rear surround channels will not change volume unless I raise overall volume which then of course still leaves them quieter relative to everything else.

Please tell me someone else has noticed this. I’m on 15.2 so it’s not like I’m missing a software update.

Set up is Arc, Sub x2, 300 x2. Any help or input is appreciated.

I got my Era 300 as surrounds for my ARC + Sub gen 3, setup, giving me the theoretical 7.1.4 setup. 

I then proceeded to use the Dolby test file to hear all the channel separation.

The Era 300 are both forward facing, being just a few inches behind my couch and close to the wall.

The sound coming from the centre, left and right channels, as well as the ARC height channels is clear and as expected. The sound coming from the rear and later channels, as well as the Era 300 height channels is quite disappointing and there’s almost no separation whatsoever. What I mean by this is that the lateral channels and rear channels sound almost identical, and the rear height channels don’t seem to be firing upwards at all.

The Sonos app was showing Dolby Atmos when playing the test tone, so I would have expected a better separation.

I run the test by air playing the audio to my AppleTV 4K, as mentioned in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/125x4jr/extremely_cooluseful_for_era_300sarc_isolated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1

Is anyone else experiencing this? Can the position of the speakers have such a massive impact on the sound separation?

1. Is it worth it to upgrade my apple tv HD to an apple tv 4k? or am I getting all the sound capabilities through my LG smart tv already?

Yes, it's a small hassle to redo all the pairing and trueplay, but it's really not that bad. It doesn't take that long to do and is totally worth it to hear these things shine the way they were designed to be used first and foremost. I know I'm going to get a lot of great use out of these over the next 5-10 years at least.\n\nI do think they're a big upgrade over the One SLs as far as surrounds go, but 450 dollar speakers with 6 drivers are the definition of overkill for this use case. That said, a week of actually watching movies and not constantly fidgeting with the 300s made me realize the One SLs were not a great surround speaker. The way they would beam every surround effect at me could be very distracting. It's been really nice to not be constantly reminded of a speaker directly behind me with the 300s, but this seems to bother a lot of people because for the price they want them to be the star of the show.

The Arc can replicate a plane flying above the TV but fails to complete that illusion for the back half of the room. \n\n\nFor regular 5.1 content it depends. If you have a room where you have to sit really close to the rear speakers, the Era sounds a ton better than the Ones.

1680550572.0	03-Apr-2023 12:36:12	Initial Impressions: Era 300s vs. Play:5s (Fives) as Surrounds with the Arc	GuitarSuperstar	50	12av6c6	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12av6c6/initial_impressions_era_300s_vs_play5s_fives_as/	"**Previous setup:**  
Arc + Sub (Gen 3) + Play:5s

**Room dimensions and layout:**  
20’ long x 13’ wide with an 8’ tall ceiling

The Arc is located on the 13’ wall on a 2’ tall media console. The surround speakers are placed on speaker stands in the corners of the opposite wall on each side of the sofa angled towards my main listening position. My main listening position is a giant [Jaxx Saxx](https://www.jaxxbeanbags.com/pillowsaxx-bean-bag-pillow.html) (bean bag) in the center of the room about 8’–9’ from the Arc and 8’–9’ from the surround speakers. I can hear the height channel audio from the Arc loud and clear from this listening position.

**What I watch/listen to:**  
I listen to A LOT of music in Dolby Atmos and 5.1 on both physical media (Blu-ray, DVD-A) and streaming (Apple TV 4K). I also watch a lot of films in Dolby Atmos and 5.1 on Blu-ray and streaming. I own multiple Dolby Atmos and DTS demo discs on Blu-ray to test with.

**Play:5s as surrounds:**  
I have been using a pair of Play:5s as surrounds with my Arc + Sub setup for the last 8 months and have loved it. Many people say the Play:5s (or Fives) as surrounds are overkill, but I completely disagree. The Play:5s are a perfect match for the Arc. When I used a pair of Play:1s as surrounds, the room always sounded front heavy because the Arc’s soundstage sounded so much wider and taller, while the Play:1s sounded narrow and small. The Play:5s brought much more balance to the room and clarity to the rear soundstage. They especially sound impressive when listening to music in 5.1 or Dolby Atmos.

**Era 300s as surrounds:**  
Overall, the 300s are an improvement over the Play:5s especially with Dolby Atmos audio for film/TV. The addition of the two height channels and side channels add much more detail to the rear soundstage that is missing from the Play:5s. The 300s do a really good job placing objects at a specific location behind you too. They help create that bubble of sound that you want when listening to Dolby Atmos audio.

**Disabled front-facing drivers:**  
The main issue I have with the 300s is the front-facing driver is disabled when it is being used as a surround speaker. This means it relies A LOT on reflecting sound off of the walls. If your room isn’t set up just right, you can lose a lot of detail and volume from the surround audio. This seems to be most noticeable when listening to music in 5.1. When I listen to the 5.1 audio mix of “Women in Chains” from Tears for Fears on Blu-ray, some of the sound effects from the surrounds are much more muted on the 300s compared to the Play:5s. This really takes away from the immersive experience when listening to 5.1 music.

**Extra channels/drivers, more detail and separation:**  
But at the same time, because of the addition of the extra channels in a 7.1.4 setup, you gain some detail and separation from Dolby Atmos music that you don’t hear with a 5.1.2 setup. When I listen to “Take On Me” by a-ha in Dolby Atmos, the background vocals are much less noticeable on the 300s than the Play:5s. They sound more diffused than clear and direct. But at the same time, I hear a lot of new detail and added separation from other elements of the song that I don’t hear from the Play:5s. On “Rocket Man” by Elton John, the background vocals from the Play:5s are loud and clear perfectly complimenting Elton’s voice from the front channels on the Arc. But with the Era 300s, the background vocals are more faint and become more like ambient noise rather than a vital part of the song. But I am also able to hear new details from “Rocket Man” from the surrounds that I never heard on the Play:5s.

**Inconsistent surround/height audio levels:**  
One other issue I have noticed is the inconsistent volume levels from the Era 300s. Just when I think I have the Surround Audio and Height Audio levels balanced just right with the Arc, I play a song in Dolby Atmos that sounds great and then all of the sudden, a very specific instrument, vocal, or sound effect from the 300s are very overpowering. I don’t know if it’s the specific audio mix of the song or the way the sound is reflecting off my walls and ceiling. But this sudden volume change from specific elements of the song is extremely distracting and just ruins the experience. This doesn’t happen with every song, but I have experienced this more than a few times. I NEVER experience this inconsistency with the Play:5s.

**Movies:**  
I have only watched one film all the way through with the Era 300s. It was *La La Land* in Dolby Atmos. I know it’s not the best film to test, but it was the only movie I could convince my wife to watch with me this weekend. Overall, it sounded great. Dialog was clear and the music from the film sounded very balanced between the Arc and 300s. The highlight of the film was actually the Dolby Atmos “Unfold” trailer before the film started. It sounded MUCH better with the Era 300s.

I was also able to test some Dolby Atmos demos from a demo disc on Blu-ray. With the Era 300s, the “747 Takeoff” demo sounded much more realistic as the 747 takes off from the front of the room and flies overhead to the back. On the “Helicopter Demo”, I could clearly hear the helicopter fly around the room to each of the four height channels. With the Play:5s, the helicopter would just fly from side to side from the two height channels above me. The raindrops and thunder from the “Rainstorm” demo felt even more realistic than ever before. So with these demos, the Era 300s are a pretty big improvement over the Play:5s which leads me to conclude that movies in Dolby Atmos is where the Era 300s will truly shine.

**More testing needed and initial impression:**  
I still need to do a lot more testing before I make a final decision especially with films and music in 5.1 and 7.1. Right now, I am leaning towards keeping the Era 300s as surrounds. They aren’t perfect, but still an improvement over the Play:5s. Even though I am missing some detail from the surrounds when listening to music, the added detail and separation from the extra channels more than make up for it.

I’m not sure if Sonos will do anything different about the front-facing drivers on the 300s, but hopefully they will figure out a good way to utilize those drivers without compromising the sound of the rear soundstage. If they are able to bring out some of those lost or diffused surround elements I mentioned above using the front-facing drivers, the Era 300s will be just about perfect IMO.

And like all Sonos speakers, I am confident that Sonos will gradually improve the Era 300s over time. The Arc sounds 10x better today than how it sounded when it was released in 2020.

**One more thing:**  
When I first set up my Era 300s as surrounds, I angled them towards my listening position and ran Trueplay. They sounded HORRIBLE. They sounded so bad that I was already considering returning them. But after I straightened the speakers so they faced the opposite wall directly and redid Trueplay tuning, this made all of the difference in the world.

I hope this is helpful. Feel free to ask any questions."	16	"['cracknub: This was the type of review I was waiting for.  I too have the ARC, Fives, and Sub(Gen3).

I don\'t listen to music too much in my living room where I have the Arc, Sub and now two Era 300s, but Dolby Atmos tracks have been a blast to play. \n\nI too have noticed certain sounds or vocals being a little loud/jarring in Atmos music specifically, but it\'s only been in one or two tracks I\'ve listened to so far, ""Can\'t feel my face"" by the Weeknd being an example. The first ""oooh"" at 0:42 before the chorus made me jump, but as you said, it\'s hard to tell if that\'s the intention in the mix or not.

Thanks so much for taking the time to share with us.\n\nI really look forward to hearing how 5.1 and even stereo sources sound (we mostly use our system for TV/movies). One person said that on 5.1 sources, the outside drivers fired but not the inside (they weren’t clear on whether the height driver was also active). This really concerned me. It seems that 5.1 video content is mostly encoded in 3F2M/LFE (so FR, C, FL, 2 side surrounds, plus LFE/sub) but it can also be 3F2R/LFE with the only difference being 2rear surrounds vs side surrounds. Is there any way you could test this sometime? I’d hate to find out that they also don’t use other drivers. I was under the impression that both the inside & outside drivers would be used in 5.1 audio sources and maybe even the height driver.\n\nLastly, I know this is probably a long shot but I just thought I’d mention it. I have Beam G2 plus 2 Symfonisk bookshelf surrounds. Since the update to 15.2, I’ve also had these weird moments where some piece or two of the audio suddenly (and rather disjointedly) gets louder for a second or two them stabilizes and returns to normal. It’s a little disorienting. It’s happened a handful of times the last few days since updating and I never noticed it before. I’ve been thinking I was going crazy and not trusting my ears. I could be a fluke or, maybe a bug in 15.2? It just made me wonder whether it’s an Era issue or an app bug that affecting other speaker setups, too?\n\nThanks again for all of your efforts!

While I'm sure this is affecting sounds on the right side somewhat, I still notice plenty of sound effects on that end of the room. Outside of bouncing sound off surfaces, the physical design of the speakers and their processing seem to wrap sound in a way that a lot of audio still comes out the top and other side of the speaker, even when it's the outside driver firing. A lot going on inside these boxes, for sure.\n\nI tried angling the speakers toward the MLP, same as you, so that the right outward firing driver would hit a closer wall, but everything still sounded better when I faced them straightforward despite the shortcoming I described above."", ""beginningatlast: Great review.

Very satisfied.	endcycle	1	12av4g1	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12av4g1/arc_sub_mini_2x_era_100s_and_a_port_for_library/	"Just wanted to throw out a post describing my setup and review in case anyone is considering anything similar.

&#x200B;

  
My use case - 65"" Sony Bravia with an Apple TV., medium sized living room. Started with JUST an Arc, and was impressed by the pseudo-surround effect of it. Really surprising how well that worked but.... well, I wanted more of course.

&#x200B;

Purchased 2x ERA 100s for rears and a sub mini, and after running the tuning thought it sounded fine. Bumped the rears up 1 notch and the sub up 2, and I'm really satisfied with how great it sounds. Made sure to setup the music setting for surround as FULL. I will say that down the road I might be tempted to spring for the ERA 300s and repurpose the 100s to other rooms for solo duty. 

&#x200B;

I also snagged a PORT to go into my library - currently run a Monoprice tube amp with a Rega RP-1 turntable into a pair of Tekton USA mini-lore monitors with a sub hidden behind a couch. This is where it got interesting to me, because it really shows the difference in how things sound on the 2 systems.

&#x200B;

The Port through the library system sounds very clean and true to the music source. Very clear, very accurate. The living room surround setup, on the other hand, feels a little enhanced. Warmer and richer, if that makes sense. I definitely prefer the Port / amp / speakers setup for music listening on its own. It doesn't sound quite as good as vinyl through, but that's a preference thing for me more than anything else.

&#x200B;

Bottom line for me: 

Arc+minisub+era100 surrounds = killer

Port as an addon for an existing component system = perfect

&#x200B;

I think the ONLY complaint I really have is price, but the quality is way up there so far."	0	[]

I've never had a surround sound set-up before, and I'm looking to get opinions from people who have done a similar thing with their beam. 

Ultimately, I know the only way I'll be able to tell if it is worth it is by taking the plunge and trying myself, but seeing as it'll be an extra 350- 400 quid, want to get as good a gauge as possible before I commit.

Have you done this before? What were your impressions, if so? And would you say generally there is a significant difference going from standard TV speakers to a surround set-up?

I also have a roam in the bathroom because of water resistance and it is also taken on the patio. Currently we just play music through them all via the app and apple music/spotify/amazon music. Looking to add an Arc and Sub Gen3 to the mix. This would be connected with an AppleTV 4k and a 4k Sony TV and based on ports, it would be Apple TV to 4k/120 HDMI into TV and out the 4k/120 eArc HDMI to the Arc since it has one HDMI port. I hope I am being clear of what I am asking, if not ask me. I'm using some words loosely and just making sure that tying some to the TV doesn't limit functionality outside of movies or even in movies. My questions are:

&#x200B;

1. Can the One gen2 in the kitchen move to the living room and they are the pair of rear channels? I'm thinking yes, but keep seeing one SL mentions. I would replace the one in the kitchen with another as we are going for the ""whole house"" sound for music.
2. If I want to use Apple Music on the Apple TV because you can do music videos, can other speakers in the house be enabled for whole house music outside of the arc/sub/rears for home theatre?
3. When not watching something that has good sound/surround sound and uses the arc/sub/rears exclusively such as just a baseball game or the news, can the sound that is piped into the Arc/sub/rears also be extended to other Sonos in the house so you could hear it when in the kitchen making dinner for example? Would this also work for a movie or similar that took advantage of the home theatre setup and aspect or would this break the quality of using Atmos and having ""surround sound""? Trying to make sure sound output from the Apple TV is not just limited to the speakers that make up the ""home theatre"" part of the setup."	5	"['GadgetronRatchet: 1) Yes, the One Gen2 can pair with another One or One SL as a pair of rear surrounds with the Arc. You need to have a pair of Ones though, you can\'t get rear sound with just 1. \n\n2) Yes, the home theater will be capable of playing Apple Music through AppleTV4K, and then you can group the home theater with the other speakers in the house for whole home audio. \n\n3) Yes, I do this all the time when watching sports when I\'m not able to just sit on the couch and watch the whole game. You can group the audio from the TV to the other speakers in the home, like a kitchen. You will get the audio of the sports game on any Sonos speaker. Doing this leads to kind of an ""echoing"" sound, imagine being in a sports bar during the Superbowl and every TV is playing the game with audio, but some are further away from you than others, you get this echoing effect. Because of this, you would not want to do this grouping for movies as you\'ll likely end up with the echo effect that you wouldn\'t want when watching a movie.', 'Significant_Break853: In regards to number 3, if you use AirPlay 2 to play audio across different rooms from the AppleTV, then I believe it will be in much better sync than when using the Sonos app to play across rooms I am not certain, but I believe most Sonos speakers support AirPlay 2.', 'jasunto: Thanks. I appreciate your feedback on this. I wanted to confirm these use cases before jumping in and sounds like everything should work the way we want.', ""GadgetronRatchet: This may be true! But for me it's not really the sync that causes the echo effect. It's the distance and walls, too many surfaces the audio bounces off of before it gets from one side of the house to the other. \n\nThe best way I combat this, is to just turn down the volume in the room that's far away much lower than the room I'm currently in.""]"

Been weighing this up a lot over the last few days.

Should I replace my foces as rear surrounds with Era 300s? What are the pros and cons of this set up?

Spoke with local Sonos specialists about benefit of any of dealing out Fives fired ERA300 and they said no, not a good move.', ""Comfortable_Ad3005: The 300s are going to be better surround speakers than the fives for multichannel and Atmos movies. They do a much better job at spreading out the soundstage rather than beaming audio directly at your listening position, which makes the overall surround experience more immersive, plus you get great height effects in both Atmos and 5.1/7.1 formats.\n\nIf you're focused mainly on stereo music playback with your home theater and don't watch many movies or can't play Atmos, then changing from the fives probably won't make much difference. In fact you may dislike how the Era 300s handle stereo music with their front facing driver disabled when paired as surrounds.\n\nIf you have the funds, I would get the Era 300s and use your fives as a standalone stereo pair as you were thinking. That's going to be a way better stereo experience than having them setup behind you imo."", ""GadgetronRatchet: Assuming you have the TV, and soundbar setup that supports Dolby Atmos, yes you should absolutely replace a pair of Fives as surrounds with Era 300's.

I am currently considering mounting my Era 300s instead of using the stands to improve the space.

Roughly a week ago my morning alarm sounded absurdly loud, and since that time any music I play needs to have the speaker volume turned to the lowest possible setting to have it not be far too loud. 

Previously (with the volume limit set on each speaker to balance them) I could set Apple Music volumes in the range of 10-20 in the sonos app and that would be adequate. Now, I have to literally set it on the minimum volume setting for it to not be excessive. 

I halved the volume limit on every speaker in my system to help make it a bit quieter, but even now setting the volume to 10 is way, way too loud. And as a result, when watching tv or using other services I need to crank the volume up to 50 or higher to be audible because the source volume for all services except Apple Music remains unchanged.

Previously, this particular TV had NO support for HDMI-enhanced Audio Return Channel (HDMI-eARC i.e. it was HDMI-ARC only). It is currently connected to a 2019 [One Connect Box | Samsung Australia](https://www.samsung.com/au/support/tv-audio-video/ports-one-connect-box/). There is also no explicit mention of HDMI-eARC capability in [the eManual](https://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/202208/20220802172156390/MUSDVBADR-4.0.5_EM_MUSE_ASIA_ENG_220111.0.pdf) as well, and even Samsung Support articles mention 2020+ models have eARC.

However, with the 1401 FW update, I was able to use HDMI-eARC in the Expert Sound Settings.

So, who knows, check your firmware for your Samsung TV, you might not need to buy a new TV for HDMI-eARC.

I have a Sonos Five I am mega pleased with and was originally thinking on a second, but a huge investment + my girlfriend will literally murder me at this point.

I have a big room with Sonos Five next to my TV and turntable while I sit 1.5 2 metres away on my pc and working. I love blasting metal and it is fine but I feel like spending 200-300 dollars - should I add a Sonos Era 100 behind me on the table for bigger sound? Am I wasting money?

I have a lot of Sonos products from my old house including (2) Playbar, (2) Subs Gen 2, (6) Play 5 Gen 2, (10) Play 1 (Don't know Gen, but older) and (1) One.

I just added two (paired) Era 300 and a Move.  I also reset the entire system.  Removed everything and set up a new network.  I was having serious connectivity issues.  Sound bouncing from one speaker to the next, dropping, different content on different speakers when I did not assign it, Spotify songs skipping etc.  System was a wreck.

After I rebuilt the system, I was still having issues.  I let it sit for a day or two and it seemed to get better.  I have an EERO mesh network, four nodes.  One wired.  I have one Playbar connected to a wired connection.

Questions:

1. Sonos lists three options for network, any benefit to a particular one.
2. Does the network get better as it functions more?
3. The Era 300 specifically asked to connect to my EERO wireless network when I set them up, do they not use the Sonos mesh network?
4. Should I just begin upgrading to 100/300/Arcs? 
5. Do the speakers, particularly, wireless functions go bad after time?
6. Am I trying to do too much?  If I upgrade, I will pair down the number of speakers.  The only reason I have so many is because they were taken out of the old house.

What am I missing?"	6	"['One_Series654: As I understand the new era 100 and 300 are not supported by the Sonos mesh network.', ""Noobgamer0111: >Sonos lists three options for network, any benefit to a particular one.\n\nWhat do you mean by this statement?\n\nDo you mean over WiFi (worst case), a mixture of Wifi and Ethernet, or Ethernet (best case)?\n\n>Does the network get better as it functions more?\n\nSonos is highly dependent on solid network infrastructure.

Most of the time I watch via Amazon TV Stick (the 4K version, if that matters) or via laptop (only with Sky X) connected with HDMI on streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney and Sky X. Unfortunately, I have the problem that every now and then the picture goes black, the sound stops, the projector then says something like ""Searching Input"" and the picture reappears after about 10 seconds and the sound reappears after about 30-45 seconds. The whole thing doesn't happen that often, I would say on average about 1-2 times per 4-5 hours of watching. Yesterday, however, I was watching something on Sky X with friends via my laptop and it really did happen every 20 minutes, which is of course not so much fun. The first 1-2 times the sound continued as described above, but after that the sound always jumped back to the laptop and I don't know if it's because of the Sky X app on MacOS, but I always have to restart Sky so that the sound jumps back to the source selected in the settings, in this case the BenQ. 

HDMI 1 is the Arc-capable input, which is why the Sonos is connected there.

tl;dr: My BenQ W2700 in connection with the Sonos Arc has repeatedly short black screens with even longer interruptions of the sound.

Does anyone know the problem or could help me?

Thus movies with Atmos tracks do not trigger the Atmos label on the Sonos ""Now Playing"" view, just the LPCM 7.1 label, and this is why there is no _mindblowing_ height sound: there is no height information as it is lost during transcode.

Blurays are mainly TrueHD or DTS-X (unsupported by AppleTV), while streaming services use mainly Dolby Digital Plus Atmos (supported).

This is an Apple TV limitation, and video players cannot fix it until Apple changes their mind and allows passthrough for TrueHD or DTS-X.

Source: https://support.firecore.com/hc/en-us/articles/217735707-Audio-Options-tvOS- scroll down to ""What about Dolby Atmos and DTS-X?"".

According to the infuse documentation you can get Atmos if your audio tracks are in Dolby Digital Plus, and [the Internet states](https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/zsry3f/apple_tv_4k_dolby_truehd_with_height_channels/) the Nvidia Shield 2019 does support Atmos passthrough in all their TrueHD glory, but I don't have one to verify that.

To sidestep this,  use an ""earc atmos splitter"": these basically split your hdmi-in from the Apple TV into hdmi-video (goes into the TV) and hdmi-audio (goes into the Sonos soundbar), bypassing all TV processing and piping untouched audio from your player to the soundbar.\n\nQuick google searches to give you a better picture: the name brand you\'ve seen mentioned in this sub frequently https://www.hdfury.eu/shop/hdfury-arcana/ and a cheaper alternative that at least for me works extremely well https://feintech.eu/collections/hdmi-audio-extractor/products/feintech-vax04101-hdmi-earc-pass-switch-4x1-for-soundbar\n\nThese are pricey, but basically your only options if your TV is being stubborn or doesn\'t have full eARC slash does not support Atmos passthrough.', 'chillaban: Video compression has gotten super good these days. There’s been movies where I have the blu ray and the iTunes version and even on a 85” 4K TV the only way I see a difference is pausing and going up there to inspect it. Most people who have experienced both the TrueHD Atmos and streaming Atmos versions say the TrueHD one sounds better. \n\nIn terms of audio delay, that’s a challenging problem with many different reasons. If your TV doesn’t support eARC, it’s basically not a solvable problem. With eARC, there may be a set of options in your TV sound settings that help. Usually you want to enable “bitstream” or “Passthrough” options in your TV settings. Some TVs (Samsung in particular) have a sound delay slider which defaults to 120ms for some weird reason.', 'None: [deleted]', ""steve4982: I've tried from dolby trailers 5.1 TrueHD which plays and shows on the Sonos App and then 7.1 and it doesn't.

I ask Assistant to skip a song or pause the music, and it tells me ""nothing is playing right now"". The Sonos app shows music playing, as does the Spotify app on my phone. But Assistant refuses to register that anything is playing.

This has only been an issue in the last week or so, I'm not sure if there was a recent update that broke it (I'm on S2 version 15.2, I can't see when the last update was installed though).

Has anyone else had this issue? Any suggestions on how to fix it?

Theres a few things i wished sonos can implement.
1. Add multiple customised presets of equaliser.ie when using for home theater you want certain volumes louder , eg action movies or even when your listening to music you want a certain setting.

2.add a family member’s account
I know you can add main account in another phone or u can add account under services but i wished u can add a family member’s separate email and given guest/admin rights to set certain settings.
Sometimes the phone is just not at home ,
You also have another situation where ur brother’s home has a sonos app and u cant play your apple music inside by just using your sonos app connected to your home network. It will detect the sonos settings but require u to log in to the main account. This wasnt an issue before as we would play spotify via the app and connect to the speakers but i notice i cant adjust volumes but the main account allows that.

3.Speaker grouping flexibility.
With the era 300s i wished i can easily ungroup them from the arc for music but u have to totally disconnect them , pair them together again, trueplay them again.
It wasnt the issue before with the onesl as i didnt see the need to unpair them.
Yes i am aware that there is group when there is more than 2 rooms, id like to see the feature where my individual speakers are able to be grouped, not rooms be grouped .

I noticed the surrounds pair sounds alot better when they are not connected with the arc. Yes i understand this is a feature for sonos and i dont mind it as i use it for movies more than music .But i wished there was a way i can select the devices i want , quick pair them use them .

What are some other features u would like to see in sonos app
Other than 
a) enabling front firing speaker of era 300s 

b) bug fixes

c) rollback firmware feature

d) separate height channels for era 300s

e) adding more speakers like your one Sl to your arc sub and era 300s.

f) improvements to apple music in sonos app."	2	"['Driftmoon: I would love quick acces to set the level of the sub. I have it on a different level for music and when im watching tv.

I have read the comparisons out there and still don’t have a sense of which one would be better.   I mostly care about sound quality for a decent size room.  The spatial Atmos stuff is less important to me until Spotify gets on board. 

**Home Assistant**

Also, is Sonos deprecating Google Home Assistant?"	9	"['Momo411176: If spatial is not important to you then definitely don’t get the 300.', 'GuitarSuperstar: The Era 300s are designed specifically for spatial audio. If spatial audio is not important to you and you primarily listen to Spotify, get the Fives.', ""Small_Assistance5944: For listening to music on a single speaker, the Five would probably be better to start with now. Era 300s will make more sense if most of what you're listening to is available in spatial audio or dolby atmos, or if you plan to start upgrading to a home theater system soon. If you're not watching or listening to dolby atmos and spatial audio, you probably won't get your money's worth out of the Era 300s. If you do upgrade to a home theater setup or get Era 300s later, the Five will still be a great speaker to use in another room in a multi-room or whole-home setup.\n\nAs long as Sonos and Google are still locked in a nasty legal dispute over patent violations, the prospects for continuing collaboration will be pretty dim. If continued Google Assistant support is dependent on hardware, that will leave at least one generation of products permanently locked out. I personally found voice assistant integration on my TV and music speakers to be more annoying than helpful. I have cheaper Google speakers separate from my Sonos system and that actually works a lot better.\n\nUsing Google's voice assistant on my Beam and Move speakers interfered with my TV and music sound, Google couldn't get my voice commands right when TV and music sound was playing, and Google voice kept getting triggered unintentionally by the TV or any other spoken sounds. Google's voice assistant also couldn't control any Sonos playlists or music libraries, and couldn't keep my multiple Sonos speakers straight."", 'WizardKelifa: I did a few blind sound tests swapping between 300’s  and Fives as surrounds with some friends over the weekend hoping to come to a clear winner so I could either sell the Fives or return the 300’s.\n\nI played 10 songs all optimized in Spacial Audio through Apple TV as well as through Apple Music via Sonos App (they can vary a little between the two). I paired them with Arc + dual subs. The common response was “they both sounds great” but many could not tell the difference or really pick a clear favorite. From what I could tell, if you liked the clarity and separation of sounds…the better Atmos effect, the 300’s would be your choice. If you like a little bit more bass and rich sound, the Fives would be your pick.\n\nMovies seemed to be about even as well or “couldn’t tell the difference”…but I tend to favor the 300’s as the Fives can be a little overpowering as rears but others preferred that experience from the Fives. I was surprised that the Fives “sounded” like it plays Atmos similarly and dare I say “better” in some cases than the 300’s. For references, I played scenes from many of the popular scene/movie choices- Top Gun Maverick, Dune, Blade Runner 2049, 6 Underground, etc. Note: all of this was streamed and did not do any Blu-ray tests, which maybe would take the 300’s to another level?\n\nBtw- in a stereo setup the Fives were the unanimous favorite…which is to be expected. \n\nAll this being said, I think I’m hanging on to both and either keeping them in a side-by-side setup if I can keep it aesthetically pleasing and toggle between the two from time to time or move the Fives to another room. Funniest thing was that a couple friends preferred it when I had all speakers running at once (300’s as surround + Fives in stereo) which to me was complete overkill but to each their own.\n\nGood luck deciding…because I certainly can’t!', 'foremanxc: Personally, the era 300.

I'm quite new to this subreddit and thinking about switching my music listening setup from passive speakers + streamer + amp + phono pre-amp to Sonos ecosystem setup as usually like to listen to some music while cooking (another room/space) or while working alongside my stereo setup, share it also with my fiancé in another room (have pleasant sound also in another room).

For start, for living room/kitchen openspace I plan to get Sonos Beam (Gen2) as would like to improve TV sound a bit as well. Potentially in the future will but there Sonos Sub Mini and maybe dedicated Era100/Era300 for kitchen area to have some speaker directly towards me, but those are some things for upgrading my experience later.

So there is plan to put some more shelves in office room. So having big bookshelf speakers on separate speaker stands (pulled away from wall because rear ports) with cabinet for turntable/LPs/amp is another inconvenience. My idea is to leave my Rega turntable + phono stage and add stereo pairing from Sonos. Initial thoughts was about getting 2 x Sonos Five, but as I'm not listening music very loud there (and usually it was louder when i was in another room, but with Sonos ecosystem that will no longer be issue), starting to consider 2 x Sonos Era100 + Sub Mini which I believe should give me enough richness in mids and treble from Era100 and lower bass going to Sub Mini. Also attached picture my room dimensions (quite small room) to have some impression where I plan to locate those speakers.

Long story short, just wondering what potentially will sound better 2 x Era100 + Sub Mini or 2 x Sonos Five? I guess there is more people with stereo Five setup as they are on the market quite some time, but interested in any experience in similar setups. Unfortunately, I don't have place where I could audition them, but plan to send them from official site, so that in case of not being satisfied, will change something in config.

A lot of people have recently adopted Apple Music and Dolby Atmos with the ERA 300s releasing.

Many times, Dolby Atmos songs sound great on the 300s but pretty bad when Apple still tries to play the Dolby Atmos version of a track over Bluetooth if you're listening in headphones, the car, a non-Sonos speaker. This usually sounds worse.

If you go into the Apple Music settings on your iPhone and turn OFF Dolby Atmos, you will get the full Lossless version of songs when played directly from your Apple Music app, but you will still get Dolby Atmos when you play the same songs via the Sonos app. 

This will ensure you're listening in the ideal format without having to constantly flip settings off and on depending on the song. 

If you exclusively listen to music on Sonos speakers then this will not benefit you."	4	"['KrylonxBlue: I would think it’s okay to leave it on for in car if you’re using Apple CarPlay.

I'm moving into a new apartment in a couple months and would love some feedback on a Sonos setup plan for the space. See diagram. We are essentially working with a classic Chicago Greystone floor plan.

**Background** — At my old place, I had a bundle with my ISP where I rented a Beam and a One for a year — call this my intro/trial to Sonos. Through that year I personally purchased a Roam to move about and a Port to use with my Audio Technica turntable. I have returned the Beam and One as the bundle pricing expired and I have been waiting for this move to make purchases.

**Priorities** — **(1)** Quality, whole home audio for streaming music via Spotify. **(2)** Playing records. Vinyl is more about the collection and ritual for me. Audio quality and soundstage are also very important but the benefit of whole home coverage via Sonos has taken priority over running the turntable through an analog setup. **(3)** Google Home/Assistant enabled speakers in each room. **(4)** Quality TV audio but no current aspirations of home theater sound — maybe when we buy a place.

**Dining Room** — This is probably where I am having the most thoughts/debate. I'd like to station the turntable and records here.

* Turntable — My current AT LP-120 turntable is in need of repair and I have been wanting to upgrade for a bit. I'm likely selling that and going with a Pro-ject Debut Carbon EVO or Automat A1 (what can I say, I'm lazy and like the perk of a tone-arm return 😇). I've also debated the Victrola Stream Onyx due to its direct to Sonos capabilities but keep in mind I already have a Port and most of the Sonos speakers now have the line-in option. I see myself probably getting rid of that Port soon. Any thoughts here?
* Speakers — I've been doing a fair amount of reading on here and watching videos. Originally I thought one Era 300 would be the way to go due to its ability to fill the space but the more I research, it probably doesn't make sense since I won't really be taking advantage of Atmos. I now think I am leaning towards a pair of Era 100s as a stereo pair and potentially adding a sub-mini (in time once budget allows). A single Five seems like a great option too but I'm just reluctant to spend more money on an older gen option with all the new options that are available.

**Parlor** — Leaning towards the Beam over the Ray here so that we can have a Google Home/Assistant mic in that room.

**Kitchen** — This is a small space so we don't need much here. The unit will be on a shelf. Instinct tells me to go with the newer tech in the Era 100 but I'm bummed it only has support for Alexa and not Google Assistant at this point. I think a Sonos One will be just fine here. Still a great speaker.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!
