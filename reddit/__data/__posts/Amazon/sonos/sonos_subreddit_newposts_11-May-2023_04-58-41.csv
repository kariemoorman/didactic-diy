Hello All!
We just bought a house and planning to turn a bedroom into a home theater. Its not a huge room. 14’x 10.5’. I currently have an LG C2 77, Sonos Arc, pairs of Era 300’s and gen3 sub.

Sonos recommends at least 8"" from the side walls, but ideally the speakers need much more space than this.', ""MrZeDark: The most accurate placement is behind your couch, aimed at your center listening position.\n\nThis way the inner speakers reflect off the rear wall to emulate 'rears' and the side walls refelect audio to emulate the 'surround' speakers - all of this in a 7.1.\n\nYou will need to play with actual distance yourself to find the perfect distance for Atmos to sound above you - and speakers to reflect properly.\n\nUse this link, to get an idea of what I mean - [https://www.dolby.com/about/support/guide/speaker-setup-guides/7.1.4-overhead-speaker-setup-guide/#gref](https://www.dolby.com/about/support/guide/speaker-setup-guides/7.1.4-overhead-speaker-setup-guide/#gref)\n\nThose rectangular speakers in the bottom are your Surround and Rears - you need to place the 300 inbetween those areas to direct audio where *those speakers would physically be.* This will put you in standard with Dolby Expectations, as you always want to be as close to the standard as possible.  There is no opinion of 'better' or 'worse' - the fact is, that link shows you how it should be for Dolby Standard, period.\n\nNot everyone can get it perfect, just aim to be as perfect as possible.\n\nThe circle speakers are Atmos and if you dig deeper into their more specific configuration guide; Regardless to if the speaker is actually above you or if the audio is reflected it must direct towards you.  So in the case of these speakers, where it's reflected.  You want the audio to essentially be able to bounce down towards the center listening position.\n\nWhen balancing all of this - keep in mind your distances.  Traditionally you want your rear and surround to be the same distance as center is from you.  As well as you want your Front Left and Right to be the same distance from center as you.  This can be challenging in reflective audio (Arc Side firing) - so the most base rule to remember is to avoid setting speakers out wider than your front sound stage is, unless you have no choice.\n\nDolby has excellent PDF's available to review the more granular expectations within their standard, that have some good reads if you're interested.  At the end of the day, all that matters is you aim to be as close to perfect as possible.  As the closer to perfection within the standard, the more RIGHT the audio is.  The sound / volume / eq response, all those little settings will be preferential to your ears and you should make it sound 'good' to *you,* But the speaker placement has no room for opinions; It's either Right, Wrong, or In Between.""]"

I’ve had the Playbase since 2019 and have added a Sub and two Play 1’s over the past few years. I absolutely love the setup. However, just came back from a family trip and the Playbase can no longer connect over Wifi. Turns out after a diagnostic that the Playbase’s wifi card has gone bad and can no longer communicate to the rest of the system, particularly the Sub, even if it’s hard-wired over ethernet. 

Sonos no longer seems to be offering Playbase replacements now that the product is discontinued. They’re offering me a courtesy replacement with a Beam Gen 2. 

I haven’t had a chance to listen to them side by side, but do we think that’s a fair swap? With the sub and surrounds will there be a dip in sound quality with the Beam vs. the Playbase? 

I loved the Playbase because it packed a lot of punch without taking too much space, and I’ve heard the Beam is a little quiet by comparison. Anyone have any thoughts either way or any experience with the Beam and Sub/surrounds together? Not sure if there’s much to do about it seeing as I’m not in a position to spring for the Arc right now but thought I’d ask anyway."	9	['GuitarSuperstar: Since you are using a Sub and surrounds, the Beam will be very comparable to the Playbase. And the Beam will give you the added benefit of Dolby Digital Plus and Dolby Atmos support and a voice control.', 'controlav: You are being offered a free replacement for a device that doesn’t work. Why is there even a debate over this?', 'satinygorilla: I be cautious if you didn’t have the sub but I bet it’s fine.

I have a playbase if you want to trade it for a beam gen 2 lol', 'CuzFeeshe: Beam gen 2 with a sub sounds fantastic.  I have never heard the play base so I can’t compare sound, but Beam is a very nice sounding speaker and the angled side speakers give it a wider sound stage than you’d expect.', 'NattyNate92: I figured the Sub would help to give it more fullness in the highs and mids.

From there you’ll know where the sound bar should be placed and subsequently how many inches the television should be elevated. There are two Sanus mounts for Arc available that telescope out away from the wall. One that attaches to the wall and one that attaches to the television. Either of these mounts will get the up firing speakers of the Arc to clear the TV.

This would mess up the appreciation of Atmos content. Being that this Reddit is about Sonos, emphasizing better placement of sound is the primary function of this forum. Viewing that $2000+ television somewhat elevated will still be an absolutely fantastic experience however, listening to that $2000+  Atmos surround system in a sub optimal position is going to really detract and mess up the sound field. If you’re not really concerned about proper soundstage save yourself hundreds of dollars and go with the Sonos Ray. However that tiny sound bar I think it’s going to look silly with that big TV, but at the same the Sonos Ray probably produces higher fidelity, sound than the built-in speakers in a TV so with that in mind still an upgrade sonically.

Whereas you want the speaker placement playing audio inline with your face because the ""audio is specifically mixed that way"".  Having a TV slightly elevated, personally, I don\'t think it\'s going to cause much if any neck strain. Yes it\'s suboptimal having a tv to high or low,  but it\'s even more suboptimal to have the sound bar way too low. So it comes down to what is the lesser of two evils? Having the sound bar at optimal level and a television slightly elevated or television in optimal viewing position and sound bar in a horrible position.

Yes, the Arc is superior. Sonos Ray is a budget small form factor sound bar without Atmos. Sonos Arc is a premium sound bar that includes Atmos speakers (up firing). If Atmos is unimportant to OP than get the cheaper Ray which will likely sound better than tv\'s built-in speakers. \n\nSince there\'s no measurements posted we can use the PS5 for a scale as it is documented as 15.4"" tall. That room is approximately 8 feet tall. With that in mind the base of the television is currently at approximately 16"" off the floor. And, with that in mind the sound bar being approximately 4"" under the television means it\'s residing 12"" off the floor. I\'m not sure any Sonos advocates would suggest having your sound bar 1 foot off the ground. \n\nNo-one said anything about having tv ""at the ceiling"". So, plus or minus 30"" is about the average ear height when sitting on an average couch. Again using the PS5(15.4"") as a point of reference for measurements that means the sound bar will be placed around 30"" above floor level. Meaning at approximately 6"" above the second shelf. This will only elevate the tv approximately 12""+ from its current position i.e. not ""at the ceiling"", but likely in line parallel with the top of the bookshelves.(mmm symmetry) Won\'t be neck breaking angel like front row of movie theater. lol\n\n Further, I was also advocating for telescoping mounts so the sound bar sits in front of the screen(not blocking up firing channels), and basically can be right at the bottom edge of the television set(not residing 4 to 6 inches below tv). \n\nThis video can help OP with decision making process.

I'll try to recap:\n\nI have 6 symfonisk frames around my house. 4 in the basement, and 2 in our dining room. We came across a website based out of Netherlands to print custom art for Symfonisk speakers, Unisk, and bit the bullet to order a couple last year. They turned out great and I was very happy with the results. The fabric gets installed right on top of the stock art, and as a result it sticks out just a bit from the frame. It also costs quite a bit to ship from the Netherlands to USA where I am, and it took about 6 weeks to receive. Nevertheless, we loved the results of the first 2 we purchased from Unisk and ended up purchasing 2 more to complete the basement set.\n\nA month or 2 ago, a US based company started getting their name out there as an alternative, Symfonx. These take a slightly different approach, where you remove the stock art entirely and replace it with a magnetic cardboard/fabric piece that they make. I had 2 more frames and they aren't in the same area as the others so I decided to give this company a try, and that is resulting in this post. First impressions are similar to Unisk- it's easy to install and looks good. The pictures don't look quite as warm as they did on my phone or computer, I was going for a sepia tone and they look more black/white to me, but they are at least consistent between the two of them and look like they go together, which would have been my main concern. I believe they were just ever so slightly more expensive than Unisk, but also showed up exactly 1 week after ordering rather than 6 weeks, so that's a plus.\n\nIn the end I'd say to go with Unisk or Symfonx just depending on where you live. If you're in the US, symfonx will get it to you quickly and the quality of the product itself is good; I like that it fits so cleanly inside the frame. If you live outside the US you're probably fine with Unisk, it probably won't take 6 weeks to get to you and the quality of their prints was really really good.\n\nFinally, I am Not the biggest audiofile, I just like speakers around the house playing the same music and my wife likes not looking at speakers all around the house so we've settled on having traditional sonos speakers in places it makes sense and a few symfonisk frames in places where traditional speakers wouldn't fit in well or would be too much a pain to install. The point of that being that I can't really speak to if either Unisk or Symfonx affects the audio quality of the speaker at all. I've had Unisk for a year or more now, and listen almost every day and haven't once thought something was wrong. I've had Symfonx for a few hours and haven't noticed anything immediately. But maybe I just don't have special ears that can notice small differences from different fabrics covering the speaker."", 'ShoelessVeteran: I feel like these are all ads', 'lolwattsperkg: Very nice.', ""NoNoveltyNeeded: I mean part of the point of the post is indeed to get the word out about these companies. It's not a paid ad as I was never given compensation, freebies, discount codes or anything else from either company. But one of the reasons I originally bought the Symfonisk frame was with the hope of replacing the artwork later since the art is replaceable. Unfortunately Ikea's options weren't my style, so I was hoping a custom option would be available somewhere. It's been about 2 years since these were originally announced, and I've only come across these 2 companies in the world that will provide this service. And for $70-$80 per print, it's not inexpensive. So as someone who has wanted this option from the outset, I wanted to get the word out to others that may want to use it, and let them know and see the differences, quality, etc from an actual consumer and not just the company themselves or the reviews on the company's website.""]"

In a normal room with 8-9’ ceilings it seems very unlikely to make a difference (if it did, that would be the recommended mounting position).\n\nWhat I’m very curious about (and no one has been able to test yet) is if mounting them like this helps solve the issue of reflected atmos being “lost” in an extra high space or with a vaulted ceiling.

It is still less right, than having space - as reflected audio still aligns with Dolby Standards - however it is superior to have a speaker directed at your seated location.\n\nSo to answer - no it's not proper to put this on the ceiling, it's the least proper way offered as a configuration by Sonos, that is a contradiction to both Dolby and DTS standards for 5.1, 7.1, 5.1.4, and 7.1.4 (not that DTS matters here...)"", ""Travelin_Soulja: It's the more proper way to produce Atmos sounds, yes, but it's a less ideal location to mount surrounds channels, which are best around ear-level. So, either way, you're compromising on something.\n\nAlso, distance is going to play a factor. For instance, if your sofa is very close to the rear wall where the 300 will be mounted, high mount might be preferable because, if mounted at earl level, more distance would be required for the angular seperation of the bounced Atmos sound.  However, if you have the space to place them properly at ear-level, I'd go that route because your surround channels are more important, utilized by more content, and carry more information than the Atmos channels.

Sonos is obviously aware of the issue(s), and has provided articles to aid in its troubleshooting. But one of the things that makes it so challenging to troubleshoot is the number and variety of potential causes, and their often fleeting nature. And even when it seems like everything is addressed, the problem often persists. Or if solved, it returns unexpectedly, starting the whole cycle over again.

So I was wondering whether it would be possible to create an app, widget, shortcut, or even feature of the Sonos app that would systematically step through that troubleshooting workflow and identify the current cause(s).

For example:  


* If non-Sonos AirPlay capable devices are present. it would list their names.
* If another app is playing audio, it would list the app.
* If voice-over is enabled, it would indicate that.
* etc.

I've no idea what the technical limitations are, but I might start dabbling in it to see what's possible. It'll be a long slow learning curve for me in my limited spare time, so I thought I'd ping this sub for any  brainstorming that might speed things along or stop it in its tracks.

Beam and Sub(3) in living room that is adjacent to the kitchen.
I want to add a “best option” Sonos on top of the a kitchen cabinet that will enhance the already great sound I currently have…..
I’m intrigued by the new ERA speakers but I don’t know if that is overkill for my application.    I have also read here on the sub that the Five is a great option to pair with others units for music.  (I would be open to any other options that would fit! ).  I would like for the “TV” audio to play thru this option if possible but the main reason for the addition is more immersive music.   I know I can’t add in a “surround” scenario as a single speaker and would just “group” the new unit in to the existing.  Any and all suggestions are appreciated!"	7	"['zugshad: I think you pretty much hit it already.. the ""best"" option is most likely going to be a Five for the excellent sound, it\'s own bass ability, and such.. Since it won\'t be surround, i think this will be the best option since you will need to group it.\n\nin a group function, I am not sure how well a single 300 will do, but this would be the only option if you were going to care about atmos shows/music, but still would recommend 5 first,\n\nAnother option to consider is the Move, it sounds great and will fill the room and would give you the portability to move it around as needed. \n\nFor budgetary concerns, i\'d got 100 then a One as the other cheaper option if budget is concern, they both will still sound great, just not the ""best"" as asked', 'GarageInfinite5006: Get the Move.', 'EMapple88: So I have a similar set up where I have a living room taking up half of one floor with the kitchen and dining room splitting the other half in a mostly open concept. \nI’ve got a beam + submini + ones in living room.

And I’ve got a Move on my kitchen counter as part of a group for that level, but will pull the Move to the garage, basement, backyard when needed - and that flexibility makes it more useful than a five would be for my kitchen. Just note there were articles a couple months back about a Gen 2 Move coming later this year so if you wanted the latest and greatest it might be worth a wait. \nThe Five is great, for me I’d just want a use case that takes advantage of what the Five offers (i.e. line in for turntable).

1683644258.0	09-May-2023 07:57:38	New to Sonos: confused about AirPlay and Hi-Red audio	case_8	3	13ctrvd	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/13ctrvd/new_to_sonos_confused_about_airplay_and_hired/	"Hi-Res audio*

Hey. I just bought the Era 100 and I really love it so far, but some things are confusing me and I was hoping for some clarification. 

I normally use Spotify but it came with a trial of Apple Music and I thought that, because the speaker uses Wi-Fi and not Bluetooth, I could stream lossless audio. But after reading some stuff online, it seems like that’s not the case. 

I’ve read some conflicting things but from what I gather, Apple Music Lossless isn’t supported on Sonos? I assumed that when using AirPlay, audio would be sent to the speaker over Wi-Fi and therefore have a higher bitrate than Bluetooth, but if I’m understanding correctly, AirPlay converts everything to AAC and so even when streaming in Lossless in the Apple Music app and using AirPlay, the quality is going to be compressed. Is that correct?

Following on from that I started a trial with Qobuz (I guess googling all that stuff is why I got targeted by ads from these guys because I’d never even heard of it before).

My second question is this: From what I understand, Lossless/High-res audio is supported on Sonos with Qobuz (and other services like Tidal). But does that mean I have to start the music from Qobuz from within the Sonos app? If I use the Qobuz app on my phone and then choose my Sonos speaker over AirPlay, it’s going to compress the stream with AAC?

Sorry for the long-winded questions. Hoping someone can clear things up for me. Thanks."	12	"[""GarageInfinite5006: Apple Music on Sonos doesn't support Lossless audio. Only Lossy audio for non Dolby Atmos music and Dolby Atmos music for Dolby Atmos encoded music.   \n\n\nThe Era 100 doesn't support Dolby Atmos music however you can stream Lossless music through the following services through the Sonos app:  \n\n\nAmazon Music (Up to 24-Bit 48 kHz) using the FLAC format  \nDeezer  \nQobuz (CD Quality) (16-Bit 44.1kHz)  \nTIDAL (CD Quality) (16-Bit 44.1 kHz)   \n\nYou can also use TIDAL Connect through the TIDAL app to connect the Sonos speaker.   \n\n\nHope this helps!"", 'Akatrielaiic: That sadly is the case. Apple still isn\'t supporting lossless through airplay. That is not Sonos\' fault. Currently the only way to get lossless audio is though Apple TV 4K connected to a tv with passthrough and HDMI e-arc connected to a beam or arc. pretty messy if you ask me. I do hope that apple will wake up and solve this ""issue"".\n\nMaybe there is a way with dongles: era 100 supports line in through one but you have to buy also a dac to connect the phone to it .\n\nSince a few weeks they added support to Dolby Atmos from Apple Music to sonos system though the sonos app. This should mean some kind of direct streaming but I have not found any int if this also mean that Atmos and non Atmos songs are now lossless though the sonos app. Still I think there is an improvement over airplay.\n\nabout you 2nd question yes, as of now airplay will always compress the stream', 'denleschae: I had a conversation with a developer from Rogue Amoeba about audio quality when it comes to using Airplay because I wanted to use my iMac audio interface as a bridge to send turntable audio to my Sonos system.

1683640581.0	09-May-2023 06:56:21	Introducing Keith, our new Sonos emissary!	BigWesternMan	313	13cqowa	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/13cqowa/introducing_keith_our_new_sonos_emissary/	"For over a decade, this sub has grown from humble beginnings to the place it is today - where over 222 *thousand* people have come together to share their love for home audio and the Sonos ecosystem. Today, I’d like to introduce you to our newest member, Keith.

Keith joins us direct from Sonos, where, after his tenure operating in their support centre, he now operates as their Social & Community manager, and he’ll now be spending a lot of his day lurking around the sub, trying to chip in and be helpful where he can. This means you might see him chipping in on troubleshooting posts, or recommending the best speaker/s for a given room, or maybe even giving you kudos on your sick multi-sub surround sound setup. He’s here to both lend an official hand where he can, but also to listen to us, too. 

Keith is:

*  A human being with feelings, friends, and family, just like you. Let’s continue the great community spirit of the sub and be nice to each other, even our newest corporate friend.
*  A long time Sonos fan himself - maybe he’ll show you his Sonos baseball cap or home theatre set up some time!
*  Here to listen to what you are all saying; feedback, both good and bad, doesn’t go unnoticed by Sonos

Keith ISN'T:

*  Responsible for that reason why your speakers drop out occasionally. He might pitch in with some troubleshooting tips, but support requests should still go through the official Sonos channels.
*  Going to talk about future, unreleased products - don’t waste your time asking
*  Becoming a moderator of the sub. This sub is still run independently of Sonos, and we’ve made it clear that it’s going to stay that way!

This is something of an experiment - if the sub benefits from an official Sonos presence, and we don’t all scare Keith away with rude language and hammering his inbox, then there is plenty of scope for this two-way partnership to grow - think AMAs, behind the scenes sneak peeks, and more…

So please give him a warm welcome, and keep an eye out for him lurking around the sub as u/KeithFromSonos!

In this case (because I had read it somewhere) I only measured the seating positions on the couch first at eye level and then with the vertical movements, i.e. from the couch and then always up to the ceiling. We sit about 3 m away from TV and beam, the room is about 2.40 m high.

I also noticed the „high channel settings“ (hope I translated this correctly) in the Sonos app for the beam. From what I read this settings are for specific sounds from Dolby atmos audio experiences. I’ve set them now at +7. Unfortunately I couldn’t find any more specific description of this settings.

Also I find for movies the OneSLs are a bit lacking - but that does not mean they are bad, they are fine for what they are.

My reservations from pulling the ERA300 trigger is mainly on suitability of my living room, the hassle of re-drilling/patching, and of course cost. I have asymmetrical living room layout and based on listening to ERA300 in store and looking at teardown visuals of the ERA to determine the driver angles - I can say there are about 3 placement options only for me at least in theory.

If I were to get them, I plan to wall mount the ERA 300 in normal orientation on my living room back wall via the Sanus mounts. The MLP (Main listening position) is about 90cm in front of that wall and the speakers would be located about 164cm on each side of the MLP. The seated ear height is at 95cm. All mounting positions will comply with Sonos 8 inch min on sides and 2feet or move above.

Here are my options:
149cm - Angled/swiveled towards MLP
95cm - Ear level
79cm - Complying with Dolby Atmos guidelines 1.25x max height in relation to Arc height

I know I would probably need to experiment with these arrangements myself and choose which sounds better to my ears but I wanted to ask fellow community members how was their experience experimenting with the height placements of the ERA 300 - do you get better sound higher and angled in or around ear level? Now, would your positioning change if the centre tweeter be enabled in the future?"	8	['vassyz: OP must be single.', 'adayinalife: I’m fortunate enough to have have a pretty symmetrical room which works well with the 300s, recently one of my friends purchased them as well and he has a room similar to yours with one wall close and an open area to the other side.

Now you do get a bubble / surround feel but having listened to both its quite obvious that these definitely have an optimal placement / room layout. Not trying to deter you, but more of an observation that compared to One’s (which sound great in most scenarios due to their uni-directional layout) these definitely are definitely harder to get right.', 'No-Efficiency-4055: Nop...', 'v5point0: My setup is an Arc, Sub Gen3 and 2 One SLs - 5.1.2\n\nLiving room is about 375sq ft\n\nI am seated about 360cm from the Arc\n\nArc is at a height of 63cm from floor\n\nMy ear position seated is 95cm from floor', 'v5point0: Thank you so much for sharing.

I currently have the Beam that’s connected to my TV (via HDMI and located to the left of the TV for various reasons) and works perfectly, and I’d like to purchase a Roam to place on the other side of the TV to balance out the sound (and also use for other purposes.

Question is, will the Roam work well for this?  My main concern is around whether I’ll have to turn on or reconnect the Roam every time I turn on my TV.  The best case scenario for me is for the Roam to be connected to the Beam (grouped), always play what the Beam is playing, and always turn on automatically.  I don’t want to have to do extra steps to turn it on or reconnect it every time I want to watch TV."	7	"['GuitarSuperstar: This won’t work. When you group the Roam with the Beam while playing TV audio, you will experience a slight audio delay from the Roam.', 'swolegandalf: This does not ""balance out the sound"", rather the opposite. If you want surround, which should be the only speakers behind the MLP, then get two Ones, Era 100 or Era 300.', ""Small_Assistance5944: I use a Beam Gen 1 grouped with a Move in my bedroom which works fine. At night I mute the Beam for quieter listening at night on just a bedside speaker. In the morning I take the Move into the adjoining bathroom to listen while I get ready for work and in the shower. The Beam is plugged into an HDMI ARC port with CEC control enabled on the TV so I can control the Beam's volume with the TV remote. I found the HDMI ARC connection with CEC control was essential for grouped playback to work without delay and sync issues.\n\nFor the balancing effect you are looking for, however, you would probably have better luck with a Move placed in the rear. The Move's power and room-filling capability is close enough to the Beam for the two to sound balanced when played together. This would be harder to achieve with a smaller speaker like the Roam.\n\nFor the sound to be well balanced, you also need to be sitting between the two. This would be easier to achieve if the Beam is in front and the other speaker is behind you. If the second speaker is off to your left or right side, the sound will be less balanced. How well you can pull off the balanced effect will depend on your room layout and speaker placement, but almost always work best if the second speaker is right behind you. With the second speaker centered behind you, it will sound more balanced than a speaker off to one side."", 'CTXSi: I have a Beam gen 2 and Roam and sometimes group them for parties when I want to bring more tv sound to the kitchen. Can’t say I’ve ever noticed audio delay. To do what OP asks the Roam would need to be constantly plugged in or on the wireless charger. I don’t normally do that so not sure how the Roam will respond to being constantly connected. Also not sure if it would really balance out the sound as you hope as it’s not like the Beam would suddenly be the left speaker and the Roam the right. The Beam is still going to be acting as left, center, and right. So I think what you want to do will technically work I just don’t know if you’d get the result you are looking for.', 'GuitarSuperstar: You probably don’t notice the delay because the Roam is in a different room than the Beam.', 'ilikeshreddingmail: Thank you for your insightful comments, and testing it out with your Beam + Roam!  Due to layout constraints, I cannot put the Beam under my TV.\n\nFrom some online research I found that there’s no delay when using the Beam + Roam for streaming music, but when you use the Beam for TV, there will be delay with the Roam—would you be able to verify this?  Essentially have the Beam on the left and Roam on the right in the same group, then play TV (I’m assuming your Beam is connected via ARC to the TV).  Is there delay? How’s the sound?', 'CTXSi: Open kitchen/family room. Even standing in the middle can’t notice it. \n\nJust did an experiment with my Beam and Roam trying to simulate OPs setup and I can say that yes, it technically works but I really needed to crank the Roam volume relative to the Beam to notice the difference. Granted my Beam is mounted beneath my TV, not to the side like OPs. I love the Roam and definitely recommend buying one but I think OP will get best experience by getting Beam mounted under TV.']"

-	I’ve tried resetting the sonos app’s settings
-	rebooted everything several times (TV’s, ATVs, iPhone)

I measured the dimensions carefully to get a snug fit. No rattles, no apparent sound degradation, and I like the look much better. total cost was $15 for a yard of fabric from Amazon. I used scrap lumber but if you to buy it you’ll need 7 feet of 1x2 lumber. A staple gun will join both the corners, and hold the fabric to the frame.   It took me an hour to build the pair.

I have ray with couple of symfonisk bookshelf rears, the sound is amazing but when watching  movies the sound effects like explosions or sound of cars seem to be way way louder than the dialogue, and it makes the dialogue hard to hear and I have to sit with a remote in my hand all the time.

I have done trueplay several times, but does not seem to resolve the issue. 

Turning the „loudness” setting off seems to help with making the sound effects less loud and dialogue more pronounced, but i feel that it is sacrificing the overall sound quality by not getting as much bass and detail without it turned on, what are your opinions regarding the use of „loudness” setting for home theater settups?

The assumption is there will be dedicated central speaker dedicated just for speech, separate from left and right speaker so sound is mixed the way it is and soundbars have hard time dealing with that. \n\nFor starters there is a specific option to combat this - speech enhancement. \nAnother thing to try is to turn off loudness, but if you listen at high enough volumes this shouldn’t change anything. \n\nBest way to fix this is to offload bass to dedicated speaker - subwoofer. \nBuying sub mini or sub will free soundbar from doing both sub base, base and mid tones (where speech lives) at the same time from same diaphragm in same drivers.', 'Bigmanjapan101: Off for me with 2xera 300, sub and arc.', ""PanicLogically: There's Dialogue enhancement on the app. You can turn trueplay on off, slide bass down, turn ambient off---loads of settings to fiddle with.

Apologies for a stupid and maybe pointless question.

But has anyone noticed how overly bassy Sonos sounds in small rooms?

Done Trueplay a hundred times, Sub crawl too. 

I am pretty sure that this setup is an overkill for a relatively small room, but i had to -8 in bass EQ and -4 in Sub to get a desired bass response when i can barely but still hear it. Loudness off.

It is normal to go such extremes?

Again apologies for a stupid question, i know that every room is different and preferences may vary. Still i am looking for any valuable insight from people who think and maybe done the same in smaller rooms. 

I must also add that i mainly listen to heavy alternative genres of music and i am pretty sure that this amount of bass is unnecessary.

I’ve been testing it hard for about month now trying to get most of it. With first couple trueplays the sound was kind of ok, but little muffled and vocal/dialogue was too quiet and in the background. For my taste it wasn’t “clear” enough - the bass was there but mids and highs were meh. After 100s of tests I got the results I was looking for and oh man it make a difference! So I thought I’d share what I’ve learned (or more what I did to get those effects), I know that most of you know some or all of those tricks, but maybe it’ll help someone:

0 - for best bass experience try something called “sub crawl”, it’s really easy - for this, position your sub in your MLP (main listening position) for example on your couch, play some track with good bass, get on all fours, crawl and listen. Find a spot in your room where the bass sounds most natural and pretty loud, it should sound “clear” and pleasant to your ear, not “boomy” (not like in a car from pimp my ride). Then place your sub in this place (or look for another if this place is not suitable due to room layout). 

1 - clean your mic before doing trueplay! I did trueplay on my 2 month old iPhone 14 pro and thought its mic had to be clean cause it was new, but I was wrong. Use something like dry toothbrush and get all the dirt out

2 - turn on speech enhancement BEFORE trueplay (after trueplay you can turn it off again if you like, I don’t know why but I was getting different results with it off and on before trueplay and with on I get the clearest sound)

3 - sit in your MLP and do the first part of trueplay as instructed
4 - most important part - for the second part (walking with your phone) focus only on your listening area and space right next to it, BUT when you are pretty close to your Arc/Beam turn your back towards it and point your phone AWAY from it. I assumed it should trick the Arc to think that the center channel should be a little louder and to my surprise it worked as intended. Here’s a drawing with my layout and with red I marked my positions during the process, red arrows represent arm with phone:

https://imgur.com/a/7py4hGR

5 - only after trueplay tweak other things to your liking, I like speech enhancement ON, trebles +3, bass +1 with audio sub +3, loudness OFF (or on if I’m listening with low volume), surrounds +5/6. But all of the above should be tweaked to YOUR liking and needs ;)

Hope it’ll be useful for some of you. 
Enjoy your Sonos."	13	"['DeangeloV: I use to have my sub in the same spot as in this diagram,  but then I moved the sub behind my couch, tuned trueplay and now my entire living room shakes like a real movie theater.

I’ll give that a try.', 'cea002: Very useful, appreciate it.', ""PanicLogically: \\#1--Everyone's room is different.\n\n\\#2--True Play doesn't operate with any impact whatsoever to having speech enhancement on or off.

Oh, and next time doing some tests I’ll follow your advice, fill the room with people and crawl between them ;)', ""PanicLogically: It's largely that. Sonos is designed for the 'every home' style of living room.   There are many other variables I'd try if I really needed to enhance sound beyond what the system can give out. Separate components are really responsive to furniture, wall coverings, windows etc. Throwing down floor coverings, wall coverings, not blocking the output on the ARC, getting the sound reflection right on that array is probably the most important thing. Rears can go against walls behind you or the left and right of your main listening position. I've heard both sound great.\n\n There's plenty of bass when the subs are off actually. I'm hearing lots of people who worry they don't hear their sub, not understanding it's not really going to create thump unless you turn the darn thing way up anyway--the same for the system without the sub. I'm happy you did find really great sound for yourself. The placebo thing is about having speech enhancement toggled before the test--yes that's placebo, it gets bypassed completely when you run trueplay.  Bass positioning is important but I've heard great sub just having the thing in the front of the room or dead center in the rear. It's an expensive system--Sonos--people start out a bit disappointed after pumping the money in, and work hard to get it at a good baseline.  didn't mean to sound so critical. Tons of posters are in the archives that sound like me a year to two years ago."", 'polsko444: That’s alright man, no hard feelings. Audio forums tend to be somehow… harsh. Most important thing is to make it sound as you like it and that’s what I did. I didn’t know about this thing with trueplay and speech enhancement and found it on some sonos forum, but as you said it could be just placebo. Your tips about the placement are important, I forgot about them! To any reading it - appropriate Arc placement with some room behind and no obstacle above is crucial.', ""PanicLogically: I'm in total agreement. I own Sonos, shifted to it from separates. I got it to replace oodles of components, cables etc. It's a simple solution and the sound is great for TV audio and on the sound bar with rears--ok for music. It seems every few updates from Sonos, things step backwards and forwards. Important thing is people here are committed to trying to help each other get better audio out of their system.

Yes, you could probably rip the casing off the beam, wire up some speaker to line level converters, run wires to your sub’s line in (I assume it has a line in - you didn’t say), hope you can somehow seal the beam back up with wires hanging out of it, and then try to trueplay tune it and get some semblance of a Sonos + sub setup.  This is a horrible idea and will likely leave you with a broken beam, wires running all over the place, and questionable sound quality.\n\nUsing an AV receiver will also not help you achieve what you want.  If you need more inputs, stop trying to force Sonos into your setup OR purchase an hdmi input selector with audio extractor + Sonos sub.  If you don’t add a Sonos sub, you won’t have any volume control of the sub.  What you are trying to do will be more expensive than what you want to pay, produce inferior results, and cost you lots of wasted time.  \n\nI love hacking stuff together.  Look at my post history regarding Sonos / symfonisk speakers and wiring up ceiling speakers.  I get it.  What you are trying to do is a terrible idea.  I cannot be more clear.  If you want to complain people are downvoting your post, perhaps take it as another indication it’s a bad idea.', 'j_nak: I doubt it would work, but i have never tried. HDMI ARC on the TV side is for audio output and on the receiver is for audio input.  If you connect the Beam to the receiver’s ARC port (assuming it has two, since you need one for the TV), the receiver will likely not output sound to it. \n\nYou could go optical to the beam assuming the receiver has optical out but you might get audio lag. I suspect the TV won’t output sound from both optical and ARC at the same time but maybe it will.']

2.)Not really related to Sonos..but: Anyone here have the same situation? If so, how do you handle the remote controls? Do you, and can you, set up the Sony Bravia remote to control the AppleTV?

I have 4 sonos Amps 1 gen for 8 speakers in my house in 4 different rooms. I recently have bought some HomePods for the other rooms and really like the automatic functions with HomeKit and that I can ask Siri to play and so on. 

Now, for the love of God I can’t sync my Sonos system with HomeKit and I have found out that it’s because they are to old and don’t have/support Apple Airplay 2. 

I went to the store where I bought my Amps 10 years ago and they said that there is no way to fix this except buying new ones. 

But, when looking on the internet, it seems that I can buy a Sonos Port and work around this problem. Am I correct or did I understand it wrong?

If I’m correct, do I need 4 ports, one for every Sonos Amp? Or is 1 Sonos Port enough? 

Thanks in advance to anyone that can help me out."	17	"['damgood32: I’m not sure the Port gets you where you need to be. If it’s Airplay you need there are much cheaper solutions than the Port ( Wiim mini) \n\nIf your products are 10 years old, it may be time to update to the new Amps. You may be able to do so with 30% off through their upgrade program.', 'controlav: Are your taking about Sonos Amps or Connect:Amps Gen 1?', 'Cute_Classy: I purchased a WiiM Home and connected it to the 3.5 mm jack input of my Sonos Play5 GEN 1. I think it sounds good, and it works with Apple airplay 2. I think each WiiM Home is about $90. I only have one older play5. Maybe only try one to see if you like it', ""TheTigersShare: So, that will sort of work. If you have a newer Sonos device that does support Airplay 2 in your system, you can initiate playback on that device via Airplay and then use the Sonos app to group other devices with that one even if they don't support Airplay. I've tested this with my system (not using Siri though). Any current Sonos product will let you do this, and you can get something like a Sonos One for much less than a Port.\n\nHowever, if you want to have playback happen on the Connect:Amps by asking Siri, this may not work so well. If all the rooms are kept grouped with the one Airplay receiver, you should be able to start playback on the newer Sonos device and have the rest start playing along with it, but you won't be able to ask Siri to play music in a specific room. If that's what you're after, adding a separate streamer like the Wiim Mini to each unit as others have suggested is probably the way to go.\n\nI suppose you could also add one new Sonos device per room and keep each one permanently grouped with the respective Connect:Amp. It would be more expensive, but it does have the benefit of keeping playback and volume controls within the Sonos app."", 'an1h: Thanks! I will look more into the Wiims.

Thank you so much and I wish you the best weekend!', ""TheTigersShare: Don't thank me yet! It just occurred to me that I may be steering you a bit wrong. If your Connect:Amps are 10 years old then they're probably Gen 1 versions, which will only work with the original S1 app. Most currently available Sonos and Symfonisk devices can only be set up on the new S2 app, and then you'll have separate systems that won't be able to interact with each other. I believe the Gen 2 Connect:Amps (like mine) started production in 2015.\n\nThere are some older products that both support Airplay and will run on the S1 app. The Gen 1 Symfonisk products will work, but you'll have to try to find one used. The Sonos One is probably the cheapest option that supports the S1 app that's still available in stores right now.

On the bright side, you should be able to get a 30% discount on new Sonos products through the upgrade program."", 'an1h: Once again, you’re a life saver!\n\nGot it, I will buy a 1 gen IKEA Symfonisk. I have already found a guy close buy who sells one that has barley been used for 90 euros, so that is a very cheap solution to my problem. Gonna try to pick it up early next week. I will  let you know if I succeed (and if not, no hard feelings, I really appreciate your help) :)', ""TheTigersShare: You're welcome! I hope it works out the way I think it should."", 'an1h: Just want to inform that I installed the IKEA lamp-speaker today and now everything works flawlessly and I can play with all the speakers in the house including the HomePods simultaneously. \n\nThank you so much for taking the time to help a stranger out.

After coming across the [past release timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonos) I got tempted to look into what the future could hold for Sonos and here's a little guess. Let me know what you think 😊

ps: With the release of the Era 100 and 300, a lot of people expect a 500 as a Sonos Five replacement. What I had forgotten is that the 5 are only 3 years old when Sonos seem to operate on a 4 year line refreshment schedule. And so I don't expect Sonos to release a 500 just yet as it would it up on the 300's profits."	3	"['Specialist_Sample473: What you smoking bro?', 'ed223344: Never go full Charlie Day', ""khoolianz: I don't know, Sonos seems pretty consistent with their 4-years product lifecycle.

My question is, anyone else using AUHD have a lot of issues with bandwidth keeping up? I'll catch speakers dropping from time to time and sometimes the music just gets thin. I enjoy the difference, but the hangups aren't making the overall experience as enjoyable. And I definitely will not wire with ethernet to speakers.

Whether a patent deserves greater scrutiny (whether an ""patented"" invention is truly worthwhile to be afforded true patent protection) depends on whether the invention is financially worthwhile.\n\nThis is determined by market forces.  Most patents are junk and not worth litigating over.  However, those that are litigated upon have been considered by the litigants as worth spending money to fight over.  Hence the economic resources to evaluate whether an invention is truly worth the patent are appropriately allocated to the patents that the market (money) thinks matter.\n\nSo just because you think the patent system is broken doesn\'t mean it is.

I finally picked up a new LG C1 TV with Sonos Arc, 2 Sonos 1 shadow speakers and a sub to add as a surround sound to the TV. The Arc was easy to link up, just plugged in the HDMI cord to the TV. 

But the speakers & sub are not working when I’m watching DirecTV. Did I mess up and buy the wrong speakers & sub? Or is there a way to connect them via Bluetooth? Any help is much appreciated. As of now, only sound is coming out the arc & I have read that speakers & sun may need to be hard wired as well."	18	"['gregorvega: Did you try to link the other speakers with the arc in the Sonos App?', 'zugshad: so looks like you have the set up correctly, but if you are watching DirecTV, you might only be in 2.1 audio.. when you are watching your show, open the app,,  click on the bottom part where you control volume for ""TV"" it opens it up in the bigger screen\n\nWhen you are in there and the show is playing, what audio format does it come up saying it is playing? Something like Multichannel PCM 5.1, 7.1, Dolby Atmos,  or might say something like 2.1   \n\nIf it is 2.1, that might by our ""issue"" as it isn\'t surround and is mostly coming from your Arc..  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother option, go to settings,, go to system, go into your system, and then down on the bottom you have the EQ and all that,, one of them has option for TV audio (for surrounds i believe) you could try boosting that up for the TV portion\n\nhopefully one of these helps', 'traegeryyc: Did you turn wifi off on the Arc or Sub or ones?', 'feelgoodthreads: Good question.

I just don\'t remember what it says on my TV version of the app.. I know yesterday, one of my apps for ATV4k came back as the MC PCM 5.1 where the TV version of the app said DD 5.1 (might have been paramount). \n\nBut yeah.. just keep an eye on the app at times and see what it says it is streaming at.. test different setups for streaming etc. and looks like you might have got your settings fixed at least as well..   enjoy the fun', 'feelgoodthreads: I heard there’s a way to activate Dolby atmos on the sound bar I believe? Is that done through the ap? Do I need to adjust settings on the tv as well? I’ve already changed audio output to the arc soundbar. For reference I have an LG C1 tv.

I'd like to apologize for the mess with the wires - unfortunately, I can't remodel the apartment and, therefore, I can't hide them :)

I have a strange room layout: black for the walls, brown for the sofa, and blue for the TV.

https://preview.redd.it/rmljw2yqwvxa1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=68bf9554bbc91d2eea412b3929fa484b697d7d3e

That's why the sofa is bigger than the TV, and the TV is in the corner.

Here is photo of corner with TV with Sonos Arc under it:

https://preview.redd.it/yjl4h9g5xvxa1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d4fa25b13b2c459a7db7a77a9558f3801845504

What it looks like from the side:

https://preview.redd.it/4neiif69xvxa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=307d274ba38e6a4c42f1bc2c52c981cac768dbed

I used to have two Sonos One SLs, and they were at a 90-degree angle on the sides (marked with an A), and that was fine. (I also marked the line in blue - it's opposite the center of the TV, for clarity, and green is the line where I usually sit)

But recently, Sonos Era 300 came, and when I put them in the places where Sonos One SL used to be, the one closer to the wall, since the center of the TV is shifted, I sit where the green line is, and the fact that the Era 300 is much closer, the volume was disproportionate, and it was distracting.

https://preview.redd.it/b1rai8rzyvxa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5656372ec1b67a6226c65030742aa23c06950878

Subsequently, I tried putting it on point B, which was a little better, but a little too loud, then I tried moving the couch 1 foot (30 cm) forward and doing a simulated stand behind at ear level, which was even better, obviously because the distance was even greater.

Then I tried to raise them by 2 feet (60 cm) (point C) according to the Sonos guide - it was better in terms of volume uniformity, but the feeling that the sound was coming from somewhere above did not leave me.

Today I tried to lower them 1 foot (30 cm) lower (point D) - it was even better, and perhaps this is the most optimal.

But still, I want to ask your opinion, maybe there are still some good places?

Because after the One SLs that were on the side, and I got used to the fact that the sound ""surrounds"" me, now it's a little uncomfortable that the sound is ""a little bit above"", but in general, I think I can get used to it.

The same ""bug"" of Era 300 for me are the fact that now I had to order a second Sub Gen3, because somehow, I started to feel even more strongly where the subwoofer is located,

Another ""bug"" of the Era 300 for me is that now I had to order a second subwoofer, because somehow I started to feel even more strongly where the subwoofer is, although I looked for the subwoofer with a subwoofer crawl and it seemed to be fine. But this is a completely different story."	15	"['PrintfReddit: How are they oriented? Are they facing your ears or the TV? Did you run Trueplay?', 'Fun_Frame_1070: Put your couch on the left wall.

I play movie surround sound on BOTH my Sonos system and my traditional AV receiver that drives my wired (vintage) speakers. That way I get the best of both worlds! Most important of which is the inclusion of my two massive sound SVS cylindrical sledgehammer “PC-12 Plus” subs! Shakes the entire house if I want!!! Sonos cannot do that. Note my TV is also older from 2016 so it does not have eArc out for my Sonia Arc soundbar. But I accomplish all this using HDFury’s VRROOM 8k. Simple really. Each AV source (xbox, 4k Blu-ray player, Apple box, karaoke player) goes into the input side of the VRROOM switch/arcana unit. On the output side of the VRROOM, the eARC Audio Arcana output goes to the Sonos soundbar. The HDMI AUDIO output goes to my Marantz AV receiver’s “CBL/SAT” input. And the “HDMI TX1” output goes to any one of my TV’s HDMI inputs. Works great! The Sonos Arc plus Era 300 surrounds adds a clarity and higher volume surround element to my vintage surround sound setup while the vintage system adds the otherwise missing depth, richness and earth shaking base to my movies and TV watching. Note: I needed to upload the latest VRROOM firmware (releases early April 2023) for it to work. I just used the VRROOM’s default settings and (after the firmware update) it worked right off the bat. Also the $549 price tag on the VRROOM is painful but definitely a good example of a buy once cry once type of purchase you won’t regret soon after you get past that expenditure.', 'CplSaveAHo: It would be nice if Sonos put out their own.', 'Thebrotherleftbehind: Great, but it will pass through audio to the tv?', 'Thebrotherleftbehind: Multiple inputs on the receiver, and I can use bass shakers and headphones.', ""funnyfarm299: Why?

If using an HDFury VRROOM or Arcana, I would think that those devices’ outputs (be they audio or video outputs or both) would always be in sync automatically.\n\nI will note that my Apple Box will sometimes (though not often) get audio and video out of sync but that problem is 100% sourced in my cable tv signal that comes in via the Apple Box. Nothing else is out of sync. And it is fixed simply by changing the Spectrum cable channel via the Apple Box.\n\nAN ASIDE ON MY SONOS ERA 300’s:\nI am returning them. I finally did a surround sound comparison with my old Sonos One speakers and found no difference in quality of the surround sound! If anything, the One’s are actually more present in the room than the Era 300’s! This is likely due to the fact that my ceilings in this room are 16 feet high and so the upward firing ATMOS speakers in the Era 300s get dissipated AND because the Era 300 front speaker (by design) is simply not ever used or turned on when paired as surround speakers, my One’s end up sounding better in my high ceiling’d room.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Era 300s are paired as a steep pair (no longer surrounds), they kick butt on the One’s big time! But then compared to my vintage speakers connected via the Marantz receiver? The Era 300s don’t even come close, not even when playing spatial Audi sourced from Apple Music! Again, that might be partly due to my high ceilings, but still, the traditional vintage speaker setup just destroys the Era 300 stereo pair so thoroughly that high ceilings or not, they would be useless to me as a stereo pair.\n\nHence I’m returning the Era 300s. Too bad Sonia decided to disable the Era 300’s front speaker when used as surrounds. My message to the engineers at Sonos? Bad decision you guys! I recommend you go back to your drawing board and reconsider that choice.']"

I’m new to this community, and I already need your help :)

I just bought a 3 story house (3x60m2).  Here’s the audio equipment I just ordered for the house:

* level 2: 2x sonos era 300 (gym)

I have access to ethernet on all three floors, but I would much prefer to end up with wireless setup. What are the drawbacks, if any? Can I count on reliable performance with wifi?

If I go down the wireless path, what setup would you recommend? Which routers / mesh networks are known to work well with Sonos? Is Eero a good choice? What about SonosNet? It’s probably good for Sonos devices, but how does it interfere with your main wifi / takes airtime from all non sonos devices?

If someone have a similar setup with One or Era, I would like to know how detrimental to sound quality it would be, if any, to mount it close to the ceiling as shown in picture, I made sure to have some wiggle room for lower mounting.

Second question is regarding this feature [https://support.sonos.com/en/article/set-up-a-google-assistant-device-to-control-sonos](https://support.sonos.com/en/article/set-up-a-google-assistant-device-to-control-sonos), how well does it work?

Ive been using Nets Hub and mini for years, as mentioned I originally looked at One since it has GA, but when Era came around I was enticed by the potential prospect of keeping the Nest Hub and mini's if they can control Era.

Down the line I will be getting a Beam, sub and rear speakers for the TV, and a wall mounted One in the bathroom, probably more if this rabbit hole is as deep as the Philips Hue one.

Looking over the guide above, it looks like I can control all of the Sonos speakers as rooms/groups with a Nest device, Can anyone confirm this?

I just need an easy ""Hey google play music in the X"" room solution. If the media UI with play/pause/volume etc on Google Hub works, that just a bonus.

I have a bit of a weird issue and I was wondering if anyone else had found a solution to the problem.

If I play any game on my Xbox Series X with my Sonos Arc, two subs and Era 300s as rears, on a Samsung QN900B TV, I get a half second audio delay that’s really bothering me. I didn’t have an issue with my Bose 650 Lifestyle unit that I was using before this. I don’t have the delay on PS5. I am completely flummoxed. Anyone else experienced this and found a fix?"	20	['funashimi: Look up in Google or on this sub your Console and TV settings.\n\nI believe, based on your “I dont have the delay on PS5”, it’s your Xbox settings.\n\nSearch in Audio settings anything called Passthrough and turn it on. Search for 7.1 uncompressed in hdmi audio setting, uncompressed is the only way to have zero delay, otherwise dolby atmos gaming will be with a delay.', 'dsaponaro: While I can’t speak to the Sonos aspect of this I believe this issue has to do with the earc of the tv and Xbox atmos output.\n\nI have an Xbox X, Samsung Frame Tv, Apple TV, and HomePods.  I have attempted all variations of settings with all devices possible and no matter what if Dolby Atmos is set as the sound output format on the Xbox there is always a delay.  The Xbox must be set to 5.1 in order for it to play without the delay.  It really is a shame as the Atmos format sounds much better comparatively to the 5.1 setting but it’s just unusable.\n\nWish this issue would be addressed either by Microsoft or Samsung but after researching online both companies say it’s the others fault and it’s been an issue for 1-2 years now.  Doesn’t look like there is going to be a fix anytime soon or if ever for that matter.\n\nWould love to be wrong on this and have someone offer up a fix though.', 'Ampersand_Forest: Folks who said 5.1 was the answer were right. I don’t have a delay on Atmos on PS5, but with 5.1 I’ve got the delay manageable enough that I can handle it. Sucks, though, because I only got the 300 system to give me the edge on multiplayer.

The first thing I did was to Google and go through the sub. I already have pass through turned on. I haven’t been able to find a setting called 7.1 uncompressed, because Samsung TV settings are always frustratingly limited.

I’ve got a Move which doesn’t appear to be turning on or charging over USB-C as the battery indicator and main status light aren’t lighting up. Unfortunately I don’t have the dock as it’s a 2nd hand unit. I’ve tried 2 power supplies which should be able to provide the power it needs (65W laptop charger and a 90W charger from a Philips 346B1C PC monitor, the monitor can provide 12 V/3 A and 15 V/3 A which meet the Move’s spec).

To try and diagnose where the problem is, does anyone know:

1. Can the Move operate without the battery if it’s plugged into power?
2. Can I run diagnostics over the USB port?
3. Is there a way to check the battery level (including with a multi meter)?

I’d also be interested to know if there are other steps I can take to diagnose and (hopefully) fix the problem or if anyone knows roughly how much it might cost to fix.

ThanksSM78

Update 06-May

I spoke to Sonos. It's only possible to run diagnostics over Bluetooth and WiFi so it isn't possible to over USB-C. They couldn't find my speakers serial number in their system to check the warranty status so the returns department is going to take a look and depending on the result they'll either give me a replacement speaker (in warranty) or 30% off a new one (out of warranty).

At home I only have higher end stuff and have generally ignored Sonos for my personal use despite truly appreciating what a solid system it is and how far the sound has come with the recent generations of products. I use a different brand with a multi-room platform.

Now I've moved in with a girlfriend and as I've set up my speakers she's wondered ""gently"" if all of this is necessary. And for the first time in 20 years of amassing a fortune in speakers and kit and feeling  settled in my multi-room system I'm considering selling it and just going Sonos. 

Since the launch of spatial audio I've been sitting in our theater enjoying tracks on Apple Music through an Arc with two subs and Era 300s in the rear and the experience has been wonderful. I can tell where the quality of the speakers falls well short of my systems, but the ease of operation and sheer enjoyment are closer to when I finally brought home my first HiFi system. 

So I'm wondering - are there any audiophile refugees who left it all behind for Sonos? Regrets? Interesting anecdotes?"	50	"['Denslayer: I’m with you. While I never had really high end gear I’ve spent a lot of $ in 30 years pursuing what I thought I needed. As I got older I just got tired of the chase . I started with the Sonos playbar and a couple surrounds and the convenience along with great sound hooked me. I sold everything and have zero desire to buy anything other than newer Sonos items . Also all the hype around lossless never made music sound better to me.', ""nekoken04: We have a decent amount of Sonos gear, but none of it was leaving behind the audiophile systems.  We have original Connects in 3 rooms hooked up to various installs.  I have a Play One in the garage.  My wife has a Roam for going on vacation.\n\nGetting rid of the audio gear would be a 100% non-starter for me.  Heck, my wife recently convinced me to buy another set of used Monitor Audio Silver towers for the rears in the living room.  I'll be finishing setting up her 2.0 office system with the leftover Monitor Audio Silver bookshelves later today.  We literally have an audio system in every room in the house other than 2 of the bathrooms and the laundry room."", 'cozmozmoz: I come from the same side, but specifically headphone/ sound production (Hedd, Focal, Audeze, ZMF, Adam, Genelic, etc). I’ve also dabbled in other wireless audio/ smart home systems most similar having HomePods as an all in one solution. Over the years I’ve tried some Sonos products here and there, but was never satisfied with the integration in my setups over my analog gear, and never really had a dedicated home theatre space until recently.\n\nPreviously, I’ve had Sonos ones, a couple fives, a beam and a roam. The fives were the closest to getting me into the sonos system, but I could never  justify the price over comparable or cheaper monitor/ speaker pairs with better performance. That was until a friend convinced me to listen to his era 300s he preordered. The 300s as a stereo pair really blew me away and was the first time I had that ‘gotcha’ moment with Sonos or even similar products. I immediately got myself a pair and now have an arc and a sub mini to complement my listening/ watching space. Still testing out how usable the entire setup is in my space vs my usage, but so far I’ve been really impressed minus inconveniences that are often brought up. \n\nThe poor marketing of the era 300s having the front drivers disabled as surrounds was a hard pill to swallow from an advertising standpoint. I understand their engenders designed it this way for optimal performance, but did a poor job of announcing this to consumers. The Sonos app truly feels like a perpetual beta with bugs and poor optimization. I also hate how difficult it is to change  or alter setups that are paired together or changes in networks breaking the system. It’s cumbersome at best and defeating to upgrade products from one another. Lastly, the Sonos system is just damn expensive. Is it worth the cost? For me it is to an extent knowing that fleshing out the ecosystem ( soundbar/ surrounds/ sub ) truly makes an incredible experience. But you have to be someone that uses the system enough to justify keeping it over a more traditional or cheaper setup. \n\nWith the era 300s, we’re truly at a forefront of an emerging technology as early adopters in the consumer/ commercial side of special audio. Unlike 3D tvs, I feel there’s a much larger dedication to spatial audio adoption because of players in the game like apple/ sonos.\n\nProfessional use is where it gets interesting. There’s already been a huge influx of requests in mixing for spatial audio from clients and studios upgrading to meet that demand. However, I don’t see it’s adoption being as widespread in the music scene over more immersive experiences like movies, augmented reality experiences, etc.', 'gitbashpow: I have two discrete high end audiophile setups -  a near field monitoring system and a lounge room listening system. \n\nOver the last couple of years my work focus changed and slowly I realised I hadn’t listened to anything much in the past year on either system.\nInstead I had set up a headphone ‘audiophile’ system for my phone and listening to tracks through a paid Spotify account on the go.\n\nAlso during this time I had developed an obsession with Ikea (Zigbee) smart home products and before you knew it, I ended up with a Symfonisks lamp a couple of months ago. Then a Ray for my TV. Now looking to set up a whole house system. \n\nNow I’m listening to music every day at home. I set my alarm to wake up through the Symfoniks lamp, during the day I have music piping through and at night whilst I’m winding down. It’s definitely not the same sound as my audiophile gear, but I’m getting a lot of enjoyment out of these products and frankly I’m impressed at the sound the Symfonisks lamp delivers given it price point.

I sold the amp, the sub and the ones. I kept the symfonisks running into KEF floor standers. It all began when I bought a really awesome UST projector and was really excited about getting the Sonos Arc set up with it until I found out that atmos wouldn't pass through the arc port due to my apple tv set up. So many other soundbars have hdmi in / out ports and it made me realised how locked in to Sonos I was (yes I know about HD Fury). I also realised how much I prefer the sound of my hacked symfonisks into the kef floorstanders vs the ones + sub combo - I just love the sound of very large speakers.\n\nSo TLDR I sold most of my Sonos gear, kept the hacked symfonisks (who's gonna buy those anyway) and am now looking to go to a receiver + floor standing speaker setup. But it's all personal preference, I wouldn't judge anyone going the opposite direction (and who knows I might one day) but the lock-in really got to me.\n\nGood thing about Sonos is that it's VERY easy to sell Sonos gear.

I understand the placement is not optimal, but was wondering if upgrading could cause any issues and make things worse due to Era's top and side firing drivers.

They are more ""future"" proof for you as the Ones will most likely lose support at some point (think someone mentioned this somewhere, just not sure how long from now). and the 100s do sound a lot better than the ones. Peter Pee think did his review on them where he said they were a ""huge upgrade"" to the Ones.  \nthe question would be do you replace all 4 with 100s, or just 1 pair.

I currently own a growing Sonos setup and I can't decide which path to take regarding the next upgrade.

As of now, here are the speakers I have in the living room / open kitchen which is a single 60m2 area :

Beam Gen 1

2x One SL as rears

1x Sub Gen 3

1x Five

1x Move

Now, I can either get another Five or sell the one I currently have and use the money to get a pair of Era 300. Cost is about the same with both solutions.

I mainly use the speakers for music listening and I have an Apple Music plan (hi Dolby Atmos).

Currently, the Sub is paired with the Beam (+ rears) but I don't mind transferring it to the Five or Era 300 as I don't watch movies that much.

My plan is to have an amp connected to two outdoor speakers and two Sonos era 100s in the main living space. The goal is that anyone on the network can stream music to both the indoor and outdoor speakers simultaneously using Airplay or whatever Android offers.

The amp will be in a closet next to my router, so I can plug it directly into my switch. My debate is whether I should pay for additional cat6 runs to each of the era 100s (they will be \~20ft from the access point). In general, networked products are always more reliable when wired, but I've never had any issues in my personal home with Sonos on wireless so I'm wondering if it's necessary.

One point of confusion I have is around Sonosnet. I've read that Sonosnet is created when you have one device wired to the router, which then creates it's own wireless network. Is the Sonosnet wireless network it's own SSID? Can someone connected to the main SSID also use airplay to stream to all the speakers or do they have to use the Sonos app? 

Instinct tells me to just hardwire all the speakers, but I would appreciate some guidance around this sonosnet thing and the pros and cons of using an all wireless vs. mixed wired/wireless network.

FWIW my network will consist of Cisco Meraki router, switch, and WiFi 6 access point. The AP will be in a closet in the center of the house, which is only \~1700sqft. I don't expect wireless coverage or congestion issues, but you never know."	1	['toodeephoney: Properly configured wired is always the best.']

You can only use HDMI ARC with HDMI-CEC (LG calls it SIMPLINK) enabled and if it is enabled it will automatically default to the HDMI ARC connected speaker/receiver.

i'm quite new to sonos. i have a ray and two symfonisk bookshelfs in my small (3m x 3.5m) living room. when i first listened to the system i thought there was far too much bass!

to get the system sounding close to listenable i used the following settings:

bass: -10

treble: +10

loudness: off

i thought it was very unusual that i would have to use such extreme eq settings just to get the system sounding nice. now i have just seen peter pee's recommended settings for  beam (with surrounds)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoUnwUTTVWw&t=969s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoUnwUTTVWw&t=969s)

where he recommends setting bass to -9

(i cannot find any of his recommended settings for the ray)

so maybe i am not too far off. what is everyone's take on this? anyone else find these things an order of magnitude too bassy and have similar eq settings to mine?

i should add that i have not used trueplay yet as i don't have an ios device currently."	7	"['damgood32: I have beam + sub mini + play 1s in my bedroom and I have bass and treble at 0.

It was connected from the Digital Output (Optical) of the Connect to the Digital Input (Optical) of the Denon.  The volume setting needed on the Denon was relatively similar to that for similar volume levels from other sources.  The newer Port does not have an optical-type digital output, but rather a Digital Audio Coax output, which then I connect to the Digital Coax (Coax 2/Aux 2) on the Denon.  But is seems that to get the same level of volume out of the Denon, now I have to crank the volume control to quite a bit higher.  I can tweak the source level for that input on the Denon, but it doesn't seem to make that much difference.  Any thoughts?  I am also planning to send an inquiry to the Sonos support folks, but I haven't tried to do that yet.	1	['coljediv: Disregard my post.  I was trying to do too many things yesterday, so apparently my aging brain was tired.  I had the Sonos line-out setting at Variable, whereas if I set it to either Fixed or Pass-Through it works the same way as the old Connect device does.  OK, now onto my other question in a separate post.']

I just moved from a small apartment to a semi-detached house - and I'm dreaming of setting up an audio setup that plays all over, is customisable (easy to choose which speakers are turned on while playing from Spotify), AND hopefully got the possibility to have a speaker on our terrace. 

Sadly - I also don't want too much bass - so a sub is out of the question (neighbours have already complained ). 

I'll try to portray the place: Everything will be centered around the first floor; which is a rectangular and large area. The kitchen is on the far ""right side"", and the living room to the far left side. Terrace outside of the living room. TV at the living room to the far left side. 

I've recently started researching Sonos - and I'm liking the idea of having a Beam 2 at the TV to the far left side. And i'm looking at x2 Era 100s, or 300s or One's (no clue yet); one at the kitchen pointing left towards the living room, and one somewhere in the living room pointing right (probably turned of during movies). And I have no idea what we could have outdoors at the Terrace. Might also want something upstairs at our bedroom.

1. Any ideas for a fitting setup? I really appreciate any answers, and I'll read everything. 
2. It will be some weeks until we have WiFi. Will the setup work without it?

Or roam for cheaper if the area isn\'t too big,, we use our Roam outside on the patio or our gazebo and it is plenty, ,but the Move will sound better and would be my preferred choice.\n\nAs for wifi,, are yo meaning you wont have internet?

I don’t think surround is the way to go for our living room, but I might reconsider down the line! \n\nThe roam or Move, is it possible to install in the ceiling outside with a power cable, and use it as a “regular” speaker together with all the others? \n\nCan you even play atmos music through Spotify? I have tons of playlists there, so that would be the most important source of sound.', ""zugshad: you would just need to find a way to mount it or place it so that you could provide power. The roam doesn't have a handle and the one of the move is like a indent into it that you grip, not sure you would want to use that as a mounting point but might be able.  Maybe get a stand or mount a shelf of sorts to sit it on, but as long as the cable reaches, then yes,, you could just leave it outside like a regular speaker as they are waterproof/resistant\n\nAs for atmos on spotify, i can't recall as I left them a long time ago.. I went to Amazon unlimited due to the atmos as they had way more options for a lot cheaper.  i have been using apple music lately since got it for free and thinking I might prefer it, not sure yet\n\nas for the first question,, guessing you mean the internet provider is coming in 4 weeks to set it all up right ?  Do you have a router currently? if not, you could go get a cheap router that you could plug in for power and then you could set up a home network for the time being as you need that for the speakers to connect, you don't need the internet connection for them for the most part. once you have the speakers connected on the wifi, just stream from your phone and should be good."", ""Lootfisk1: >As for the speakers..

maybe one of you guys can help me as I am a bit lost here:

Situation:

I have a Sonos One with Alexa and Spotify for music in a kids room. The kids has it's own spotify family profile and it's own Alexa kids profile.

Before that I had a Echo in the room but for various reasons I like to finally achieve a Sonos only enviroment. 

Now for my problem: For some reasons I cannot switch the Alexa user profile towards the kid. No matter what I do, it switches only to the wife or back to me.

I have added another adult profile - but it doesn't let me switch to it as well.

Resetting to defaults didn't work sadly.

Two Era 300s will be arriving today to replace my One SL, and my supplier will provide me with a Sub Gen3 to test for two weeks how the 2 subwoofers will work in my setup (Arc, Sub Gen3).

So I have 4 questions:

1. What is the best way to evaluate the Era 300's in movies?
2. I've seen some debates on how to better evaluate surround music - either with the Sonos App or with Apple TV, where did it end? What is the best way? Since I don't have an Apple TV, I'm wondering if I should borrow one from my friends to test it.
3. What music is worth evaluating in the context of spatial audio?
4. What movies are best to evaluate in the context of 2 subwoofers?"	11	['wiggum55555: Arrival (2016) will get those subs subbing, as well as the 300’s. \nI watched it over the weekend with just one Sub3 and it was powerful enough for me.

I have the Arc soundbar and a big subwoofer, and recently added an Era-100 speaker in my kitchen. I'm experiencing cutouts when playing sound from my TV to the Era-100, but I haven't had any issues before (the problem is only in the era100 the other devices continue to sound without problems). The Era-100 is about 14 feet away from the other devices, and there are no walls between them. I've tried resetting my modem and reconfiguring the Era-100, but nothing has worked so far.

With any audio format, 5.1, Atmos TV or Atmos music, very little seems to come from the inside speakers. I can put my ear to each side of the speakers, and there is very little information coming from the inside speakers, and quite a bit from the outside ones. As I understand it, the inside speakers handle the surround back channel, and the outside speakers the surround side channels. I would have expected a lot more from surround back, and the inside speakers are the ones more directly facing your ears. 

I have run Trueplay, and removed/re-added the Era's as a test, to no avail.

Is this everyone else's experience? I’ve read there are some test tracks around that let you verify what channels are coming out of what speakers. Can anyone point me at those for 5.1, 7.1 and Atmos? And then, what do you use to actually play those test tracks?

The far right is what should be aimed for.  As it also projects Atmos at the MLP. Which is what Dolby wants you to do with Atmos.  If you move beyond just the demo photos and read the speaker placement requirement- they want it to bounce down towards the MLP or be directed at it if overhead.\n\nSo the third image is far more accurate in how the spread of audio would properly enlarge the audio bubble.\n\nYou’ll notice in Sonos official documentation they don’t ask you to place them in the second photo.. there are just marketing images showing that. Similar to the ones… But one’s go just like the 5.1 config set by Dolby and DTS and THX and every other foundational format ever with 5.1.. the only thing Sonos tells you is the minimum clearance from speaker to walls.. and uses awful marketing images.\n\nThe only thing Sonos ever claimed was ear level. As every standard also claims this. \n\nSo you do what actually makes sense, and the third photo makes the most sense in how audio would bounce and fill the room.. But it’s not going to make audio sound like it came from the front right or left.. that is a gross exaggeration.\n\nThe most accurate though, is yes, Sonos doesn’t tell you that if you don’t have that perfect box - it won’t be perfect. Most people don’t know that though, and they (Sonos) know it.  So it’ll still sound like an upgrade, and feel like an upgrade - even if it’s not right.  Though if you CAN make it right, do so.

I live in a small flat with a sitting/dining/kitchen open plan room. I’m considering having the right surround next to the main sofa on a console table, but the left being a bit further away on the end of the kitchen worktop. (Pictures attached for reference)

Would this work? I considered speaker stands, but I’m loathe to do that as it creates more clutter and adds the extra challenge of cable management near the sofa. 

I’ve never had surrounds before, so not sure about how sensitive they are to position.

Any advice/ideas appreciated!"	12	"[""rsplatpc: You can probably even it out, but I'd just buy 2 stands, put them behind the couch, call it a day."", 'jtripp2011: Get two stands and place them behind the couch.', 'MrZeDark: The only answer is stands, don’t put them in weird random paces behind the couch.

1682897952.0	30-Apr-2023 16:39:12	How I got my turntable playing on Sonos without a Five/Era 100/Era 300/Connect/Amp/Port	dagu	2	1346lmo	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1346lmo/how_i_got_my_turntable_playing_on_sonos_without_a/	"Hey Sonos fam,

I found a workaround to get my turntable playing on Sonos WITHOUT buying a new line-in product using my Mac and some cables I already had. Hope it helps someone!

You need:

-	Record player with preamp built in + cinch to 3.5 audio adapter (like [this](https://i.imgur.com/hK9vfnv.jpg))
-	3.5 audio cable WITH TRRS (I had one from a Rode VideoMic external microphone. They look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/dB6UFHP.jpg) - 3 lines on the plug = they transit audio to a device like a computer:)
-	USB C to 3.5 audio adapter (I had the [Apple USB-C to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU7E2AM/A/usb-c-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter) lying around, but I guess others should probably work as well
-	An AirPlay enabled Mac (or maybe Windows / Linux works as well, if you have a Bluetooth enabled Sonos player — but not sure about audio quality) 

How I did it:
1.	Connected the cinch adapter to the turntable, and plugged the TRRS cable via the USB C dongle into my Mac. Looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/RvvrI6E.jpg
2.	I went into system settings on the Mac, into sound, and changed the audio input to the USB C adapter (if it does not appear, and you are sure the cable used is TSSR, ensure the end with 3 lines is plugged into the adapter). Looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/FSZkETZ.jpg
4.	Now we want to have the audio from the turntable playing on the Mac. Easiest way I found was to open QuickTime > File > New Audio Recording. Audio should start playing if you put on a record. You do not need to record (but you can). I suggest you adjust the volume in quicktime and input volume in system settings so it sounds well balanced
5.	final step: AirPlay from Mac and get music into your Sonos system 

Downsides: 
-	Your computer needs to stay turned on
-	Audio has a slight delay (like Sonos Connect)
-	Afaik Airplay is capped at lossless CD quality 


Not perfect, but it’s a nice workaround since you might have the necessary cables at home already (otherwise cheap ones can probably be had at Amazon from $5-10) instead of buying a used $200 Connect S2 

Hope it helps someone, I’m deffo happy to be listening to some tunes on my Beam + Play 1 Surrounds 🎶"	0	[]

1. **Is eARC critical over ARC to get proper Atmos to the Sonos Arc + Era 300s?**
2. **Is there any audio-benefit to having devices (chromecast, xbox, etc) input through HDMI 2.1 to the tv, or is 2.0 ok?** 

Just plopped down my order to upgrade my beam gen 1 and two play:1s to an Arc with a pair of Era 300s - extremely excited to join the Atmos camp from a music / movie / gaming perspective!

That being said - unfortunately I have a tv from 5 yrs ago without eArc connection ([https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/vizio/p-series-quantum-2018](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/vizio/p-series-quantum-2018)), thus I assume no true Dolby Atmos from movies?

Being just about five yrs old, I'm ok with an upgrade, but want to be sure its needed here and to be sure I choose the right tv next to support these audio codex's in as future-proof a way as possible.  

Question on the new tv is whether or not HDMI 2.1 is really needed on all four inputs or if two on HDMI 2.0 is ok?  If I've got an Arc on eArc input that leaves one HDMI 2.1 port for either 1. Xbox Series X, 2. PS4, 3. Nintendo Switch, or 4. Google Chromecast w Google TV.

I've been a Sonos user (and fan) for quitte some time. Ever since I purchased my first Play:1, I use Sonos almost everyday. There's a great deal of things about Sonos that I like, some things I dislike. But there's definitely room for improvement. I figured I'd make a post and share some thoughts. I'm curious whether people agree or have other takes on these topics.

Firstly: I dearly wish for Sonos to reboot the Playbase. I know it's kind of an odd form factor, and it's kind of pointless when you mount your tv to the wall. But it's unique shape is the reason it sounds so much better than other TV-speakers made by Sonos. At least it does as a standalone speaker. I chose the Playbase over the Playbar (those were the 2 choices back then) because the Playbar would block a tiny part of my TV screen, from the couch.

Since then I've made a few changes to my setup, but nowadays I'm still using the Playbase, with 2x Play:5 gen2 as rears. I'm aware that's very much overkill for rear speakers, but I already owned 1 and could scoop a second one for cheap when a store nearby went out of business. The Play:5 gen2 (/Five) and Playbase are pretty much the only speakers with a decent sound. At least at high volume and without any sub paired to it.

In fact, that's the whole reason I have this setup. A sub would definitely put me on bad terms with my neighbours. This is the only way to have at least decent amount of low tones without a booming sub in my setup. The downside is that on higher volumes, any other speaker (whether that's a Play1/One, Move or Play:3). They all kinda disappoint if you try to do anything other than low volume background music or very small rooms.

So if Sonos could create a new Playbase, with eARC, throw in some Atmos, it would almost be the perfect TV-speaker for anybody who doesn't mount the TV on a wall. Yeah, the Arc and Playbase have a wider soundstage, but that can be overcome if Sonos finally decides to support to use a small speaker as front left/right. Long story short: to me any other TV-speaker than the Playbase, would be kind of underwhelming without a sub, unless you only want your dialogue to be clearer compared to integrated TV sound.

To be honest, that turned out to be a longer story than I intended. I'd also wish for Sonos to keep ethernet jacks on their newer speakers. On a Move or Roam I think it's acceptable. And it sure is a great step to make most speakers able to use 5GHz when not in a surround setup (directly to your wifi). But nothing beats wired up speakers. I live in a city centre and even 5GHz is starting to get a little crowded. I'm sure 6GHz will help, but that's far from mainstream. And eventually it will also be busier and busier.

I know you can buy a dongle. But besides it being more expensive, I'm also buying Sonos for it's design. And the clean look will definitely be compromised by a dongle hanging out the back. I haven't been hands on with the new ERA speakers though. As I'm a network engineer professionally, I do expect WiFi 6 to be a lot better in challenging conditions than the aging WiFi 4 (802.11a) other speakers are using. I fear it's not going be as big of a jump from 802.11a to 802.11ax as it was from 2.4GHz to 5GHz, but I guess it surely isn't going to make it worse.

So... what do the people of r/sonos think? Do you agree? Am I out of my mind? I'm looking forward to hear."	7	"['CassCasey: Yes please.

More people are mounting their tvs, and if not then creating a speaker with the strenght to hold, say a 65-inch tv with say, the massive foot that the LGs have would be very hard.  \nThat thing weighs a ton and if I used it as a weapon I could kill someone with it.', ""Sadistmonkey: I could imagine atmos would be difficult when the top has to be solid to hold the TV's weight. So getting up-firing speakers placed would be difficult. Unless it was done like the Beam Gen 2, which has phantom channels."", ""StillAvailable1696: I don't know about the dimensions of the stand, but my 55 inch OLED B8 (2018 model) weighs about 17-18kg (38ish lbs) and it has no issue whatsoever. I can't find the weight of a 65 inch B8, but the C2 65 inch is 1kg lighter than my 55 inch 2018 model. The C9 (2019 model) 65 inch is reported to weight just shy of 26kg. The weight limit for the Playbase is 77lbs (so around 36kg). And it seems LG has put their OLED tv's on a diet.\n\nBack when I bought the Playbase I had 55 inch LCD TV. It had 2 small feet on each side instead of 1 big stand in the middle. The Playbase did fit underneath it perfectly. The Arc  (or Playbar back then) was going to block my view on a small part of the screen. My current OLED is actually on top of the Playbase, so it wouldn't have been an issue."", ""StillAvailable1696: Well, the Beam gen2 also doesn't have upfiring speakers. In fact, Atmos is designed to work with any number of speakers (between 2 and over 100 if I remember correctly). \n\nWhat makes Atmos so different to previous surround technologies, is that there's no predefined soundtrack for a set number of speakers. The soundtrack has information of where the sound should be coming from, from the viewers perspective. The sound system will calculate this, based on number of speakers and more info. A proper Atmos system should also be calibrated, so the system know what speakers you have, what it's exact location is. So it can create the effect of a sound coming from a direction where there's no speaker, by altering the sound or using multiple speakers to create a ghost speaker effect.  \n\n\nThis is actually something Sonos is completely lacking. But it's also something that Sonos could implement. If they had a way more modular approach to what speakers you can hook up to your home cinema, it would've been awesome. Right now Sonos has barely any input as to how far speakers are away from the viewer. \n\nAlso the ERA 300 have upfiring speakers. But if you really want immersive sound, you should just have ceiling mounted speakers. Just imagine how different living rooms can be. Do you really think there's a 1 size fits all if you want the full Atmos experience?  Sure, Trueplay could help out a bit (untill the room is accoustically changed) and you can kind of tell it how far you are from the rear speakers, but that's it.""]"

1682784089.0	29-Apr-2023 09:01:29	Play:3 replaced by Era300	CassCasey	15	132zj4n	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/132zj4n/play3_replaced_by_era300/	"Couple of weeks ago I had asked here how the Era300 performs as replacement for a Play:3. Nobody replied so I ordered an E300 and compared myself. TL;DR: The Era300 (single unit) clearly outperforms the Play:3, even with stereo content.

I used my single Play:3 in my 26sqm dining room with a lot of glas/windows. While it was always only used for casual listening (mostly TuneIn radio stations) at moderate and very moderate volumes, I was pretty content with the Play:3 (even compared to my Play:5 at low volumes). However, as the dining room is the only room where the E300 can work in my house (elsewhere: odd ceilings, space restrictions), I decided to give it a go and replaced the Play:3 by an E300 a week ago.

While I (and, more importantly, my wife) liked the design of the E300 from the start (in White), I was not impressed by the build quality (visible gaps between the back plate and the speaker). But I decided to keep it.

And boy, the sound! The E300 sounds much fresher and broader than the Play:3, even with stereo content. It really easily fills the room and does sound less muffled than the Play:3. The bass is also powerfull and warmer, very nice. Vocals are a little less sharp though than on the Play:3 (let alone the Play:5). 

Atmos of course is even more of an upgrade if the content is properly mixed: „Lift me up“ or „Higher Power“ really shine and even though my listening position is far from ideal, the E300 produces clear multichannel effects from one unit- impressive .

So to my ears, the Play:3 is no match whatsoever against the E300, not even in stereo. Mine is going to eBay. As even my wife (who is not at all interested in audio) noted how much better the E300 sounds, I plan to add a second one to stereo-pair in one or two years when we rearrange the room."	12	['coxmr1: Thank you for posting this.

What’s the best possible way to get the best sound with Tidal

Kind Regards

I recently finished my Sonos system, I have a Beam Gen 2, Sub Mini and 2 One SL’s as surrounds. I bought a Port yesterday to finally connect my record player which is a Audio Technica LP120xBT. So now my entire system is connected. The source level is also set to Level 10 on the Sonos app.

My question was is there any perceivable sound difference between playing a record on my turntable through my Sonos system, compared to streaming in High-Res lossless via the Sonos app/Apple Music? 

From what I understand the sound quality increase from vinyls usually comes from analog systems with cables and such, it’s not really noticeable via wireless systems.  

I’m relatively new to proper sound systems and the audio world so I’m not attuned enough to be able to pick up differences by ear yet.

Have some beefy 14-Gauge running to one pair of the speakers ([Sonance outdoor](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/outdoor-speaker-pair) that's a bit further away), but wanted to skip that and run some thinner wire to the other set which are just some bookshelf speakers right next to the Connect:Amp

Y'all see any risks in the situation I'm describing?

I do have an Arc under my TV and I will add 2 x era300 and a sub to upgrade to a 7.1.4 system. 

My 2 era300 speakers I can place on a closet behind the couch (earlevel). Behind the couch there is also a dining table. I want to putt the era300's on the closet (between couch and dining table) but with the front of the era300 towards the dining table. 

As I understood when it's configured as a surround system, the front speakers of the era300's will not work. So there is no reason to point them towards my tv.

Esthetically it's a big advantage when you sit at the dining table that you see the front of the era300's and not the backside of the era300's. Also when playing general music, I can change the surround settings from ambient to full to play music. In that case the front speakers of the era300's will play and this will allow to hear it when sitting at the dining table. 

Any idea how I can configure this, as I think it will have an influence on the dolby atmos height/side left and right orientation. That should be inverted then. Is this something that TruePlay can fix? 

Here is a little shematic.

I thought I'd share my project with the Sonos community.

We moved into a new home (to us) that had a 20 year old Elan system in several rooms.  There had been some remodeling, and a couple of the rooms no longer had in-ceiling speakers, but most of the rooms did.  There was wiring (but no speakers) in an outdoor area, and all bedrooms had speakers.  The family room had wiring for in-ceiling surround speakers (and stereo speakers behind a cloth panel - replaced with a sonos soundbar and sub behind the cloth panel), and an office area and basement space also had in-ceiling speakers.

When we did the walk through, I knew the Elan system was probably non-functional.  Wires were EVERYWHERE and the old wiring closet was in disrepair.  A step-ladder was resting on top of at least one cat-5 control cable, and the insulating jacket had been pulled from the RJ45 connector.  I found Tyler's hack and decided to go all-in with it.  I'm really glad I followed in his footsteps as I'm extremely happy with the outcome.

In the end, I used 9 Symfonisk bookshelf speakers.  I printed the enclosure Tyler designed - which worked perfectly.  The stereo zones I replaced are mono as there's just 1 channel of output from the modification.  I'm fine with this as you'll never be sitting in a perfect position for stereo audio.  I pulled out the 2 x Niles 12 channel amplifiers and multiple zone controllers / preamps and intercom / integration units.  7 of the amps / symfonisk guts ended up in the wiring closet and 2 ended up going into the family room for surround sound for the existing sonos system.

Lastly, I was able to remove the old Elan wall control units and I replaced with the Lutron pico controllers.  This has been fantastic to retain the ""ease of volume control"" in every room.  Super easy to play / pause / adjust volume without needing to pull out a phone.

A couple of really nice benefits - 1.) Sonos thinks they are Symfonisk speakers.  Trueplay works wonderfully.  I'm shocked at how good the speakers sound.  I'm fairly certain boxes are behind the in-ceiling speakers.  I'm not sure how they would have gotten the bass response without some type of enclosure.  2.) Pairing the surrounds with the playbar and sub was super easy.  3.) AppleTV lets you redirect the audio to airplay speakers.  Because the Symfonisk bookshelf gen 2 speakers are airplay2 compatible, I can redirect audio from the screened-in porch appleTV to the in-ceiling speakers.  No, it's not optimal for movie viewing, but it sounds SO much better than the pitiful TV speakers.

Let me know if you have any questions.  After doing 9 of the conversions I learned a lot about the ""order of operations"" and I'm fairly confident in my ability to help if needed.  Oh- and when all the zones are playing + some existing sonos gear / subs, it'll thump pretty good."	6	['birdmarket: Nice job!

I'm having an issue and was wondering if anyone can help me. I recently got married and tomorrow we're hosting a large party for our friends/family. The venue we booked already has a Sonos system throughout their establishment. It was setup on their guest wifi and has multiple S1 Ones. 

I brought two of my Play 5s, two Era 300s and a Sonos boost hoping to use them for the party. When I get on their guest wifi it causes complications between the two separate systems. I can momentarily see my boost and Play 5s but after awhile, the wifi signal drops. Then when I go back to the Sonos app it starts showing me the venues already established system. 

I can manage to play music on the Play 5s for a little bit but it'll eventually lose the wifi connection. I'm thinking it's because the app is registering both systems intermittently causing issues. Another issue I come across is with the venues S1 speakers. The app tells me it's incompatible with my S2 speakers and wants me to forget the venues Sonos system, which I cannot do. 

I'm just not sure what to do to trouble shoot this issue. Is there a way to maintain the connection to my speakers, while leaving the venues system alone? 

Any thoughts or suggestions would be awesome."	5	"['IllCardiologist9032: I guess if you can do without the ones you could buy a cheap router and set your system up on that at home.

Chances are they just never got around to it… although I’ve never done S1 -> S2 myself .

I have two Sonos systems both under the same Sonos account. I can link one of my Google Homes to my Sonos acciunt and connect it to the Sonos system in that location, and thereby use my Google assistant to play music through the Sonos system. When I try to link the other Home in the same way it seems to disconnect the first one. If this is a limitation of the system (either in the case of Sonos or Google Home) then it's one I find totally unacceptable. Does anyone know a workaround?	0	[]

After a few hours of troubleshooting, I was finally able to get it working.

I have a PS5 connected to a HDMI Splitter connected to Arcana connected to a Dell monitor and to the Sonos, but the audio output is always 2.0, not matter what settings I change on the PS5. I tried to set the audio to AV Receiver and the channels to 5.1 (and even 7.1), but the output is always 2.0.

Changing the audio output to Linear PCM, Dolby or DTS also makes no difference.

I know this isn't Arcana's sub, but if you guys have a similar setup and could help me it would be amazing!  I tried different settings on the Arcana, enabling and disabling features but none did work.

Any help is welcome!

Thank you in advance!

\----

EDIT: I forgot to mention that between the HDMI Splitter and the Arcana I have a Lytmi NEO-Pro Sync for the LEDs behind the monitor. Not sure if it would make any difference, but I thought I should tell it

\---------------------------------------

RE-EDIT: I finally got it to work. I made 2 changes, but I don't know if both fixed the issue or only one of them. Anyway, the changes that I made were:

1. Instead of HDMI Switcher (where the PS5 is connectec) > Lytmi > Arcana > Sonos (via ARC) and Monitor (via HDMI), now I have HDMI Switcher (where the PS5 is connectec) > Arcana > Sonos (via ARC) and then the Arcana's regular HDMI output goes to the Lytmi > Monitor
2. I also replaced the HDMI cable that was going from Arcana's regular HDMI. It was a fiber cable, so I replaced it by a regular cable. The screen was losing image from time to time, and it seems to be better after I switched the cable

The first change created a cleaner input to Arcana, because it has less devices connected before reaching it. So far so good. 7.1ch output automatically! I'll test it over the weekend!

Thank you all!"	14	"['ggenoyam: What happens if you remove the splitter and led sync and use only the ps5, arcana, and monitor?

We have an open-concept Living, Dining, and Kitchen, and she wanted to avoid rears interrupting this. With that being in mind, here is what I am thinking...

Kitchen - Sonos Move so that I can move it outside if we have guests or I am grilling

Office - Sonos Era 100

All other Bedrooms - Sonos Era 100's

Garage / Gym - Sonos Move - Currenly use and really enjoy (Can also bring outside if need more music)

is there any need for Era 300's I am also thinking of doing the 100's mounted high on the wall, will that mess up the sound?

Thank you in advance."	4	['chfalin: You don’t need era 300s unless you want to play atmos music. Just a little note: If you group a non-atmos capable speaker with the era 300, the grouping will default to playing non-atmos for all speakers. Of course, you would be able to group the era 300s with your Arc/Sub/Surrounds, and still get atmos.  As someone who doesn’t care that much about surround for movies and tv, I think I like my era 300s as a stereo pair more than using them as surrounds with the Arc.\n\nThe Move is always a good choice. \n\nThe Era 100s are great because of their versatility.  I originally put a play:1 in every room, then added another for a stereo pair in some places, and moved some to a surround configuration. Like the Play:1 and One, the Era 100 will be very versatile. The Era 100s will sound great, have wifi6 (but not use SonosNet), have Bluetooth (I hate Bluetooth), and a line-in option.\n\nMounting the Era 100s closer to ear level will give you the best sound. A little higher will be not too bad. Like HIGH on the wall, the sound will be…different. I had Play:1s mounted up high on the wall in the kitchen and hallway, and it was fine, but the reflections can do some weird things with the sound, and the sound can be a bit less inspiring. \n\n\nI have the Move, Era 100s, and Era 300s, and I think they’re all great.  Your plan with a Move and Era 100s sounds like a solid one. I love my Era 100s, even though I’m using them as surrounds with a Beam 2.\n\nYou could also look at the ikea symfonisk speakers for places you want to maybe not spend as much.

Obviously it’s not going to blow away a dedicated stereo system with a fancy preamp and DAC, but I get mixed feedback on if it’s any good at all. 

The alternatives (Beam, Arc, pairs of 100s/300s) all have their merits, but the 100/300s won’t hook up to a TV and the Beam/Arc don’t really deliver the goods in terms of music quality (I do listen to TV and music, but I care more about the quality of music than I do TV).

It seems like conceptually the Amp is the only thing that could meet this criteria (music focused, but TV compatible). I could team the Amp with a pair of bookshelfs I already have spare (KEF LS50s for example)."	5	"['MDAdvice: From what you are describing you may want a traditional AV receiver setup.

But keep in mind that you will be limited to standard Dolby Digital and rely on a phantom center channel when playing TV audio.\n\nHave you listened to music in Dolby Atmos yet?

When the Arc is used with a Sub and a pair of surround speakers, Dolby Atmos music sounds pretty incredible."", ""TheTigersShare: Yes, the Amp remains a great product! Is anybody really suggesting otherwise? It has loads of power in a very compact, cool running package, and the sound quality will be the same as any other properly designed amplifier and DAC combo. \n\nI've been using the Amp for 4 years in the exact same scenario (TV setup with KEF LS50s) along with a Sonos Sub, and I love it. It will depend a bit on your setup, but I find that they image really well and it works great for both TV and music."", 'forbiddenpineapple: I have! I have a single Era 300 elsewhere (might change to a stereo pair soon) and they’re great. If there was even a way to take stereo HDMI into the Eras (excluding an external DAC which won’t play well with syncing A/V).\n\nI’ve heard an Arc + Sub combo and it’s outstanding for Atmos content. But I thought it was just average for regular stereo music.', 'GuitarSuperstar: Yes, the Arc is not great with stereo music.\n\nIf you already have an Era 300 elsewhere, then adding a second 300 would be a great way to enjoy Dolby Atmos music.\n\nThen use the Amp and a pair of good bookshelf speakers for the TV and stereo music.']"

I have a Sonos sub in the basement which is connected to the ceiling speakers in the living room. I have a sub in this room which i want  to pair with the AMP but i run into stability issues when using it. The sub pairs fine with other speakers. 

Reading on one the forums, i understand that the Sub create a separate 5HZ channel with the AMP and does not use Sonosnet or Wifi for this connection. Which is a bummer but explains my scenario.

But when i checked with Sonos support yesterday, the agent said that's not true and the Sub also connects using Wifi and Sonosnet just like other speakers

So this leads to my question
1) Does anyone for sure know how they connect?
2) If infact via a separate channel then i am screwed.

It works by acting as a ""mobile hotspot"", allowing nearby players to bounce their wireless connection directly to that player, rather than attempt to reach the nearest access point/router.\n\nHOWEVER:\n\nThe Sub will utilise a 5GHz channel for connecting to a HT player (e.g., Arc, Arc SL, Connect: Amp G2, Amp, Beam G1/G2, Playbar, Playbase and Ray). This connection is used for streaming the Low Frequency Emitter/Effects channel (i.e., the .1 in a 5.1 system) to the Sub only.\n\n>If infact via a separate channel then i am screwed. Can i use a workaround such as hard-wiring the Sub if it helps? and how do others use their AMP with the SUb with this limitation?\n\nI am unable to confirm/prove that a Sub can be wired to a HT player with two Ethernet ports, where one port is connected to a router/network switch, and the other is for the Sub\'s port (i.e. an Amp or Playbar with a Sub).\n\nAs far as I know, no one has this set-up.', ""Purple_Gas_8222: Have you turned on WiFi for that specific amp?, make sure WiFi is on and then it shouldn't be a problem"", 'cpsal: Hi\n\nI have great wifi and Sonosnet enabled in the house as I have a few speakers wired.

I’ve had the same setup for about 2 years, and I regularly play music via my premium Spotify account. I have made no recent changes to the system or Spotify, but when I tell the Sonos to play music it says, “Ok, playing ____ on Spotify,” but no music plays. The same thing happens on every device. 

I have tried unplugging devices and plugging them back in, reauthorizing the Spotify account, and even switching to Pandora as my default music, but nothing has worked. Of note, when I switched my default to Pandora the same thing happened; it said “playing ____ on Pandora,” but nothing played. So it seems it’s a problem with the Sonos or Google assistant, not specific to Spotify.

All other commands seem to work. I can have it control lights, etc.

I’m not sure how to fix the problem. Has anyone experienced this?"	2	['TheWitcher1989: https://status.sonos.com/', 'bcmd15: Ah thanks!']

i have a smallish tv on which i watch movies and play my ps5. however, i listen to music basically every waking hour. i’m looking for a pretty simple speaker setup that will sound good for both a wide range of music genres and a less wide range of movie genres (i don’t watch many modern movies, i’m pretty much entirely a criterion channel/mubi asshole). 

initially i was looking at two homepods but the potential lag with games and lack of upgrade path scared me off. i have very nice smaller speakers and headphones, so this doesn’t have to be “audiophile” grade, but i am slightly picky with sound. i am unlikely to ever add a sub due to being in an apartment however i have considered the possibility of adding two fives to tie my vinyl setup into a sonos system. 

the living room is an “open” plan that is a 17’ x 11.5’ area with an additional 12’ x 14’ combo dining room/sunroom directly behind it. my tv is small (42”) so i will not be sitting much more than five feet away. 

any thoughts about whether the arc would be overkill? i’m sure it is based only off my movie habits but if it’s significantly better for music i’m happy to pay the extra."	13	"['GuitarSuperstar: With a 42"" TV and sitting 5 feet away, I would get a Beam (Gen 2).

Further complicating things is that I am considering going with a pair of Era 300s instead of in-ceiling speakers for the family room zone. These would be wall mounted at about 8' (probably inverted), and the reason why I am considering them is they may work better in the room with the ceiling we have.

**The Floorplan / Room Design**

This is an open room approximately 40' long by about 14' with raised ceilings sloping from the right down to the left (if looking towards the TV). The raised ceilings don't start until about 1.5' into the room (thicker top dashed line in the picture) due to existing overhang/support of the second floor, and then they shoot up to 10' 10"" before sloping downwards at \~14 degrees until hitting the back wall at 8'

My plan was to create two zones - one for the 'family room/TV' and another for the 'kitchen'.

https://preview.redd.it/rrk1ot6j09wa1.jpg?width=1813&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8776575c644c0594af5d27cb4a01d3c6d95e5089

**Zone 1 - Family Room/TV**

This will be the primary TV-watching area - there will be a Sonos Arc and Sub -  either paired up with a pair of in-ceiling speakers (blue circles) powered by a Sonos amp or with Era 300s (red circles.) I

If going with in-ceiling speakers, do I get Sonos+Sonace pair to take advantage of TruePlay tuning, which may (or may not?) help with the raised, sloped ceiling? One speaker would be about 10' above the floor, while the other (due to the slope) would likely be closer to 8' 6"" give or take. I don't know how this might impact the listening experience and if TruePlay could compensate for it, or if the TruePlay capability of the Sonace speakers would be negligible. If not noticeable, I'd rather save the money going with cheaper in-ceiling speakers and being able to maybe pair with an older Sonos Connect:Amp (S2-capable).

Depending on the final placement of the couch and support column, an alternative option would be a pair of Sonos Era 300s wall-mounted upside down about 7' 6"" off the floor and angled down towards the back of the couch. I don't think it looks as clean as in-ceiling speakers, but the cost is about the same (or cheaper compared to going with Sonace+Sonos in-ceiling), and I *think* the sound might be better. While framing is going on, I will have the ability to ensure a clean look with cable management and power supply.

**Zone 2 - Kitchen**

My plan was to put 4 speakers in the ceiling here that would be used for background/ambient music, but may occasionally be grouped with the family room zone both for music listening or occasionally for TV (e.g. hosting people and watching a sporting event.)

Where I am stuck... do I attempt to set up a stereo pairing here, keeping the left channel running along the north (top) wall and the right channel along the southern wall, or if I'm better off setting these up as dual mono to fill the space without stereo-bleed and knowing that where someone is in the kitchen when watching TV might not always be left/right (there will be some barstools in lower right-hand corner of island, not really facing the TV.)

If I go with the dual mono setup in the Sonos app, what changes as far as wiring these in parallel and with regards to the type of speakers I should be looking for? Do the speakers need to be individual stereo models to support dual mono?

Also, would it sound weird if these are dual mono and get grouped with the stereo left/right in the family room? For example, if eating around the table and having light music playing in the background of both zones.

I decided to invest in a pair of Era 300’s for my home office setup (based on the feedback on this sub it seems like using them as rears for my arc is a bit overkill). 

Does anyone know how a stereo pair works with the side firing speakers? I.e if the speaker on the left will stop firing the speakers on its right to avoid muddying the Atmos sound coming from the right speaker?

If so, does that mean that the left speaker would only fire it’s left speakers, front and top, and the right fire it’s right speakers, front and top?

If so, is it a bit pointless to have them stereo paired and instead just get one a sub mini?

So far the audio has been really good versus the one’s they replaced, but the Atmos isn’t as enveloping as others have described from single Era 300s.

I'm torn between the beam and the arc and I need some advices. Here are some things to keep in mind:
-I have young kids so I don't want wires everywhere
-I only want the sound bar so no sub or satellites
-I live in a semi detached house with a neighbor on the other side of the party wall so I don't want to make the entire building shake.
-I am not a big audiophile
-The sound bar will be used to watch regular tv, music and some tv shows or movies from streaming.
-Here is a description of my living room. The couch is in front of the wall mounted tv and I have a wall behind it.  On the left, it's an open room with the kitchen and dining room so the left wall is about 30 feet. On the right, I have stairs that go down to the entrance of the house

So with all this in mind, here are my questions:
1: Is the beam enough for what I'll do with it or should I go big with the arc to match the quality of my tv?
2:When the kids are asleep, will I have a hard time listening to tv with the sound on low without waking them?
3: considering my living room, will Dolby Atmos sound any good ?

Thank you in advance. Sorry about my English, I'm french Canadian"	4	['funashimi: Look, every “arc vs beam gen2” post comes down to your personal worth of investment.\n\nEven in a smaller room, arc will fill the room better and sound should be better. But not marginally better, diminishing returns are big and your ears are in equation too.\n\nArc costs twice as much, but you may be satisfied with beam gen2 as well.\n\nSo, the questions:\n\n-\tDo you want to pay twice as much for only 30-40% better sound (generally)?\n-\tDo you consider the option to buy the Beam gen2 first, if it suits you then OK, if it’s not enough but still good, move it to the bedroom and buy the arc later\n-\tYou said you won’t expand on the sonos line up, are you really sure you won’t? Why sonos then? Answer this for yourself.\n\nAnyway, I think it comes down to your budget and worthiness of sound quality and “fullness” of the sound.\nNot gonna throw parties, low volume always, just want better sound, no upgrades and not really picky about the sound quality? Beam gen2 suits you well, with arc you won’t notice sound bump so much, but you will surely notice a price bump. Beam gen2 is good value in sonos ecosystem and sub mini complements it a lot in terms of value upgradability. \n\nPersonally, when I bought lg c2, I wanted the sound to be **on par** with picture quality, so I went full arc-sub-surrounds. Even though the sound never exceeds 30% mark, I’m happy. But objectively speaking, beam gen2 and sub mini combination is more valuable.\n\nAlso, arc looks better on 55+ tvs, keep in mind that.', 'Electrical-Street-16: Beam or ARC you will get Dolby Atmos. ARC will be the better choice. Why\n\nIn the Sonos app you will be able to enable Sound night and will reduce the sound. This option again with any sound bar Gen or ARC.\n\nIn the future you will never know you decide to upgrade you will be ahead of the dound game.\n\nJust my honest opinion \n\n✌️', 'brainegg8: Arc']

I am torn on which speaker to go with; Sonos one vs Era 100 vs Move.   I've been very happy with the few Sonos One's in non-stereo for smaller rooms, but have one room that doesn't have anything in it yet.  I never use the voice assistant items, nor really care about bluetooth, or have the need for stereo support in this room, so all are non-deal breakers for me.

I'd considered purchasing the move as a portable speaker, leaving it in this room in question, when not in use, but have heard rumors the Move is planned for a refresh this fall, so I've been hesitant making that purchase.

I've heard conflicting reviews on the Era 100 vs the One; where the Era 100 loses out on midrange, conflicting feedback on lows, but highs are non-debate that the Era 100 wins.  I also noticed that the Era 100 loses ethernet port and that would be an extra $40 to add an adapter (call me a grandpa, but I love having a hard wired connection).  I've heard some are maybe using a different adapter with success, anyone have more info on that?

What are you thoughts on what I should go with?"	4	"[""j_nak: I have all three.  I would say the Move is slightly better than the 100 in bass and loudness, but the 100 is slightly better at stereo separation and imaging.  They are pretty equal in most other aspects.

Is there any written guidance/analysis on what methods of playback are capped at what streaming quality based on different music services?

In short - trying to determine if playback quality is maximized by launching songs via the Sonos app always, or if there are certain instances where it makes no difference when using AirPlay with Apple Music and/or Amazon Music.

The User Interface of the Sonos app is a little less convenient for browsing playlists and your Library can only be sorted by Alphabetical order as opposed to Date Added. I would just use the native Apple Music & Amazon Music apps if it makes no difference in quality, but not sure the case.

I do realize that Dolby Atmos requires songs be launched from the Sonos app, not asking about Dolby Atmos songs in this case."	5	['legallypurple: The sound quality to me is much better through the Sonos app than through AirPlay.

Airplay 2 and Sonosnet S2 both max out at 24 bit 48khz.\n\nHowever “Airplay” is a bit of a hodgepodge, and acts differently under different situations.  I believe in general, though Airplay 2 supports up to 24 bit 48khz, in practice it largely maxes out at 24 bit 44.1khz.  Then also, depending on audio source, airplay sending device, how you airplay, they all can make a difference (eg on OSX vs iOS, different lossless/hi-res streaming sources with different file types, bit rates, locally stored files, airplay from an app vs a system on OSX) in how Airplay behaves in terms of transcoding into AIFF, maintaining a bit perfect stream or not, etc.\n\nIf you airplay just right, Airplay and Sonos should both sound comparable, but if you don’t hit the right combination with Airplay, Sonos could have an edge.  For most people, the physical setup of their listening space IMHO compromises their audio reproduction enough that it should not make a practical difference.  For those who care and have their listening space well set up though…', 'Cry_Wolff: AirPlay sounds worse / compressed.

I have an Arc, 2 subs, and 2 300s. The 300s should be facing directly towards the tv, they should not be angled into the listening area. If they are angled it throws off the side surrounds and rear surrounds. If you can imagine angling the speaker into the listening area the left and right surround would then be facing the wall further into the room and the rear surround will be at a sharper angle behind you. Each 300 is about 4 feet from the edge of the sides of the couch.  They are 13 inches from the side walls to the center touch button of the speaker and they are about 4.5 inches away from the rear wall. They are about 4 inches above my ear level using the height adjustable sanus mounts. The subs are on opposite sides of the side walls about 3 feet from the tv. The arc is mounted to the tv using the sanus tv bracket mounted to a fully articulating tv mount. I found that pulling the arc out further from the tv sounds significantly better.  When trueplay tuning, tune the listening area. Walk slowly and wave your arm slowly as well. Bring your phone close to the ground as it will help tune the subs. Don’t get too close to the walls, don’t get too close to the speakers. If you can go about a foot behind the main listening area. There is no sense it making the software and processors adjust the sound profile for a part of the room in which no one ever watches tv or sits.

Once properly added to the app and paired as stereo, only the left one plays music although the right one controls the volume on the left one ... I tried a hard reset twice, unplugging for 15-20 sec, removing them from the app, removing the pair then adding it again, resetting my internet connection, updating iOS and OS apps, different music sources and I still get the same result.

I'll call tech support tomorrow but I wanted to try here first.

After demoing the Sonos speakers in the store, I felt the era 300 was by far the best speaker out of everything they offer right now. Intially I wanted to go with the Arc, but decided against it as the era 300 blows the Arc away when playing any kind of music.

So ideally I would want to use a pair of era 300s as stereo speakers for my projector, but… no hdmi inputs. Now I’m left wondering what my best course of action is. Should I just get the Arc with the Eras just for the hdmi input? But then the eras would act as surrounds which would be a terrible waste.

Is there any way to use the era300s as mains speakers without the arc? Or is there a way to combine it with the arc, but set them up in 3.0 instead of using them as surround speakers?"	4	['early_rejecter: Does the projector have an analog output you could send to the E300?

The E300s have good bass, but not as deep as the fives.  If you like bass, they could benefit from a sub.\n\nIf you are streaming over airplay though, it doesn't support Atmos.  The soundstage for stereo content is a lot more indirect. The outside firing woofers aren't angled towards you and are designed to bounce off walls.  Because of this the room impacts its sound stage far more than having a pair of traditional speakers like bookshelves pointing at your listening position.\n\nFor stereo music, I far prefer a pair of Sonos fives and they don't need a sub (it's a luxury for further bass extension).   If you want atmos for music and will change from using Airplay to using the Sonos app, that's where the E300s plus a sub may make more sense."", 'Denslayer: Curious about this as well', 'allinwlk: !thanks that’s very useful. I’ve no interest in using the Sonos app and it will prevent me from air playing to other devices in the house so I’ll re-consider fives or the passive route.', 'Han-Yolo44: Yeah I far prefer just doing airplay personally, it’s just quicker and more convenient. Open plan I don’t think you’ll be disappointed with Fives but the passive route is great too as you’ll have lots of options and ability to customize. \n\nOne other cool thing to consider I’ve seen others do is to go with 4 Sonos ones or 100s. So two stereo pairs placed in a large room but grouped. Just place them so that the rights and lefts are on the same sides.

It's a large open room with a kitchen and dining area, so I will likely add another 4 speakers in the ceiling, but for those I want to go with something cheaper paired with another Amp to create a separate zone.

My only interest in the Sonace Architectural is the ability to true play the speakers, otherwise I think it's absurd to spend that much for a pair of speakers (I'm not an audiophile.)

Does anyone know of any other in-ceiling speakers that look near identical to Sonace, but which are maybe closer to \~$150/speaker?"	9	"['pmnk-: These are on sale via Best Buy.

I’m not sure what exact angles are available, but you can almost certainly get 15° out of the tweeter. \n\nFYI, the speakers themselves look very similar, but not identical. Assuming that you will use them, you should know that the grills are subtly different. At least, at the time I purchased (a couple of years ago), the Sonos version has a more square shoulder profile (and therefore not much of a bezel) while the MAG6R has something like a quarter inch bezel. Also, the hole pattern is slightly different; they are about the same size (and the resulting color is very similar), but if you are up close to them, then you can see that the Sonos version has sort of a spiral pattern to the perforations while the MAG6R has what looks like a normal grid pattern.\n\nI have a mixture of them in my house, and it works just fine, but I figured I would point that out. BTW, the cover plates are interchangeable.', ""ElBrenzo: Do you think the Sonos Sonace ones are worth it purely for TruePlay capability? \n\nThe MAG6R seem to be $100-150+ cheaper per speaker. \n\nI would only do this for two in-ceiling speakers, so I can't help but wonder if I'm better off going with MAG6R and an older Connect:Amp Gen 2 that can run on the S2 platform."", 'fiatowner: I only paid for the (considerably more expensive) Sonos version in one room.

I can definitely tell that TruePlay is doing something, but it’s not dramatic. Those two drivers have a slightly different “voice” to begin with.\n\nSo, in my case, at least, I don’t think that TruePlay is doing very much. I’m sure it does more in other environments, and I am sure that someone with a better ear than mine could tell the difference here in my home, but I don’t find it to have a dramatically positive effect. Personally — given my ear, my taste, and my environment — I would be reluctant to spend a lot of extra money on these drivers only to get access to TruePlay. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, the Sonos version is definitely better (to my ear) out of the box, and TruePlay does make it somewhat better (in my environment). I just wouldn’t spend 4x as much anywhere except in my living room (and even then I’m kind of wondering if I should have even done that). \n\nIn my case, I decided to mostly use MAG6R and spend the extra money buying a sub and adding an Arc w/surrounds to the TV. And I am happy with that decision.', 'ElBrenzo: Yeah, that\'s where I\'m conflicted... The room has a 14-degree sloped ceiling that, if looking at the TV, starts at 10\' 10"" and slopes down to 8\' over a \\~13\' length. So one speaker will probably be around 10\' from the floor and the other might be closer to 8\' 6"" give-or-take.\n\nMy thought was maybe Trueplay could help with balancing this out as it\'ll be the main rear stereo pair for watching TV. Unfortunately, there is no way to place anything closer to ear level as my wife does not want speaker stands, and the back of the couch will be in the middle of the room, which I understand. \n\nIf I didn\'t go with Sonace and got their mid-tier or whatever MAG6R are, it would also let me pair with a spare Connect:Amp (Gen 2/S2) that I have, it\'s more a $1,000 savings - more than enough to cover the cost of the Arc.']"

You definitely get the full Atmos experience with 300s paired with an Arc, but there simply just isn't enough Atmos content that I listen to that would make it worth it for me. They felt so lifeless and quiet when listening to non-Atmos content. That was the kicker for me: I loved the way the 300s sounded for music when used as a stereo pair (=unpaired from the Arc) but hated them when paired to the Arc. I didn't want to deal with the pairing/unpairing dance whenever switching between TV and music, so back they went! I think almost all of this issue would be remedied by Sonos simply enabling the center driver on the 300s when listening to non-Atmos content (or, at the very least, for music) while paired with an Arc.

I’ve had mine for several years, and the ratio of working/playing time to pretty-looking technology brick is something like 1:90

I’ve also tried reaching out the company (VNYL?) or whomever currently owns them/still sells them. And get…nothing. 

Anyone know if they’re still in business before I throw mine out the window in frustration?"	0	[]

I have a customer who is experiencing trouble with one surround system in their master bedroom (only). they have 3 surround systems in their home, all wired the same (1-Arc, 1-Sub, 1-Amp with a pair of speakers) and 8 other Amps with pairs of connected speakers on them. The Amp and Arc are both wired to the LAN. They are experiencing disconnections of their surround where the Arc (only) play when the TV is on. I suspect the Sub is also playing, but know the ceiling speakers (Amp) are not. The issue came up about 3 months after they moved into the house and had been using the system successfully without any issues. Initially the Amp was not wired to their LAN because I was told that only one Sonos device needed to be wired to the LAN for the entire system to operate properly. After this issue first appeared I was told that the Amp in this room needed to be wired, which I was lucky enough to do (in this now finished home). 

Support tells me that the Wi-Fi for this amp needs to be turned on, even though it is a wired Amp and this is only so it can be troubleshot with them. Four trips to the site, now and each time the issue is resolved only to come back again after a week or two or three.

Why is this happening? What is the resolve for it? Calling support should resolve an issue permanently minus site changes or wiring issues (which there have been none). 

I appreciate any insights. 

Thank you,

We have a Port, a Play:1, a One SL, and a playbar. We’ve had the whole system for about 5 years, added the Port in a couple years ago with a new turntable. When it works, it’s so great! But it hasn’t worked in months.
I can’t use the Port/turntable at all. (It just doesn’t work. No sound.) Even if the Port is just plugged in but not in use, the whole system goes down. 
I can’t actually listen to more than one speaker at a time, as soon as I group the rooms at least one of them cuts out. The volume dances all over the place. Constant “unable to connect to system” error messages. Halfway through a song and one speaker will cut out, comes back on and another one goes. It’s rare that I can get them all going at once.

LowEmphasis6836	1	12wb1ef	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12wb1ef/era_100_on_sonos_one_stand/	I’m looking to buy a pair of Era 100’s and I’d like to place them on stands, but the asking price of the Sonos stands feels like a ripoff. Unfortunately 3rd party stands seem to be a few months out, so I’m looking for alternatives. I noticed that the Sonos One stands have the power connector attached to the stand. I’m assuming that wouldn’t fit with the Era 100. (That would be too easy..)

Ledigu	3	12watko	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12watko/sonos_amp_still_recommended_in_2023/	"Hello everyone, I am thinking to build a 4.0.0 system using two passive bookshelf speakers with the Sonos Amp in the front and two Sonos One SLs in the back. Thereby I have the best of both worlds: Great stereo audio for music listening and the option to use the theater mode for movie watching with surrounds in the back.

Do you think that the Sonos Amp is still a good amplifier for that purpose for the next years to come or do you expect Sonos to release a new Amp generation soon with more and improved features? I am asking since it was released four years ago and it seems kind of old to me.

Miss_Aerith	3	12w6zm6	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12w6zm6/beam_sub_mini_or_arc/	"Hey all, I got a Sonos Roam a few months ago and have been addicted to using it. My parents have a few Sonos products at their house and I wanted to get into the Sonos eco system. I've been wanting to give my apartment a bit of a sound makeover, and since I'm starting a new job soon I figured I'd start thinking about it. Right now I have a roughly 50 inch TV with a Polk S1 soundbar underneath it. I mainly use the TV for playing games, watching Youtube and the occasional blu-ray. I'm thinking of upgrading my TV setup, starting with the sound. My main question is, should I go for an Arc or a Beam + a Sub Mini? My biggest concern is living in an apartment, I don't want to disturb my downstairs neighbors with a subwoofer, though good sound quality and immersion is important to me. I could go with the Arc, however I'm afraid it would be too large underneath my current TV. My room is small to medium sized with the TV placed on a media cabinet about 8 or so feet from the couch. I suppose another option would be just a Beam with something like an Era 100 in another room for more coverage of the apartment in total as I like to listen to music a lot.

Any feedback, tips, or ideas would be appreciated.

Edit: I went to a Best Buy with a Sonos demo and listened to multiple combinations. I think I'll go with the Beam + Sub Mini or a Beam and an Era 100 for another room just to add coverage through the apartment. The demo gave the option to disable the Sub mini and the change wasn't massive, however this was in a store and the demo content wasn't super bass heavy to begin with. So most likely I'll just start with the Beam and expand it as I feel the need to."	8	"[""jmbroady: For a small to medium sized room, the Beam Gen 2 with a Sub Mini will do wonders for you.  It really is a great little system.  Then eventually get some One SLs, Era 100s, or even Ikea Symfonisk bookshelf speakers for surrounds.  \n\nYou also have to consider what model TV you have and if it has eARC otherwise there's a chance you won't be able to use either the Beam Gen 2 or the Arc to its fullest potential."", ""Small_Assistance5944: For more immersive TV sound that won't disturb your downstairs neighbors, you may be better off starting with a Beam, then add surrounds before you get a sub. I have an older Beam Gen 1 with two Play:1s for surrounds in my 10 x 20 ft. carpeted living room which sounds great and I really don't feel the need for more bass. I also have Beam Gen 1 soundbars in two bedrooms which sound very good by themselves. If I was getting started with Sonos now, I would probably get the current Beam Gen 2 for my living room TV and two Era 100s to try in different rooms. For dedicated TV surrounds I would get a pair of Ones or Ikeas.\n\nFor dedicated surrounds you could save some money by getting Ones on sale or refurbished, or a pair of Ikea Symfonisk speakers. The Era 100s may be worth it if you really want the added bluetooth functionality or the optional line-in/ethernet adapter. Most reviews and listening tests suggest the Era 100s' improved sound quality is noticeable when they are used by themselves but not so much when used in stereo pairs or as dedicated surrounds.\n\nIf you add a pair of surround speakers you still have the option of switching them back and forth between dedicated surrounds, or separately with  grouped playback with the soundbar for fully independent volume control.\n\nWith the Arc and sub you may not get your full money's worth unless you have a large room and everything you watch or listen to supports dolby atmos and spatial audio. There's also a good chance you won't be able to get your money's worth out of an Arc and sub without turning it up loud enough to bother your neighbors."", 'Vise_9999: I just installed a Beam + Sub Mini + Ikea Symfonisk setup at our cottage/lake house and it sounds fantastic.  We have a 49"" TV limited by wall space so the Arc was overkill.  \n\nHighly recommended as it sounds fantastic... even got the wife\'s approval too.  :-)', 'tempturnipseller: I have a 55 inch TV and Arc looks just about right under the TV. If it’s 50 inch, Arc might be too wide. \n\nAlthough I had a Beam Gen 2 + Sub Mini prior to upgrading to Arc. I didn’t like Sub Mini that much because it really rumbled the floor and I don’t think the sound improvement is worth the risk. Arc sounds better for me and made me at ease.', ""Miss_Aerith: My current TV only has ARC, the TV I'm planning to replace it with has eARC. So at least for the time being, only ARC. I'm leaning towards the Beam Gen 2 with the Sub Mini. Figured I'd get some outside input. Thanks for the advice :)"", ""Redinho83: Do you think it's even worth getting a beam 2 if you don't have earch? Would you get benefits from music quality over beam 1 still?"", ""Miss_Aerith: Thanks for the input. I think I'm going to go for a Beam alone at least for now and maybe an Era 100 for another room in the apartment. I demo'd multiple combinations of speakers at a Best Buy and felt I'd be best off with a Beam."", 'diggardens: This is the correct answer. The ikea product is the best value/bang for buck in the ecosystem. I rate the Arc, at best 15% better than the Beam and the full sub at best 20% better than the mini. Go w the Beam - Mini Sub and add Ikea bookshelves as you go.\n\nAnd I have most modern Sonos products. Including a full Arc setup and a full Beam setup. Etc etc']"

I am planning my new home. And thinking of adding music options through out the house.

The house is ground + 2 floors with garden. 2nd floor will be guest bedroom so we can skip it.

My use case are
- Bedroom on first floor: Very low music at night for 30 mins in my bed room. Currently I use airpods for it.
    - My bedroom and kids room is upstair so announce everywhere e.g the food is ready will be a good option but not a very big use case. Currently I use facetime call for this purpose.
- Bathroom on 1st floor: currently I listen it on my iphone but I want to upgrade from that experience.
- Kitchen on ground floor: some light music while cooking.
    - May be having a screen in kitchen is good for recipes. I use my ipad/iphone for it currently and is mostly satisfied.
- Garden
- Smart speakers can act as doorbell too. 

I have couple of options:-
- Buy a move and take it everywhere with me in home. Only issue I find with it is that it may be on the other floor and I will have to go and fetch it many times during the day. The music quality with it will be great for my use cases. Costs 400 bucks.
- Buy 3 symfonisk and put one each in kitchen, bathroom and bed room. Garden will be missing. Will cost around 300 bucks.
- Buy 3 homepods and put it in bathroom and bed room. And put the kitchen homepod on battery dock and take it in garden on demand. Will cost 300+50 for battery dock. 350 in total.

Or any combination of above.
I don’t want to spend a ton and be mindful of my purchases.

I'm growing really tired of the half-assed quality control at Sonos, on the software side of things.  I've had my system for ten years with never a hiccup, until the last six months.  Now there will be a minor issue they try to quickly fix, and in the process they screw up three other things.  I expect better out of products in general, but especially at the Sonos price point!	3	"[""Texas_Tom: What problems have you had?

Stand in another and half the system disappears.\n\nNetwork tree shows everything connected and good to go. 80% of the time new products need to be added 3 times before they show up on the S2 app. It's worse than I've ever seen it.

Chubasc0	2	12vcn2d	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12vcn2d/single_same_configuration_for_tv_watching_music/	"Having researched easy to use setups for my technology challenged parents, I think the Sonos “Immersive Set with Beam” (includes Beam Gen2, Sub Mini, Era 100 x2) might be a solution for both watching TV & listening to music.  However, I don’t have personal experience with Sonos components, so appreciate any help or insights you might share.

I’m assuming setting up / configuring the audio for TV watching will be very simple using the Sonos app (I’ll do this for them).  But I’m unsure about whether the configuration should (or can) change for listening to music (ie disabling the sound bar).  Again, given that my parents are not tech savvy, any configuration / mode change (TV <-> Music) would need to be extremely simple…preferably using universal remote instead of Sonos app.

CONFIGURATION (planned, haven’t purchased yet):
- Television HDMI Arc or eArc to power on/off and volume control the speakers.
- Prefer to avoid using A/V receiver, instead using TV’s HDMI Arc functionality.
- Components connected to TV via HDMI include Sonos sound bar, cable TV box, AppleTV, Blu-Ray / CD (music) player.
- VHS tape player possibly connected via RCA cables (weird, I know…but parents are old).
- Wi-Fi connection for all components (TV, speakers, Cable Box, AppleTV).
- Music to be played via Bluetooth (from phones) and HDMI (Blu-Ray/CD player).

I own two Sonos One and two Sonos Five and a sub, all gen 2. We have an open floor plan so I have one Five in the kitchen and one in the living room. The sub is in the living room next to the TV.

I use the Ones in our cabin, one in the kitchen there (useful) and one in a bedroom (pretty useless). 

I am considering buying a Move for our cabin, to use in the kitchen for better sound but also outside on our deck. 

I don’t really know where to begin with planning what to place where, and I’m wondering if anyone could help me with how I should be using this probably pretty decent starter kit to get the most for my money. Thanks!"	1	['blackarrow7302: i am guessing all your speakers are used only for music and none for home theater. the ones can be paired as stereos and you can add the sub for your musiccin your living room. you can use a five in your kitchen and another five in your bedroom. and as you said, you can buy a mive for your cabin.']

Please post any links if I missed the response and as always thanks in advance. 

I use Amazon Echo devices throughout my home for audio.  I have them grouped together to be able to play the same song throughout the home.

We did our backyard last year and at the recommendation of install team decided to go with Sonos.

Both systems work great independent of each other.

Is it possible to combine these two systems so that they play the same music inside and outside the home at the same time?  

If yes, is this accomplished through the Amazon Echo or through the Sonos app?"	4	['GuitarSuperstar: No, this isn’t possible.', 'Doazanz: Feed a Sonos Line-in with an Echo Dot and group everything.

Should I get one more Symfonisk so that I can create a stereo pair? Or should I just get the subwoofer? Or should I buy a pair of the Sonos One SL? 
Obviously im not a sound connoisseur, but decent sound for music is more important than it is for watching movies.

At the moment I have the Beam and Symfonisk placed with some distance in my livingroom, which gives me a bit of volume for music. But I can't use them both for watching movies, it just sounds wierd since they are in mono.

 YES you can in fact link your Era 100 via Bluetooth to a TV as use it as the audio source.

And yes, you can also set them up as a Stereo Pair and STILL link them via Bluetooth to your TV for audio output. The sound will work in Stereo.

Now, this won't apply to everyone as it's going to really depend on your TV, however ALL the Sony Google TV models from 2020 onwards support this.

Unable to try other brands, so if you're able to test sending audio from your own TV to headphones via Bluetooth at home and it works, please post the TV model below!

Either way, using the Era 100 as Bluetooth speakers is entirely possible from the TV and latency is practically non existent in my own testing, your results may vary! Turning the TV off switches the speakers immediately back to WiFi only.

Turning the TV back on, the speakers immediately switch back to Bluetooth so no input required. Remarkably smooth."	8	"[""WinterPublic2445: Using it on a TCL Android TV.

1682155163.0	22-Apr-2023 02:19:23	What to do with my OG Playbar?	TheLordNyuk	2	12v0eqd	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12v0eqd/what_to_do_with_my_og_playbar/	"Hey there /r/sonos,

Long time Sonos user and I love it, but have managed to tie myself in knots over the ongoing role of my OG Playbar in my system, so thought I would turn to the community for a sanity check.

First – a bit about my setup overall.

All this is in a small townhouse, so physical room space is not massive.

**Living Room / Kitchen:**  Currently 5.1 - Beam / Sub Mini / 2 x Play:1 as surrounds. This is attached to a Sony Android TV with HDMI ARC. Main video use cases are the Android apps for streaming services (Netflix, Stan, Youtube, MLB TV) and very occasional terrestrial TV or casting using to the TV using the built in ChromeCast. No external DVD/BluRay/Cable boxes.  Spotify Connect to the Beam is the major music use case, or using the Sonos app directly for a network attached music library – but we will also use the built in Android TV apps for music too, for example when we have company and the visuals are useful. We don’t use Apple Music, which I feel is important to this scenario.

**Guest Bedroom / WFH Office / Gaming**– This room wears a lot of hats - the joys of small townhouse living. Currently just a One, for music use only – mainly podcasts while I’m working. The room has another Sony Android TV, also with HDMI ARC, which gets similar video use as above, as well as being my WFH monitor and my PS4 gaming screen. Both my WFH docking station and PS4 are connected by HDMI. WFH PC Audio through speakers is mostly irrelevant but would be a nice to have. Another gaming PC or next gen console might happen up here in time, but I’m not counting on it.

**Other useful info:**

* We very infrequently use Alexa anywhere in the house, but wouldn’t want to rule it out either if possible – except I disable the mics in bedrooms.
* We would like our guests to be able to play their own music, or use the guest TV with good surround sound too. I do have a guest VLAN on my Wifi, but it's mostly trusted family who stays.
* Most other rooms have a One for Spotify Connect / Sonos music – we get the whole house bouncing on cleaning day. :)
* I’m more an IT guy than an AV guy, so while I’m no dummy, I’m not completely up to speed on all the various supported protocols, standards, etc between Optical/HDMI, DTS, Dolby, etc.
* I’m definitely entrenched in the Sonos ecosystem as you can see.. but I’m not really looking to add anything else (like an Arc for example) right now… got a wedding to try and pay for first!
* I've used the upgrade credit from the Playbar to add the Sub Mini - relevant if I'm considering selling the Playbar.

I’ve had my Playbar sitting in a box for a while now, as in my old house (and before the Beam) this was my main living room soundbar – of which I vague have memories of not being use with Spotify Connect as well as the (expected) AirPlay, without grouping it with another AirPlay enabled speaker first.

I was thinking I’d sell the Playbar, but it's just such a good system, so I’ve just unboxed it and set it up again, and I can now use it with Spotify Connect – or maybe I could all along?

So, my **questions** are:

* Where is the best spot for my Playbar?
   * Even though I’m quite happy with the Beam setup, am I better off putting the Playbar back into service in the living room in place of the Beam?
   * Or should I connect it up in the Guest room, and if so, will I get the audio passed through from the PS4 or laptop connected to the TV by over HDMI through the TV optical to the Playbar?
   * Could I also pair this with some Symfonisks to have an over the top guest room / very reasonable PS4 setup – but I'm not sure - will surround audio get passed from HDMI inputs over the Optical output and to the Playbar?
   * Is the Playbar better off connected to the TV with the least number of external inputs (eg zero, in the Living room)?
   * Is selling it and finally saying goodbye to the device that started it all the right move?
* I don’t use anything that relies on AirPlay2… right? Sometimes various apps get a bit confusing in iOS as to whether you’re using AirPlay or another method – confusion I want to avoid for my fiancée, and my own by extension, my own wellbeing.
   * I could add an AirPlay receiver app (such as AirReceiver, which I've dabbled with) to the Android TVs to bridge any gaps there, I guess.
* Is there anything else I haven’t thought of?
* Am I overthinking this? (Answer: Almost definitely yes)

Anyway, I hope there is enough info here to help set the scene, and I look forward to some input from you all – if you have any questions about it all I’m happy to add them in replies :)

Thanks in advance! :)"	1	['TheLordNyuk: Anyone? Bueller?']

So I could listen music in stereo +sub and then switch to movie beam+sub. The space is small so I could put the mini at the center so that would make sense but  I wanted to know if this is possible for the system and would it be seamless?

I received my Sub Mini yesterday, and having some trouble connecting it to my system. 

When I plugged it in, the status LED is white, so I supposed I need to reset it.

Plugged it out from power, hold Join button (the only button on Sub Mini) while plugging it in. The status LED began to blink white, but after a while it just came back to fixed white light.

I have tried this many time, but still haven't been able to reset it in order to pair with my system.

I then plugged ethernet port in to it, and was able to find its IP in my network, and Web Interface (port 1400) works just fine (REPORTED as Sub Mini, too!), so it's not totally dead, but it seems like there isn't a way to reset it from Web Interface.

Have anyone experienced this problem (on both Sub Mini and other devices), and any tips? Appreciate.

Cheers!"	0	[]

Quicheanon	1	12uomzv	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12uomzv/arc_upgrade/	I know I won’t get the upgrade discount - but thinking of going from Beam2 to Arc.  I have pair Era300 as surrounds and a Sub Mini. One of the reasons- and please tell me if I’m wrong- is I was listening to Dolby/Atmos songs and the eras and sub were great but I could tell the Beam wasn’t on the same level. Feels like there needs to be more separation from the main source speaker. Drums/voice/bass compacted in there and then you’d get this incredible flourish of guitar or keys or backing vocals from the Eras. The Arc would solve this, yes?  More speakers= more separation? I know a bug determining factor is the room itself. It’s big. 20x20 but the ceiling is vaulted - but only about 5 ft, maybe less. Knowing that - will the difference be noticeable if I go with the arc?  Thanks for any advice in advance	4	['legallypurple: I think that makes sense. The Era 300s obviously can pair with the Beam, but I think it is meant to go with the Arc.', 'GuitarSuperstar: Yes, the Arc will make a big difference especially with the height channels. The Beam’s smaller size and lack of upward firing drivers can’t match the Era 300s performance. The Arc will definitely add more balance to the room.', 'Electrical-Street-16: Papo easy say easy do 😂 \n\nARC 2 ERA 300 then you may want to look for the Sub even open box then it’s Game over\n\n✌️', 'Electrical-Street-16: Papo easy say easy do 😂 \n\nARC 2 ERA 300 then you may want to look for the Sub even open box then it’s Game over\n\n✌️']

DrivingDegree	0	12uny0f	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12uny0f/is_sonos_a_good_fit_for_me/	"I am looking for a better speaker/surround system than what I currently own while reducing cable clutter, and Sonos seems like a good option. My budget is around 1000usd.

My setup is a little weird. I have a small room which is around 12x12ft but may move to a bigger space in the future. Current Speakers are Logitech Z906 (I know, not well regarded among most audio communities), connected to:

1. Windows PC via Optical using a Soundblaster X sound card, which provides permanent DTS and Dolby Digital audio.

2. 2019 TV via Optical (it also has ARC, no eARC, but I have never used this feature), which is also connected via HDMI to my PC, and I sometimes use it as a secondary display for gaming or even watching content from my PC.

3. Chromecast Audio via 3.5mm Jack to enable the speakers to do Spotify streaming from any device within the same Wi-Fi network.

From what I have read, I am thinking of a Beam Gen 2 + Sub Mini, or Beam Gen 2 + 2 Era 100's, but I am not sure if any of these would allow me to switch between my PC and TV.

Any opinions or suggestions?"	2	['formerswimmer32: The sonos beam has one connection via HDMI (with an optical adapter for those that use that connection). Unfortunately there is only one so if you wanted to switch between wired connections that wouldn’t be possible. However, you can stream music from the PC to the sonos speakers wirelessly depending on what app you are using (I use iTunes) or connect the pc to the TV via HDMI or as a wireless monitor and then use that as the default audio device (it will then play through sonos since that’s the TV’s audio out device). Note: I have a beam V1 so they may have added additional HDMI ports.', 'DrivingDegree: Thank you! I ended up getting a Beam and Sub Mini :)']

Sound is great. I wanted to add surrounds and my wife knew that so she got me a pair of ONE SL's (white of course). I hooked them up even after debating returning (because the Era line came out a week after purchase). First thing I did was true play them. They're mounted about 5 feet behind the main center couch on the walls behind. (10 foot ceilings) mounted about 7 feet up, angled down toward listening area. First thing I tried was music. System sounded awesome! Huge improvement. However watching regualr TV is very underwhelming (music is probably 20% of the usage  in the family room)  . Watched a couple scenes in atmos of  several action films on Netflix. (I realize the ones don't use that)  and sound was better at a higher volume. They are set up as ""surrounds"" but it's night and day hiw much better the system sounds with music compared to movies/TV.   I also have the five in my screened in back porch and that speaker is incredible even as a stand alone. 
I'm considering switching up my setup. Would the Era 100s be much of an upgrade to the ones as surrounds? Or 300's?  Or maybe even 2 fives as surrounds (is that even pososble) 

If I did make a switch. Could I use my ONES in my bedroom by themselves for tv watching? Or do you need a soundbar first connected to the TV to be able to add the ones?

Anyone with a Beam 2 specifically running into issues? That’s what I have and noticing most people here seem to be adding it to an Arc and loving the improvement.. I’ve been having to tinker non-stop to get the sound balanced. Basically, quiet scenes are too quiet and loud scenes are too loud, with surrounds needing to be maxed out in the app to even get much of an effect from them.. that’s not even touching on how quiet they sound overall for 5.1 content.. is this just me or due to the Beam maybe? I want to love these so badly but my honest review right now is the Ones I had before were just easier to use and generally sounded better for the majority of content in 5.1 and stereo, with definitely some improved performance on 7.1 Atmos, but overall experience just doesn’t feel worth the cost right now.

My non-audiophile guess is these haven’t been calibrated very well for home theater rears and also need the middle driver to be activated at least a little bit?"	8	"['Electrical-Street-16: Yes, I notice after the latest update 15.3 volumes needs to increased, however I did TruePlay.

Waiting until end of return policy in hope that Sonos has a fix that makes the 300’s more consistent, otherwise will probably return them and go back to my Ones, until Sonos gets them right.', 'Aware_Yak: Returned mine (was using with the arc) for the same reason.', 'legallypurple: It’s likely that they are designed to work with the Arc and less so with the Beam. Having said that, I have read posts where people have used the 300s as surrounds for the Beam and really liked it.', 'Think_Juggernaut8968: Most likely it’s a bug, i think i’ve read it somewhere that there are issues with volume control on IOS devices with ERA’s', ""Comfortable_Ad3005: I really haven't experienced volume issues with the Era 300s (paired with Arc) leaving them at 0 for TV audio after Trueplay. If you're upgrading from the Ones, you're not going to always notice sound coming from the 300s, especially in stereo content, because they aren't constantly beaming audio directly at you. So if you crank the volume up to +10 to make sure you're always hearing something, it's going to be too loud when they are really supposed to kick in.\n\n\n While the switch to the 300s was jarring at first because I had gotten used to the Ones, it really is the Ones that don't operate well as HT rears in my opinion. The 300s offer a much closer surround experience to what I used to have with a traditional Klipsch 7.1 setup and I definitely don't want to go back to the Ones, expensive as the 300s are. When there is ambient noise or other effects that call for the surround channels, the 300s produce a wider and taller soundstage that the Ones simply can't compete with."", 'deorex33: Yep I have the mini sub and it’s very hard to calibrate a balanced listening experience where the bass and overall volume is stabilized watching a film, in quiet scenes you think you need more “oomph” but then if an action scene kicks it it can get comically loud and so it’s just a constant game of moving the dial around in the app for volume, surround and sub audio levels, I don’t think there’s a way to currently have one setting make the experience feel good for all different media/scene types so it’s just a lot of Sonos app twiddling these days lol', 'deorex33: Yeah considering doing the same but kind of ready to just throw in the towel, I added the sub mini like 2 weeks before getting the Eras in and that was a feeling of joy as it immediately made the setup feel enhanced and I think did a good job allowing beam + ones to focus on the finer details, but adding the Eras has just been a totally different experience so far and for the cost just doesn’t seem worth it at the moment.. I have a feeling they’ll get it right eventually but we’re like at least 4 months away from any significant updates as they’re going to pull in our user data (including return rates) to analyze and correct issues, and I just don’t think this amount of investment should give you a product tester experience, they should have done a lot more QA before marketing them as rear surround replacements, they don’t even seem to have consistently messaged how to position them in user manuals/marketing materials so feels like maybe they don’t even know what’s best, and I do think the center driver being disabled seems like a decision that will get tweaked eventually, some of these issues do seem to come from that choice.']"

1682110429.0	21-Apr-2023 13:53:49	Decided to jump to the Sonos train, €500 budget. Where should I start, Era 300?	Stonneddd	8	12ui06i	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12ui06i/decided_to_jump_to_the_sonos_train_500_budget/	"I currently have an Edifier 1280DB hooked up to my turntable and my iPad via Bluetooth, which I have really enjoyed so far, at least for its price.

Recently, the wife said I should spoil myself, so I decided to jump on the surround sound system train. The thing is, my budget is €500 (+/- €100) at the moment, and I am really confused about all the Sonos options. I can spend another €500 next year if I am satisfied with the experience.

My main focus is to listen to digital and vinyl music and have that room-filling sound. I will probably listen at low volumes, as I live in an apartment. I also have an Apple TV 4K, but I'm not really concerned about TV content at the moment.

My room is about 7×5 meters wide (could be smaller, like 6×4, not really sure)

1. **Single Era 300 or Single 5 (2nd or 3rd gen)**  
First, I've decided to buy a 2nd hand Play:5, but then I realized there is a new model called Era 300, which in theory should be more future-proof with the Dolby Atmos support and all the reviews I've read mentions its mind-blowing performance. Then I leaned more to Era 300.
2. **Two One SL's or Era 100 or Any Combination Ikea Symphonisks**  
Then I saw people recommend buying 2 pairs of speakers instead of just buying one to have that surround experience, which supposedly makes a lot of difference. But I am more impressed by the premise of the Era 300 (I also want to experience that experience of “mind-blowing sound”) and want my setup to be as future-proof as possible. And  it would be hard for me to replace systems along the way since Sonos is not officially in Turkey and 2nd hand market is very limited.
3. **Sonos Beam + 2 Ikea Symphonisk Bookshelf as Surrounds**  
Then I realized I can buy refurbished Sonos Beam 1st gen and 2 IKEA bookshelf speakers as surrounds, then I would have a nice budget home theater setup. But in this case my turntable would be useless, and I am not really sure how can I add an Era 300 or Five in future to this combination on a single room because surround setup of the soundbars are supposedly limited. (1 sub + 2 surrounds AFAIK). In that case, the turntable speaker would not be included in the home theater setup, then it would be an overkill investment for just listening vinyl.

**TL;DR:** I have a €500 budget with a possibility of another €500 in the coming year and I want the best of Sonos experience.  My room (apartment) is around 30 square meters (322.917 square feet) is and has one TV and one turntable. What would you do/buy in my position?

I get the error, that Amazon Music is in use on another device, when I play Amazon Music via Sonos App. It happened on the second day on my new Era300 and only Sonos product so far. It worked seamlessly on the first day.  
I have Amazon Music Unlimited PersonalI have no Alexa / Echo devices.  
What I tried so far:  
- Delete Amazon Music account in Sonos App.  
- Remove authorization in Amazon account.  
- Remove any registered devices in Amazon.    account 
- delete Sonos App.  
- remove era 300.  
- reset era 300.  
- install Alexa app and add Sonos as skill.  
- disable/enable Sonos skill in Alexa app.   
- reset Alexa, Amazon Music links and apps.  
- all of the above and start completely fresh.     
   
Result at any point is the above error, with one exception:   
As soon as I removed Sonos App and afterwards the  Amazon Music app, the Era 300 started playing a Amazon Music song of my playlist. I was unable to change anything, because I wasn't connected to the Era 300. This only happened once and I can't reproduce it.   
As soon as I installed everything again, I couldn't play any song.   

I can play Amazon Music from any device: Laptop, Smartphone, Desktop and stream it to Chromecast. The error appears via the Sonos App only.  

Can anyone help please?  
Thanks in advance.  
Best regards."	1	['blender311: I know that if I go from using the Roku Amazon Music app to the Sonos app, this will happen to me if I don’t wait long enough.  Sometimes I need to start a different  app on the Roku']

I use the Google voice assistant on a Sonos One speaker. Twice in the last weeks, the Google assistant has spontaneously started speaking about dogs. The first time, it said something along the lines of ”I sometimes wonder what it feels like to be a dog”. The second time, it said something about the wonders of how dogs fall in love.

Both times, this occurred while I was watching a tv show, leading me to think that the assistant was inadvertently prompted by a voice from the tv. However, these events are not listed in the My Activity-history. All other voice activated events are listed. So I’m not sure what the hell is going on.

Can anyone help me find an explanation for this? It’s curious to be that both spontaneous events were about dogs.

1682048685.0	20-Apr-2023 20:44:45	Looking to buy sonos question.	funkspiel56	1	12tpbdh	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12tpbdh/looking_to_buy_sonos_question/	"So I'm really interested in getting into the sonos ecosystem. I'm familiar with it cause of family who have it but they have older models.  

I have this really old speaker system for my bedroom a lg  LFA840, just two speakers. The've held up well and have a ton of  bass. But they are overdue for a replacement and I think slowly breaking. 

Would like to keep stereo audio which means pairs of era 100s. But worried about the bass which is why I like the idea of the 5. I could  go with a pair of 100s with a mini sub but then I lose out on the volume if I want to really turn it up. 

Good bass is key for me as I like  house/electronic music. I seem to have made up my mind already due to budget and desire for stereo audio. I thinking two era 100s and buy a mini sub at a later date when I get more money. I can deal with the quiet 100s vs a 5 simply cause I'm still living in apartments etc. 

Thoughts? What are yall doing?"	16	"[""ithinkibanana: 5's are overkill for a bedroom IMHO"", 'toodeephoney: If this is for a bedroom apartment, then go with a pair of 100s + sub mini.', 'funkspiel56: Sidenote: seems like tons of people are going  for sonos 300s?....', 'SadElkBoy: Buy the fives or another speaker company.

If you have room to give it some space a single Era 300 sounds fantastic and has decent bass.

Or just like soundstage/space.', 'zugshad: due to atmos.. for stereo only, the 100s outperform supposedly and for nearly half the price or more. Fives still being the best', 'funkspiel56: Yeah reason I’m curious about the smaller speaker volume is cause I’ve maxed out a older Sonos one before and the audio deteriorates when that happens. That being said odds of doing that in current living area is way lower so it’s less of a topic for me\n\nFives are reallly nice but don’t think I can buy a pair of them at the current time. But one five could be a step into the system', 'Mirthgiver: Most people say they are nothing special at low volumes so you would never get the full experience in a bedroom.', 'hughesy01611: I have fives in my bedroom no problem.

But then again, I don’t know what your volume decibel level preferences are 😀', 'funkspiel56: Im not trying to blow my ears out...already have hearing damage from house bands and shows. But I guess where thats where the sub mini comes into play as it can add the quality bass. I like to feel the music as opposed to it being stupid loud.', 'CuzFeeshe: This may work well for you then.  The sub mini should be carrying a lot of that load for the 100s.  If I get to even 50% volume half the house is shaking.', ""funkspiel56: Just picked up a 100...quality is nice. Quirks of sonos ecosystem will take some time to get used to (not really a fan of the app). \n\nIm doing a side by side comparison of the lg LFA840 (old setup) and the 100. Obviously not fair fight, but stereo is all I think I'm missing. The lgs handle their volume a bit better and have way more bass but I can feel they are warping the audio adding in almost a reverb and tons of bass whereas the sonos feel more neutral. Stereo pair would be nuts."", 'CuzFeeshe: Yes, that is what the sub mini is for.  Once you add that in the balance will most likely shift.  Sonos subs are very nice.']"

Long time Sonos owner. I had a full s1 system with 1 incompatible product (original play 5). I've been in the process of moving and the whole system has been boxes. 

I bought a new Arc + sub and setup s2 and been using my TV. I hooked up my old Beam and play 1 both s2 compatible and tried to upgrade it to s2. It failed with it trying to open the s2 app seeing the arc already and not doing anything. One time I s2 app actually only showed me be and play1. I got upgrade and now those 2 devices show up correctly in my s2 app. However now I can't see my arc and sub.

Today I have a Marshall woburn II, But in some way it doesnt fit my new apartment soundwise. 

I cant get the placement right to sound as good that it used to. 

So I think its time to try out Sonos.

I like it when the sound is clear but still can fill the room with effortless bass.

I like when the bass is still there even on low volume.

For my rather small room, the bass of the two eras is more than enough - very nicely balanced, punchy but not overpowering. Stereo is also better on two eras than one five because you get true separation.

Thinking about getting a Sonos Move for traveling. I currently have a Roam but want to get bigger sound from the speaker. 

I wanted to ask anyone with a Move for some feedback: 

1- How do you like the sound? Lows, highs, etc.

2- How much does the sound differ over Bluetooth versus Wi-Fi? 

3- Do you have any issues trying to connect the Move to. Hotel networks? This will be bought for traveling so will always be on new hotel networks. 

4- It’s certainly a bigger speaker, so what are your thoughts on its size for portability, and it’s build quality as it’s going to get thrown around a little during travel. 

Thanks for any help!!"	16	"[""j_nak: The Move is much, much better sounding than the Roam.  It is much bigger and more expensive, so I would hope it sounds better. \n\nWifi sound is a bit better, but Bluetooth is pretty decent.  Not big enough of a difference to tell with casual/background listening.\n\nEven travelling with my Roam, I don't switch it to the hotel wifi, It's a bit of a pain.  Just use Bluetooth and put your phone on hotel wifi if you don't want to use data.  \n\n I don't travel with the Move as it's too large. Plus, travel always risks damage and it's a lot easy to stomach some dings on the Roam vs the Move.  The grill on the Move is prone to dents - mine has a small dent from an unknown and unnoticed incident.  I think the Roam is better suited to travel."", ""PenoineAddict: i pack it in my checked bag when i travel for work. \n\nIt's worth the hassle/cost for the sound. Wifi is better, but as a bt speaker it is the best bt speaker i've come across. You can stream upto 24bit/48khz only with wifi. \n\nHotel wifi will not work seamlessly bc of the typical hotel wifi portal login screen. You can get around this two ways. \n\n1)Spoof the mac of the move to your laptop, provision hotel wifi on ur laptop, turn off ur laptop wifi and unspoof mac. Then connect ur phone and provision hotel wifi and then you need to connect ur move to the network like normal. \n\n2)Set up a local wifi network with a portable router/ap. They cost like 40$ and ur move will always auto connect no issues. \n\nIt is heavy, but the battery kicks ass and the weight gives it a very dense/expensive vibe. i've left mine out on my balcony during a snow storm and a few other rainy days; it's working just as great. I have dropped it over the last couple years soo many times and it just has a single ding on a corner. If you plan on bringing it on ur carry-on,and it fits inside the carry on, then you'll be fine if it's a two day trip. Anything more and u want to check a bag bc u need the sonos move and the charger for it. You can not use most usb c charging bricks, i have never seen a device so particular on the power source. \n\n\nThe highlight for me is that the battery is replacable unlike every other speaker. I would buy it again and is probably my fav sonos speaker after i learned how to work around the tiny quirks."", 'bso45: 1 slaps\n\n2 no real difference, it depends on the audio source\n\n3 it will probably be an issue because the Sonos probably won’t be able to handle the login\n\n4 it’s pretty hefty. It fits in a backpack but I wouldn’t take it hiking or anything', ""parkyeonggyu: depending on how long I stay in a hotel, I will bring my own personal router (apple airport express works great). I set the SSID and password to the same as my home network and the Sonos Roams connects to it without having to update/change anything in the S2 app. 2 Roams in stereo is not a bad combo. I would try that before getting one Move. 2 Roam SL's is still cheaper than 1 Move. \n\ngetting the AirPort Express set up with the LAN in the hotel is usually another mess if there is no LAN cable port in the room, but the best way I have found to do it is connect the laptop to the hotel wifi and internet share from the laptop to the AirPort Express with a cable to create the personal wifi network that my Roams can connect to (this is all on Mac OS). \n\nIf your travel is not hotel based (ie camping/hiking), then all this is a moot point and the wi-fi stuff is not important and 1 Move on BT will be much better (but also much heavier and bulkier) than 1 Roam on BT (2 Roams can't be stereo or even doubled on BT, which does not make sense to me)."", 'kidtexas: I love mine. Sounds great: a lot better than the Roam and a little better than a One. I’d take it on a car trip but not a plane.

It sounds much more “full” than 2 Roams in stereo (although they would be easier to pack). Mine also has a mystery dent, but the sound is pristine. \n\nAnother vote for rigging up your own router. I use my Move for white noise at night and with a music alarm to wake up - and neither would work over Bluetooth. Turns out that Eero now has a feature called “eero Internet Backup” that you can use to get an eero router on the hotel Wi-Fi, even if it’s not plugged into anything.', 'nintendomech: The move imo it’s too big for traveling.

It sounds great enough over Bluetooth, and this is an added benefit if you go somewhere and want other people to connect/play music.  It is easy to pack and it travels in my carry on with all my clothes etc etc (I do pack light..).  I strongly recommend it and think its feasible.\n\nIt will definitely add weight to packing though, fyi.  Not sure what the weight is, I consider it manageable.', ""PerrinSLC: Thanks for the feedback.  I picked up a Move and am setting it up now.

Especially if you're traveling international"", 'PerrinSLC: Thanks for the heads up on the cases.  I bought the Move, and also got a case for when we do take it traveling.  Hopefully that helps.', 'PenoineAddict: The only danger with lithium batteries is if they short and catch fire. That is not something that would happen unless you buy unregulated chinese tech like hoverboards or are the last remaining Galaxy Note 7 enthusiast. \n\nIt is not a hazard in any legitimate way. Legally you are allowed to check pretty much everything you can carry on except for external batteries and vape pens because they are largely made using the cheapest chinese lithium cells. \n\nThe move has a 36watt battery and faa limits devices to 100watts.

This is my very first day as a Sonos user. I've bought a pair of Era 100, a Sub Mini, and a pair of Moves. Everything sounds really good and I'm really really excited. 

On the other side, I'm a bit struggling with the use of AirPlay. 

What I understand is that you have to have all devices connected on the WiFi, together with your mobile device (I have an iPhone). The songs are streamed directly from the device to all selected speakers.

If I turn off the WiFi on my phone (or my phone gets randomly disconnected) everything drops. That's annoying.

I'm coming from an older setup, where I used a pair of passive speakers wired to an amplifier (Onkyo). The amplifier is a network stereo receiver that supports various audio streaming services, including Spotify. So basically, I can select any song from my phone, send it to my Onkyo and then let it play. All without the phone being connected over the WiFi (it could be even turned off). 

**Question: is there any way to do the same with my Sonos speakers?** 

Also, having the songs played out of my phone, it consumes all the battery rather quickly...

Thanks for all your responses!"	10	"['bso45: Use the Sonos app to start the music\n\nAirPlay only works with your phone connected to WiFi', 'ardtsky: Use Spotify connect and play music from the Spotify app, shall work as well', ""alefkandro: Thanks for your reply!

The Sonos Ones that I ordered on EBay for $200 arrived today. I ran home from work to set them up and try em out and wow - pretty amazing how awesome they sound along with the Beam! As you can see, I’m in a pretty small space (please excuse the mess!) and I decided against a console table behind the couch. The door is sealed shut and doesn’t ever open - goes to another poor souls bedroom that will likely hate me…

I ordered some mounts from Amazon and I’m thinking I’ll mount them to the wall about 7” above the couch - where they are placed now - at a slightly downward angle.

Any input is greatly appreciated! Thanks!!"	2	"[""GadgetronRatchet: You want to try to keep them mounted near ear level!

I am considering returning the era 300s and going back to the Ones for a couple reasons and was hoping someone can talk me off the cliff…
(Before anyone asks, everything is setup correctly in my system)

1. I am not a fan of the design and my wife objects to the size of speakers (eyesore in our main living area)

2. While (luckily for me) price isn’t a huge factor, I just don’t feel it’s worth the $1200 upgrade (including stands). I would say the 300s definitely sound better than the Ones, but just not $1200 better imo. Maybe my ears aren’t as fine tuned as others though especially as it relates to the upward firing speakers. 

3. The content I mainly watch isn’t in Atmos to fully utilize the 300s. I’m a big sports and TV show watcher (HBO type tv shows), and typically those items are 5.1 max. 

Just my two cents. I will say, the second sub made a huge difference for me (one sub in the front and another behind my couch). I would prioritize that upgrade over the 300s."	65	"['Dutch_Bartman: Seems to me a clear decision. More cons than pro’s. And making wife happy probably counts for two!

Looking at getting a soundbar for home tv & films viewing. 

I can get a good deal on a Sonos Beam (gen 1). Other option would be soundbar & subwoofer and rear wireless speakers, something like the [Sony ht-s40r](https://www.whathifi.com/news/sony-launches-the-ht-s40r-soundbar-with-wireless-rear-speakers). 

Which would I get a better audio experience from? I'm not likely to buy a Sonos subwoofer as they're crazily expensive.

Seems like Atmos tracks are significantly more bassy than the usual stereo ones. To the point where I am slightly worried about pissing off my neighbors...

While spatial audio does sound good with my Arc + Sub Mini + 2x One SL, the equaliser seems to be all over the place with a clearly V shaped sound profile. Does the Sonos system even use the equaliser when playing Atmos content?

Edit: Tested the following tracks on Apple Music (both Atmos and normal stereo), also tested against Spotify for good measure

2. Take on Me by a-ha
3. Anti-Hero by Taylor Swift

Over the years I have bought a lot of sonos speakers, a sub and a couple soundbars. My decision to stick to sonos for all things audio has been primarily driven by convenience and sound quality. I don’t really care about the voice assistants.

I am looking for just 1 new speaker for my office room and am confused between Era 100 and 300.

I hardly use sonos app for music playback. This is not a problem for my existing arc, sub and 2 ones as I have Apple TV that can route Spatial Audio or Atmos content to this setup.

However, for my office room, I would want a speaker that will primarily play from my phone or mac over airplay. 

As spatial audio over airplay is not supported, should I get the cheaper Era 100 over the 300?

Or should I break out of sonos and buy the HomePod 2?"	7	"['GuitarSuperstar: If you are only connecting over AirPlay and don’t care about music in spatial audio, get a stereo pair of Era 100s or a pair of One SLs.', 'bitsnotatoms: Or consider a 5, if you want only one speaker and you pan to use it only with Airplay.

I’ve read various forums that talk about how Sonos and Unifi do not play well together… but shouldn’t a hardwired connection be flawless?

Sonos uses the original Spanning-tree protocol (STP) and your unifi devices are probably running rapid spanning-tree protocol (RSTP). It's possible that even with multiple hardwired links, it is still using the wireless between speakers rather than utilizing your wired links. Specifically I would see if you can set the priority on your Unifi devices from default of 32768 to 28672, and change it to use legacy (STP) path costs, if that isn't possible then you could try switching the unifi from RSTP to STP, still change the priority."", 'DogTownR: My approach has been to hardwired as many speakers as possible, use UniFi Wi-Fi for the remainder, associating them explicit with the nearest AP.

I ordered several Symfonisks due to the new reduced pricing. I just received three speaker covers and am quite happy with them (this isn't sponsored in any way). Happy enough that I've ordered three more Symfonisks and will be ordering more covers.\n\nCaveat that I'm no audiophile, but to my ears they sound just like the Ikea covers. I don't notice any difference in sound quality. There are a couple of other places making covers but they seemed to be located in Europe and, since I live in the US, it seemed easier to order domestically to minimize shipping issues.\n\nThe quality of the printing seems great. I mean, it's on fabric so it's not going to look like a regular print. Maybe there are some colors that won't come through well but I'm pretty happy with how mine turned out. I'll be curious to see over time if it attracts dust or what not, but should be super easy to run a handheld vacuum over it.\n\nThe first order I placed came damaged; UPS had bent the package badly and the cardboard backing for the covers was bent beyond my ability to straighten it. Symfonx was super responsive and sent out replacements, and changed their packing to be more robust. I was really grateful for the quick response.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions. But the executive summary is that the covers look great and sound great (to me, anyway) and the customer support seemed top notch. I'm still thinking about where to mount them permanently, so I apologize for the poor quality pictures."", 'pbsurrey: Unisk have a good rep and seem cheaper for the custom option. Haven’t used them yet but was planning to!', 'PanicLogically: are you using your Symfonics as rears for a sound bar or as stand alones?', ""phr3dly: *At the moment* I am using them as standalone. I am planning to replace two Sonos One surrounds with a couple Symfonisks once I figure out the best way to mount them. The sound bar is an Arc and I've got two subs there as well.\n\nIt's unlikely to be ideal, because the wall on which I'm mounting them has a sliding barn door which limits the mounting locations for a picture (my Ones are on stands), but like I said I'm not an audiophile and my TV room is definitely not ideal for acoustics regardless.""]"

1681826899.0	18-Apr-2023 07:08:19	Spotify songs skipping (I may have stumped Sonos support)	ylenroc	2	12qo97r	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12qo97r/spotify_songs_skipping_i_may_have_stumped_sonos/	"I'm taking a shot here that maybe someone else has had a similar issue/problem. I am a long-time user of Sonos, with a decent size setup (roughly 17 Sonos devices scattered about the house). I have not had many issues over the years, but one has recently cropped up that is making me crazy.

One of my main uses for Sonos is to combine songs from multiple sources into one big queue, using the Sonos (S2) app. For example, I’ll have a queue that is made up of roughly 15,000 songs from my music library (hard drive on my home computer); roughly 9,000 songs from Spotify (7 Spotify playlists that have in the neighborhood of 1200 songs in each); about 100 songs from Bandcamp and another 100-150 or so from Amazon music.  The queue is in shuffle mode and played on multiple speakers in my house, usually grouped together.

The issue is this – when a Spotify song follows a song that is from my music library, Amazon or Bandcamp, it will play for 30-45 seconds and then skip to the next song. No error message or any other kind of popup. If that song is followed by another Spotify song, that subsequent song will play fine. All non-Spotify songs play fine.

This started happening about 2 months ago. I’ve had no change in ISP (Xfinity 1.2GB) nor any additions/deletions to my Sonos setup in that time. One of my devices is a Boost hard wired into the gateway. I spent several hours with support where they noticed IP conflicts and some interference. I ended up replacing the ethernet cable from the Boost to the Gateway, rebooted many of the individual Sonos speakers and subwoofers and even used an Xfinity Xfi mesh extender pod to hard wire my Playbase. I also re-booted my gateway many times during the whole process, sending them diagnostic reports along the way. All of the interference and cable issues went away, but the Spotify skipping problem still exists. Frustrating, to say the least.

Although the support techs were very nice, I simply couldn’t spend any more time with them (I have a job), so I thought I’d throw it out here to see if anyone else has had this, or similar, issues.  Any advice? Thanks!"	11	"['Johnnybarlowww: App and speaker update released today.  15.3.  Update your app and the speakers to see if it fixes it.', 'deanso: Kind of the same issue here.

Previously Era 300 played spatial via Sonos app (Apple Music inside the Sonos app) only?

Can't see any update for my Era 300 so it will be playing spatial directly from the Apple Music app. 

Where is the magic that it could not before and now it can?

Tried songs from Sonos spatial playlist directly with the Apple Music app and they sound pretty spatial to me now:

In both setups, it blew us away. We tested using following

* TrueHD (i.e. 7.x and not Atmos over DD+, validated in Sonos app About System) with Atmos , all of them were significantly better than with the ones, some scenes were jaw dropping in the sound difference. We tested using 4k Blu-ray player, Shield 2019 and X Box Series X Plex. All incredible
* DD+ Atmos (e.g. streaming services), noticeably different as well vs ones, however TrueHD is definitely a more richer sound (as expected)
* Apple Music Atmos, definitely notice difference as well versus the ones (note some Atmos tracks are not great examples to demonstrate)

The biggest difference we notice is that prior with the ones, the spatial sound was front biased (as expected given the ones are not positional). However now, the positional sound is 360. As noted in another comment, the sound is so good that our cats even look around the room in response to some of the testing we did. Additionally, we haven't even bothered with proper positioning of them yet, which we will do when we get the proper wall mounts (using a temp solution for now).

As many have commented, make sure you test with proper sources, got your TVs etc setup to pass through properly, and most importantly the source has to be an adequate quality (and actually Atmos) to enjoy it fully."	6	"['zugshad: Nice Congrats, I just did the same this weekend as well replacing my Ones with the 300\'s.\n\nWe definitely love the sound more, specially when it is Atmos.  The upgrade seems ""slight"" when planning normal 5.1 or music at times as the family was like ""seems almost the same"" but when I put on some Atmos, they were blown away,,  Daughter and I watched the final episode of Carnival Row and were amazed when heard/felt some running/dripping water start behind us when we didn;t see and then as it came on screen and forward, could hear/feel it pass over our head then to the Arc. So much nicer.\n\nAs for testing, I have been trying to test. Not sure I have anything/seen anything come in as TrueHD or 7.x so far,  is it only achieveable via blu-ray disc and such? \n\nWhen streaming, I am getting mixed. I have seen some come as Atmos, and then some shows that said Dobly Vision or Atmos, the app reflected as DD 5.1,  when I streamed some music that was supposed to be Atmos, i had mixed.  I tried Youtube Music and all of theirs that said 4k came back I thnk as DD 2.1 or something like that,, know it was a 2.   Amazon Music that was Atmos I think also came in as a 2.1 on the app,  might have been 5.1\n\nWhen I streamed from my phone via Amazon music, I think that was the one that might have been 5.1, and same 5.1 I think when i did sonos musci, but I don\'t have their HD plan.. the HD from them is the same bitrate and qual as Amazon Music. Amazon shows that the soundtrack was 24bit and the 14.4 (something like that) hz but said the max for the device was 16bit with the 14.4.\n\nHaven\'t tried streaming from the PS5, but the Sonly is the 85k series and think it ""should"" stream better from a quality sake than the PS5.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nany thoughts/suggestions to test better?  I did confirm that the Arc is in the eARC slot and the PS5 is in the other 4k ARC slot. both do 120hz', 'facialmast3r: Sonos needs a way to let you use your 300s as stereo pairs for music, but use them as surrounds for movies without having to manually remove them. The 300s sound amazing for music in stereo pair. But it’s a marginal improvement for 5.1 content as you stated, and even for Dolby atmos content I dunno, I don’t notice a night and day difference from my era 100 surrounds. It’s maybe 10-20% better? Come on Sonos give us this feature', 'plocktus: For TrueHD, it is Blu-ray yes. Streaming services are at best DD+ Atmos (which is max 5.1, 768kbps I believe, vs max 18mbps from memory). That is where you will really notice the difference both because of the 7.1.2/7.1.4 output and the bitrate. Alternatively, you could use a ""rip"" of your bluray with TrueHD soundtrack on Plex (direct play) with an appropriate device. Unfortunately, most TV apps will not always passthrough TrueHD (only DD+ at best), so you may need to use an external device (e.g. Xbox, Shield, note the PS5 only supports Atmos from bluray and not apps or games). \n\nNote for your PS5 as above, the PS5 only supports Atmos on Blu-ray only and not apps and games. The Xbox Series X does support Atmos in games and apps (some of the Atmos enabled games sound incredible, like MW 2.0).\n\nTo see if you are getting TrueHD passed through correctly, in about Sonos you should see the following under your Arc speaker;\n\n`Audio In: Dolby Atmos (TrueHD)`', 'zugshad: Thanks,\n\nyeah, tracking all on the PS5..  Though the PS5 does ""spatial"" audio and I know you can get it on headsets via the games, and I\'d have to test it and see if it works through the sonos.\n\nwith the new 300s, we get ""7.1"" type sound vice the 5.1  or only if it is trueHd?  still new to the differences. Like, thought I read/heard that the arc+sub+2 Ones was 7.1 but the max sonos would give is 5.1??  then read that now with the 300s, its ""true"" 7.1 (or whatever the numbers).. \n\nwas having a discussion with coworker,  if you are playing in Atmos, does 5.1, 7.1, 9.1 even make a difference?\n\nI will have to see if I ahve any blu-ray discs laying around to see if any are in atmos to  maybe try it out in the ps5', ""plocktus: Yes, you still can get a TrueHD input irrespective of the rears. What the Eras do is unlock 7.1.x plus provide positional sound from the rears (which will benefit 5.1 as well). TrueHD works as input on Sonos arc and beam gen 2. Beam gen 1 is DD+ max, play bar DD and Ray DD+ I think from memory. \n\nIn my situation, I guess there's 2 main variables at play which makes it difficult for me to distinguish a weight of what causes the improvement, is it the Eras vs Ones or  7.1 vs 5.1 with the ones, but I am pretty sure most of it will be the speakers themselves over now having 7.1.x, if that makes sense."", 'zugshad: yeah I agree,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think for your latter,, it is both. I went in and listened to each speaker individually before I did the upgrade. the 300s are much better sounding just on their own regardless of the set up. .so changing them out, im sure will always be better.. the only time i the Ones are supposedly ""better"" is if you are doing the music in stereo but thats the only time i think they might be better (based on pro reviews)']"

Are there any known major issues with the speaker? I have 2x Ones and 2x Play 1s that I currently use. Thanks!	19	"['padphilosopher: The Roam falls off the system a lot and is just in general quite finicky. The sound is also not that great. If the primary use is travel and outside use, I’d get a normal bluetooth speaker, such as a JBL. \n\nI use my Roam for bathroom use. Before that I had a One on my bathroom counter. The One sounded much better.\n\nThere are two things which I’ve liked about the Roam. Every now and then I bring the Roam out onto the patio with me, and for that use it’s been nice. My partner likes to play the news in the morning via Bluetooth (long, boring story why she likes to do this), and the Roam allows us to share this with all of our other Sonos speakers so I can listen to the news in the Kitchen when she’s getting ready in the bathroom.', ""zugshad: For me, I am a bit different than the other comments so far. I personally love my Roam for it's use. I haven't had any of the connection issues that most are discussing, when the speaker is not in use, it will shutoff/disconnect, but I have not had any issues going into the app and seeing it and playing through it.\n\nSound wise, I love the sound. I have owned several JBLs (mostly the flips, which I would say is the comparison model based on size and such) and I think the Roam sounds better than the JBL. I have used both as a pc speaker, music, movies, etc and the Roam just seems to outshine the JBL every time,  family agrees.\n\nLike the others said, since you have a Sonos ecosystem, the Roam seems like the nicer choice as well to fit into it and you can  use in the house as well, outside, whatever, and even group if needed.  \n\nI'd say if I was going to buy again, I might go up to the Move for the portable aspect, but only for home or maybe taking to park/beach/etc, but for traveling I am not sure I'd want to fly and all that with the Move,  the Roam would be the nicer option for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust my thoughts"", 'natespartakan: Reddit hates it.  I think it’s good.  JBL is probably a little better but it doesn’t fit into the ecosystem.  I’ve only had mine for 6 months and it’s a bathroom speaker for me.

It obviously gets used a lot more because I can use it to extend sound from the existing Sonos system at home (on top of outside use on BT). \n\nI think the preference for the JBL is because it goes louder and seems to have more bass, however I find the Roam more balanced and the vocal clarity especially. Considering the size I typically don’t push volume that loud to begin with so on the JBL I was at 40 and comparatively go with 60 on the Roam.   \n\n\nApart from maybe once or twice it disappearing from the system I haven’t had any other issue (in almost 2 years of use) and those only required a reboot.', 'kameradhund: well, my „problems“ so far are: \n\nthe on/off button is strange because most of the time it doesn’t react as it should\nthe battery drains fast when sound level is higher than 50%\nthe sound is not good under 50% sound level but is fine when at 60-80%\nit can’t do sonosnet (!)\nit sometimes looses connection for a few seconds \nthere is no manual true play option via ios device (!)\n\nover all i think that roam is too small and move is too big. no idea why they didn’t make a speaker in the middle.\n\nfor 100€ it is fine, for 200€ definitely not.', 'LISCoxH1Gj: I like it.

It'll work, but it'll be clearly surpassed by what's new. With speakers, a speaker that sounds great today will still sound great in 10 years, and the performance between it and a new product is going to be quite small. You won't be retiring it because it doesn't hold up anymore. You're retiring it because you have to if you want to add current products in the ecosystem. \n\nI think Sonos can do something about this, and they choose not to. S2 may have paved the way for a lot of new technology that just wouldn't work in S1 products, but streaming music is streaming music and there's no reason that can't still happen across generations. Instead of dividing ecosystems, they should be finding a way to incorporate legacy devices with limited functionality. Make legacy products only support legacy audio formats, I'm 100% fine with that, but let me group them with my modern products for when I'm playing a format that both support (aka most music).

I look at my 10 year old phone, which has spotify on it and it can't connect to the spotify server, my guess is because the protocols have changed. Now my phone has no option to work, stand alone or other. At least with legacy Sonos products they can still function  by themselves, and you get a 30% upgrade option if you want.

The tracks John Coltrane's *Blue Train* played in Atmos when grouping an Arc + Era 300 surround set, Era 300 stereo pair, and Beam Gen 2 + Sonos One surround set.

When I then grouped a Sonos One stereo pair the music dropped very briefly, the Atmos logo disappeared from the Sonos app Now Playing screen, and the music resumed in stereo. The difference was definitely audible and a downgrade.

It's disappointing to have to downgrade to the lowest common denominator if I want to have music playing throughout my home.

I'm going to read through the [iTunes Package Format documentation](https://help.apple.com/itc/musicspec/#/itcc9a9d50d8), not sure if it will provide any insight. What's weird to me is Atmos music will play in my Beam Gen 2 + Sonos One surround set, which includes two non-Atmos speakers.

For anyone wondering, and I’m sure that’s a small few, many modern sonos systems will be using Wi-Fi and not the older solution, SonosNet.

Seeing that the CR200 setup screen requires a connection to a Sonos product for setup, and not the usual mobile/desktop app, I assumed that it’s using SonosNet to connect to such a product.

And after a quick check, Yep! The CR200 uses SonosNet and has no perception of Wi-Fi and therefore a pre existing SonosNet network is required for its setup. The people who found that they could only add a CR200 if they already had another CR200 set up are in that position because SonosNet was already running for that existing controller, and so it was instantly ready for another one.

I found that my ZP90 and Play 1s were not connected to ethernet, therefore using Wi-Fi as usual, and so the usual ‘Press the buttons on the nearest product’ didn’t work, as the products weren’t visible to the CR200 without SonosNet.

Simply plugging in an Ethernet equipped sonos product to your router would enable SonosNet throughout your S1 system, and therefore pressing the Play/Pause and Volume Up buttons on THAT product when prompted would allow the controller to connect.

So…

1. Connect an Ethernet enabled product (in my case, the ZP90 (Connect)) to an Ethernet source.
2. Restart said product if it doesn’t already by itself.
3. Follow the CR200 setup instructions (pressing the requested buttons on the Ethernet connected product from Step 1)
4. Voila! Enjoy your dates controller in all its glory.

PS, if you’re worried that your CR200 is on a lower firmware than mine (7.5), don’t worry, so was mine originally. As I connected it to my system, an ‘update now’ button presented itself on the Home Screen. Updating isn’t required, but won’t do any harm either.

If you already knew this, Great! I’m just making this post to refer people who are unaware. Sonos Reps and other members of this community are actively telling people not to bother and to bin their products while I’ve found a solution."	3	['ho1bs: NOTE: And also, if you’re already using a CR200, and have been for literally a decade like me, I know they still ‘work’ the issue is specifically with adding them to new S1 systems where SonosNet may not be running.', 'controlav: I am impressed the touch screen hasn’t failed yet, that was the weak point on these.', 'ho1bs: My dad has owned this one since new, still going strong.']

However I'm not quite sure where I would put them. Our basement isn't massive, and we've filled up the space with a big couch and a long desk for the kids behind the couch (see photo). Right now the Symfonisks are placed on the end of the desk and on a TV tray in the very corner of the room, which works pretty well. But, I know that the Era 300s like to be placed a bit closer together, and shouldn't necessarily be angled at the listener like the Symfonisks are. I feel like the ideal placement is to put one of the 300s right where we have a walkway to a bedroom... any thoughts?

In this photo the TV (not pictured) is centered on the couch, so the center seat of the couch is the ""ideal"" listening location. The floorplan is also a mirror of the actual room.

My living room is a long one split in two sections, so it wouldn’t be great to have the speakers on stands right behind the couch, i.e. in the dining area and in the middle of the room. 
Resuming the unobtrusive placement of my old Play:1’s, turned towards the x, seems like a bad solution because of the side firing drivers.
The couch is sitting 12 ft / 4 m from the TV and 16 ft / 5 m (!) from the windows directly behind it, where I could place them on the window sill. I’m considering if mounting them upside down above the windows in the back might help the sound overcoming the distance.

I’m torn between the Eras 300 and HomePods (2023), upgrading from stereo HomePod minis:

* I use Siri on HomePods to start/stop playback, change volume and skip/repeat tracks - is it possible to integrate Sonos controls into HomePod Siri and have similar experience? I have Home Assistant and HomeKit bridge installation (if that matters) and if I opt for eras I'll keep one HP mini just for Siri/HomeKit in the same room
* Excluding the Dolby Atmos support, is Sonos Apple TV connectivity comparable to HomePod? Will I be able to output Apple TV stereo audio to stereo paired Eras 300 wirelessly, same as I do it with HomePods? Will it be significantly worse than the Dolby Atmos enabled Apple TV+stereo HomePods setup?
* Is the Youtube Premium (not necessarily Yt Music) experience on Sonos better or worse than on the HomePods (where I'm forced to stream content from my phone/tablet via AirPlay)? Do I still need to Airplay 2 or can Sonos stream from YouTube directly?

We will have to ditch the Playbase as it just doesn’t make sense for us in this case. Of course the Arc or Beam would make a great fit, but with the new Era speakers I at least want to see if there are any alternatives out there.

Tl;dr: Would the following setup work and kinda make sense? Model for the projector is not chosen yet: 2x Era 100 as stereo speakers, one of them connected via line to the beamer, completed by 2x Play 1 as rear speakers.

Thanks!"	4	['GuitarSuperstar: No, that setup will not work.\n\nGet an Arc or Beam (Gen 2) and connect it to your TV via HDMI ARC or optical. Then you can add a Sub or Sub Mini for deeper bass and a pair of surround speakers. A pair of One SLs, Era 100s, or Era 300s are good options for surrounds. The subwoofer and surrounds will connect wirelessly to the Arc or Beam.', 'okimonkojo: the only way to do this is to get a Sonos Amp which has HDMI input.  then connect two passive speakers of your choice as the front L and R.

1681671328.0	16-Apr-2023 11:55:28	I am experiencing repeated audio cut outs when using the Xbox Series S with the Sonos Beam Gen 2 (no issues with the PS5 and Apple TV). Any ideas on how to resolve this issue? More details below.	Spoggi99	2	12oktv6	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12oktv6/i_am_experiencing_repeated_audio_cut_outs_when/	"I know this sounds weird, but I have an audio problem that is definitely caused by the combination of Sonos and Xbox.

When I play something on the console, the audio cuts out for a few seconds every 2 minutes or so, which is quite annoying. I've tried different audio settings and even reset the console - both to no avail.

As mentioned in the title, this only happens when using the Series S combined with the Sonos Beam. The problem does not occur with my PS5 or Apple TV. I also tested the Series S on a different TV (without a Sonos system) and there were no problems.

Above that my Sonos system made a loud popping noise and then rebooted three times over the course of two months (I also have to reconnect the Sud Mini). This seems to be a known issue with the Xbox. Could there be any connection between these problems?

Frankly, I've run out of ideas and need your help.
Any tip or insight is much appreciated :)

If it helps, here is my setup:
Sonos Beam Gen 2 + Sub Mini (connected using the original HDMI cable).
Xbox Series S (connected directly to the TV with a HDMI 2.1 cable)

The point being, no other system allows you to upgrade piece by piece and use the speakers elsewhere or standalone (even a setup like the Sony soundbars, the rear surrounds can ONLY be used as surrounds with a Sony system). Also, if a Vizio rear surround dies, you lose the whole system (unless they can still repair/replace the speaker).\n\nAlso, the Sonos system has far more smart integration than any other I’ve seen. If you use the Soro app on iOS, it adds support for basically every Sonos setting which you can use in Shortcuts. It’s great for creating a nighttime listening mode (you can change the rear surrounds levels, the EQ, turn on night mode, turn on voice enhancement, etc…all with a single click or voice command). I’ve been looking for other systems which can do this but have found none. Even the flagship Samsung Q990b with SmartThings integration has nothing like this.\n\nEveryone’s ears hear things differently and people have different preferences but I wills say that in my opinion, the Beam Gen 2 punches well above its weight in terms of price and even size.

I just added a Sub Mini to my Beam 1 and 2x ONE SL Surround Setup and was very thrilled. I heard so much about the jump in quality when adding a sub, wider soundstage, better mids and highs for the beam and of course a nice but gentle bass. 
And now…
Nothing. 

I tested various positions, in front, right, left, a corner, left of sofa… did truplay… 
I can barely hear a differnce when turning the Sub on and off in the App. Only when I turn Sub Level up to 10 and more, I can hear the deep mumbling. But I definitly cannot hear better mids or highs… 

Deeply disappointed here. But before I Return it: what am I missing? How can I improve the result? 
I am not looking so much for the deep oomph, my desire is to improve the sound for the system as a whole. Especially for Music. 
I was thinking, y‘all (and all the reviews) cant be wrong, so I am. 
What can I do?

I have a TV with a Sonos Beam (Gen 2). I would like to add a speaker so that we can hear the TV from the other room (Kitchen). I as looking at getting a single SL One. I am concerned about a delay. The sound bar and the SL One would be a single room apart.. maybe 20 or 30 feet? The last thing i want is a bouncing effect on the audio. Is this an issue?	2	"['Pools-3015: That is not an issue. I have a Playbar, Sub and two Ones in my living room and I group my Five in the kitchen with the TV all the time. There is no delay.', 'Small_Assistance5944: I do this every day with 11 Gen 1 speakers in every room of my house to create a whole-home sound system for my TVs and music using grouped playback. To avoid delay or dropouts, make sure your Beam is plugged in directly to an HDMI eARC port on your TV. Other posters in this forum say this is not possible without annoying delay but I don\'t notice any delay or sync issues on my system.\n\nIf there is a slight delay or sync issue it will be less noticeable when your speakers are in separate rooms or far enough apart that you\'re really only listening to one at a time. Delay and sync issues are also not noticeable for background narration like sports, documentaries, and voice-over news reports. Delay issues will be more noticeable for dramas and talk shows where you watch people talking on-screen most of the time.\n\nAny ""Bouncing"" echo or vibration effect on my system only happens when the distant speaker is being played a lot louder than the nearest one. When all speakers are played at nearly the same volume, or the distant speaker is too low to be heard, there is no echo effect. If your soundbar is not loud enough to be audible or decipherable in your kitchen area, you should be able to listen on a kitchen speaker without annoying echo or overlap.\n\nThe thing I like best about having a whole-home sound system is being able to listen to my TVs and music all over the house at a consistent volume without having to turn anything up loud enough to be annoying or create distortion from echo and vibrations.']"

does it have an advantage above arc+sub+two ones for 5.1 or is it about the same quality?

The surround audio has much more dimensionality with the 300s, especially in terms of height. You will absolutely ""know"" the Ones are behind you at almost all times compared to the 300s, however, which seems to give a lot of people the impression the Ones are performing better than the Ones for non-atmos content.

My room doesn\'t have many surfaces on the right side to bounce audio off of, and regardless of how I placed the speakers (angled, straight on, etc), they always sounded great.

The Ones for 5.1 great because they are unidirectional. You put them anywhere behind you and point them at your couch and they will sound decent.

Most people DO NOT have the proper space to place these, as specifications would require.\n\nThese are awesome speakers, but you need to have the space to use them. People are not going to get away with aimlessly choosing to place them where they fit, as they have done with one’s, with the 300s.\n\nMy opinion is, if you can place them where walls will recreate reflected audio in a 7.1 audio configuration that Dolby demonstrates in imagery - then do it.  Otherwise it’s a waste of money and should stay with One’s or 100s', 'Internet_Bigshot: Same experience here. I think the room layout and speaker placement is important.

Ones have a very simple a defined use of just pointing at the central sitting position. 300s, because they require correct position for both the inside drivers and outer drivers to correctly emulate the channels, are far more susceptible to be incorrectly placed. Maybe omnidirectional isn’t the correct term in this case, but I would argue that  most spaces are far more optimal for a single direction speaker as compared to one that requires two directions and wall bouncing. Having played with both the ones and the 300s extensively I can make the Ones sound great in lots of different positions behind my couch, the 300s can go from amazing to terrible both with minor rotation and positing changes.

If anything when the Sub is off, there's more bass since the One SLs are handling the frequencies.

Tested it again with 2 other friends and they couldn't hear a difference either.

I've tried moving the Sub audio from - 15 to +15 and they sound the same at both ends of the spectrum. 

From every comment here, they say the Sub is a game changer, what am I missing?

Could something be broken with my Arc or Sonos setup?

EDIT: It was because WiFi was disabled on my Arc. I thought since Arc was hard wired I didn't need to enable WiFi.

The sub works great now!!

Turns out I am a dummy, and had the speakers turned on their sides, which somehow makes them not connect using Trueplay. So I placed them with the Sonos logo on the front face of the speaker, oriented toward the top.

Just wondering if I am the only one with this issue, or if someone has resolved the problem. I have the ARC, two sub's, and two Era 300's, which replaced my One's. Everything is working fine, it all shows as connected to my network and plays media just fine, but the only thing that does not work now is Trueplay. It gets to the point where it would normally have you turn the phone around, and instead it says ""Trueplay Problem"" with no details.

If I unplug the Era 300's Trueplay works fine. Trueplay works fine in my other room on my Beam and One's setup also. I have updated all the apps, network software, unplugged and rebooted all equipment, and still not working. I did notice that while my Era 300's say they are connected to my network (in the ""About My System"" section, they do not show any network icons in the Era 300 tab, unlike the One's do. Maybe a network issue?

Hopefully there is some simple fix for this. Thanks!"	4	"['Comfortable_Ad3005: I ran into this same issue.

I have a 55 inch TCL Roku TV. It has served its purpose well, but since I just went full Sonos for sound, it’s a good time to update the TV. Here are the general parameters for the TV:

-	65 inch
-	OLED
-	eARC (that should be a given for new TVs, I assume)
-	4 HDMI ports
-	plays well with Sonos
-	preferably no Alexa, or the ability to remove/shut it off
-	4K (don’t need 8K)
-	does not need to be the latest model

I watch only streaming content through my Apple TV 4K. I very rarely play games on the PS5 or the Switch. 

Price isn’t an issue, but I doubt I would want to spend more than $3K for TV, because that seems obscene.

iPhone 13 Pro Max

iOS 16.4.1

Sonos app: 15.2.1 build 72239220

Sonos Era 100 speaker: I don’t know the firmware level.

Issue:

1-I’ve been playing my Amazon Music source via the Sonos app for over a month. Everything was running fine, connection on the network was working. No issues.


2-Yesterday, I went to play “My Likes” playlist from Amazon Music and it came back with a message “Unable to add to queue.”


3-I scanned my network and saw the speaker was connected to my network and detected as online. Things still weren’t working so I looked around online and was shocked to read from a Sonos support site that the recommended step by Sonos to resolve this is to REBOOT YOUR ROUTER. A client device is failing so shutdown the entire network! Are you kidding? I also read somewhere on the site that this is a recommended action to take every month to prevent future problems. This is like saying, “reboot your router every month to ensure your laptop and everything else will continue to be able to connect to the network!” This sounds like the Sonos speakers go into a zombie mode and become unavailable to the Sonos app if they’ve not been used in a couple of days. I presume if the speakers go into a power saving mode, the Sonos app would be designed to “wake” the speakers when the app was opened.


4-So, I had no other choice but to gracefully shutdown all the devices on my network and reboot the router. You can’t just blow every other device off the network. If they rely upon any DHCP assigned address, that’s one thing but those that don’t it can cause major issues during router reboot. The last time I needed to reboot my router was maybe 4 years ago! When the network was back the Sonos device was still discoverable on my network. It seems like an API issue between the Sonos firmware in the speaker and the Sonos app.


5-I went to play my music and got the same error message as indicated in point # 2 above.


6-Next, I deleted the entire Sonos app from my iPhone including any data associated with the app.


7-Reinstalled the Sonos app, completed the addition of the Sonos Era 100 to the app and to the network, and approved the Sonos app to access my Amazon Music source.


8-When going to play music as I’ve always done before, I still get an error message. After reinstalling the app, I now get the message “An error occurred while adding tracks to the Queue (701).” A slightly different message but it still makes reference to an issue with the “Sonos Queue.” That seems to be the source of the issue.


9-Then by accident I discovered something weird. Via the Sonos app and still using Amazon Music as the source, it could play all of the other playlists I created on Amazon Music which were 20 songs or less. But, for some reason it wouldn’t play the “My Likes” playlist on Amazon Music which only has about 120 songs. It can’t be the size of the playlist as it’s very small and has been working fine for weeks.


10-I used the Amazon Music app to play music on the Sonos speakers and it worked, except it was relying on an Airplay or Bluetooth connection. Wifi would provide the best quality for home use which is what was being used.


11-So, in conclusion there is no detectable issue with the router, the network, or the speaker. I very highly doubt that the Sonos speakers determine what playlists can be played and what can’t be played on them. This has to be an issue with the Sonos software.

I still cannot believe they want you to reboot your router. Anyone come across this same issue and found a resolution?

\- 2 x Symfonisk rear, no sub and not planning to get one in short term either since I live in a building with a lot of noise complaints

\- Primary use Netflix/HBO on Apple TV box, and XSX/PS5 gaming

\- For a small living room, I'll be sitting 1.5m (5ft) away from the soundbar

The placement is a mess, so I think I'm going to get a stand for it, and I'm already thinking about getting another for a stereo pair and a Sub Mini to cover those last few Hz, because I am loving having this for all the music I listen to.

Foreground is a modular synth I'm building. I'm going to hook that up to a line in adapter to have some fun when I'm not using headphones to monitor it.

Q: if I get 2 line-in adapters for a stereo pair, can I easily switch between them?"	3	"['Willylowman1: how come why u take it apart?', ""g1rlchild: It's a modular synthesizer.

1681520625.0	14-Apr-2023 18:03:45	Need some advice on surround speakers in current layout.	orthix	1	12mkkq8	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/12mkkq8	"Need some help to finish my surround setup please

In need of some help or suggestions from redditors.

I have a very small setup currently in my basement… with arc, and the sub.
Trying to get a full surround by adding either ones or maybe new set of eras or in ceiling sonance speakers connected to amp.

The problem is that I have 2 poles  behind my couch and no outlets behind the couch unless it’s against the wall. 

So having speaker stands I would need away to hide or handle the power cord. The ceiling speakers would be the cleanest since I can fish that to this location.

With ceiling speakers should it be directly above the seating area or behind? If behind, note there is a beam so not sure if the sound would bounce off that.

The basement ceiling is a little over 6 ft.

Anyways hope the pictures are sufficient for an advise or suggestion.

First time getting into Sonos and I'm looking at replacing my LG SP11RA setup which keeps flaking out in various ways and hasn't delivered promised features (TV Sound Mode Share does not work as advertised, never did).

I have an LG C1 TV and I mostly watch streaming content from an Apple TV 4K and some gaming on PS5. The TV does eARC, and Atmos works with my existing LG SP11RA setup.

I'd like a surround system with Atmos.

So I'm thinking either:

1. The Premium Immersive Set with Arc which has the Sub (Gen 3) and Era 100s for rears
2. The Ultimate Immersive Set with Arc which has the Sub (Gen 3) and Era 300s for rears

I'd slightly prefer the Era 100s just because they are smaller, and the rears are going to be sitting on end tables next to the couch. It would be better if they take up less space. Also I have highish vaulted ceilings so I'm not sure the uprising of the Era 300s is going to do me a whole lot of good.  


But, does the Arc with Era 100s as rears still do Atmos? The marketing page for the set seems to imply yes, but I know the standalone Era 100s don't.  


Does anyone know for sure?"	6	"['GuitarSuperstar: Yes, the Arc and Era 100s support Dolby Atmos audio.

How do you find Atmos on your existing up firing LG soundbar setup? As that is likely a good way of gauging how much your ceiling will impede.', 'lifereinspired: Era 300 will support an inverted mounting method which doesn’t require bouncing off the ceiling.\n\nEra 100 will support Atmos but you’ll get no Atmos height effects from them, if that makes sense. If an Atmos object moves through the rear area, you’ll hear it via the Era 100 but only the Era 300 will support rear upfiring Atmos effects.', 'calmkelp: Thanks! this is very helpful.', ""calmkelp: I find the existing LG system fairly immersive. But to be honest, I'm not sure I notice if the up-firing is helping or not.  \n\n\nThough I'd rather not have this new system be a downgrade from what I have."", 'frazell: If you can swing it I would recommend you try both the ERA100s and ERA300s as surrounds.

Mainly, I listen to music and secondarily watch some 5.1 titles through streaming.

I am thinking of replacing the two Ones with two Fives. As I have in mind, for Home cinema, I will have a relative improvement in sound, but a much greater improvement when it comes to music playback (music playback: full in settings), which is the main goal.

Will I still be able to have 5.1 sound for movies and tv shows as I do now and a much better system for music playback? I understand that the Ray is entry-level, but as a soundbar, it suits me.

But as I said before, you can group in the HT set and it will play along with your fives. You can do that, turn down the volume of the HT and turn up the sub volume if you want the music mostly playing from the fives and the sub. \n\nThere are apps that can automate those steps and automate a return back to the normal settings so you get the best of both worlds.

RevBingo	3	12m4hhf	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12m4hhf/sub_mini_very_quiet/	"I spent a few days at a holiday home that had a Sub Gen 3, and it immediately convinced me that I needed a sub!  My lounge is about 3.5m x 6m, and I'm not after an audiophile performance, so I felt I didn't need to go the whole hog, so I ordered a Sub Mini.

It arrived the day after I got back, I excitedly paired it with a Beam (gen 1), found a banging dance track, waited for the drop and.... nothing. Ok, maybe a little bit of something, if I stuck my head a couple of inches from the sub.

After a bit of playing, I've found that if I put the Sub level up to +15 it's roughly the sort of sound that I was expecting.  If I leave it at the default level 0, I literally cannot tell the difference between the sub being on or off, and I've done blind tests with a couple of other people who reported the same.

I've put the sub in a different room, and paired it with a Play:5.  I've tried turning other units off and on again.  I've tried Trueplay tuning. Same results. I chatted with support who told me the diagnostics looked fine, and of course then we get into ""your room is the wrong size/shape/colour"".  But it seems to me that if I can't tell the difference between the thing being on or off at the default settings that's surely a problem?   Or has the Sub Gen 3 somehow spoiled me and I have unrealistic expectations of this thing???

Have a dozen or so speakers including a small Beam/Sub/One HT setup in our loft and a Port connecting our primary living room HT. We're about to kick off a major kitchen remodel and as part of that replacing our flooring on the main level. With all the upcoming changes, the wife and I have been talking about aesthetics in our living room and what our options are for replacing speakers. You can see what I'm dealing with from a space/layout perspective in the pictures. We're probably 75% Movies/TV and 25% music with the occasional karaoke party with friends/family. Existing fronts are Definitive Technology bi-polars with 10in powered subs. They're over 20 years old, but surprisingly still sound pretty amazing. The center is a DT Mythos (had to downsize when we moved due to space on the mantle) and the surrounds are DT bi-polars mounted pretty high up on the rear wall behind the seating position and above the bar. 

Have been kicking around the idea of replacing everything with Sonos, but I'm just not sure the juice will be worth the squeeze. Forget for a moment that I'd have to hire someone to wire the electrical for the surrounds and find a way to properly mount them in a way that was aesthetically pleasing, would they work effectively that high up on the wall? Then there's the Arc. Replacing two front tower speakers with a soundbar sounds nuts. Right? I'm slightly less concerned with low end, as I'd buy two Subs. 

All that said, I'm looking for some sage advice. Should I keep looking to find a passive speaker series that is smaller, more visually appealing while still capable of sounding great? Do you think I'd be happy with Arc+Era300+2xSUB? 

Thanks in advance for any feedback.

As the title says just looking for some advice on what to do next with my set up. Due to move to our new home soon and had sign off to upgrade the sound system.

Presently rocking the arc with 2 symfonisk acting as rear surrounds. I am going to get the sub gen 3 to add in and I was looking at the era 300s as rears. However they will be right against the back wall with the sofa in front of them so very little room for the sounds to bounce which I have read they need? The sofa can’t be moved or relocated.

Also I was planning to hook up my turntable to one of the eras as well but I have also read to my dismay that if they are used as rear surrounds the line in is disabled.

So revised plan I’m thinking of is 2 of the era 100s to act as the rear surrounds, add the sub and then either a five or era 300 for the turntable? Other option is to leave the symfonisks as they are for rear with the sub added and just upgrade for the turntable?

Welcome any thoughts please 🙏"	8	"[""thearsenalinn: Quite a bit to unpack here.\n\nFirst, my era 300s are against the same wall as the sofa. They don't project forward, just up and to the side. So I find the surround noise works perfectly.  I came from Arc, Sub gen 2 and symfonisk lamps gen 1, and i find the era 300 a great upgrade. For the right content - atmos movies and spatial audio. honestly for anything else they are no better.\n\nHowever you've said you want to plug in your turntable. How often? if it's regularly enough that having to ungroup your surrounds and set up each time is a pain, and this is something you really want to be able to do then I wouldn't use era 300s for surrounds.\n\nIf the choice is an era 300 or a five for the turntable, get the five. As a stand alone speaker it knocks the socks off the era 300 from what I've been told.\n\nI don't think i'd bother upping the symfonisks to the 100s. just dont think its a significant upgrade but i'm happy to be told otherwise."", 'RiseSoggy: So a little update for you. My record player has a pre amp and it turns out it has Bluetooth as well which I never realised.

Appreciate not ideal being via Bluetooth but is already a huge upgrade on the crappy speakers I was using previously.

I had read in other posts that they needed space for the upwards effects to work well and give you the full benefit.\n\nThe turntable will be used very regularly so pairing and unpairing constantly is a no go for me. \n\nI look forward to other’s opinions on going from the symfonisks to the era 100 is worth it then. I’m with you and personally leaning to it’s not worth it. \n\nThe main thing for the Era 300 was the Atmos and turntable combo but as that’s going to be a no go I can’t justify the cost for the atmos element on its own, plus then a five for the turntable plus the sub as well.', ""PanicLogically: You really nailed it. All Sonos speakers can go against a rear wall--spaced ideally according to Sonos designations in their documentation. I'm glad to hear you're getting good sound from the 300s.

The Symfonisk stuff, for those of us that have it, is good stuff. The frames are quite unique (don't be put off by the ugly patterns for covers, you can buy from third party , other covers. ) Really cool music sound. Ikea isn't hard to deal with if you have one close by--if it's not close, it's not an easy purchase if you decide you don't like them."", 'RiseSoggy: My friend this is amazing!! I had never thought of hooking up the turntable to the tv to output that way!!! Definitely going to be looking into this thank you. \n\nI am with you in the symfonisk and have always been very pleased with the sound that comes from them. I have them in the kitchen as well for music and they have filled the room so well and so easy to place. Lots more research to do I think', ""PanicLogically: Keep us posted. It's odd, for the TV I own, what I can plug in and output. Turntables of today are not like the turntables of yesteryear. Some are self amplified. My TV has a couple RCA inputs I've not yet tinkered with-yet all audio, so far is out putted  to the ARC via the selected input I designate on the TV.""]"

Noobgamer0111	5	12lv33h	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12lv33h/whats_a_feature_youd_want_to_add_to_existing/	"For me, it would be adding more playlist file support for both local and online music streams.

For example, adding in \*.m3u8 would allow for Unicode characters e.g. a popular phonk artist,    
Dxrk ダーク would have white boxes replacing the Japanese characters if an m3u playlist file was used.

While the [HD badging](https://developer.sonos.com/build/content-service-add-features/hd-badging/) system is nice to have, it does not distinguish between Dolby Digital Plus with Dolby Atmos and Dolby TrueHD with Dolby Atmos at all. The only effective way to check would be to check the media file's metadata using MediaInfo or trust that the online music service isn't lying to you.

~~I also dislike how you cannot add radio stations in the mobile S2 app by URL, requiring you to use the desktop S2 controller instead.~~

The feature exists on the mobile S2 App, go to *Browse-> TuneIn -> My Radio Stations -> vertical three dot button -> Add New Radio Station*

I felt a bit sad about it, but then realized I still have my 100 days free return/satisfactory guarantee.

I have spoken to Sonos, and they are fine with me sending back the One SL's. To switch my One SL's for two Era 100, I'd need to pay roughly €150 more (I used the 30% trade up, hence the ""low"" difference). Since I spent over €1000 for the system, I feel it is not that big of a deal.

I hope to have neutral opinions here even if i'm in Sonos space :)

I'm the owner of an 10 years old Klipsch G17 speaker. I want to upgrade especially on the connectivity side (only airplay 1, no BT for example) but I'm scared to loose on the audio quality side! Am I right or speakers have improved drastically in 10 years and no matter which recent model I pick up I will feel a positive difference.

Thanks for your help!"	4	"['RaymondBumcheese: The G17 isn’t really an audiophile speaker so, at a guess, if you swapped it for a 100, even if you were to lose some fidelity it would be made up for with enhanced functionality. \n\nIf you consider what you paid for it, 2x 100s would come in at less money and absolutely blow it away.', ""Small_Assistance5944: This G-17 Air Wireless speaker looks much bigger and a single Era 100 probably isn't comparable.

Listener tests and reviews indicate a single Era 100 would be a big improvement over pretty much any bluetooth speakers of similar size. If you're looking for a bookshelf speaker alternative, the Five would probably be the best choice for music sound quality with a single speaker, but you wouldn't get the added bluetooth. Two Era 100s can also be linked as a stereo pair for more power and better stereo imaging.\n\nIf you're worried about bluetooth, bear in mind that with Sonos' streaming music integration there's a good chance you may not really need to use bluetooth around the house."", 'No-Efficiency-4055: For the price of two era 100 and sub mini you could try an SVS Prime Wireless Pro that sound much better (audiphile level)...

Frankly I can't compare the sound quality of separate speakers (w/ fairly high end specs) to Sonos\n\nBUT for the best to my ears, soundscape, Sonos won over competitors. Within the Sonos speakers, it's up to one's ears. if you're using an ARC (sound bar)--and into music, check out the fives. I'm speaking to the wealth of music that is out there that is non ATMOS. Ikea has the Symfonisk line which were made in partnership with Sonos. Their frames, lamp (yes a lamp with 180 degree sound) and the bookshelf speaker, in addition to the 100s and 300s (by Sonos) all sound good. I like the frames for music listening. \n\nI do tweak (as much as Sonos allows) my bass up, my treble, and fiddle with the few other settings they allow. \n\nSo is it audiophile or close--no.

I finally pulled the trigger and my Arc arrived today. I connected it with my sub gen 3, ran truplay and adjusted EQ and height channels before popping in Dune (4K Blu-ray). The moment has finally arrived and my anticipation is through the roof! 

My first impression is that the dialogue sounds very crisp and clear; however, I soon realized that the Arc’s sound is just more hollow. Even with the lossless max bandwidth  eArc and Atmos, it can’t compete with how my Playbar and sub fills and shakes my room and maintains a warmth. The playbar sounds more full. I switched between the Arc and Playbar with the opening scene and first sandworm encounter scene and after playing them back to back, the Playbar surprisingly sounded better despite no atmos/eArc.

It’s worth noting I do not have rears set up yet so I’m wondering if a full 5.1.2 arc setup will sound better then playbar 5.1. I have a pair of era 300s on the way so we will see with the 7.1.4 but right now I’m leaning towards returning the Arc. I’m sure the 7.1.4 will be an improvement but maybe not worth $2k. Maybe the arc just needs time to break in?

So here's the situation: my projector doesn't support eARC, but I don't want to get rid of it since I'm happy with its performance. That means I need to find another way to get audio to the Sonos Arc. I've been considering two options: getting a new streaming box or a device to extract audio from HDMI.

Initially, I was considering getting an Apple TV, but then I realized that my current one is the last one to support optical audio. So now I'm a bit confused about my options.

Has anyone here had a similar setup? What streaming boxes with optical audio  or audio extractors do you recommend? Are there any other solutions that I might be overlooking?

Non-Atmos Surrounds (Ones, Fives, 100s, Play 3s, Symfonisks)	Han-Yolo44	12	12l4v7o	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/12l4v7o		1	['Han-Yolo44: Posted last night about my Era 300 surround set up and there have been questions about Stereo Music and how it sounds compared to non-atmos surrounds. I see this come up in other posts too.\r  \n\r  \n**My answer is not that it is better or worse than ones, fives, symfonisks, 100s or play 3s, but different when it comes to stereo music. Wanted to visualize what is happening so hopefully helpful for someone considering purchasing 300s as surrounds and what the trade-offs are.**\r  \n\r  \nThe eras bounce the stereo music off walls rather than pointing directly at you. The side firing woofers and tweeters do the majority of the work in concert with the arc. The inward facing woofers/tweeters and height tweeters of the 300s are dialled down and the center tweeter is off.\r  \n\r  \nWith the 300s, the soundstage for stereo music is wider to my ears than before (I had play 3s previous as surrounds) and more emphasized to the front/sides.  If you don’t have walls to bounce off of or it is very open, it might not sound great for stereo music. \r  \n\r  \nWith non-atmos speakers (ones, 100s, fives, play 3s, symfonisks), they are pointing directly at you from behind so at default levels and set to full (not ambient) the soundstage is often emphasized to the rear/side depending where you placed them.\r  \n\r  \nI suspect if you lean more towards stereo music and non-atmos content and are used to non-atmos surrounds playing music at your ears directly, the 300s could be disappointing.\r  \n\r  \nFor atmos music and movies/shows, the 300s are absolutely a better experience to me. I personally prefer how they sound with stereo music also because I like the soundstage emphasized to the front/sides.\r  \n\r  \nOutside of a home theater setup, the Sonos king of stereo music is a pair of Fives (+ a sub) facing you from in front.  The sub isn’t necessary for a great stereo music experience, just a bonus for a larger room and if you love bass.  I tried my 300s in a stereo pair with a sub and the fives (even without a sub) win for stereo music.']

OK, with that out of the way, here's what I was thinking about buying, and how I intend to set it up:

* Sonos Port
* Sonos Era 100 x2
* Sonos Era 300

So I don't care about surround sound at all - this is strictly for music.  Each Sonos speaker will be standalone (no stereo pairs) and will be spread out through the downstairs of my house.

The goal is to be able to listen to any streaming service or the turntable through any combination of the Sonos speakers + the Onkyo/Polk/Pro-ject setup.  I will note that my phono preamp has 2 outputs, so I was thinking this signal chain made the most sense:

* Turntable -> Preamp -> Preamp Output 1 -> Receiver - this will allow me to just listen to a record without involving Sonos at all
* Turntable -> Preamp -> Preamp Output 2 -> Sonos Port -> Receiver - this will allow me to listen to a record through any combo of speakers

Does this make sense?  Am I forgetting anything?  Any mistakes I'm about to make?

Thanks in advance!"	1	['damgood32: I see no reason why this wouldn’t work']

My HDMI cables are all new, high speed cables. My source is an Apple TV HD.

Connections:

AppleTV - HDMI port to the HDMI-switch input 1  
HDMI-switch -  HDMI-output(ARC) to the Projector HDMI\_input1  
HDMI-switch optical to the Sonos Beam, using Sonos optical/HDMI converter  


This will give 2.0 PCM audio. Even though the media is 5.1. If I replace the projector with my TV, the Beam receives 5.1. Regardless of using the ARC port in the TV or not.

On the HDMI switch, if I move the HDMI cable running to the Beam away from optical, and connect it into the HDMI port on the switch marked ""Audio Only"" the Beam reports ""No signal"". Same if I try with the TV connected.

I talked to the company I bought tha HDMI switch from, and they said that it should work. They even replaced the HDMI switch because they suspected it was faulty. But the new one behaves exactly the same.

I have not used the HDM cable included with the Beam, since i bought all new cables anyway. Is that cable special in any way, could that give a different result than my other cables?

In the bedroom we have a tv on a stand right at the bottom of the bed, I was thinking about adding another sound bar to this just to have Sonos in all the rooms really.

It would be so close that I'm pretty sure the Ray would be good enough, but then I'm thinking to myself if I get a ray will I be tempted to get the Ikea bookends or frames later making it pretty expensive for something I'll probably only watch casual late night tv on.

So I guess I'm mainly wondering does the beam 2 actually work really well as a Dolby Atmos speaker to push the sound above, behind and to the side so back speakers aren't needed? Or is it not worth the extra cash?

Many of those Atmos demos being more convincing than ever before.\n\nBut for standard 5.1 or surround content it’s not been so dramatic.  Even a bit disappointing at times as sone surround audio feels a bit awkwardly thrown out to the sides over a more “direct” source like I felt with the Ones.  \n\nIt can still sound really good and even some content in 5.1 is improved over Ones, but for the price…it’s not as easy a recommendation.  At least not yet.  Feel like the profile will hopefully improve with updates, but while I’m happy with them, I’m not sure I can enthusiastically recommend yet.\n\nOh and I also find with LPCM, I have to bump the volume wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy higher than usual.  Like I am nearing 50 or even 60 at times for comfortable volume levels(PS5 especially), whereas with the Ones I was rarely mid-30’s for a similar comfort level.  Just overall I find I am pushing my volume dial higher now since either the 15.2 version or the Era 300 swap.', 'cptxbt: Most posts are saying no', ""GadgetronRatchet: I upgraded from Ones to Era 300's and I absolutely love them.

These are definitely on par with the Sub gen 3 as the most overpriced speakers in their home theater lineup. But if you want the best surround speakers they currently offer, 300s are the clear winner imo, plus you have a pair of kickass speakers that can be used individually or stereo paired, as well.

Sonos should have been transparent on the sales page in regards to the centre driver being disabled when used as surrounds (whether needed or not) and so I will be arranging a return.    To top it off since setting my ones back up there is now an occasionally loud pop sound from the rear speakers, again judging from reddit posts this is happening to all rears in the line up and will need a fix with yet another software update …   \nI felt invested in the Sonos ecosystem and as said i do love my current setup and hopefully it will do me well for years to come but I don’t think i will invest in it further after this experience.  I’m ok with spending a lot of money for quality, and it is a lot of money so to receive one (of many) that slipped quality control and to have personally compared sound using lossless audio to find they don’t hold up to older speakers in pure clarity (not wider soundstage) there is no justification.   \nI urge those to have bought them and experiencing and wowed by that wider sound to just switch back to your previous rears and listen to the same scene again and make your final decision.

Most reviewers have reviewed for music and only one speaker.\n\nI am really mixed on keeping my 300’s over the One’s.  Sometimes I think they sound a lot better on some sources and other times on par with the Ones or even worse.  The frustrating part is you have to play with the Surround Audio TV level to get the 300’s to sound good consistently, where as the Ones, I set it on one number and never changed it.   For example, one streaming source could be moved to a 7/8 to make it sound good and others 0 to 3.   Should not be that inconsistent and for that reason alone I may the return them.\n\nHoping firmware updates address this before my return period is up.   I also don’t like how big they are compared to the Sonos Ones, but can live with that if they continually better.

(Without having to re-establish a home theater and re-do True Play each time). The Era 300 was mind boggling how great they sounded as a stereo pair for Atmos music. \n\nI also wish you could adjust the pairs of ""L/R surround"", and the ""Rear L/R surround"" tweeters manually like you can the height tweeter (rather than just turning up the whole surround volume. It would be great if you could do that with the Arc too. Just more customization of each of the drivers. Now that I know what the left and right surround can sound like, I want more. I know there\'s some logistics there and the woofers would have to stay the same volume to cancel out vibration, but I don\'t think it\'s as much of an issue of vibration with L/R tweeters not being the same volume. \n\nAnother thing would be giving the user the option to switch the rear surround ""inside"" tweeter in favor of the ""front"" tweeter. Unfortunately due to my living room, my Era 300\'s are more so directly behind the listening position rather than to the left and right of the listening position, so the rear surround isn\'t aligned very well. Allowing me to move that to the front tweeter I believe would give me a better Home Theater experience.', ""GadgetronRatchet: Anything that is in 7.1 content still gets a major boost, you get stronger left and right channels (since the Arc and Era 300 are combining for your left and right channels), and the wide soundstage is still great with separation, obviously you lose the height channels. \n\n5.1 content is where you aren't getting quite as much out of the Eras as they're capable of. To my ears it sounds like it just plays the surround content from all of the drivers (except the front), which does lead to nice wide soundstage, and doesn't feel like it's right behind you. But you lose the wide left and right separation when all the drivers are playing the same thing. Still much better than a One, but if you're watching mostly 5.1 content (like reality TV, sports, etc.), I don't think they're worth the upgrade."", ""GadgetronRatchet: [https://www.theverge.com/23657335/sonos-era-300-review-spatial-audio-atmos-speaker](https://www.theverge.com/23657335/sonos-era-300-review-spatial-audio-atmos-speaker)  The Verge says you won't be disappointed with them as surrounds sounds and they make a huge improvement. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUf0vV6srYk&t=779s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUf0vV6srYk&t=779s) Peter Pee is his videos said he was completely blown away by how amazing the Era 300's are as a surround pair.

The roam is far enough away it doesn't impact my listening in the main kitchen but it fills in the gap when i'm moving between the two rooms doing chores.  The roam then gets taken out ot the patio and again, is far enough away from the kitchen the two don't overlap but you don't miss out on anything you are listening to."", 'Small_Assistance5944: ""Pairing"" in Sonos talk is for linking two of the same type of speaker together to create true stereo sound in a single room or location. For this you need two of the same speaker; i.e., a pair of Ones or a pair of Roams. ""Grouped"" playback is for getting synchronized sound on separate speakers; usually in separate rooms for a multi-room sound system. For grouped playback in separate rooms or locations you could get a Roam and a One.\n\nIf you want a relocatable speaker to use around the house and can afford the extra money, I\'d suggest considering the Move. The Move is like a little boombox that is powerful enough to fill a room, deck, or patio space. The main limitation with the Move is that it can\'t share music with other speakers if you are using its bluetooth, but when you\'re streaming your music around the house you may never need the bluetooth anyway.\n\nI have two Moves and decided not to get the Roam because the only time I need a small and portable bluetooth speaker is when I\'m away from home. Sonos compatibility away from home is useless because then I\'m not in wifi range. For travel i just use another cheap bluetooth speaker.']"

Or if let's say the news is playing on the TV and I want to listen to it from the kitchen. 

My question is basically, does music have to be played through the Sonos app to pair speakers?

You can also turn the volume down on the soundbar if you want to watch or listen at a quieter volume on a speaker right next to you.\n\nThe biggest limitation with the Move is that its bluetooth can't be shared with other speakers.

The Move weighs about 10 pounds, however, so you need to use it more like a boombox rather than a travel speaker.\n\nSonos speakers sound great but what really sets them apart is the ability to add on gradually for a multi-room or whole-home sound system.

The center tweeter is deliberately disabled by Sonos when the 300s are used as surrounds. As I understand it, it's because the 300s are meant to be parallel to your TV (like how I have mine placed). Placed like this, the inside facing surround woofers and tweeters become your rear surrounds in 7.1 and point directly at your ears from behind.   The outside woofers/tweeters play the left/right surround effects in 7.1 and bounce sound off walls to reach your ears from the side.\n\n**The outside firing woofers and tweeters of the 300s, along with the arc are what take a majority of the load with stereo music.** So the experience becomes very different than with a pair of Ones or Play 3s or Fives.  I literally walked around the room paying attention to where sound was coming from as I was testing and placing things.\n\nWith the 300s, the outside woofers/tweeters work in concert with the arc side firing to emphasize left/right pans and widen the soundstage.  The result is a bigger sound stage, the sound is bouncing off walls and less direct than having 1s or Fives or Play 3s or 100s pointing at your ears.  The sound stage is more emphasized to the front which I personally like. With my old play 3s, the soundstage for stereo music at default trueplay levels was emphasized to the rear and I had to turn them down.  If you turned around, it was like just listening to the Play 3s (or ones in your case) in stereo by themselves but the left/right flipped.\n\nBack to your question, I think it could be interesting if Sonos allowed the center tweeter to be turned on or off.  I'm not sure if switching on the tweeter (without a matching woofer) would sound good. For now, it's a choice they've made and I'm fine with it.\n\nIf you like the way your current set-up sounds for stereo music, all I can say is that a setup with 300s would be different.

This is my current setup with the ones on either side of the sofa facing inward and balanced on the center cushion. While the wife is at work, that’s my go-to spot for playing PS5 and it sounds excellent. However, when the whole family is home (which includes my other dog), I’m usually relegated to the recliner on the right hand side and the surround sound there really is more of a point source. 

The Era 300s are a surround upgrade in a lot of areas, but I was hoping the wider soundstage they provide would help make that recliner a more viable seat when watching movies or playing PS5. If I keep the Era 300s in the same spot as the ones, will the recliner be included in the soundstage? Should I move the surround to a spot behind the recliner? If I do that, will it impact the balance at the center spot of the sofa? 

Obviously, the feng shui that my wife recommends would be the ultimate decision point here, but I’m curious what others have experienced on this. 

Thanks in advance to all those who went through this trial and error with your 300s. I appreciate it!"	1	['adayinalife: This is that I would do: move both your couch and sofa forward a bit, and to the right (so the sofa is not next to the wall. Place o300s behind (the more room you can leave the better), one near the corner (but leaving at least a foot of space to the wall). Place other 300 to the right of the couch. Both 300s facing forward. This will be likely your best scenario. You do have an open living space so the side with the wall have a better surround effect but unfortunately you cant overcome physics.']

The system sounds great and has worked wonderfully.

For movies in stereo or 5.1, the 300s and Fives are similar. The Era 300s will give you a wider soundstage in the back of the room, but the Fives will give you more direct surround playback because the front-facing drivers on the 300s are disabled when used as surrounds.\n\nIf I were you, I would test the 300s for yourself.

Green: where I plan to place the speakers, maybe 8-10 feet apart

Blue: sitting area; loveseat, and two chairs

Red: entrances to the living room, where foot traffic ends up being

All of the music I listen to is stereo, not Atmos, but that *could* change in the future, but not convinced. I also listen to CDs and have been planning to get a record player to play some vinyls. All signs are pointing me to getting the Fives. However, in my living room I mostly listen at a lower volume. My current Arc + Symfonisk surrounds + Sub gen 3 is set to a volume limit of 50% and I rarely go above 50 (so that would be like 25 volume normally with no volume limit set?).

I've read a bunch that the Fives don't come alive unless you crank it up, but I really want to know *how much* you would realistically have to crank it up to get good performance out of it. I don't want to have to set the Fives's volume super high or anything since my listening area is not super big and the wall separating myself from my neighbor is not super sound-proof.

I was thinking about the Era 300s and know that their bass response is not as strong as the Fives, but I also have a sub mini that is currently being used with an Era 100 in another room that I would be okay with adding to the pair of Era 300s to fill in that bass.

So what do you think? Are a pair of Era 300s + sub mini comparable to a pair of Fives at low (\~25-30) volume? I'm not an audiophile by any means so if the difference is small, I doubt I would notice.

Finishing our basement and will have an 85 inch tv in the living room for kids to play videos games and for family movies. I have the option to run wires for a traditional speaker set up but I’m favoring a Sonos surround set up for ease of use for the kids and to reduce clutter. Movies will be all streaming ( Netflix and Disney +) planning to get a arc, sub, and 300s for rears mounted on the wall. Am I crazy for not putting in a wired system when the walls are open?"	37	"['damgood32: What’s the cost to run wires?

Speaker wire is pretty darn cheap, get some nice banana plug-type outlets as well and you can have it look pretty tidy without anything even attached to it. If I had a ceiling open and was going to dry wall it, I\'d probably seriously consider dropping in at least two in-ceiling speakers as well for Atmos.\n\nBut then again, \\_for me\\_ I think the versatility for Sonos isn\'t ""hiding wires"" -- AC plugs are way harder to run and hide than speaker wire -- it\'s that I can break a system up when I move and put the speakers in different rooms trivially.', ""herrmo1: A traditional homecinema setup can result in a better experience. You can install ceiling speakers for Atmos and don't have to rely on virtual atmos effects.

I went with a Sonos surround system in my living room because I have Sonos devices in every room of my home: living room, kitchen, dining room, all bedrooms, master bath, garage, basement, and patio. That's a lot more involved and expensive to do with traditional wired gear.\n\nIf I was *just* doing a home theater system, I'd probably go with a traditional setup. You can get better sound for the same money. But after having a whole-home system, I don't think I'd want to go back to a single room setup."", 'mynoliebear: I pulled a lot of cable into my home theater. 11 discrete speakers (6 overhead) with two separate runs (one back to my rack on a different floor and one to my media stand in the room). I pulled 8 hdmi cables from the tv location (4 to my rack, 4 to the media stand). So much cat-6. At least two pairs to every light switch, speaker, with maybe 8 going from my tv to my rack, same again from my rack to my media cabinet. Subwoofer cabling? Of course! The longest piece of optical you’ve ever seen? You bet. Good old fashion RG6? At least 4. So.much.cable. \n\nBut I felt good. I had planned and measured and knew exactly what I wanted. \n\nAnd then I decided my rears needed to be 3’ wider and 18” up (after the drywall was up and painted) so I opened the walls and moved those speakers. \n\nAnd then I realized the 50’ 4K certified hdmi cable I bought wasn’t actually certified because nothing copper was 18MB when I bought it so I needed to have purchased fiber. So I purchased fiber and tried to pull it through my conduit (of course I put conduit in) but it wouldn’t pull so I started to open the walls again and my wife said no. \n\nAnd then I started thinking that I should have wired for a projector because sometimes I think I need 120”. \n\nAnd then my wife says, “what would this room be like if we spun everything 180 degrees?”\n\nIn conclusion, wiring is great, it really is, but it’s not flexible and there is tech that can go obsolete. There are also real fire/fire spread issues that need to be considered. Would I do it again? Probably. But only if I could install bass traps and float my floor.', 'ADKessler: Run the wires and buy the Sonos.  Most traditional surround sound has someone push a button/change a setting and it is never right again.  Sonos makes it simple, sounds great and is upgradeable.  Just make sure you have a mesh network in your house!', 'DblJBird: I do this for a living. I prefer a conventional system hands down. But then you have inputs that have to be set correctly, devices that have to be on/off, and someone always gets pissy when they can’t figure it out. You have kids which is why I mention. There is ARC and all that, but it doesn’t always work the way you want it to. Electronics are only awesome when everyone knows how to use them. \n\nA Sonos system would eliminate any conflict of operation. It never has to turn on or off or switch inputs. It always works…with the tv remote. \n\nI would spend the couple hundred or whatever it will cost to run all the wires. Your AV guy, electrician or whatever can leave all the wires hidden in the wall, take pictures and come back to them if you ever change your mind. \n\nIf there’s a wife, kids, in-laws etc I usually tell people to put a theater in when they finish the basement(if that’s an option).', 'Ordinary-Profession: Doing more research on home theater systems. I went to bestbuy with a magnolia home theater section and listened to surround systems with dedicated overhear atmos and I agree the sound is superior to the sonos set up. I posted on AVS and several suggested I go ahead and put in 4 atmos speakers and in wall surrounds and fronts for for a 5.4.1 system. This will cost about $2000 + the cost of a 9.2 channel receiver. Seems like a reasonable plan but then I started looking into tv stands that work well with an AV receiver , I don’t want to sit the AV receiver on top of the stand because the toddler and little kids will play with the buttons. Placing a receiver inside a cabinet behind a closed door is a must but then I need a specialty table that is deep enough and has enough ventilation to not overheat. These range in price from 2-3.5k. The total cost and complexity will far exceed a Sonos set up. The more i look into it the more I realize a dedicated home theater set up is going to pose a lot of challenges for what this room is , a second family room used by many people and a kids playroom. As much as I would love to have a dedicated home theater with 4 atmos channels overhead, I just can’t see it not being a headache at this stage in my life. I appreciate everyone’s input thus far. I think the most reasonable approach is to run speaker wire and leave it concealed behind the walls and get a Sonos surround system for now. This will give us a fun room to watch tv and video games and will be simple enough for my kids to use on their own and overall be headache free. When the kids get older if I have the itch for a dedicated home theater I can make the switch without too much difficulty.', 'Whatwhyreally: For what it’s worth, I ran wires for a 7.2.4 atmos setup 3 years ago and bought a fairly well reviewed set of Sony speakers. And it’s been fine for three years. But every time I heard the Sonos arc at Costco I wanted it. \n\nLast week I sold off the Sony speakers and now have an arc, two subs, and era 300s for a setup. Wires are sitting unused. \n\nIt’s just a different ERA of home theatre technology. I also love the polished Sonos experience and knowing the speakers are calibrated to work together. Really enjoying the switch.', 'National-Elk5102: There is always something coming from Sonos, I know that there are way better sound systems but nothing can beat the system updates. \nMaybe you can use a Port for the rears if you want something bigger, if a new codec breaks into the market you can just always replace the bar.\nThe versatility of the system is a deal breaker for me.', 'rltaylor24: Always had traditional home theater, but recently bought an Arc, Sub, and 2x Era 300.

If I had the room in my smallish condo, I would go with a true 5.1.4 or 5.2.4. Sounds like you have the best of both worlds and would highly recommend going wired. Best sounding if you’re looking for the best. You can always update as things change quickly and to me, the receiver is the most important part.

My home theater is just so superior, in every metric: punchier, more detailed, spacialization, bass... Given the price of Sonos, your system will cost almost 3K, which is the price of a very potent Home Theater that will deliver a much better experience.', 'arielsocarras: Not to mention you may as well run the Ethernet wires while you’re at it', 'Ordinary-Profession: Cost is negligible since walls and ceiling are open.', 'Ordinary-Profession: Yeah my plan was to have the contractor install recessed wall outlets on the back wall for the rear sonos.

Any specific speaker model?', 'radphencer: Yep, this is what I did and we love it.  And yes, you still need a Port if you want to listen to music on it, but it sounds amazing.

OP could just get a programmable remote and set up 1 button activation as well.', 'adayinalife: Yes you can', 'PanicLogically: Just review the product that has EARC---not all EARC products are putting out ATMOS --especially on the low end to mid end TVs.', 'Ordinary-Profession: Can you explain how this works? How does your nvidia shield control your receiver ? Also what about when they switch inputs to play Xbox?', 'Ordinary-Profession: No just movies. I appreciate and enjoy quality sound but I have little kids who will use it often. Main draw for Sonos is ease of use for them. I have a Sonos playbar and sub upstairs and it’s simple for everyone. It’s really the receiver and multiple input from a traditional receiver that I think will be problematic', 'Ordinary-Profession: What is a port for the rears?', 'tylercrabby: This! A thousand times this. Cost of copper is a fraction of the cost of running lines and re-rocking your basement later.

I just use it for streaming, turning on and off everything and adjusting the volume.   With receivers,  you plug in everything to the receivers multiple HDMI ports and only have one HDMI going to the TV.  With HDMI, you get CEC signaling which always you to use one remote for turning off and on and adjusting volume.  The thing to think about is, the Sonos ARC is only 3-4ft long and you are relying on small woofers to hopefully bounce off the walls to get left right separation.  With home theater, my left and right speakers are 6-7 ft apart with of course the center channel in the middle, so you get way better separation.  Don’t get me wrong, the Sonos sounds great, just not home theater great and you can get a decent home theater set up for close to the same price as all the Sonos stuff you would get.', 'National-Elk5102: Oh, a Sonos Port.

My dad is a bit of an audiophile, musician, and just overall music lover.  I'm trying to steer clear of a full AVR setup with different zones, etc as its just a bit too much for my 75 year old parents to handle.  The builder is trying to sell them on this whole-house audio setup, with a 7.1 home-theater setup, but I think that is just too much going on for them.  

They basically only listen to music in the living room/kitchen, backyard, and maybe front patio.  My idea was to just get a 5.1 Sonos arc + sub + one rears for the living room, and then two Era 100's as a stereo pair mounted up under the patio. Then they can add another era 100 to whatever other room they might want, or a roam or move

I settled on Sonos because I've heard good things about the user experience and just overall reliability.  I am their tech support, so I want something that will cause them the least amount of issues, and in turn, I get less calls about it not working lol.  Ease of use is the most important factor, sound quality second, and price is the least of the three concerns.

Is there a better system out there, with the priorities listed above in mind?  I know there are tons of sound bar options out there, I definitely want something that is going to sound amazing for them.  But I also want them to easily be able to use it, be able to easily play audio in the right room, and have it be relatively issue-free.  Really appreciate any advice here."	38	"['diogeneticism: As an old guy who’s been into high end audio gear for over half a century and just experienced Sonos gear in the past 10 months, i say go for the Sonos gear, especially in the living room.

The TV Arc + Sub “just works” and my dad was able to use Airplay on his phone without issue. You’ll want to make sure the TV has HDMI eARC to get full use of the Arc (most TVs made in the past 5 years do).       \n    \nGiven your priorities of ease of use, then quality, then price - I think what you’re recommending is a good fit if your parents know how to work a phone and music streaming apps.   \n  \nSide note if you’re an Apple family - I also recommend the Apple Family plan.

My first issue is that when I add the Connect to the TV room it creates a separate TV Room 2.  I'd like to just add it to the existing room but it doesn't seem possible.  

When music is playing via turntable to connect to tv room setup, the EQ with the Connect doesn't do anything for the sound.  It is only when I go to the speakers playing the music, tv room, I can change EQ settings.  Id like to just have something set for the turntable as it needs a little more bass and don't want to have to change EQ settings when switching back to TV.  Basically TV Room 2 EQ doesn't work at all.  

Can I just add the connect to the TV Room?  

Can I have a separate EQ setting just for the connect?

We also have a Move that we use in other rooms wherever we are. The Connect has a CD player and our turntable fed to it through a switcher. We go from the Connect to our receiver. Why, if that causes a 2 second delay? Because it permits the Connect and Move to not be out of sync which sounds incredibly annoying in the apartment.

What I want to know is whether there is any way to send the audio from what's being watched on the TV (which itself is fed through the receiver as well) to the Move. Theoretically, this would require the receiver which is producing the TV audio to then be sent out in a sort of loop out to the Connect. That probably isn't gonna work.

I am new in the world of Sonos, but ready to invest. I am living in a small apartment and mostly listen to music, and watch sports, motorsport, and game. The distance to my TV is about 3 to 4 meters. 

Hopefully, you guys can help in picking the perfect setup. I don't mind spending a bit more money, but if something is overkill I'm happy with downgrading. Long term I want to put a speaker in every room of my house, but first I would like to get the home cinema into place. 

Current idea: ARC Soundbar, Mini Sub, and 2x ERA100 speakers."	13	"[""GadgetronRatchet: Sounds like you're headed in the right direction! \n\nSome may say you need the full Sub, but the Sub-Mini IMO is perfect for apartments.

I have an Arc, Sub Gen 3, and 2x Era 100 speakers. It's great for our small living room (we're in a house). I think I could have gotten by with the Sub Mini, but given that we plan to move to a larger home in the next few years, I went ahead with the full sized sub for future-proofing purposes. If you're in the same place in life and your budget permits, you may want to consider the larger sub and simply turning down the bass. \n\nWe had actually downgraded from 2x Era 300 speakers and went with Era 100s as rears. They're really good. I thought the 300s were pretty mediocre for the price when listening to music. I remain interested in them but likely won't look to upgrade until Sonos has things worked out with firmware/software."", ""ishzach: I have a good size apartment with a Beam Gen 2, Sub and Pair of Ones and literally never even have my volume halfway up because it's plenty loud.

Then take that remaining budget and get a move or something else for your other rooms.  Once your tv sound is going to your arc, it will be available for all the other speakers in your system also.

The Era 100s main advantages would be if you also want the flexibility to use them individually in other rooms, or the bluetooth and optional ethernet/line-in connector.\n\nIt's also a good idea to make sure your TV, TV or streaming video and music services, converters, and adapters can support dolby atmos and spatial audio. Without those other pieces in place you're looking at additional expense and effort before you could really get all your money's worth out of the Arc and Era 300s.

I have just built a little surround setup in my living room (as well as some One SLs sprinkled throughout the house). 

My current surround setup is Arc, Sub, two Sonos architectural speakers in the ceiling hooked up to an Amp. 

I’ve recently plugged my record player into the Amp and realized I need to unpair the ceiling surrounds to get it working (wish I could automatically do this somehow, seems like a silly goose may have designed this setup). 

I can live with that annoyance but the next step drives me a little crazy. I add the surrounds back and need to retune the room even though the surrounds obviously haven’t moved. 

Is there a better way to do this? Can virtual rooms be setup that I easily switch between and it remembers the settings? Or how can I avoid the ridicule from my wife for spending so much on a sound system and looking like a dork tuning each time I play a record?

Thank you thank you!"	3	['GuitarSuperstar: You have to redo Trueplay tuning every time you remove the Amp as surrounds. Or get another Sonos device with line-in like a Port or Era 100.', 'paleposeidon: Oh nooo that is bad news. Appreciate your answer! I’ll look into both.']

My living room and your living room probably aren\'t the same size or shape. How is Sonos supposed to adaptively know what one click on your Era 100 is equivalent to in a different room on a different speaker? How are they supposed to know that you want 4 clicks in the kitchen for every 1 click in the living room? And then how are they supposed to assume that for every person that owns a Sonos speaker? Maybe I personally want 2 clicks in the kitchen for every 1 on the living room? The group volume slider only functions as an extension of the individual sliders. The individual sliders are digital representations of the physical volume controls on the individual devices. To have the physical buttons adopt the group slider function would require way more information than the single button press can provide. That\'s why the group slider is in the app that has all of that information being fed to it. Even still if you move large enough amounts in the group slider it\'s not even perfect at scaling everything together because of room acoustics and personal preferences.

To control the group with the same buttons you would have to remove the individual speaker control. That is a far more complex and inconvenient function than it doing what all on board volume buttons have done since their invention. Could it be an option in the app? Maybe, but to expect this feature to be standard is silly. I'm in my home office right now while my wife is in the living room watching TV.

Something tells me it would not be as simple as an intern crapping it out in an afternoon. That something is all of my ""melodramatic"" responses about how every room\'s acoustics are different, everyone\'s preferences are different, none of the speakers move the same amount on the slider to get the same change in volume, none of the speakers have the same minimum or maximum output, the currently existing group slider isn\'t even perfect at doing what you want, and no amount of smart tech is gonna be able to juggle all of that at the same time and make every customer happy. Sure they can put the ""change group volume"" option on a speaker\'s settings page. That doesn\'t change any of the other stuff you\'ll have to already do in the app to get it right where you want it every time before that feature is actually doing what you want it to do. So now the solution is ""just make preset groups and then make a preset volume for the preset groups"" and it has already become more complicated than some dude just adding it in their spare time. Could it be done? Yeah, probably. Is it simple? Probably not as simple as you\'d think. Does it make the speakers or experience better? Questionable at best.

They can very easily have input on the physical slider control other speakers because they already have the code that makes all the speakers go up or down. \n\nSonos tech is very impressive and I promise you they could do this if they want to but choose not to. It would be nice in my very specific situation, and the OP clearly thinks so too. In fact, I almost guarantee that the code for this feature exists, was tested, but they decided against implementing it. Compared to their other software this would be really really simple. \n\nI know they can do it, and in my specific situation, I would like it. If the product manager wanted to do it and the research said it would be a good move, they would do it. That’s all I’m saying.', 'JTOremus: It had better be your last comment because you\'re literally bringing nothing to the table. ""I want it"" and ""I know they can do it"" don\'t help your argument. Even if it was as simple as just taking the one app feature and letting you assign it to a button there are multiple other pieces of the app that would need to be amended to make it work the way you want that you\'re just entirely ignoring.']"

The sound isn't comparable (wired being better)."", 'Maleficent_Move_2617: I’ve been using and buying Sonos products since they first came out, but for years I had a wired HT system for my family room while the rest of the house was Sonos.  It was a pretty decent set up: Paradigm speakers made it a 5.1 system and I used an Anthem AV receiver.    Wires ran through my basement and I drilled holes through the floor to get them into the family room  AND THEN I did my best to hide the speaker wires in that room - PITA but looked ok for an HT setup.   The Anthem took up a bunch of space and I had problems with it every couple years and needed to get it fixed.   The fronts also took up a lot of real estate.  \n\nI swapped it all out for Sonos: arc, sub and ones for the rears.   A lot of people say wired sounds a lot better, but to be honest it really depends on the room and your options for speaker placement.  My family room is a rectangle with the TV on one long wall and a couch against the opposite long wall.   Because of the space, I don’t have the option to set up rears behind me and cutting into an 80 year old plaster ceiling for height speakers was not a practical option.  So in my case, I can’t say my wired system sounded better than the Sonos for TV/movies.   However, with the Sonos HT I freed up a ton of space and got rid of a lot of eyesores.  And, knock on wood, I’ve had less headaches with it.   Even wired receivers can have problems.  \n\nThe wired system did sound better for music, but that was only when I sat right in the middle of the couch and pulled the fronts away from the TV wall.  You get much better separation (for obvious reasons) when your fronts are spaced out.   That said, I rarely listened to music critically in that room.  Most of the time when music plays in this room it is when guests are over or I’m moving around the house doing things.  In these cases, separation and whatnot doesn’t really matter since it’s background music and you are generally not optimally positioned for listening.   \n\nBut now with the Sonos HT system, when guests are over I can more easily fold in the family room into the other Sonos zones when playing music.  \n\nI’m also looking at the era 300s for rears.  If I do pull the trigger, I will just use the Ones in different rooms.   This is in contrast to my old wired rear surrounds.   They were only useful for HT.  So when I switched to Sonos HT I had no use for them.  That is a really nice feature about Sonos - it is very simple to add onto and to move their speakers around the house - just unplug and plug back in a different room without having to worry about an integrated receiver and speaker wires.  \n\nMy two cents: if you  have the want, the budget, and are able to design a HT room, go wired.  Otherwise, go Sonos.  \n\nI have slowly added onto my Sonos system over the past 10-15 years and currently I am running Sonos through most of my house, on the deck, and in my garage.  I use it almost every day.  The only thing that’s not Sonos is my office, where I have a pretty decent near-field system set up at my desk.   With this, I have music for work and, when I have the time, I can kick my feet up on the desk and sit back right into the vertex of the listening triangle. ;-)', 'DerGJo: From all wireless soundbars that I’ve listened before, I felt like SONOS had the best overall package to offer. Even in terms of sound, for me personally at least, there’s nothing that comes close to the clarity of sound to SONOS.

When I compare to a single Five, the Five still have more clarity, but not outrageously so. And the Era 300 have a much better soundstage. In stereo, some will prefer the Five, some will prefer the pair of 300 (a single 300 was just no match).

TLDR: What is the cheapest/oldest Sonny’s speaker I can find to pair as surrounds with my Beam Gen 1.

I’m looking for the most budget friendly - cheapest 😂- way to add surround speakers to my Beam Gen1. I went to buy what was advertised as a Gen2 on FB marketplace but was able to talk them down to $175 when I saw it was a Gen1 so I figured at that price, it’s a great deal!

This is my third Beam, but I always seem to lose them in the break-ups 😂 😂 and I’d really like to level-up my setup with surround speakers. The Beam is in a small, rectangular room that is roughly 10’ x 12’ with a 48” LG OLED A2 TV. It sounds great, but I thought I’d look on EBay for some old Sonos 1 or Play:1. 

Can anyone help me sort out which would be the cheapest route to go for 2 surround Sonos speakers to pair with my Beam?


Thanks!"	17	"['mynoliebear: IKEA stuff is likely the cheapest thing you can use as surrounds.', ""Sp1r1tofg0nz0: I've seen a ton of Play:1s on FB in the past couple of days that are sub $100 each.

**What is the best, cleanest way to wall-mount the Era 100s???**

I purchased a [pair of the Sonos mounts](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sonos-era-100-wall-mount-pair), but I still haven't seen any photos of these mounts actually installed, and other than having the power cable go through the opening in the back/bottom of the mount, it is unclear to me where the cable is supposed to go from there.

I definitely do NOT want to have a looped together / zip-tied power cable visible if that is at all possible to avoid!

Thank you!!"	1	"[""DaddyFennix: in the past when I wall mounted Sonos play:1s, I poked a hole in the wall right behind where I wall mounted them, and ran the power cable in thru the wall and down to a light switch and hard-wired them to power in the closest junction box. So generally if you put them above where a light switch or receptacle is, you'll have easy power to work with. I think I used the original power cord, but just tripped the (male) pronged end to work with the bare wires.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course this isn't the way to do it by code, so only do it the way I mentioned if you know what you are doing or have an electrician that you are cool with. I believe the rule that it breaks is that you aren't supposed to run extension cords or power cords through a wall. Ideally you get a SHORT power cord and install a single receptacle in the wall behind your speaker, but of course that is a lot more difficult. Also you could do a similar setup, but go to a switch in a junction box in the ceiling (instead) of a receptacle) that way you can hardwire the switch (to the speaker) and have proper cabling in side the wall TO the switch junction box. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few way to do it, depends where you are flexible.""]"
