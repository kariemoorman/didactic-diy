And by horrifically slow I mean it takes well over a minute if it even comes up, moved the sync module I've checked the router settings, I've had speed tests done, has anybody else run into this issue. It's been a problem since day one and in the case of the front doorbell camera it defeats the purpose if the view fails when there's somebody outside the door and it takes well over a minute if it even goes into live view.

As for the notification delays I will walk up to the front door get in the house and it will be an easy 30 seconds to a minute before notification pops up on my phone about the camera going off. It is the exact same way with the security cameras, that is concerned about them but what is the point of a door cam if it takes that long to get a notification of somebody being there.

GreedyPaint	5	12wg24h	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/12wg24h/why_is_it_that_the_blink_app_on_ios_always/	"Seriously, what the hell is with that oversight?

Guaranteed the app will crash if you do not have a stable Internet connection on your iPhone or iPad.  

Once the Blink app starts up and I select a camera to view live, it will display a few frames, then chug, and then inevitably crash.  This is guaranteed to happen on any network that isn’t fast or stable.

This has been going on for a while now (well over a year now), it’s affected several versions of iOS, and it’s still a pervasive issue.

So, my question is, what the hell? What gives? Why is this still such a problem? Have the software engineers not prioritized this high enough in Jira or what? Shoot that thing up to a P2 (if you know, you know). I think this is a huge problem that hasn’t been addressed formally yet. I want to know why blink hasn’t assessed and tried to fix this issue; is it so ingrained into the core of the code they can’t fix it?

Crashing to a desktop while trying to perform normal operations is not “good coding” or even “good software”, I’m just so mad at how poorly this app was stitched together and basically forgotten about by Amazon and it’s devs.  I swear if I see an update for “UI improvements” and them not addressing actual bugs like this, I’m going to lose it."	5	"['MacNewton: OP.

PieInTheSky9	11	12r3o8r	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/12r3o8r/new_to_blink_sync_module_2_and_good_grief_this_is/	"This is a rant, and I know I'm not the first. I had 2 Blink mini cameras from some Echo deals but never really used them. Then we had some vehicle break-ins in our neighborhood and my Ring doorbell came up for renewal and I went looking for an alternative. I hate pointless subscriptions so when I saw the Blink Sync Module 2/Doorbell deal on Amazon I thought, ""Hey, that would work and I can setup the Minis I have more permanently."" So run that credit card and a day later the doorbell and sync module are here. Having setup the Ring, it was pretty easy to setup the Blink the same way and the setup is super duper easy. +1 there. I then have a camera I setup in my garage for in-garage package delivery and another I setup with a nifty gooseneck cable thing in my living room to cover an indoor area. I setup the sync module and connected with the app and plugged in a USB stick. All good so far. 

At this point, you probably know where I am going with this. I then realized that to keep the doorbell armed all the time but not the cameras, I have to setup a different ""system"". That of course means I lose local storage of the camera footage if the sync module is on the same system as the doorbell. What a dumb design. So for now I have all the cameras on the same system and I am just going to use the running man icon to turn off motion detection on the indoor camera unless we are away for an extended time.

I love I can have camera footage local without a subscription, but the limitations are just plain madness."	12	"['MacNewton: Personal opinion feel free to downvote. :) \n\nIMO I find the idea of the sync module is fantastic idea for setting up independent zones. Outdoor cameras, indoor cameras ext. scheduling is made easier with different zones as well. With IFTTT and Alexa you can automate a lot of different devices that work with the blink cameras. \n\nSetting up zones with other camera manufacturers is not a easy task unless you move up to more expensive CCTV systems.  \n\nFor the most part Blink cameras are terrible when you use local storage I can’t imagine not using a Blink plan the advantages outweigh the off plan method. You lose a lot of features, making the Blink kit almost useless.\n\nThat said some people are ok with this arrangement.

Not worth $3 a month to me, but for my impatient wife I don't think she even watches the videos any more.

So that is a feature of the subscription.   I've had my cameras for a few weeks now and I'm still under the 30-day trial and I see this Select/Delete option under Clips.  I generally like the Blink system, but without a subscription, if you have to pull the USB flash from the Sync module to delete clips using a computer , that is misleading and kinda deceptive that they don't tell you up front that feature is only available while on a subscription.    That could be a deal breaker for me.""]"

Bethsticle	0	12qgxy6	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/12qgxy6	"I have a blink subscription for my doorbell camera, and it's not recorded anything from it since I bought the plan. I'm getting notifications of movement but nothing on my list. I have a camera in my doorway overlooking my front garden which is the XT2 and works fine.

Rang the support team and they said it's not working and has no connection as I have low battery. I told them I used rechargeable batteries and they have worked perfectly until my free trial ran out. I can't afford the lithium batteries as they don't last long.

1681660071.0	16-Apr-2023 08:47:51	Blink Sync 1 Can't Connect to WiFi - Tried Everything	arethosemyfeets	2	12oe9w3	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/12oe9w3/blink_sync_1_cant_connect_to_wifi_tried_everything/	"I've an XT2 system that worked fine when I 1st got it. At some stage, the WiFi disconnected and I couldn't get it to connect again so I put it aside for a few months. Back trying to get it sorted again now before we go on holiday at the weekend.

Here's what's happening:

Ill try to set up the Sync in the app. I can start the setup, connect to the Syncs WiFi network and then when it's going through the motions (sending WiFi details to Sync, Connecting to Sync Servers etc), The power light goes red and I get an error to say the WiFi password was likely incorrect. It's not. 

Here's what I've tried to far based on other posts and some googling:


* Reinstalling the app 
* Trying it with a different network (we have 2 in the house here) 
* Making sure the network is on 2.4GHz
* Making sure the password had a capital letter in it
* Making sure the password was right
* Changing the power cord
* Hard resetting the sync
* Tried it with another phone with the app installed there.
* Turned off mobile data
* Checked to make sure firewall wasn't blocking it and security was set to low on network. 

Is there anything else worth trying? Anyone come across this before?"	10	"['enchantedspring: Have you tried the ""one simple trick"" using your phone hotspot?\n\nIf not, and you can\'t find it in the sub, we can explain it.\n\nFrom what you describe though, something has changed on a firmware update on the router - perhaps \'legacy authentication\' is disabled now etc.?

How long are your IP leases set for? Blink devices need lease times of 1 day+ or they loose 'track' of how to connect easily introducing delays in video / live view.\n\nOr your 5Ghz has the same SSID as the 2.4Ghz (split them)\n\nOr you have a . or 'forbidden character' at the start of your (new?)

Blink Software app already has the ability to pause notifications for a certain length of time - and it is fairly easy to use and not hidden. Plus it allows the notifications to automatically start back up again when that period of time has passed without further interaction by the users of the camera. I wish blink would have the same ability to EASILY disarm/stop motion recording on one camera at a time for a particular period of time and then it arms again after that period of time has passed without further interaction from me. So like it currently has pause notifications, I wish it would pause being ""armed"" or maybe call it ""pause recording motion"". For those times when say the shadow of a flag moving on the pavement causes motion triggers for 3 hours a day; or similar situations. This would be a truely useful improvement.

My dad has his own account and ordered a bunch of Blink cameras even though for this reason I would have gone with Wyze.
I can't join/make a Household since amazon is stupid and doesn't let me do it for 180 days after kicking an adult out of a household (in this case my mom's old account that I forgot about until very recently) so that option is a no-go for now.

Do we just link the Blink account to MY Amazon account?

The end setup would probably be:


His phone:

* Blink app


My phone:

* Blink app
* Alexa app


Additionally, any idea what to do with the second Sync Module 2? And would using a USB HDD instead of a flash drive be a good idea? (and if so, would we be able to just use that same HDD on a computer to view the footage?)

I honestly would have just gone with Wyze or another high quality 3rd-party brand (due to dual-compatibility with Google Home AND Alexa) but I GUESS Blink is tolerable. Beats having to deal with the shitty CCTV system like before. Thank you all for the help."	6	"[""enchantedspring: I am not too sure this will work as it will likely keep tripping the 2FA check for the account.\n\nYou also cannot add a USB HDD.

And even then, the V2 cam (which was white label shit) works well enough when I used it for myself. As for a HDD, I'd of course have it be powered seperately, but seriously?

I will test the front one once it is wired in as well.

Hi all, apologies if there's another place to find this info but I couldn't find anything on the Blink support pages and was hoping someone here may have an answer.

I have a new Blink video doorbell I've just set up. I have it wired to ring our existing analog chime, however when I press the button it only rings one of the chimes. So for instance, if our doorbell usually does a ""ding-dong"" I only get a ""ding"" and can't seem to get it to fire on the ""dong"" part. I've tested changing the power settings in the app but that doesn't change anything, which frankly I didn't expect it to, but never hurts to try. I can't seem to find any other setting for it.

Taking a look at our doorbell, it looks like there are two chimes, one that does the first ding by going down, and another that either does just the ""dong"" or both ""ding-dong"" by going just up or down and up... Sorry I'm really not too familiar with how these are set up. It seems testing in either the app or pressing the doorbell itself only does the one ding chime on the left. I've uploaded a picture here so it's easier to visualize.

Does anyone know what might work to get the full ""ding-dong"" sound? I must say I feel ridiculous with how many times I've typed out ding-dong... but hopefully it makes sense lol.

Thanks everybody for any help!

I’ve been experiencing some issues with my blink cameras randomly (or maybe not so randomly) not recording or capturing motion. It seems to always be when one neighbor in particular walks near the camera. And it is always around the time that they are arriving or leaving. 

Also, since it won’t capture clips, it seems that even adjusting the settings does nothing to help the issue. It’s almost as if I have no control over the cameras after they walk in front of it.

They aren’t fond of me because I unfortunately have to report the apartment shaking domestic violent fights they have almost every early morning (1-3am). Part of the reason I have the cameras up is for my personal safety as they have threatened to fight me once before when they were drunk. 

My question is, could they potentially deactivate the cameras somehow? Or am I just experiencing paranoia and it’s something much less sinister like a hardware issue? 

Thanks for your help :)

Update: it’s happening now too. The neighbor walked in front of the camera. That’s the last clip and then no more motion captured clips even though I can clearly see there is activity outside of my window."	6	"['tanzd: If you catch it happening in real time, try to do a live view of the camera.

I’m going to buy some wireless cameras but I’m unsure about the sync module and how it works. 

My main question is do the cameras connect to the sync module directly or to the Wi-Fi? The reason I ask is that I want to put the cameras on my garage and an outside office. It’s quite a distance and I have cables underground to them. I know from trying to make a mesh work that wireless access points between buildings could not communicate over that range. 

I couldn’t find this info in the user guides and would appreciate any help. Thanks!"	18	"['enchantedspring: The Sync module connects via WiFi to your router only AND via Low Frequency Radio - LFR - to the Cameras (not the Mini). The Sync module does not connect via WiFi to the cameras directly.\n\nThe LFR uses far less power than WiFi which is why the cameras can be battery powered - they only ""wake up"" and connect to WiFi when woken by the Sync module via LFR or on Armed motion detection.\n\nThe Blink WiFi chips have a very low powered amplifier and small antenna. They do not work well with medicore WiFi.\n\nYou need wired backhaul from router to an Access Point nearby - mesh or extenders introduce latency and jitter which you will notice.', 'ServingColdCuts: Thanks for replying. \n\nIf I wasn’t clear my Wi-Fi is superb. All locations are wired in and are on the same network. \n\nMy concern is that a sync module in the house won’t be able to reach the remote wireless cameras.

I appreciate your help.', 'ServingColdCuts: Thanks. I’ll try that. \n\nWhat happens if the camera gets out of range? Does it just not work?', 'enchantedspring: Yes, but the LFR is slightly more resilient and penetrating than WiFi.\n\nI have the full 10 Sync modules on one of my systems due to stone walls!\n\nGood luck!', ""Terrible_World_1900: That's a good question.. fortunately the furthest camera still gets a good connection so I don't know..I  go thru about twice as many batteries on that camera"", 'enchantedspring: Just to hop on this thread and add a bit to some of these extra questions...\n\nIf the camera cannot connect to a Sync module, it will continue on in the last mode (armed or disarmed) for up to 3 hours (it keeps waiting for an LFR connection every 30 or so minutes then fails and reports offline in the App after a certain number of checkins are missed).\n\nEnergiser Lithium Ultimate (the correct) cells last for up to a year in real life, but significantly less if WiFi is poor or IR is used a lot (wildlife uses usually).

My father bought 2 x Blink cameras around two years ago and he selected them because they were a one off payment and didn't need a subscription plan. Now, when he opens up his Blink app it tells him:

""*Plus plan trial 7 days left. When your trial ends, you'll no longer have video recording and limited to live views and motion alerts*.""

They've also sent an email saying the same today. As far as we can see, he was never party to a trial but it appears that the service is being redefined and he's being given a fait accompli.

On the face of it, this seems very much like bait and switch. If he'd known up front that he would face subscription charges, he may well have chosen another brand. Does anyone here know what's going on?

If Blink found the free service was unsustainable, I'd expect them to write and explain - but to suggest that his 'free trial' is coming to an end is disingenuous.

Looking for a bit of help - I've put a TLDR list of bullet point questions, but the longer explanation is below.

\- Does the sync module 2 have its own local storage?

\- Is there a reason that someone getting Blink cameras in September 2021 would run out of trial time before someone in May 2021?

\- I've read a lot about changes to Canadian users (Grandfathered Accounts) - has something like that happened in the UK recently?

&#x200B;

Longer explanation:

&#x200B;

I got my Blink cameras in May 2021 (two cameras and sync module 2), was pretty happy with them, and so bought another set for my parents for a birthday (September 2021, two cameras and sync module 2 again). We’re in the UK.

Since last week (22 March 2023), my parents have been unable to see any videos; going into the Blink app tells them that their subscription has ended, and that they need to go onto a new plan (but that they can use local storage if they get a sync module 2).

They have, and have always had a sync module 2. Their app shows that it's there, and online.

&#x200B;

My own system is still working fine, but when I look at my app, it suggests that the clips my system is recording, are being stored in the cloud, rather than locally... and that my storage is covered by Blink Plus free trial.  I am *pretty* sure I never signed up for a free trial, and I thought that all my clips were being stored locally to the module.  That being said - I've not got a USB in the module, nor do my parents, I thought the module had its own local storage - maybe I've been using the cloud storage all this time?

...but that wouldn't explain why my parents' module expired, and mine has not, despite being older.

The whole issue seems to have parallels with people talking about their experiences of their accounts being Grandfathered, or being failed to be Grandfathered, but I've not received any e-mails from Blink since I ordered them other than the delivery notes and marketing.

&#x200B;

It's very odd, and I don't even know what questions to ask of Blink Support - so any help that can be chucked my way, would be much appreciated!"	5	"[""enchantedspring: Welcome!\n\nYou don't mention which camera models. That's critical information for us to be able to unpick what's happening.\n\nHowever, your account is too young to be grandfathered (it's newer than 15th April 2020) - it won't be an OG account with inclusive cloud storage for all cameras in that case."", 'Pieface876: Amazon UK has recently ended the free trial for a lot of users and trying to move them onto the subscription based model. \n\nYou will need a USB Thumb Stick up to 256GB which plugs directly into the Sync 2 Module (exFAT formatted) to start having your clips saved again', ""davidasnoddy: Ah, apologies - all I can see is that they are Blink Outdoor cameras (and that's for both myself, and my parents)."", ""enchantedspring: No worries; the Outdoor is a model.\n\nIf you're UK like me, as Pieface has explained below Amazon UK has ended the (long) free trials for these models. There is no inclusive service for them, so if you're account is younger than the 15th April 2020 cutoff sadly the subscription is now due (or go for local storage on a compatible USB stick if you can tolerate it!)"", ""davidasnoddy: Weird thing, though - mine are fine.

Two cameras are working perfectly, and they are taking high volume of video recordings. Still working great with the original batteries for more than a month now. However, one that I am having trouble with, is that it keeps disconnecting every couple weeks. The first time I used it with the batteries came with the set, it stayed online for a week, then it went offline. I replaced the batteries (same brand, brand new), it stayed for two weeks. This was when I called customer service and opened a ticket for solution. They suggested me to removed the camera, remove the sync module, etc. Then replaced a fresh same brand batteries, I did everything they suggested, the camera stayed for 2 weeks. In that ticket I opened, I requested a replacement because since two of them are working fine, this one is probably having issue. And the other two are still using the same original batteries, this one has been replaced for like three times. Customer service keeps asking me to troubleshoot for them, which all of the requests were performed in the phone call. Now they know I've tried everything, they suggested me to make sure that I'm using fresh, Energizer 1.5v Lithium non-chargeable batteries. My gosh is it really hard to get a replacement? Anyone has experience like this?


update:
So I called in the hotline and talked to one of them, we went through the procedure and checked everything. Eventually we re-plugged in the batteries that I removed from the camera when it went offline, and the camera can be powered on with that old batteries. This means that the batteries were not drained, so it looks like the camera issue.

WiFi is affected by your neighbours systems too, so if they are running something non-compliant or very close, it will affect the outdoor camera more.\n\nCamera could also be faulty.

I've had 2 mini cameras for a couple of years and had no problems with them. I decided to buy a doorbell and a couple of extra cameras, along with the sync module 2.

I added the sync module 2 and the doorbell to my system and all was well.
But when I added the new mini cameras, while they work fine, they seem to have just connected directly to WiFi and skipped the sync module.

I'm basing this on the fact that I had to give them my WiFi details when setting up (it's my understanding that if they connect to the sync module then the sync module connects to the WiFi, so the cameras shouldn't care about the WiFi details) and they don't have a ""camera to sync module"" strength on the settings page like the doorbell does.

And no matter how many times I reset and readd them, I can't seem to figure out how to connect them to the sync module rather than direct to WiFi.

Am I misunderstanding? And if not, how do I connect my mini cameras to the sync module?

It's not a huge problem since they work fine connected to WiFi, but part of the reason I wanted a sync module is to reduce the amount of devices I have on my WiFi network, so I'd love to figure this out 

Thanks 🙂"	10	"[""FeMaster1: While I can't answer all your questions, as I have no experience with minis, the cameras will connect to both the WiFi and the sync module.

I can get the camera to work inside, but when I place the camera outside i cannot connect to it. The camera is literally on the other side of the wall to the hub. It’s not even 6’ away from it… I’ve got perfect wifi on my phone when standing where I have the camera and it is by no means far from the modem. It works fine inside the house, but the second I walk out the door and close it it will not connect. My house is wood construction so the only thing between the hub and camera is drywall, fibreglass insulation, plywood and the vinyl siding. Very standard, I have no idea what to do as I’m not tech savvy and my ring camera which is pretty well right under it works absolutely fine, I’ve never had an issue with it. Any suggestions?

Edit. After much fooling around with it, the camera will not work if it’s not within 6’ of the sync module. Hot garbage.

Been dealing with a Savvy Digital Stalker who figured out a means to get access to the Blink system via their unofficial API and doing a MITM (man in the middle) attack to get credentials from the camera communication. He takes over the module and either renames cameras, takes individual ones offline (6 outdoor cams and doorbell, one indoor) , Sets the status to disarm and of recent, takes the sync module completely down where you have to reboot it to resolve. 

Changing the account password to 30 characters did nothing as the damn cameras on passing info to the module on a wifi network, pass credentials. Securing the wifi network has been done (100character passwords) and still this ass gets the token from the cameras communicating by pretending to be her nework and capturing its communication first. 

I have set an outside the network computer to now use a python blink api library ( and her. blink credentials) to check on the arm status of the network and when unarmed, it resets it back to armed and notifies me and her via text. I recently had to add checks on module status and when its offline, notifies me as i now have the module on a smartplug that i can turn off n on from an app since the api doesnt give you the ability to bring the module online (or i havent found it). I am now researching how i can possibly access the smartplug via an api and when the blink system reports offline, it would trigger code to send a command to the smart plug to turn off and on.  All this code is set on a scheduler to check status every 4 minutes (i had it originally at every minute but the Blink API gateway tends think the requests were a DDOS attack and forced a authorization token refresh)

These cams are **NOT SECURE**. the hacker was able to accesss the live feed and watch and hear what was going on (one internal camera on the system). I have scrambled to keep the blink system up and add an alternate camera system that has in-camera memory and cloud storage to add as redundancy. 

Until Blink resolves securing the communication between the cams and modules that even if sniffed by MITM attacks, they dont give up the access authorization token for some unauthorized party to have full access to your system to them, i would not let anyone else buy these things.

there are others."	39	"['enchantedspring: This post was briefly unavailable due to its content.\n\nBlink has responded via support thus:  \n""*This is common with any connected device if an attacker has access to the network configuration or physical device itself.

Also have some minis for indoor use when we are out on vacation. \n\nCons:\nWithout the subscription, the blink service is subpar. \n\nIts not always recording.

I manage a very large apartment community. We wanted to expand the number of cameras we have on property. We have resident non-compliance issues often. Testing out BLINK cameras in various places as a cost effective method. I like the quality!
For instance, our using these is to see things like if there is a fight at the pool…we would want to look back and see who started it. Or if there is a damage in our clubhouse we want to look back and see who created it. 

I’ve installed two and put them on highest settings and sensitivity.

I have over 1000 clips in just one day. Realizing this would make it extremely challenging to find “an incident” if it did happen by searching through tons of individual clips.

I’m also concerned about the distance between the hub and the cameras. No big issue yet. We have strong WIFI everywhere, but the hub makes things tricky.

We’re sort of trying to use this like CCTV but a cheaper alternative. 

Is there any way to make this work better in my situation?? 

If not, can you suggest a cost effective brand of cameras that might be better suited??
We priced out actual security cameras to link onto our current system and the cost was insanely high. Thanks!!"	5	"[""enchantedspring: You need CCTV for this use case sadly, as if you're intending on gathering evidence and need the reliability they offer there is a minimum quality you need to achieve.\n\nThere's many other brands offering similar to Blink, but CCTV is ultimately the gold standard.\n\nFor example, the Wyze v3 cameras can be run in RTSP mode to stream back to a Synology NAS but do require power."", ""TunaPouch311: Blink cams are great for a single residence, but I don't see them being good for an entire apartment complex.

Originally, I set up the sync module right next to the router and the doorbell sat about 12m away. The connection was so bad that it if it worked, it would take over a minute to display the feed and then have delays of over 10s.

I've re-routed the router to other side of the wall that the doorbell is on and the sync module next to the router again.  

The wall is just bricks and plasterboard. The house is not made out of any unusually restrictive materials. Total distance between doorbell and router / sync module is approximately 80cm now.

It still takes around 15-20s to display the feed, but the delay in the live feed is only about 2s now.

The router is ASUS TUF AX5400 and works perfectly with all the other devices in the house. No issues.

I've tried on the normal SSID and also tried putting the blink camera on its own 2.4GHz SSID. Didn't help.

I've restarted the router multiple times. I've reset both the camera and sync module multiple times, too. And everything is on the latest firmware.

Have tried with the exact same results viewing on an iPhone 13, Samsung s22 and other android phones.

“Actually, please know that water getting into the lens which may cause the doorbell to fog up or be blurry, is considered water damage and is not part of the warranty for the doorbell.

We've owned a blink sync module + 2 cameras for about 2 years now. Recently I've been trying to use a USB device to save the clips locally (SSD card with USB converter). When I plug in the USB device, I will continually get notifications from the mobile app that the storage device has been connected and disconnected. Happens about once every 20-30 seconds and never resolves itself. I've tried reformatting the SSD but it still happens. I've ordered a new USB 2.0 flash drive to try instead since the USB adapter is quite old. Just wanted to post here in case anyone else has encountered this issue? Has anyone found out why this is happening? Any suggestions on other things I should try for troubleshooting? Thanks!

&#x200B;

Edit: I plugged in the dedicated USB drive that recently arrived and the local storage function works fine now, so there must have been something weird going on with using the SD card and USB converter cable."	4	"['NoRomBasic: FWIW I attempted to do similar when initially setting up my Blink system as I have a number of older and smaller SSDs that I\'ve placed into portable drive housings that I thought would be good candidates.  These are the issues I ran into before simply buying a couple of 128GB low profile flash drives and using those instead:\n\n\\-> The Sync 2 Module couldn\'t supply enough power to keep the SSD connected: Both the power supply that comes with the Sync 2 as well as the USB A port in the Sync itself appear to be unable to provide enough power to handle some SSDs (and even some larger capacity Flash Drives). I suspect this is what you are running into. I was able to resolve this by using an Anker 2 port high output USB P/S with one port powering the Sync and the 2nd USB port on the Anker P/S via a USB splitter cable powering the SSD. This solved the issue that I believe you are running into, which is the drive dropping off when the power levels drop too low during read/writes. But then I ran into problem #2:\n\n\\-> Most SSD drives and SATA-to-USB adapters will go into a ""sleep"" or low-power mode after being idle for a period of time. I found that, at least in my case, the Sync 2 had intermittent difficulties with this, where it appeared that the drives would not wake-up quickly enough for the Sync 2 when trying to access the SSD and backups would sporadically fail. \n\nAfter messing around with this for a few weeks and trying different approaches I finally just ordered a couple of Samsung FIT flash drives and kept the Anker power supply (vs the one that came with the Sync 2.

Check this out	joomuhh	12	11av7bp	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/11av7bp/long_load_times_check_this_out/	"I’ve been plagued with long load times since I installed these cameras. Taking 20+ seconds to load your doorbell kind of defeats the purpose right? I have a solid fiber connection and pull about 600/600 of my 1gb plan yet it didn’t help at all. 

I came across some interesting information on how one person managed to fix their speeds … and voila we hit gold.

Doorbell load times reduced from 20 seconds to a blistering 3 seconds.

My exterior cameras from 20 down to an average of 10. These weren’t my worry, it was mainly the doorbell. 

Enough blabbering, here’s what I did and hopefully it can help you.

- turns out it had to do with a default setting on my router. Beacon interval. 

- I have an asus router and was able to find this setting under the professional tab within the wireless section. 

- I changed from the default of 100ms to 300ms on the 2.4g band only. 

You can play with these settings to see what works best for you. 

I’ve tried 50, 75, 100, 200, and 300.

300 hit the mark for me, but don’t go too high or too low as it can affect throughput and overall reliability. A simple google search can make you more familiar with what beacon intervals are, and the effects of too high and too low. 

Hope this helps✌🏼"	3	"[""enchantedspring: Yes, this is a way, but I wouldn't recommend blindly adjusting network settings on routers without understanding the effects.

I bought a second mini for the bedroom at night to catch him if he pees on the rug. The sensitivity is set to 7 however sometimes it doesn’t capture everything. It’ll completely miss someone getting up and walking straight across the camera to go to the bathroom, but it will catch them coming back into the bedroom. Or it’ll miss my dog getting off the bed and walking around but catch him getting back on the bed. Sometimes it’ll miss everything but catch a tiny speck of dust floating around. It doesn’t make sense. 

We arm/disarm it every night and morning. We’ve tried testing different sensitivity levels. The light in the room doesn’t change as we mostly use it from 10pm-5:30am, so it’s always dark. It’ll miss motion randomly throughout the night. 

Is this normal for this brand? Is it the night vision causing the problem?"	3	"['enchantedspring: The Mini uses pixel difference analysis to detect and trigger motion.

ChiSky18	2	117qay6	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/117qay6/outdoor_floodlight_mount_issues/	We recently installed an outdoor blink + floodlight mount at our back door. It worked perfectly for about 3 days. Tonight, the motion started to only sometimes activate the floodlight for some reason. For instance, there will be times when the camera detects motion and starts recording, but the floodlight does not activate. Anyone with similar issues/potential solutions? I’ve tried playing around with the sensitivity settings with no luck. Could this potentially be caused by our back door window letting bright light from the kitchen outside to where the camera/floodlight is?	1	"[""WalkingHorse: I bet you it's the kitchen light. I was going crazy after installing mine. Could not figure out why the lights would not motion activate after dark.

Since you are already doing this, the rest of this post is more for those that would be interested in how to accomplish this.\n\nThe place we stay offers a free and paid tier of Internet access during your stay. The free tier has a limit of 4 devices. You have to figure with a family, 4 devices are gone just like that. The resort accomplishes this limitation by making you input your name and room number the first time a device tries to access the internet through their Wifi. It logs the MAC address of the device, so on the free tier once 4 MAC addresses are associated with you, then that\'s all there is unless you pay the exuberant amount for the paid tier.\n\nTo get around this limitation I use a travel router. I use my laptop to ""log into"" the resorts WiFi so that the MAC address of my laptop is in their system. Once that\'s done, I disconnect the laptop from their Wifi, and then connect the travel router to the Wifi instead. This is done by having the router clone my laptop\'s MAC address. Their network now thinks that my travel router is actually the laptop that I connected with earlier. Once that\'s set up, then all of our devices will connect to the travel router instead of directly to the resorts WiFi. Now everybody has Internet access with as many devices as we want.\n\nAn added benefit of this is the travel router acts as a hardware firewall which keeps all of our devices safe from prying individuals, should the place we are staying at not have their network configured correctly to prevent devices on the network from seeing and/or accessing each other.', ""professionaldiy: I tried to say the same and got down voted.

So I have a blink sync module 2 along with one outdoor camera and a blink mini inside the house. Today I installed a blink wireless doorbell. Until today, The app has saved every motion captured video onto the app without me paying anything towards a subscription. This changed since installing the doorbell and I can no longer see auto saved videos. Anybody know why this suddenly stopped? Was I just getting lucky before??

I've watched several youtube videos about this, and it seems like some users of blink products are able to utilize local storage without any issues, while others are not.

Things I've done

- sensitivity is on 9

- IR/night mode is off/low

- quality is best

- sync module is about 3ft away from the camera and 3ft away from my router"	22	"['HAsamsk80: Is the camera mounted outside (not behind glass)?', 'enchantedspring: I\'ve read through all the replies so far and have these thoughts:\n\n1. the PIR detection (i.e. all devices except the Blink Mini) works by detecting a shifting heat gradient from left to right across the PIR sensor (tagging u/Auggie93 for info on this too). Your picture shows it impossible to have that left to right transition I think.\n2. ""*sync module is about 3ft away from the camera and 3ft away from my router*"" - too close. Radio or even TV signals are \'drowned out\' by being too close to a transmitter. This is the same with WiFi.\n3. Your set-up does not, to me, look like it will work with the Blink PIR based motion detection. You\'re effectively relying on the heat from someones head (looking down on all but the tallest people) to trigger the PIR. But then the heat doesn\'t move from left to right so.....\n4. You may have a faulty camera or PIR (it\'s rare, but does happen), but most likely you need to position the camera on the opposite wall at a lower level. Can\'t see the whole location though so there may also be even better places!\n5. When talking about signal strength, ignore the App. The App only measures signal strength and not latency or quality. Your router will have better metrics (RSSI values etc.) in it\'s logs if you search for the Blink device MAC address (on the sticker on the back). I don\'t think this is signal issue here though, more a suboptimal placement problem.\n6. (more for others that follow...) I know it\'s frustrating, everything networking is frustrating when they just don\'t work, but it\'s easier to try and help if the starting point isn\'t \'convince me not to chuck them\' - there\'s no Blink people known on this sub so there\'s sadly just us here!!\n\nOnce you have them working, they will work reliably though :)', 'roytwo: I have 5 Blink cameras and find them very sensitive to motion.

I tried clearing all existing clips from the device in case it was full (it wasn’t, there was over 200GB remaining on the USB stick). Note: I could see and play the existing clips fine before I cleared it, so I don’t think the stick is bad.

I tried disabling and re-enabling motion recording on the cameras.

I can still get a live view if I click on the cameras, and the module shows as online with a last check in of a minute ago. 

I have five cameras - two indoor (wired) and three outdoor (battery). I do not pay for a subscription.

Any tips, tricks, other things I can try? Thanks!"	4	"[""enchantedspring: For this one I would test out a new, correctly formatted stick.

Again, I ask even if they CAN, WHY WOULD THEY? Are you SOOOO interesting or are you doing such demented things on your cams that you are afraid will get out?

My last camera had a feature that detected when I was/wasn't home and started recording when I left. This makes sense.

Now I have to manually arm the camera every time I leave? That's just annoying and I very often forget, which entirely defeats the purpose of having a camera. 

Furthermore, even if I wanted it recording 24/7, I'd have to snooze notifications every 4 hours, which is absurd. 

Does proper use of this camera actually require opening up the app every single time I leave?

1674792156.0	26-Jan-2023 20:02:36	Please tell me there is a way to batch download cloud clips.	tresrottn	2	10mbkvx	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/10mbkvx/please_tell_me_there_is_a_way_to_batch_download/	"A very much beloved pet passed away suddenly  last month and it was so wrong and I've been wrecked by it.

I decided I wanted to download the clips (thousand +?) I called blink support and all they could do was upsell the sync 2 (which apparently doesn't download clips from before it was connected) and that if the police had a subpoena they would do a batch download for them. Worse, not one single representative had a single shred of empathy. One kept writing me asking if everything was resolved. I begged him to please stop torturing me before he left it alone, but not before trying to sell that sync 2!. It's not resolved, it will never be resolved.

So basically, I'm in hell. I've been racing against the clock, trying to download these clip individually and it's killing me. I have to manually scroll for 10 minutes to get to where I had to stop, I spend the entire time crying my eyes out, reliving this beautiful cats last days, I can't take it for very long. My mental well-being is no longer well. I've lost days of clips because I simply couldn't bear the pain of the process I am forced to do.

If I weren't stressed out enough, this *insane* glitch that every now and again (like 2-3 per minute) the clips go blank and it starts this mad scroll up back to the present, I have to catch and hold it then carefully try to scroll back down to where I was and start over. 7 minutes to get to the last clip, I am stressed, upset, *and* have to be hypervigilant.

Then I read people in other countries have the option to download all their clips with a button press because they have better digital privacy protection laws. Well. Yay.

I'm at the end of my rope. It's like being forced to watch my kid die in front of me over and over and over again.

I can't believe the only bulk management option is deleting. It should also let you download or share them to Amazon photos or something, but as it is, I wish I could sue them for the actual pain and suffering I am having to go through. This has been traumatic.

Tl;Dr please is there an easier way to download all my clips before they get deleted? I need them.

Quick update: The videos are downloading. It started from yesterday and working it's way backwards, so it's not going to get some videos before they're deleted. I lost a half a days worth of clips getting this set up. So, I'm downloading individually the ones facing imminent danger of deletion as quickly as I can and hopefully will be able to meet it in the middle. But, they're downloading. When I am in a better place mentally, I want to be able to watch them and celebrate this little girl.

I’ve gone threw 4 sets of Energizer lithiums in two months.
Blinks customer service was easily the worst experience I’ve had in years.
I opened a ticket with them and the ONLY reply I would get, no matter how many photos and screen shots, was to replace the batteries.  
Last set of lithium’s lasted 5 days with only 10 total short, low quality settings video of a spider.
I have it pointed feet from my driveway with 100% WiFi connections and no matter how I setup the camera, FedEx trucks drive by and park right in front with video Maybe twice.
I have an email string with their customer service representative Hezel Jane.  
They literally and completely ignored my questions and requests for replacement.   Shockingly bad company.
I finally chatted with Amazon and returning for a refund.  I asked if they would send a replacement, and she refused saying I had to purchase it again (at a much higher price).
I’m done with this horrible camera…

Their canned reply below from my last email explaining the batteries only lasted 5 days, with screenshots of the correct batteries purchased from Amazon and installed photos.
——

After careful review of the server logs for that particular camera, I was able to verify that the batteries in that camera have depleted. Typically, the batteries should last up to two years with standard use, which is defined as approximately 40,000 seconds of usage on the 1st Gen Blink Indoor Camera, and the XT Camera, and approximately 53,870 seconds of usage on the XT2, and new gen Blink Indoor and Blink Outdoor Cameras. (Usage is calculated by seconds worth of recorded motion clips and Live View sessions, use of two way audio, etc.)

When you replace the batteries, you will want to use non-rechargeable AA Lithium (Energizer) batteries. Please do not use Alkaline-based, Lithium-Ion/Li-ion, or rechargeable batteries as they will drain quickly and may cause the cameras to malfunction. To purchase the recommended battery type from Amazon, check out this link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003IEME/

You can also power the camera using a micro USB cable and USB power adapter if the camera is indoors. We do not recommend that set up for outdoor use as it makes the camera non-weather resistant.

For reference, Listed below are a few things that may also affect your battery life:
- Use of non-lithium batteries (Such as alkaline or rechargeable batteries)
- Slow Internet connection speeds
- Extreme temperatures
- Weak camera signal strength between the Sync Module and the Wi-Fi router
​

I live in an apartment where we all have external doors that go directly to the outdoors, no shared halls.

I bought a blink doorbell camera and and outdoor camera to place by the 2 entry points I have.   
I'm starting to question whether its ethical to put a camera on my door without notifying my neighbor. We share a short walkway that leads up to our respective doors. I don't care for my neighbor and this is partly in response to them not paying attention when at the door and we both have dogs. 

Is this an ethical thing to do? Is there a better way? And I just worrying? Does my right to security trump her right to privacy? I have not hung it yet, but can today when it arrives.

For them to start recording movement or work I need to go into the Blink app and do a live video for each and then they begin working again. I have a paid subscription, wifi in my house is top notch, wifi connection on my mesh system is excellent, cameras are within 10 ft of either my Google mesh point our router. I've restarted my wifi, restarted my blink app, restarted my sync module for my blink doorbell and nothing is solved.

Blink assistance had me do all this again, then they connected to my system and ran tests, had me literally stand in front of them and move so it tested the system while on the phone.  All of which I have pointed out numerous times to the Blink technical support that I've done, time and time again.

Anyone else have this problem? I'm in Canada.

Edit/Update:

They have a Show 5 and can view the doorbell. I followed a YouTube video on setting up two routines. 
1. When doorbell is pressed Alexa says show doorbell. 
2. When doorbell is presses wait 20 seconds then alexa says stop. 

Issues I have is routine 2 didn't work until I rebooted the Echo but then only worked for a day before not working again so the camera stays on until told to stop. Ive tried rebooting, deleting and re adding the routine but still doesn't work. I am also getting an error message on the Blink app that the system is busy. I'm wondering if this may be because the video feed is showing on the echo. To test this I added a 10 second wait to routine 1 to allow them to answer via the app first but this routine now no longer works either, if i delete the 10 second wait it starts working again which makes me think there is an issue with routines with a wait command.

There are 2 echo show 5's and 2 phones on the network. In an ideal world I would like to be able to have the echo shows activate on a doorbell press, and in the event that no one is in the house, also be able to click  the phone notifications and view on either phone. 

Is this something that is doable? It seems that if a doorbell activates on a show then it can't be displayed on another show or even viewed from a phone?"	1	['x35fighter: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttkVYnd0NDw&t=306s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttkVYnd0NDw&t=306s)\n\nI tried this an it worked but I did have to change the routine in order for the echo show to stop live view after so many seconds. Instead of creating a separate wait and then stop routine like in the video, you just include all steps into that one routine set to launch upon doorbell press. So basically routine will open the live view > wait 45 seconds (my settings) > then stop live view. Good luck!\n\nEdit: The video is old and Amazon fixed the issues that the Youtuber experienced so that is why I was able to put all those steps in the video into one routine.']

I have 5 Outdoor cameras purchased at different times. About the only thing I can think of that might be different than other peoples\' setups is that one of the cameras is a beta test unit, as I was part of a ""2 month beta test"" for the Outdoor line of cameras. In reality the testing lasted about 8 months, but the cloud service wasn\'t cut off until about a year after we initially got the cameras. I\'d guess all the delays probably had to do with COVID, as the testing started in March of 2020, just before the shit hit the fan in most places and lockdowns went into full swing. That unit came with the original Sync module (#1), though it had a USB port on the side of it like a Sync 2 does.\n\nAfter they cut us off, I made the decision that I wasn\'t going to pay for the service, so I went out and bought a single camera system that included the Sync 2 module so I could do local saves (spring 2021). At the same time I picked up a Samsung 128GB USB 3.0 flash drive, along with a short (6"") USB extension cable. I picked up a single add-on camera during Prime Day 2021, and bought a double camera add-on during Prime Day 2022. Of course each time I added new cameras I was allotted a 30-day trial, so I was on and off the cloud service a couple times over the years. The final 2 cameras went up in July 2022, and I\'ve not touched the system since. The last free 30-day trial I had ended in August, so I\'ve been on local saves ever since.\n\nThe one factor that may or may not affect the reliability of my system vs other peoples is that I have one of the older Sync 2 modules which has the single digit firmware. The latest for this module is V4.5.7.  I know a lot of others out there have the newer unit which has a double digit firmware of something like V15.x.x. I can\'t say if that is a factor in all the issues people are having or not, but it certainly shouldn\'t be ruled out.\n\nAs far as internet goes, Spectrum is the provider. Home service with a very generous \\[cough!\\] 100Mb down and 10Mb up. Tests show that I generally get 114 down and 12 up, so either the test website is not accurate or I\'m lucking out.\n\nWiFi consists of Synology units, which are a bit nicer that the typical home users router.

When I was still on the trail version with cloud storage, I would get badge (iPhone) notifications as well as Lock Screen notifications.

Now that I’m on local storage, I’m not getting badge notifications on the app. So if I’m not on my phone when motion triggers a recording, I am not getting a notification and would never know that a recording happened and would never know to go look for the recording unless I happened to go into the app on my own. Ie no notification telling me a recording was recorded. 

iPhone 13, same app settings as when I was on the free 30 day trail, and I was getting notifications just fine during the 30 day trial.

I've been using Blink cams for indoor security for a while, and generally, they work. But some times (and this is not rare), when they are armed and there's movement in the camera, my Android phone does not notify me with the ""movement detected"" notification.
If after this I open the app, then all the notifications start popping all together warning me about 20-30 movements detected while the app was not notifying me.
This is a HUGE problem, as if it was a security problem, I could be unaware of the movement until I manually opened the app.
I've tried to put the app in the battery unrestricted setting, and kind of things, but it keeps happening in some occasions, like after I reboot my phone (I think?).
Is this happening to any of you? Any workaround to force the app to ALWAYS notify me when there's movement?
Thanks!"	2	"[""enchantedspring: Ah, that could be one of two main things:\n\n1) when Android has automatically 'put to sleep' the Blink App - enable 'never put to sleep' for the App and that will be resolved.\n\nor 2) when your data connection service hangs and is restarted by the Android subsystem (notifications 'rush' in at once) - you need to either simply reboot your phone (if it's been running a long time) or fix the underlying OS issue for that one.

Like many posts I've seen, after a recent firmware update, I found my blink cameras were no longer sending notifications or recordings to the local USB storage.  If I removed the USB, notifications would start again.    I tried everything imaginable and finally found a method that works.

I have two blink systems, set up, one for the garage and one for the front door.  Because only the front door system was knocked out, I was able to swatch different combinations to confirm there was something weird with the front door blink module.  After any and all reset possibilities, readds, deletes, and different USB drives, this exact way worked.

1. While still plugged in and connected with the USB plugged in, I pushed the reset button on the blink module until it reset.  The red light will turn on, and then once you let go, the led should start blinking
2. Now, without deleting the module, the app shows the module is offline.  I clicked change wifi.  this allowed me to connect back to the reset module and then choose my wifi again.

After it reconnected, the module started working again.   To really futz with it and confirm this method works, I deleted and reset the whole system again.  I removed the module, cameras, and system and put it all back together.  Then I confirmed that once again it was not recording and there were no notifications as long as I had USB recording enabled.   I redid the method above and it started working again.

Did Amazon purposely nerf the system to force people to subscribe after the latest firmware?  I can't imagine it to be so malicious.  I think there is likely a firmware bug that needs to get resolved.  I hope this helps you if you are having the same issue.  Happy New Year!"	5	"[""3lmtree: thanks this worked for me! my internet went down for awhile today and when it came back up noticed my stuff wasn't recording. i did the one reset another poster suggested and it didn't work for me this time around, but your suggestion did. i hope it's just a bug and fix it eventually..."", 'RockyRacoon09: Didn’t work for me.

Ipse_Tase	28	zz7ky4	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/zz7ky4/anyone_up_for_a_class_action_lawsuit_against/	"This is a crosspost from the Amazon's own forum....thanks for reading.

&#x200B;

Really simple: the day my free Cloud subscription expired, my problems started with the clips being saved locally.

I know I'm not alone, this forum and Reddit are full of similar reports.

I'm quite familiar with network equipment and have set up everything in the house myself, so I'm pretty sure it's not ""user error"" as your vendors usually tend to infer.

Today, the Sync Module 2 is seen on the network, available and SOMETIMES even decides to record clips. SOMETIMES.

I definitely power-cycled the module, performed a hardware reset, deleted and re-added the module, but while I get normal notifications on all connected devices (phones, tablets, Echos) I don't get clip recording ...maybe it works once in 100 notifications.

Obviously, if it works once, the network is out of the question, but nonetheless I verified in the firewall that the module has connections to all cameras and they exchange traffic.

Considering that everything worked fine for the month I had Cloud subscription, I can only conclude this is either a complete disregard for software quality when it comes to local recording or a blatant attempt to force customers to subscribe.

Since I'm not alone, I'm interested in what legal avenues we have as customers.

EDIT: A number of folks replied citing good Blink support....I can confirm that for the doorbell they sent me TWO backplates (original was not allowing the case to slide in place, very poor design, the first replacement was lost due to an intelligent UPS driver who threw the envelope on a windy day, despite being 1ft away from a mailbox).
So support is not the issue here, it's the shitty software associated with local recording - how come during the trial month I had instant access to all recordings and MUCH faster than on my gigabit LAN?

Considering I just received an item that was repackaged in bubble wrap and a plastic bag, I am getting pretty convinced that Amazon is turning into an abysmal Walmart/Zellers/Kmart low end store.
Something needs to be done, otherwise that will only get worse....and money is the language Bezos speaks."	55	"['ImWaitin4GoodThings: I’ve been using Blink cameras since they first started and have had and used every cam version. \n\nI have yet to even install any of the Sync 2 modules for fear of my grandfathered free subscription going away. \nI’m so scared of that due to the issues I’ve heard.  Tho I’d prefer a type of local storage, it surely is not the way they do it. \n\nI’ve tried to deal with Blink on a very obvious issue that is having to do with the Gen 3 inconsistent built  quality many of which are poor when it comes to that camera generations issues with IR LEDs / Night Vision. \n\nI’ve got many Gen 3 and some have issues with the IR LEDs inside for Night Vision causing an internal reflection making the image poor where it occurs, it’s only night vision, but I live where there are no street or city lights.

LustyLioness	1	zykjcx	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/zykjcx/does_blink_mini_blue_light_turn_on_when_armed_and/	"Question pretty straight forward, but I do have a few more.

How to tell if a blink mini is armed if you’re not in the app, I noticed when viewing live video it has a blue light turn on.

If you don’t have a subscription, does it save motion clips? For how long?

Is there a set time they record for once motion is detected?

Let’s pretend it records for 60 seconds once motion is detected, how long until it will reset, and “sense motion” again and start a new 60 second recording? If motion is continuous will it continue to record?

I’m only interested in how the blink mini functions.

It drains completly empty in 2 weeks, with 3-4 triggers per day. It is on external power for 3/4 of that time, then it switches to the blink's batteries and is dead within a couple of days. 

Before I had an old XT-2 camera which lasted for 2-3 months in the same spot, now with the solar mount and the camera that came with it, it lasts over a way shorter period.

I have no idea what is happening. Blink support already replaced the mount, with no change at all. As it is winter here, I understand that the mount is not charging well, but it should last longer, as I manually charged the 3.7V battery of the mount.

Is it possible that the mount drains also the batteries in the camera? I will try the blink now without attaching it to the solar mount to see if it lasts longer.

Anyone experienced similar behaviour?"	3	"[""enchantedspring: The mount can't drain the camera batteries as there's a simple diode in the circuit to prevent it.\n\nAre the camera batteries the correct Energiser Lithium Ultimates?\n\nSomething's not right though as both the camera AND the solar battery packs shouldn't drain off in a few days. Is the IR light always on? Can you check your router logs to be sure the router isn't forcing the camera to stay always connected to WiFi? That would drain it over a few days as described."", ""PopularApricot7790: Not sure where the other guy got his information. But it was all through the reviews on Amazon. A lot of people were pissed because exactly what you were saying happened to them. Those reviews might still be up there but Amazon deletes a lot of negative reviews on products. The only reason I know is because that is the literal reason I don't have their solar mount."", 'The_real_Cthulux: Thanks for the reply. Ideally there is a diode, but as I never opened up the mount, I don\'t know if there really is. I already wanted to add a diode to the connecting cable of the mount, to exclude this.\n\nI used Energiser Ultimate in the beginning, but stopped, as I would be poor by now... I switched to others, the difference is not significant in my situation (1-2 days longer with Energiser)\n\nThe IR light doesn\'t seem to be always on. And I found nothing in the router logs which would force the camera to be always connected. Especially, I do not have these problems with the other blink cameras, attached to the same Wifi, so I assume that the router is not the problem.\n\nOne thing I read on a forum is that the new blink cameras (version 2?) that come with the solar mount, have a feature enabled by default: ""Enable Photo Capture"", which my other older cameras do not have. This feature take a photo every 1 hour. So that\'s 24 triggers a day, and 168 triggers a week. Perhaps this is what is draining the batteries. I didn\'t even know that this setting was there, as it is only available on the new cameras, and switched on by default. I now turned it off to see if that makes a change!']"

We’ve had them all for about a year. I’ve played with zones, positioning, height, scheduling, and every other tweak I could think of or find within the app. Generally speaking, they alert us to motion when we already know about it for some other reason, alert us to motion that we don’t want to know about, alert us to motion that doesn’t exist, and don’t alert us to motion that we wish we’d known about. Once in a while we’re happy they alerted us about something. Once in a while they record something useful while we’re away. They seem to be very finicky. Also kinda maybe not that reliable or predictable. IR doesn’t go on when it should and turns off too late as well.

The batteries on the doorbell ran out within the first month we had it and blink sent new ones (thanks, blink support!), then after replacement, the low battery notification stayed on whenever the temperature was below freezing outside even though the batteries weren’t actually low.

Just got off the phone with support and they are trying to tell me my relatively new router is the issue. 

I stopped getting motion notifications recently.  This caused me to look into the Sync Module and I realized events haven’t been recording either. 

Multiple resets and system deletes and I realized that when the USB is removed, I get motion and notification as normal. As soon as I plug back in a USB, the cameras don’t detect motion, I don’t get notifications and of course, nothing records. 

I’ve tried multiple USB drives. All the same result. The only way to get notifications, is to remove the USB it seems. 

Anyone have advice?

Update: I deleted the entire system. I run a mesh network. I manually removed all remaining instances from Blink on my “connected devices” list.  I set the system back up making sure to give each device a solid couple minutes to boot up before adding. The system is working as it should at the moment!

I got blink plus for my grandma's setup, that I am paying under my amazon account. My grandma has her own blink account, but I can't remember if I linked my amazon account or hers, I am assuming it is mine since I am paying for the blink plus. 

I am wondering a couple of things:

1. Can I setup the new camera and doorbell at my mom's house, and have the camera's under my blink plus plan?
2. Is there anyway to check which amazon account is linked to my grandma's account? When I look it just allows me to unlink, it doesn't show what account is linked.
3. Can multiple people view the camera's in the app? Like can my dad also look at the cameras on his phone?
4. I want to setup echo dots as chimes, are they loud? I got 2, they have two stories, but they have a pretty open area, so I am wondering if they are loud enough that I would only need 1.
5. I can't remember if I checked the associate with my amazon account when I bought the blink camera and doorbell, I noticed it was checked when I bought the echo dot, and I unchecked it. Will I encounter much issues when I install the cameras if I end up using my mom's amazon account?
6. Can I have separate notifications for individual systems? if I can have 2 systems, at different locations, can I have it so person at system 1 only receives notifications on cameras on system 1, and person at system 2 only receives notifications on system 2?

I have a blink doorbell (current model) and last year xt2 indoor-outdoor camera. I currently had on first gen blink sync module. But decided to upgrade to second gen module for usb support. for some reason my doorbell wants me to sign up for a plan whereas the older camera just works without (grandfathered?)

Ever since I set up the second module and remove the first module, if I lose power or Internet it’s a pain in the ass to get the same also connected back to my router. I literally have to unplug it and plug it back in and then finally it reconnect.

Every morning around 3 AM PST Comcast does their check update and rehash which means the Internet blips for like 10 seconds, which in turn disconnects my sync module. And of course the blue light is studying the green light flashes. I have to unplug and plug it back in.

I scoured the Internet. I looked everywhere. I don’t know what to do. I have a feeling it has something to do with the IP. Maybe it’s coinciding with my old system I thought the second module would be an upgrade. It would be better but it’s giving me nothing but headaches .

Has anybody ran into this I know a way to fix or a workaround I just don’t want to be on vacation and then my Internet goes out or power and my cameras don’t come back online cause I’m not there to plug it in.

I am replacing an old intercom set up. It has four wires instead of two.  Green and Yellow are connected to the PCB board that has the bell button and then go to the speaker.

Any insight on how to wire this to Blink DoorBell?

Hmmark1984	3	zls1yg	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/zls1yg/blink_doorbell_sometimes_notifications_come/	"Getting really fed up with my Blink Doorbell. In the past, I tried a Ring doorbell and found it would take upwards of 5 mins for it to notify me of a press, so I returned it immediately.

Since then, I installed Blink camera's around my home and was quite happy with them, so when the doorbell was released, for a LOT less than others, I grabbed one.

For a while, it was pretty good however now, roughly a year after install, it's causing so many issues.

I have it set up to announce via two Alexa Echo devices, and both myself and one other in the house have the blink app with it set to notify as well.

However, while every time it's pressed the doorbell itself will make the ring noise, I've found that rarely do all devices/places get announcements. Most often, both echo devices will announce the doorbell press, and they do it almost instantly, although for the first time, yesterday they both stopped, and I had to disable and re-enable blink on them.

As for getting notifications on the two phones, it's a complete crap shoot, sometimes both of us get notifications, sometimes only one of us, sometimes neither and as for when we get those notifications, again it can range from within a second or two after the Echo devices up to 10 mins after it was pressed.

The doorbell is powered with batteries, as there's nowhere near the door to take a power feed from.

I've checked all the settings I can find as far as trying to make sure the phones wifi/bluetooth etc… aren't in a ""low power"" mode, and I've made sure the Blink app is set to never be put to sleep or suspended on both phones and yet it's still next to useless for actually letting us know someone is at the door.

I really like the idea of having a video doorbell, more so for security rather than talking to delivery drivers etc... (we all know these days most of them just ring the bell, leave the parcel and run due to their strict schedules) but I'm honestly considering going back to a bog-standard doorbell."	18	"[""chillboy72: I'm same... notifications on mini cameras, echo dots and echo show all great.

I received a notification four days ago from Amazon to say the batteries need replacing. I thought it was odd, but I went out and purchased more batteries, Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA. I received another email from Amazon last night to say the batteries would need replacing again! Checked the app and they were at 20%. 15:16 the battery percentage was at 100%, and by 18:36 they were on 20%. 

The doorbell is linked to two Echo Dots, and the app is installed on two phones. Doorbell goes off around 1-3 times per day. Motion is often detected between 7-8am, 3-4pm, 5-6pm when leaving for work etc, and then a few times during the night. Camera is in view of the drive way, motion goes off if car leaves and enters the driveway, and obviously if somebody walks past the camera, to enter/leave the house. 

Current settings:

MOTION DETECTION:
Enable Motion Detection - ON
Activity Zones - (bottom 3 squares from left, second to bottom 3 squares from left, 2nd and 3rd squares in middle)
Retrigger Time - 10 seconds 
Sensitivity - 5 
Clip Length - 20 seconds
End Clip Early If Motion Stops - ON

NIGHT VISION:
Control - Auto
IR Intensity - Low

AUDIO:
Enable Audio - ON
Speaker Volume - FULL
Ringer Volume - HALF

VIDEO:
Enable Video Recording - ON
Quality - Best

PHOTO CAPTURE - 
Enable - OFF 


Doorbell is obviously not wired up, no Sync Module, and it’s also obviously armed. 

How can I stop the batteries being eaten so quickly?!"	3	['Scooter310: Consider purchasing a sync module for it. The sync module helps it to get a better connection and also extends the battery life GREATLY according to blink. I remember reading that blink said it can be used without a sync module but if you want the up to 2 years battery life a sync module may be needed. The doorbell was originally intended as an add on for people that already had blink systems. Also it seems that you leave it armed 24 hours a day and that will greatly reduce the battery life without a sync module controlling its energy output.', 'killthecord: You need a sync module.', 'Diademinsomniac: Sound like you have a faulty device.  I had a similar issue with 1 blink camera draining battery every 2 weeks.  I contacted blink support and they did some remote checks after enabling the option to allow them access.

I just recently purchased the bink doorbell camera, it was only like $30 on sale at Target so it was more of an impulse buy than anything, Needless to say, I did no research before purchase, and like many others, I am finding out after set up that without the sync module (sold separately) there is no option to view a live feed unless motion is detected or the doorbell is pressed. After looking around online I did see that many have been successful in linking their blink doorbell cam to their echo dot for notifications (no live view obviously because no screen), I set that up and it works perfectly. Alexa notifies me when motion is detected or if someone presses the doorbell. After more research, I found that by linking your blink doorbell cam to your fire stick you can access live view any time through voice commands by simply saying ""Alexa, show me the name of the camera"". I have my blink cam and fire stick both linked together in the Alexa app and notifications are on and the blink home monitoring skill is enabled, however...when I use voice commands for Alexa to show me my cam, the reply I get is either ""camera doesn't support that"" or ""camera not responding"". I have uninstalled and updated the blink app & Alexa app. All my devices are up to date, I have unplugged and restarted, disabled, and enabled the skill and notifications. Nothing seems to fix this issue, I know that fire stick supports live view for blink doorbell, so if anyone has any tips or suggestions I would greatly appreciate it! I have been working on this for hours now. I will also add that I also have Wyze cameras in my home, linked to Alexa and the voice commands work fine through my firestick and I can see the feed for my Wyze cameras just not blink. So that leads me to believe it is not an issue with my tv, wifi, or firestick. Maybe it's a glitch with my blink cam? Also adding that I get all normal notifications just fine on my phone, iPad, and echo dot for doorbell cam, and I have it installed wirelessly with no sync module, but I do have a blink plus subscription plan."	0	[]

Sync Module 2 with a Blink Doorbell and 7 outdoor cameras.


I immediately cancelled the trial subscription after adding each new camera because I just wanted to use local storage from the beginning.


When it works, it’s great for my needs.  I did the research before, also had a friend who had them for a while, so I knew what I was getting.


Unfortunately, I’ve had a few issues here and there.  And I worry that I can’t really rely on them.  Sometimes they show online in the app and I can take screenshots and change settings but they are not actually recording or detecting motion (as per the recent firmware update disaster).  Also occasionally they only record a few seconds even though there is still motion.


I have a good router and a mesh network, so I don’t think my network is the issue.  So the thing I don’t like is sometimes the system may not be working, or everything working properly, but I don’t know it at first.  Though overall they have worked well most of the time.


Anyway, I’m wondering if the subscription is worth it.


Some Concerns I have If getting the subscription:

- Will my system stop working if I start the subscription and I have to redo things or reset sync module, etc.?  Or should it be a smooth transition?


- I like to be able to remove the flash drive any time I want and backup videos on my computer and view them on their.  With a subscription I know it’s only once a day, and if that stops working I won’t know until the next time I remove the flash drive.  And I assume there is no way to force a backup to the drive??


- I worry if I some point I decide to cancel the subscription then everything will stop working and I’ll have to delete everything and start over.  As I’ve heard a lot of people have issues when the trial ended.


- Also I’m concerned I may still have intermittent issues as I’ve been having, and now I’d also be paying a yearly fee.


But having the subscription seems like it would be better with the extra features it ads.


Wondering what your thoughts are.  Thanks."	31	"['magicanthony: Appreciate all the comments so far.

Cancelled trial subscription,  motion  detection working on both cameras and notifications being received. USB stick recognized, Sync2 shows the cameras available for local storage.

Blazah	4	zexh13	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/zexh13/amazon_cloudcam_refugees_wyze_is_the_way/	"Have spent a few weeks getting to know the wyze system. The web interface is not as smooth as amazon's, but right now there's an excellent deal on these cameras, at about 18 bucks a camera AND if you have a spare ipad or tablet laying around the viewing on tablets is 100% awesome. 

https://www.homedepot.com/p/WYZE-Cam-v3-Wired-Home-Security-Camera-with-3-Months-Cam-Plus-Included-2-Pack-WYZEC3CP3X2/322233890?irgwc=1&cm_mmc=afl-ir-10451-483420-&clickid=R-syisyEgxyNT7XxQ9RPpy8JUkAxBe1FuzCe040

Pick up a two pack and get to know the system.

They deliver better quality, ""smart""/better alerts and identification than cloud cams.. 

You can SORT the clips by which camera and which kind of alert, person, pet, box, car, etc. which amazon never did... and they are much cheaper. 

After that you need to look into setting up rules, the system lets you get much more in depth than amazon.. can stop motion alerts when you are home, but still have it recording the entire time (with a micro sd card in it) if you want.. etc etc.

Overall I'm happy that I was forced to look around. Still a little pissed about a 350 dollar investment being worth nothing thanks to amazon's choices.. but these cameras are far more advanced than the cloud cam ever was, with a higher resolution and better experience to start.

Edit: I also encourage all of you to write to jeff@amazon.com to voice your dissatisfaction."	6	"['Furrealyo: Coming from CloudCam, we’ve all realized Blink is trash by now I think. \n\nMy primary beef with Wyze is the lack of native geofencing.

I have a Doorbell and a battery powered camera and both connect to the Sync 2.

But my Blink Mini cameras won't connect to it.  They don't have a signal strength meter for the Sync, and also don't have the option to record an image every hour.

I configured them all in the same room as the Sync so it's not a connectivity issue.

I had questions that I couldn’t get answers to…

(1) I plugged the USB drive in to the sync module and my app notified me that a USB drive was plugged in. The day continued and the app continued to notify me and save videos whenever it detected movement, but it didn’t save in to the USB drive, was it because I have the free trial?

(2) When my 30-day free trial ends, and if I have no subscription, how will the videos save? Will I be able to record live streaming regardless of motion detection for as long as I wish? Will these videos automatically save on to the USB flash drive? To view these videos, will I have to plug the USB in to the computer, or will I be able to view them through the app? 

(3) Does the subscription just allow us to save the clips on their cloud server that can be substituted by the USB flash drive? Because if yes, then why would someone pay a monthly fee when they could just get a USB flash drive?

(4) If I don’t have a subscription, will I still be notified about motion detection and will those clips save automatically on the USB? 

Sorry for the stupid questions, I really appreciate your help friends!

I have my blink cam with solar mounted on a tree next to my driveway approximately 35 feet from my house. It wont detect a person going to my front door from the right side of my property.

I've wanted this for a while and seen others mention it, but the only thing I was aware of until now was the 4-hour thing or to turn off using iOS settings and get nothing including from the doorbell.

But Blink has something buried in an incredibly stupid place.

Settings -> Device and System Settings -> Pick any system -> Sync Module -> Help/Troubleshooting -> Notification Settings.

From here you can separately enable/disable a bunch: 
### Events
- Doorbell Press
- Motion Clip
- Scheduled Arm/Disarm
- Camera temperature

### Alerts
- Low Battery
- High Camera Usage
- Camera Offline
- System Offline.

Despite being buried under a particular system, this setting is global and affects all systems, which is why this is an incredibly stupid place to put these controls. Also it has nothing to do with troubleshooting.

I'd still love to do this per-camera indefinitely, or even per-system, but turning it off across the board is better than nothing

I’ve got an XT2 for him, but we don’t have a great place to mount it and he’s oddly worried about positioning on it so we haven’t quite sorted that out.\n\nThis was all with a subscription, which ended without fanfare, the only thing they initially noticed was the thumbnails are gone, but otherwise it was as intermittent as ever at catching motion. Until Sunday. Now he gets zero recordings at all to his USB stick. Did the usual reboots, pull and reinsert the drive (it is recognized and we can see the percentage used by existing videos so it definitely does read). Swapped the drive too, just in case.\n\nThere does seem to be an issue with USB stick storage right now, but it sure isn’t helping.\n\nMy hope is to disable motion detection on the doorbell completely, get him to use it as a doorbell and on-demand camera (the original intent), and the XT2 with permanent cloud storage in a better position.', ""BostonBeemah: Did you try reformatting the drive in exFat? Mine wasn't working as I had data on it before and it was ntfs and once formated started working.\n\nAlso sounds like its a software bug on the camera and not a physical issue like you eluded to with the motion detection. Guessing you already checked for a firmware update but what about a complete reset and set back up as new?"", ""thedaveCA: Ignoring the motion detection issue everything was working fine, which *mostly* rules out formatting issues and configuration. Admittedly a USB drive could fail. He's swapped it out but I'm not sure about how the replacement was formatted. I formatted the original exFAT identically to mine (starting with `diskpart` `clean` to clean up any weird partitioning).\n\nThe sync hub can still read existing videos so the USB stick isn't completely dead, but it could be dying.\n\nIf I go over I'll take another USB drive which is freshly partitioned and formatted exFAT. \n\nI know he's been working on not getting video recorded for the last few days so I'm sure he's re-inserted and rebooted. I don't know if he's removed the sync module and re-added it.\n\nI doubt he's removed the doorbell to scan the code, so I suspect the doorbell hasn't been removed and re-added from the system. \n\nNeither of us thought to copy the code, and I have no intention of removing it while it's below -20 outside. I could take over a Blink Mini, or his old doorbell (replaced under warranty due to motion issues, but the new one performs identically, so I think it's okay). I could take both. \n\nEither way, I suspect he's reasonably close to just being done and ripping it out, which is a shame as the doorbell part (ringing, seeing who is there, interacting with them) works, and that was the thing he wanted in the first place."", ""BostonBeemah: Dang well sounds like you've gone through everything I can think of especially cleaning the drive and partitions in disk part.

The definition of my love/hate relationship with tech"", ""thedaveCA: > The definition of my love/hate relationship with tech\n\nSo true! \n\nI hit the partition thing myself on the initial flash drive I used. Just grabbed one from my bin and formatted, Blink recognized the drive and said it would format it. It didn't. \n\nI'm sure it was something I did in the past and never cleaned it up properly.\n\nI'm thinking if I can attach another doorbell or mini, and they don't work either, there's no point in going outside. If they do work, maybe it is worth the effort.\n\nI still think Blink did something though, there's a bit of a surge of these reports this week. But also this explanation means I can be lazy for a bit more :)"", 'BostonBeemah: Haha I always like blaming the company. Give another new camera to try and see if that works. If not, burn it all down brother!', 'thedaveCA: He just contacted them to inquire, they blamed his network and various other things first and then shipped new gear. They claimed they’d want the old stuff back and would send a shipping label, that was in the summer and they still haven’t, so I’ve added it to my pile of test electronics.\n\nI am tracking what unit is what, and I’ll ship it to Blink upon request.']"

**What happened**

I purchased 2 mini-cameras and a Sync Module 2 so I don't need a subscription. The products came with a 30-day free subscription, which actually makes setting up the local storage more challenging. Long-story short, no matter how many times I reset my devices, ejected and replugged my USB drive, I continued to get the dreaded ""this USB storage device has no clips"" error.

**With a free trial**

The first thing to understand is that with an active subscription the local storage doesn't act as an immediate storage. Instead, the app performs a once-per-day backup to your USB. The annoying thing is that anytime you setup a camera, even if you've already disabled the free trial, it automatically reactivates.

**System**

Multiple devices such as a camera and sync module need to be associated in a ""System."" As far as I know, you can only create a system during the sync module setup process.

**Steps**

1. Create a ""System"" in the blink app while setting up your sync module.
2. Setup your camera(s), including them in the same system.
3. Disable your free trial.
4. Ensure your system and cameras are ""armed"" and set to activate with motion.
   1. At this point, my shit didn't work and threw the ""this USB storage device has no clips"" error, even though I've now determined everything what setup correctly. If you're getting this error, continue to step 5.
5. Repeat these steps a minimum of 3 times before proceeding to step 6 (if it still doesn't work):
   1. Reboot the Sync Module: unplug and plug-in the power cable.
   2. Safely eject the USB storage drive, and insert it again into the Sync Module 2.
   3. Delete the sync Module 2 from your system, and add it again.
6. If you're still having issues, type [192.168.0.1](https://192.168.0.1) into your browser, access your network settings and make sure Access Point (AP) Isolation is **not** enabled.

**How to know if it's working**

This is another area I've seen lots of misinformation about. Once setup correctly, you will see clips of motion activated video in the app, saved there only a few moments after the activity has occurred. The sync is immediate, not daily like it is for the subscription backup. I've seen people stating that it's daily or that it doesn't save them at all to the app and you have to plug your USB drive into your computer. This is nonsense.

Hope this helps. I had to complete step 5 above at least twice before mine randomly started working. I'm guessing there's some kind of race condition in their setup that needs to be addressed but Blink doesn't care to fix it since they want to drive people to their subscriptions anyways."	2	"['Murky-Sector: Excellent write up', 'Dilbert_55: I recently purchased two doorbell camera\'s, couple outdoor camera\'s, spotlight w/camera and two indoor cameras.

Seems a little odd to not have that feature given Blink is making cameras meant to be used inside the home. I understand why you would want a security camera facing outward to be watching 24/7 but when I’m home from work I don’t exactly want a live camera watching ME.

I certainly wouldn’t want one in any bedrooms if it can’t be disabled via the app.

Just a few questions about these cameras

I bought a pack of 3 with the sync module included from best buy recently on a deal.

They are in my apartment close to the wifi router and run on batteries. 

2 of them work perfect but 1 of them I've always had trouble connecting to live view where it would fail and I would have to retry several times. That rarely happens anymore how.

However, today for a period of 30 mins I could not live view anything. I also do not see any recordings for those 30 mins.

My cat is in the apartment wandering around and I have it set to high sensitivity to pick him up and anything else going on.

I also have one watching my parking lot where I park my car so movement there is also recorded.

However during this 30 min period today, somebody came by the parking lot and I saw them pull in but after that I was unable to see anything.

My question is, if the wifi drops, do the units still record locally and transfer to the module for safe keeping ? I'm using the free subscription at the moment with no usb memory.

Or if somebody used say a wifi jammer or signal jammer would that be the reason why there's no recording ? 

The system came back after 30 mins and I could live view everything again and recordings came back also for after this timeframe which was just after the person left the propert so it just seems way too suspicious right now. 

I get now that blink may not be the best option but it was affordable at the time.

I appreciate any advice and information

I bought a Blink Outdoor with a Synch Module...since day one it produces pinky video and photos. I tried:

&#x200B;

1. Factory reset pressing the reset button for more than 30 secs
2. Remove batteries for a couple of minutes
3. Deleting the cam from the app and sync again with the module
4. Disable and enable night vision

The camera is brand new but I can't fix pink images and videos. I know it could be the IR Cut filter: night images and videos are perfect.

Could it be a faulty unit?"	2	"[""enchantedspring: IR cut filter is jammed.\n\nIt's taken a fall in transit or at some other point in its life.\n\nReturn it as faulty for replacement OR strike it hard on the right hand side (looking as the cmera faces away from you) to see if it can be dislodged."", ""spulci: Yess!!!

3 indoor minis 
1 sync module 2

Setup into two groups/systems which i labeled inside and outside

Before the trial was started, all 5 cameras were connected to the sync module and recorded motion to local usb.

After the trail started and subsequently ended, now the ""inside"" system/the 3 mini cameras won't reconnect with the sync module. They only show connected to wifi, but not a SM.

If I go to manage subscriptions under settings, there is nothing there. As a test I completely deleted the sync module from the account. As expected the ""outside"" system and the 2 cameras stopped working saying ""no sync module "". 

One thing I noticed, when I go to clips it still shows the ""cloud"" tab at the top as well as the icon for local storage.

But the inside cameras had no such fault. So with no active subscription, they won't connect to module either. 

I've tried...
deleting a mini and  adding it again. 
Deleting sync module and adding it again 
Power cycle one of the minis

The blink mini camera, which is the furthest away from my Wifi responds in a few seconds. It's pretty good.

I have my own router and 3 mesh nodes so I have good coverage throughout the house and around the outside of the house.


I have a Blink doorbell camera and 7 outdoor cameras.  I use local storage.  I’ve never had a subscription.  When I first added the cameras I immediately cancelled the trial subscription right away each time.


I’ve had some issues here and there but usually solved it by replacing batteries or rebooting the sync module.  But mostly they have been working well.  They have been installed for a little over 3 months.  And I’ve already replaced batteries for some of them (I used the recommended Energizer Lithium Ultimate batteries).


Today, the cameras stopped sending motion notifications and stopped recording.  The doorbell camera still notifies motion (that is the only one) but it doesn’t record either.


I tried disarming the system, ejecting the flash drive and removing it, unplugging the sync module for a minute, plugging in the flash drive and plugging the sync module back in, rebooting my phone and re-arming.


I also tried turning motion recording off and back on for each camera.


I also tried a different, newly formatted flash drive but it made no difference.  


I can refresh the thumbnail view on each camera and change settings.  I can update the signal strengths and they all look good.


All cameras will show the blue light as I pass them as if they are detecting motion and recording, but starting this afternoon I suddenly get no notification (except for doorbell) and none of them record.


Any ideas?  I have heard people talk about resetting the sync module.  But am I correct in assuming that if I do a reset it will erase all cameras and I will have to add them all again, name them, change the settings, etc.?  That’s a bit of a process I really want to avoid.

1669253094.0	23-Nov-2022 17:24:54	Why didnt the batteries last as long as 2 years	parmesan11	2	z36jw9	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/z36jw9/why_didnt_the_batteries_last_as_long_as_2_years/	I bought my Blink Outdoor camera in around April, and I used the lithium batteries that shipped with it for around 6 months until now. In the blink app it says REPLACE next to battery and it indicates a low battery icon. The coldest the camera has ever gotten was probably just under 0°C, but blink says the outdoor cameras can operate as low as -20°C. Usage on the camera is relatively low with only a few seconds of video a day. So how come they only lasted 6 months? Lithium batteries are expensive and I worry they won't last as long, is there any alternatives to lithium batteries?	4	"[""enchantedspring: Only the wired options - any other battery will last a lesser amount. The Blink chips were designed to work with the Energiser Ultimate Lithium cells so other batteries struggle to work with the battery status indication too.\n\nCheck yours wasn't an Amazon return - Amazon returns that are resold are shipped with non-original or used batteries.\n\nSometimes one battery in a pair is faulty and drags the others down.\n\nOthertimes the WiFi signal is just on the cusp of being too weak so the batteries get eaten up more quickly.\n\nHigh usage and lots of IR also causes quicker drain."", ""tanzd: I have 20 cameras, some last less than 6 months on a set of Energizer Lithium, while others last over a year, and everything in between.\n\nIt all depends on frequency of recording, clip length, video quality, use and intensity of the infrared illuminator light, and also the strength of WiFi signal with the base station and your router.\n\nIf you adjust those settings, you might squeeze out more life from the batteries.\n\nSince early this year I have started using rechargeable Lithium AA batteries.
