SewerGoblin_69	1	138veap	Ring	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/138veap	I recently moved into an interesting apartment. I located the chime box according to the instructions and to my surprise it's a plug-in into an outlet near the ceiling. Am I able to install my doorbell normally and just plug in a ring chime to the outlet? Or would I have to do more rigorous testing to ensure the power supply is correct. I will buy the tools if I have to but if I can do it without the extra complications it would be stellar. Thanks again for reading	0	[]

Brainstorming most simple way to give pet sitter access while on vacation without the overhead of dealing with ring shared access.

That is to say that if the network link is not good enough to stream a video event or a snapshot as it is happening, then it never makes it to the Ring Cloud and is thus never saved.\n\nI have had cameras ""fail"" in a few says. One way is they register that they attempted to record and send a video but there is no successful upload.  These show up on my timeline as an event that has no video, but the event exists.  It can also completely fail and there are just missing videos that the camera attempted to record and send (because you can see it\'s blue light and was otherwise functional), there just was not enough network bandwidth or no network available to send it.  I have also got corrupted video clips sent where when you download or play them, they are simply broken and bad videos, but the cloud doesn\'t know any better and tries to let you watch them.\n\nAs for the timelapse snapshots... Those are probably ""compiled"" on the device over long durations.  That is, it takes a still frame avery 30seconds, or 120 seconds, or 300 seconds or whatever your setting is.  And it slowly appends those still frames into the snapshot video.  If a motion event occurs, then it probably flushes out the snapshot and starts recording and sending the motion event video.\n\nSo, for the OP description.  It could have been taking still frames periodically, and when they add up to perhaps 4 hours worth, it send them.  So it could have happened to have recorded up to 4ish hours of still frames with no network, so long as the network was working at the end when it sent to send it all up, then you would get the snapshot of still frames from before the network resumed working.\n\nThe new ring alarm base stations however DO now include an option to store video events locally.  In that case we simply redefine what ""the cloud"" means and instead of an AWS bucket on the internet somewhere that Ring pays for, the Cloud becomes your ring base station and the micro SD Card that you installed.  So long as your local network remains functional, then that cloud should continue to record video events and snapshots... But you probably can not access them without the base station being connected to the internet.  I have one base station that can do this, but I did not enable that feature, so I have no first hand information. What I described is just the impression I got from reading about that feature.']"

As the package was delivered and the driver was walking off the porch, he cuts through our lawn and starts peering into our car and later reaches for the handle. My dads wife then sees this and yells at him to leave which he does. Keep in mind the camera was not recording this whole time. Right after the driver leaves the camera was working just fine and detecting even a small amount of motion. I‚Äôve heard theories that the delivery drivers are using wifi jammers which seems plausible in this case and he hasn‚Äôt been able to find any other videos from his ring of packages being delivered even though we regularly order from Amazon and other sites. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true or not that they‚Äôre using these wifi jammers and our ring is battery powered so it could just be having issues but it seems odd that it would be working fine for the rest of the day until the delivery driver comes and starts looking in our car.

I‚Äôm trying to get some more security and surveillance around the home and I am looking at ring simply because even with subscriptions and such it seems to be one of the more simple to setup and use. 

Looking to start with a doorbell camera at first and then a security system in a few months. What doorbell would be the recommended product to start with?

The $99 battery ring cam seems like a nice deal, but I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a bad value because of little features. 

Here‚Äôs some useful info:

-	Must be battery due to no existing doorbell wiring. 
-	Property is a 2bed apt in a duplex in high traffic area. 
-	Would need some door and window sensors.

About four months ago,  we got a Ring indoor camera (set on a kitchen counter) that is linked with our three doorbell cameras.  Hubby and I were  out of town for a couple of days. While reviewing footage of activities outside of our house, we saw that at 1:33 am the indoor cam recorded about 10 seconds of ""person detected."" There was nothing on the recording except our dark kitchen. 

Nobody else lives with us and we don't have pets. Have no reason to think a mouse or a bird or bat got in the house. We have a boiler and our heat wasn't on. We don't have central air. We have never had this notification before. 

Is there a simple explanation like it is just buggy or our settings need to be adjusted or might we have a ghost? (just kidding but I think I'd rather have a ghost than an animal. LOL) 

ETA: Forgot that our front doorbell camera logged a linked event at the same time our indoor kitchen camera notified of a person detected. Nothing was shown on either recording. Thank you!"	3	"[""memorex1150: These products are not infallible.  They can and do make mistakes, but a better explanation is that the camera's detection software picked up something that it's programmed to do.  Or what the sensor defects which could be multiple things.\n\nIt is interesting that both cameras recorded at the same time which makes me believe you have enabled a setting to roll all devices at the same time if one device starts to roll.\n\nI wouldn't put much stock into it; listen to the audio recording at the time you had a motion issue internally.  This is best to figure out if there truly is someone inside or if it's just a fluke.  And, again, flukes do occur.\n\nIf you are able, I'd buy a motion detector for the same room as the camera.  That way you have redundancy.  I did this in my house after I moved and still owned it.

Whenever you click on videos in the History tab of the Ring Web app (the one that runs in browser), it just spins forever. The Dashboard and other tabs of the Web app still operate as normal. The problem seems to have started around early March 2023, and the speculation is Ring must have pushed some sort of change to their website code at that time.

For many of us, the website is the only way we can monitor our Ring system during certain times of the day. It is the only way to interact with Ring from a desktop computer, especially after they [discontinued the desktop app](https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059615351-Ring-Desktop-App-will-be-Discontinued-in-2023) earlier this year.

This issue is being tracked on [Ring's Community forum](https://community.ring.com/t/event-history-not-loading-videos-on-the-website-but-working-on-my-phone-tablet-etc/187796), but after many denials by their team, there is still no progress and no feedback. There was speculation that certain work VPNs were interfering, but that's been disproven by several counterexamples. They've also marked the issue as ""solved"", when clearly it is not. I'm hoping the more noise we make about it, the more resources will be devoted to a fix.

Has anyone else here experienced the issue?"	7	"['rumbly_tumbly_: I contacted tech support earlier this week and was told ""our team is aware of the issue, in the meantime you can use the app to view event footage"". Unhelpful, I know, but at least it\'s something that\'s happening to multiple customers. Maybe they\'ll actually try to fix it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I saw the comments from u/Wayne8766 that mentioned vpns and ad blockers. I use the Ad Block for Youtube extension and realized it had access to all sites. I changed its permissions to just Youtube and the event histories are loading for me now.

Disabling Ad Block didn't work for me and many others in that thread, though.\n\nIt still points to a change on Ring's side of the house, which they have denied repeatedly in the same thread."", ""spltscreen: Ah, sorry if it's a repost. I did search and didn't find anything that matched. Is the website History tab working for you?\n\nThere are enough responses in the linked Community thread that seem to indicate this problem was not solved by disabling VPN or other browser add-ons.\n\nA [post](https://community.ring.com/t/event-history-not-loading-videos-on-the-website-but-working-on-my-phone-tablet-etc/187796/42) in that thread theorized that a simple change in ports on Ring's side could explain the problem. I'm not a network engineer, but this explanation seems plausible:\n\n>... I can see now that any attempt at loading a history video results in an immediate climb of the ‚ÄúDENY‚Äù counts for my firewall. Looks like someone changed the ports used by the web playback widget and forgot to update the firewall ports document."", ""rumbly_tumbly_: it worked temporarily, and now the videos are only loading sporadically.

I can access the video via chrome, Firefox, edge all fine. I use Brave as my default browser and have never had any issues at all.\n\nThe VPN thing is tricky, a lot of people just use it as a matter of fact but you cannot really dismiss it on either count. I know the last person who posted fixed it as it was a work VPN, different ones will do different things depending on how they are configured.']"

RadicalArcadians	2	12ym2dg	Ring	https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/12ym2dg/ring_doorbell_pro_2_not_sure_whether_to_existing/	"I am trying to install my new Ring Doorbell Pro 2 and hope someone can help with working out the electrics.

I have an existing wired doorbell which has a chime box and a transformer inside. The transformer has the printed on it:

    PRIM: 230v ~ 50Hz 
    SEK: 8v ~ 0.6A 

I am presuming the PRIM is the power to that transformer (the input) and the SEK is the stepped-down power which is put out (the output). Please correct me if I am wrong.

This [page](https://support.ring.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360044443152-Hardwiring-your-Ring-Video-Doorbell) says the Ring Doorbell Pro 2 requires **16 to 24 VAC, 50/60Hz, 10VA to 40VA.**

So, although I'm fairly certain I'm correct, I want to sense-check that the existing transformer, where the 'SEK' (or output) is 8v \~ 0.6A would not be sufficient to power the Pro 2 doorbell?

The final part then is the Ring transformer supplied. The input power is 100-240V \~ 50-60Hz, which matches AC supply going to the chime and existing transformer box in my house. The output on the Ring transformer is 24V-0.42VA, which does seem inconsistent with the 10VA to 40VA Ring says the Pro 2 doorbell requires, but it must be correct?

Big thanks to anyone who can help with this!"	1	"[""arteitle: You're correct that PRIM is the primary, or input, winding of the transformer, and SEK is the secondary, or output, winding. 8 V \\* 0.6 A = 4.8 VA, so both the voltage output and maximum power capacity of your existing transformer are too low for your doorbell.\n\nCould the Ring-supplied transformer specify 0.42 A instead of 0.42 VA? 24 V \\* 0.42 A = 10 VA which would make more sense.""]"

Long story short. Me and my girlfriend (both 19) don‚Äôt really get to see each other or do things as much as we want to because of our schedules with school, her working a lot, as well as my strict, overprotective, Caribbean mom not letting me really have the freedom she has at the moment. (go and come with friends or whatever). And on Tuesdays nobody is home for the whole day and typically me and my girl see this as a chance to hang out and just be with each other. But my sister (25 and who kinda is overprotective of me too) has Amazon ring system and Amazon ring motion sensors around the house. Not because they don‚Äôt trust me. They are just very safe minded people. 

So I‚Äôve done research before and I know that when you turn the Wi-Fi off, the Amazon ring doorbell or motion sensors don‚Äôt send notifications to your phone. Which I‚Äôve tried before. But as soon as I turn the Wi-Fi back on, my sister gets notifications on her phone. She doesn‚Äôt get the video from the doorbell or anything but when she gets the notifications and looks at them she figures that I had my girl over. 

I just wanna know ways where I can just make sure notifications don‚Äôt pop up at all because from what I‚Äôve read nothing gets sent when I turn the Wi-Fi off but that‚Äôs not the case. I also know that it tells you on the app when the wifi gets turned off so Ik she‚Äôd be suspicious if she sees it off all day and that‚Äôs kind of a gamble.

All of a sudden it stopped recording. I called Ring and they confirmed that the video processor was broken so they would send me a replacement camera...great! A few days later the replacement arrived, but straight off the bat I noticed the battery hatch hinge was different and there was no protective film on the camera. After a bit of research I found out it was an older model that was most likely refurbished. I called back the same day and asked for the same camera I paid for. I was told I would get it in 5 days.....this was almost 20 days ago. I've been calling every week since and I get the same response ""oh we don't see the order in our system, I'll put a new one in, you'll get it in 5 days"".

I am looking at getting the Ring Intercom that plugs into an existing analogue audio only intercom phone. 

Does anyone know if there is a max cable length? 

I understand the cable that comes in the box is rather short - perhaps just 25cm? - and I would like to hide the Ring Intercom in a box or cupboard rather than have it visible.  


Also, I already have a 5m+ extension cable connected to a secondary analogue intercom audio buzzer (installed by a technician). Could I add the Ring Intercom to this path?

as the **ring intercom** was presented in my country I looked everywhere online to find the official pinout and the only thing I found was [a community thread with a partial pinout with a cable unconfirmed](https://community.ring.com/t/ring-intercom-neon-access-and-guidance-on-what-each-wire-does/165329).

It turns out that the official pinout can be accessed from the ring app by choosing a ""*Generic*"" brand and a ""*6+n*"" type of intercom **during setup**. 

It will then and *only then* [show what each cable does](https://i.imgur.com/71zOBKZ.png).

The PINOUT is then as follows:

* A1 -> COMMON 
* A2 -> SPEAKER
* A3 -> MIC
* A4 -> AUDIO COMMON
* A5 -> UNLOCK
* A6 -> CALL 

What I reverse engineered:

* A1 -> COMMON: 0v (AC) from the PSU. In some system this is also the audio common, not in mine.
* A2 -> SPEAKER
* A3 -> MIC
* A4 -> AUDIO COMMON: in some intercoms this is not the main common but a normal ground. This is to avoid hearing the unlock buzzer in the intercom during unlock.
* A5 -> UNLOCK: this will be shorted with A1 for a second or so in order to unlock the electric lock in the door
* A6 -> CALL: this cable is sensing some voltage (with A1) from the PSU. 10-24 volts AC are what I've seen, but the range might be even greater. It's what activate the ring itself, send you a ""someone is at the door"" notification and actually make your normal buzzer ring.

This camera seems to eat power faster than the battery gets trickle charged, so I need to replace the battery with a charger spare about every two weeks.

I‚Äôve had a ring doorbell for about a year and it‚Äôs been great. I wanted to add a camera above our garage, so I got the ring stick up cam to stick with the same brand and app for ease of use/access. Two cons that I was not aware of: I have to pay an additional subscription service fee even though I‚Äôm already paying for the doorbell.

Unfortunately, the living room sensor keeps tripping the alarm while we are away. I  originally set it up in the app as window but it kept immediately tripping the alarm when in away mode without allowing the exist delay. So I switched it to a window and that problem was solved.

However, pretty much daily, I will get an alert that motion was detected and the alarm delay starts. Today, I had to remove it completely. I‚Äôm wondering if this is likely a faulty 10 year old monitor and essentially trash or could there be and issue with my wiring?

I can tell that the detector works correctly to detect motion based on the red light indicator. Also, for clarification‚Ä¶ there are no pets in the house and mo vents near the detector. It sits on a wall between the kitchen and living room and faces a hallway to the front door. I highly doubt it is over sensitive and that there is some little motion tripping it.

I have seen this asked elsewhere but never answered in the affirmative and I cannot believe a solution does not exist!  My Ring Mailbox sensor signal to the bridge is usually only ""fair"".  We have tried moving the bridge around, but then I lose connection to the other sensor on the bridge.  There is some metal equipment between the bridge and the sensor, so I think if I could get the antenna higher up, the signal might have a better chance of clearing any obstruction to the bridge.

So, I was hoping someone somewhere makes an extension cable for whatever this connector is, so I could simply make the line longer and rais up the little ring hexagon to make a clearer shot to the bridge.  Does anyone know the specifications of this cable (or maybe of the whole antenna) so I could extend it somehow?  Thanks so much!

Contrabeast	2	12kxhcv	Ring	https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/12kxhcv/extra_wide_door_mounts_to_look_past_storm_doors/	"I live in a townhouse and cannot drill into the building, and we don't have doorbells, so I have to use a door mount. 



I have a storm door in front of my regular door, and all of the mounts on Amazon are too short, which would leave me a view of the storm door and maybe a little bit off on the side. 



Are there any extra long mounts, like 6"" or more, that allow a door mount to work with a storm door in front? Or am I just screwed and need to send it all back?"	0	[]

Looking to add a Ring Spotlight Cam (probably Plus) to the house to cover the side of the house. We live in an area of townhouses and one of the neighbors got their wall (which I want to cover) graffiti'ed this winter, I hope this can add an optimistic layer of dissuasion and if someone decides to have a go at our wall, we can find said artist. Below are pics of the wall in question along where I think I will mount the cam.

I'm thinking about going solar for this one as electrical wiring is not easy where I can install it. A few more considerations and questions:

* How many hours of sunlight does the cam need to be charged, really? According to Ring a few hours is sufficient (2-3 I guess) what is your experience?
* We live in Montreal Canada so yes winter is to be considered in this setup, any good ""covers"" for the cam itself wit a lid (like a baseball hat) to prevent snow from going into the lens? Any suggestions?
* For mounting, the gutter mounts will not be usable I guess due to the distance between gutter in the pictures and the side we wish to monitor. Any suggestions? Am not the handiest person but like any good homeowner I have tools and willing to give it a go.
* The floodlights are controlled by a Lutron Caseta dimmer in the house so I doubt I can use that wiring to power the camera. Am no electrician either ;) 

Any other input welcomed, odds are I forgot to think of something.

Thanks!

Almost immediately after plugging the panel in, I started having problems. In addition to weak Wifi warnings and periodic disconnects, I would get nearly no usable recordings, instead seeing the message: ‚ÄúThis event did not record correctly. You may need to adjust the settings on your wifi router.‚Äù If I unplugged the solar panel, the camera would operate normally, and if I plugged the panel in while on live view, the image would freeze and disconnect. Thinking it was a problem with my wifi mesh network (google wifi), I rebooted the network, rebooted the modem, and rebooted the camera, but the problem persisted. I then bought a couple of more powerful Nest wifi routers, and was able to get the cam‚Äôs RSSI to a respectable -40, but I would still get large periods of the day where the video wouldn‚Äôt record. The only thing that seemed to fix the problem is unplugging the solar panel.

I have found that these camera seem to have better audio conversation quality, and it's handy that they have a battery so they can keep running for a few hours (in the ""wired"" higher power use mode) of runtime.

I just noticed today for the first time that all four of them have a plug in circle-and-cross error in the bottom right preview corner that says: ""CameraName stopped receiving power.  To keep it online and avoid draining its battery, reconnect power soon.""

But when I check their ""Device Health"" those all say that battery level is still 100% (after enough time that they should have drained some), and ""Solar Status"" (Also for any plugged power source) says: ""Connected"" which indicates that it is in fact plugged in.

This is the same across two separate external power sources for this set of cameras, which are all of my battery cameras, all of which run in plugged in mode.

I‚Äôve done this 5-6 times with no improvement. 

Other smart home devices seem uneffected. Everything that usually connects to wifi seems to be operating normally. It‚Äôs just these two systems that use a bridge.

LazyJoeJr	23	12guqvw	Ring	https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/12guqvw/ring_alarm_system_what_do_you_think/	With Google announcing end of life for the Nest Secure, a lot of folks are looking for alternatives. It seems like Ring might be a good option for me. What do you folks think? Interested in hearing some feedback from users, especially anyone who has it integrated into HomeKit.	44	"['betsyrosstothestage: I have a Ring Alarm Pro and can give my thoughts.\n\nTl;dr - Love the alarm. Love the Ring eco-sphere. The Wi-Fi is fine.\n\nI had a Nest Doorbell and Nest Camera, both battery and both were shit. It took too long for videos to load, or for the doorbell to ring, or the app would crash before anything would load, and the videos would just disappear. And the doorbell would die after a week and you have to dismount the whole thing.\n\nI bought a Ring Pro Alarm kit, Ring Doorbell 4 (battery), and two Outdoor cams (at first). The doorbell and cameras awesome. The battery life gets me 2+ months in warm weather, and 1+ month in freezing weather, in a city, on a busy street, with settings at ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Swapping the battery takes ten seconds (just don‚Äôt drop the screw). \n\nI wanted an alarm system that was monitored, and for various reasons I didn‚Äôt like the other options. ADT was just using Nest and was expensive. Vivint was expensive. Euphy didn‚Äôt have monitoring at the time. Simplisafe had some very negative reviews about lag. And also, I had to have a battery and wireless system, so PoE was out of the question. \n\nThe Ring Alarm Pro checked all of my boxes. It‚Äôs wireless, there‚Äôs a lot of sensor options, it‚Äôs got monitoring and plans are pretty reasonable. I‚Äôve had no dropped videos and there‚Äôs no lag starting the video. Its caught all of the recordings. It‚Äôs easy to use the app and sort through, and it plays nicely with the rest of the Alexa/Ring system.\n\nI‚Äôve since installed FirstAlert Z-Wave smoke/co detectors throughout the house. I‚Äôve got a sensor light on trigger in my alleyway. I‚Äôve got other spotlights that turn on by sensor, all by battery, and two ring chimes throughout the house. And I like the keypads. I have absolutely zero complaints about the alarm and monitoring system. I can‚Äôt stress this enough - I have zero lag issues throughout my house with the Ring Alarm system and attached lights, which was opposite my experience with Nest. I also have probably close to 50 devices between computers, cell phones, smart home lights (including shitty Wi-Fi WiZ lights), speakers, monitoring devices, etc. and there‚Äôs no issue with them just PnP.\n\nMy only complaint is (maybe was) the Eero router side of things. It‚Äôs a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router, and with two more bases I‚Äôve got coverage throughout the house. It works just fine, but the Eero network app is designed entirely for novice users - there‚Äôs no option for the advanced settings you‚Äôll find by default on other routers, and with just one Ethernet plug on the router, it‚Äôs kind of a pain in the ass if you like hardwiring a lot of things. I ran into an issue where my Sonos system got lost in the IP mapping abyss, but I sorted that out. So if you like to go beyond the basics of PnP routers and basic ip mapping, the Eero ecosphere might not be for you. \n\nThe other complaint was that it wasn‚Äôt as fast using the internet on other devices compared to the Orbi it replaced. Like there would be a noticeable lag before websites would load. I completely about that until this post, and just realized I haven‚Äôt noticed that issue in about 6 months so that seems resolved.', ""TheREALStallman: I've had Ring Alarm for about a month since my wife and I just purchased a home.

They gave us a quote for like $3,500 USD, which gave me pause.  So I went down the rabbit hole of what alternatives there are and found Ring Alarm.  I installed it and it is freaking amazing, it came with four door/window detectors that detect of a door or window has been opened, a motion sensor, a range extender, and of course the base station and keypad.  I can't believe how well the app works and the fact that even if the base station is disconnected it still runs on battery and because it's z-wave it still works if the power goes out and WIFI is down.

I bought a Yale z-wave compatible smart lock for the front door and getting the Ring alarm to recognize and program it was insanely simple.

With all that said, are z-wave devices going the way of the dinosaur (e.g. becoming extinct/obsolete)?

I made the mistake of ordering another z-wave smart lock, a Schlage, and I'm trying to sell it but no one is biting.  This is in Canada, I should add, but still I'm in Toronto and I'm trying to sell it on Kijiji (e.g. Canadian Craigslist).

It isn‚Äôt going anywhere. To be fair Wifi and Bluetooth smart devices are more popular now. But if you get your system set up now with the devices you need, you should be finer for many years to come. \n\nAlso keep in mind that Ring‚Äôs business model relies on subscription revenue. So keeping equipment supported for the future is in its own self interest. \n\nYou‚Äôve made a good choice!', ""bridgehockey: Z-wave locks have a reputation of being unreliable.

Orangedilemma	1	12flqrn	Ring	https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/12flqrn/does_gray_appear_black_in_night_vision/	My cat has been missing for 4 days. He is black and white. I have a ring camera that has caught a cat coming to eat the food I left out and the cat looks like mine (fluffy tail, black coat on top), only problem is that there‚Äôs a similar feral cat around and he is gray with the same fluffy tail. Is there any way I can differentiate between the colors? Would the gray cat look black in night vision?	0	[]

I have a Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 and 2x Floodlight Cam Wired Plus V3

Additionally i have the Pro Chime V2 with Wifi Extender.

My question is this, is it normal for your video to **pulsate** from the security cameras? About every 2 seconds it goes out of focus and then comes back, this happens on both of my security cameras. The doorbell is beautiful and this does not happen. If it was a weak signal, I am sure my doorbell would be doing this too, however its a solid beautiful video the whole time.

When you stream an HD movie from Netflix, it just takes a fully complete video file and slowly sends it to your network. That‚Äôs easy.\n\nWith Ring, there is no ‚Äòfinished‚Äô video file. It‚Äôs constantly recording, compiling the video, sending it to Ring‚Äôs servers, processing, and then back to your device for viewing *all in real time.* That ‚Äúreal time‚Äù aspect is the cause here. It‚Äôs basically impossible to get a crystal clear live feed from the connection security cams use. The technology just doesn‚Äôt exist to handle all of that and put out a perfect image.

Short version - installation of 2 brand new Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2s with a new single transformer rated for 24V, 20VA. No chime so I didn't use the power pro v3 blocks. It seems my transformer fried.

Long version - We had 2 battery powered Ring devices but our cold weather essentially killed them. We had everything related to the doorbells replaced earlier this year, wiring and transformer with the thought that we'd be able to just get new wired Rings and put them in ourselves. I installed both tonight and we started the setup with one of the doorbells then went to the other to start the setup and it wouldn't respond. Eventually the first one timed out and some troubleshooting led me to measuring 0V coming out of my transformer. It was working prior to doing this installation since I had to probe it to find the breaker it was connected to.

The wiring charged the previous battery powered devices so I don't know why these new ones would kill the transformer. We also don't have a chime so I don't think the power blocks are necessary. The wiring is run parallel with all the leads connected at the transformer then run to their specific door.


Other than replacing the transformer, what rating should I look for on a new one? Is there anything else that I may need to do for my setup?"	0	[]

I‚Äôm sick of charging it every month. I don‚Äôt have anyone who can help outside of calling a professional. I‚Äôm fairly handy and have replaced most lights/fans in the house but this project is the first that‚Äôs gone awry. When flipping power back on, wires at Ring smelled of electrical fire. Immediately flipped it off and pulled Ring out again. The plastic near connectors had begun to melt because they got so hot. The transformer was also hot. My wiring looks different from all diagrams and videos, so I‚Äôm at a loss. The manuals show a single red and white wire going to either side (white left, red right though it says it doesn‚Äôt matter). I have two red and two green.

The old transformer was 16V 10VA. It was dead per multimeter testing. When I pulled it out it had two sets of red/green wires. Both red were wired to left screw and both green to the right screw so I copied this on installing the new one (16V 30VA).

I also copied the way the former owners had their Ring wired. Both green wires to one side, both red wires to the other. 

I haven‚Äôt touched the chime and I don‚Äôt care if it works or not. It was not at all hot unlike the transformer and the Ring.

What am I missing?

Wondering if any of you have had issues with ring doorbell and wifi connectivity.
This device has been hit and miss since purchase with it randomly dropping and us missing doorbell rings. 
It‚Äôs seemed to at least work most of the time until today. 
Now it won‚Äôt connect at all. 
Have tried another battery, have tried factory reset twice. It will connect for about 5 mins after setup, update firmware then shit itself.
It‚Äôs not the wifi as I have a spotlight camera about 15 metres away further through the same materials and same walls etc.
The doorbell is 3 metres from my AP and gets a signal strength of -53.
I tried calling support, they were appalling. I politely explained I had factory reset the device this morning. 
They asked to factory reset again and reboot the ap. Do you not think I have tried that 10 times ffs. 
Final outcome, I need to take it back to where I purchased it. They said it‚Äôs too difficult to post a new one as requires a lot of troubleshooting.

Well my experience since the 25th is that there are no recordings at all, I can't do anything with it even while on wifi.  The app shows that it is on wifi and has a great connection but there are no recent recordings available and live monitoring over wifi tells me that I need a subscription.

Started with the doorbell, and it was about as simple of an install as could be. Picked up the wifi right off the bat, and it is currently working just fine. 

Went to do the first light, and it will not detect my wifi. The list is about 15 different WiFi's long, all of my neighbors houses basically, but not mine. I check and my router is sending out both 2.4 and 5, so that doesn't seem to be it, especially with the doorbell working. I tried a hotspot with my phone and it saw that, and I connected to it and it works just fine, it even had an update that took a few minutes. I tried my house wifi again, still no luck. 

I haven't tried the 2nd floodlight just yet, figured I'd see if this was an issue with that type of light or if I was just doing something wrong. But I am going through the same process as the doorbell, and that isn't it. ü§∑

I apologize if this has been asked before - but I searched here and on The Google, and didn't find anything.

I just set up the Ring alarm system and cameras yesterday.  Set up the base station first, then contact sensors on doors, then on from there.  When I first set up the contact sensors I was getting the ""chirp tone"" when doors were opened only on the base station.  At some point after installing two keypads I completely stopped getting chirp tones altogether.  I played around with some settings and started getting chirp tones on one of the keypads, but nowhere else - which I didn't really want.  I played around with settings some more, and finally started getting chirp tones only from the base station and nowhere else - which was what I wanted.

Now today I've realized that I'm getting chirp tones when doors are opened not only on the base station, but also on my Echo Dot which is in the room I use as my office.  That may have been going on last night, but I didn't realize it because of the Echo Dot being in a different room than the base station.

I don't want to get chirp tones on the Echo Dot when doors are opened.  The only thing I can find is to turn off the ""Enabled"" option on the contact sensors in the Alexa app - but that seems to completely turn off the sensors altogether so Alexa can't do anything at all with them.  Is there some way to just turn off the door open chirp on the Echo Dot without completely disabling the sensor in Alexa?  I ordered another Echo Dot last night to put in my master bedroom, so Alexa could announce when someone rings my doorbell (because the mechanical doorbell chime usually can't be heard in that room) - but I don't want chirps going off in my master bedroom (or my office room) every time a door is opened.

I don't know that I'd ever use Alexa for anything in regards to the contact sensors, so turning off that ""Enabled"" switch is potentially an option - but if there's a way to just turn off the chirp on the Dot I'd rather do that.  I know in the contact sensor options there are ""Base Station Only Sounds"" I can choose from, but I don't really care for any of those sounds - although I guess I could choose one of those if I have to."	4	"['BarryJ128: Is there any chance you have an Alexa routine set up to cause your Echo devices to chirp?', ""DoAndroidsDrmOfSheep: I don't think so.  I've never set up any Alexa routines that I'm aware of.  I only have the one Echo Dot in my office room, and I've never really used it for anything.  SiriusXM gave it to me free last year.  I did the initial setup of it when it arrived, but never really did anything else with it.\n\nThe only time it chirps is from the contact sensors when one of the doors is opened.  I just set those up yesterday, so prior to that the Echo Dot has never made a sound.  I like that it'll tell me someone has rung the doorbell (which was why I ordered another one for the bedroom, since the doorbell usually can't be heard in there) - but other than that I don't know that I really want the Echos giving me door chirps or alerting me to every little thing that goes on with the Ring system.\n\nETA: I just looked in the Alexa app, and there aren't any routines set up for anything."", 'BarryJ128: Okay try this: in the Alexa app, go to devices, on top scroll to the right to find all devices and click that.

NoName2show	2	125er8n	Ring	https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/125er8n/psa_dont_remove_your_ring_connected_zwave_devices/	"I've been using Ring since it first came out. At the time, I added all my z-wave+ light switches, and other z-wave devices. I liked that Ring supported the latest z-wave+ security. I also have a SmartThings hub where I have more esoteric devices that Ring doesn't support.

Because I have 2 Ring repeaters and I had been having problems with a particular switch I was using on SmartThings, I decided to move it over to Ring - WORST DECISION EVER!

Once I transferred it, Alexa would not retrieve it from Ring. I disabled the Ring skill and re-enabled it - still no cigar. I decided, to my demise, to disable it again and manually delete all my ring devices - light switches, fans, sensors, cameras, locks, etc.

Upon re-enabling the Ring skill, ONLY the Ring-branded and Ring-certified devices showed up on Alexa. All my other devices continue to work ONLY on the Ring app but are not recognized or added to my Alexa devices, which is my main  interaction method. I used to ask Alexa to turn off/on my lights and control all my z-wave+ devices.

I decided to search online and found a whole thread on this on the Ring community. Apparently, either Alexa decided to limit what it gets from Ring or Ring stopped sharing non-Ring devices with Alexa. This has been an issue for months!

I'm very disappointed since I am a Ring-subscriber and pay all my dues to them. For them to simply pull the rug under my feet like this simply SUCKS!

Same for turning it off. Turn off time 6 am means I have to enter 4 am. I'm located in Europe. So it looks like some part of my Ring thinks I'm living in CEST (which is correct) and a small part thinks I'm in GMT (which is CEST -2 and wrong). Actually the offset went from 1 hour to two hours after we went for summertime last weekend. I can't find any setting to correct that. Any proposals? Thank you!	0	[]

However, the sticker fell off of the Floodlight (I can see the outline of where it was) and there are no identifying marks of any kind, inside or out.

I should be able to get the MAC address of the device with Wireshark but I don't know the PIN or even the format of the QR Code.  I read the QR Code of the Doorbell so I know the format of the URL (`https://ring.com/s?m=<MAC ADDRESS>d=rds&n=<DSN>&b=t&v=2`).  The MAC address is easy, however I don't know what the DSN might be referring to.

My question is, does anyone know how to encode the MAC Address into the PIN?

I got a Ring Doorbell Pro 2 a little while ago that I probably can't still return, and I want to try to install it where the intercom doorbell is now on my front door.

The intercom doorbell was wired to an 8 strand wire (4 black, 1 blue, 1 green, 1 red, 1 white). That wire has an imprint along it that says ""CM 4PR22 SHIELDED (UL) E108998 OR AWM 2464 BELDEN M 9305 CSA PCC FT4 KP"" and it is connected to an old Elan EPL-MDA1000 amplifier that is also connected to speakers throughout the house. The old system is not currently working and some of the wiring is disconnected by the previous owner who did not know anything about the system after they bought the house. I'm assuming it's probably not worth trying to salvage the existing system as it is.

Is there a way I can make use of the existing wire? It would not be easy to run a new wire since this wire is run all the way up and over the main floor through the attic before dropping down 2 stories to the basement.

Could I connect that existing wire to some kind of transformer that would allow me to supply power to the Ring Doorbell?

Thank you for any advice!"	3	"[""anomalous_cowherd: If you're disconnecting all the original system then it's just wires in the walls now, so it makes sense to use them as running them without needing to redecorate or anything is the worst part of the job.\n\nYou could even use several wires twisted together to increase the current carrying capacity if they are super thin."", ""AffectionateBody261: I just wanted to follow up here and share what I figured out in case it helps anyone else.

They said I could use a transformer that provided from 16v to 24v. So, I bought this one because it says it can support multiple devices and I have 2 spots I want to put a doorbell at.

Maybe Ring will be able to improve if other people have had similar experiences. This is why I do not believe this violates rule #3.

But as the title says - after just 3 DAYS of using Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2, I am cancelling my Protect Plan Plus, and returning the doorbell, flood light and spotlight cams back to Lowes. The latter 2 are still in the box.

&#x200B;

A large part of this is do to the god awful experience I had with Ring support. I just wanted to know how to download video recordings. But after asking me to verify my identity (all via login methods despite the fact I am currently logged into a valid session for the chat..) - it became clear to me that there was a language barrier.

&#x200B;

I'm not here to hate on outsourcing support - it is what it is. But their support could not even answer me in readable sentences if they offer a product with SD card support. They also kept repeating things which is extremely frustrating. So I thanked them for their time and ended the chat. This sort of service is the fastest way for me to 180 on a product. So I am.

&#x200B;

But the crux of the issue I have with Ring is their total lack of 24/7 continuous recording options. Even the Protect Plus plan offers no recording outside of 120 seconds video event clips. Finding information on if they even SELL products with local SD card recording is difficult. But as I understand it - no.  Best I found is \`[https://ring.com/products/ring-edge-microsd-card-64gb](https://ring.com/products/ring-edge-microsd-card-64gb)\` which is an SD card for their Ring Edge product which still does not support many of their actual cameras.

&#x200B;

I don't like being Nickle and dimed, trudging through poorly explained products and services, and talking to support that is less effect than smashing my head into a brick wall.

&#x200B;

So it's all getting returned and I'm buying the \[BIG G COMPANY\] ecosystem. Which for $20 more a year i get 10 days of 24/7 video recording for all my cameras.

&#x200B;

Downside to the alarm pro is it‚Äôs only a dual band router and can‚Äôt handle as much traffic or as many devices. Pick your priorities.\n\nIf you‚Äôre going with the alarm pro, get a eero 6/6E as the gateway router plugged into the modem and put the alarm pro as the other router about half the distance of where the Wifi signal gets bad. That way it will be able to extend the signal with good strength. For me this was about a 30-40‚Äô radius from the modem & gateway router. Caveat to this is that any camera connected to the alarm pro will not have as good (but likely still acceptable) of a connection as cameras that are closer to connect with the 6/6E because we‚Äôre talking about 2.4 & 5 band vs 2.4 & 5 & 5 bands.', 'obsessedsolutions: So I have the base and an extender. I had issues with 2 and 1500 square feet. But also with Pro we get 3gb of data for free if the internet goes out. I‚Äôm to cheap to pay for extra data üòÖ\n\nSo I‚Äôve used Ubiquiti for my main network. 3 of those placed around the place. Love it so far but a bit to technical if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing', 'ss3walkman: This is extremely helpful. I‚Äôll buy the Ring Alarm Pro. Then I‚Äôll also buy a separate eero 6 to plug into the modem and set the alarm pro as the other router placed in another location. My question to you is if this the best alarm system/ecosystem to buy into? I only ask because when you mentioned the downside, it feels like there‚Äôs another option. Also, if I bought a eufy camera, would I be able to access it from the Ring app, or would it be a separate app?', 'macphoto469: I think what he meant by downside in that particular instance is using the Ring Alarm Pro as part of an Eero system vs. having tri-band Eeros, since the Ring Alarm Pro\'s built-in Eero is, as he noted, dual-band.  I have personally not found it to be a big hinderance, because most of my Eeros (and my RAP) are hardwired backhaul (so the third band isn\'t as much of a factor), but even when connected through my one wireless Eero, I still get a bit over 300mbps.\n\nI\'m a fairly recent convert to Ring (about 6 months ago), and am pretty happy with it.  I think my only big complaint is how dependent the cameras are on having an internet connection... there\'s pretty much no capability for footage to be buffered, so if the connection is lost (through WiFi jamming, cable being cut, or just bad luck), the footage will be gone.  The Ring Alarm Pro\'s backup internet can take care of that to some degree (though in my case, my cell signal is too weak to be of much use for video).\n\nI love having everything in one app... I think we have around a dozen cameras now (doorbell, floodlights, stick-up cams).  When you consider that the service for the cameras is ""free"" when you pay for the alarm monitoring, it\'s a pretty good deal.', 'ss3walkman: Thanks for your response. I‚Äôm feeling better about this change with every response I get. Do you find the combination of stick-up cams and flood lights work for you? I was considering just doing stick-up cams along with the Ring motion lights instead of the flood light.', ""macphoto469: For the most part, yes, the combination of floodlights (four of them) and stick-up cams works well for me.  In one case, the positioning of the existing old-fashioned floodlight wasn't a great location for a camera, but I went ahead and put one there anyway (the camera is still useful there, just not ideal).\n\nI could have probably gotten by with just those floodlight cams, but I went a little nuts with the stick-up cams too.  :)"", 'ss3walkman: Appreciate all your help! Last question - if you have a ring doorbell camera at the front door, do you need an additional camera? Or should the doorbell camera be enough?', 'macphoto469: Probably for most people just the doorbell would be sufficient, but I have a stick-up cam covering the front porch as well (from a perpendicular angle).  My doorbell doesn‚Äôt look down far enough to see packages on the porch, and the stick-up cam also supplements the view by showing more of the front yard and street.']"

I am missing event motions. 
For the life of me I can‚Äôt figure out why. When Owls were residents, I saw no issues. 
I just recently linked the outside cam to the inside cam. That‚Äôs how I realized I was missing events. Outside cam records the Doves going in and and out at their shift changes. 
In the included videos you can see the other enter because the outside cam triggered inside to come on. But as you can see it doesn‚Äôt show the other when it left, hence missed event. 
So I don‚Äôt get why it would miss obvious movements.

Ring Wins

* Alerts are just faster. 2 seconds on Ring, vs 8 seconds+ on Arlo  - this is critical
* Ring software is slicker/faster/more stable

Arlo wins

* The mode interface is very simple and smooth

I had no trouble distinguishing which battery needed replacing.  On a previous app update; ring folks decided to rename these to ""battery 1"" & ""battery 2"".  Conversations with ring support made it even more confusing -- one tech told me battery 1 is on the right side; another insisted that battery 1 was on the left.

Fast forward to today; now the app says 'left' & 'right' again - I suppose it changed on the last update I installed (*version 5.57.1*).

What has me confused this morning is that I replaced the left battery (status was 17%) yesterday with freshly charged one.  Almost 24 hours later; the app says that the left battery status is now at 7%.

So...  I go to my camera, removed the left battery (*as viewed looking at lens*); and wait for my app to refresh.  On the app; left battery is still at 7%; but it now tells me to add a battery to the right side.

Appears to me that ring folks have f\*\*ked up the app again.

We've been having problems as well; specifically our doorbell stopped announcing ring events on any of our Alexa devices.  I had tried troubleshooting from the Ring side with things like moving the doorbell from 5ghz to 2.4ghz wifi, disabling the mechanical chime, resetting it, etc but nothing made a difference.  

Last night I did the following:

* In the Alexa app, disable the Ring skill.
* Still in the Alexa app, go to ""Devices"".
* Find and remove ALL devices that had been linked through the Ring skill (they should have an error like ""Server Not Responding"" after the skill is removed, making them easier to find)
* Back in skills, re-enable the Ring skill and perform account linking
* Allow device discovery to occur
* Set back up groups/routines that use the Ring devices

Not only did this immediately fix our issues with the doorbell announcements, but our camera feeds are now coming up on our Echo Show devices MUCH faster than they ever have before.  Like, nearly instantly whereas previously there was maybe a 10-15 second delay.

The problem exists on two different phones. I tried to re-enroll one of the devices, did not help. I am thinking about disabling and enabling the encryption as next step, although that requires some time as I need to open the doorbell and it is cooooold :) outside.

Anyone observed the similar bug? What was the solution?

I DO have some initial questions.

1)  I also bought a chime.  It seems like the chime works only when there is a body in front of the camera.  While inside I reached outside to press the button and test the chime, and it didn't ring.  Is that purposeful or do I have a problem with the chime or bell (I note that the tune DID ring when I stood in front of the door.)

2)  Is there any way to adjust how long the ring blue circle spins between pushing the bell?  I noticed when I pushed it the circle would spin a minute or so, and it was only after it turned white that I could ring the doorbell again.  I'd love it to be able to ring much more quickly if possible.

3)  I'm trying to work out setting the motion detection zones.  It has the default ""blue"" zone I can adjust to exclude the street and sidewalk in front of my house.  What is the purpose of being able to add additional zones (when I clicked the button a purple box showed up).

4) Are there any other settings I should be adjusting?

My home was recently burgled. I'm now looking for a set-up which:

 a) acts as a visible deterrent to potential burglars

b) gives me peace-of-mind when I'm away from home (i.e. can take a look at internal cams and check the place hasn't been ransacked and receive push notifications for movement sensed).

I'm not really interested in ''security system' elements such as the alarm.

With this in mind I'm thinking of purchasing:

1) doorbell

2) a few 'indoor cams' to poistion in rooms around the house

3)'spotlight cam pro' (or similar) to place in a particularly vulnerable position at the rear of the property where access was gained for recent burglary

I'll soon be renting a house to tenants for at least a year, maybe 2-3 years. The house has a Ring alarm which I am leaving for the tenants to use. It has 6 door/window sensors and a motion sensor. 

For obvious privacy reasons (mine and theirs), I don't want to just make them shared users on my account. I would instead like to remove the devices from my account and let them take them over fully as admins. Similar to ownership changes described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/d311qf/how_do_i_transfer_ownership_to_another_account/) and [here](https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038010351-How-to-Take-Over-or-Change-Ownership-of-a-Ring-Device). 

I understand the instructions at those links, but they and all other instructions I've read seem to imply a permanent transfer of  ownership, and usually one where you don't care about transferring the existing configuration (e.g. you've sold the devices and they will be installed at a new location). 

However, in my case, the devices will stay where they are, so the config won't change in the sense of how many sensors, their locations, etc. 

Is there a way to transfer ownership/ admin access to the system that preserves the privacy of both parties (no access to my old recorded videos or account info, the tenants have their own [Ring.com](https://Ring.com) account, etc), BUT preserves the config (the tenants don't need to fully set up the system again and re-add all the sensors)? 

I.e. I'd like to be able to transfer the alarm such that when the tenants add it to their account, it comes with the sensors already configured with their locations, sensitivity settings, etc. And the tenants just need to add their user-specific settings like PIN codes etc. 

Thanks."	4	"['Torontobeachboy: I doubt it.  But someone else may know better on options to transfer the config.  And if you do have it all reregistered to them, just remember when they leave, if they don‚Äôt deregister them all from their account, you‚Äôll never be able to use them again.  So if there is a security deposit, make sure you word stuff so it also covers you having to buy a new system unless they deregister all the devices.', 'Wayne8766: Only way would be to update the email address with the account, then they could update the password. However I highly recommend you don‚Äôt do this as they will have access to all previous history/data on the account. It is after all consumer equipment made for self install. \n\nYou‚Äôre best deregistering correctly and letting them set it back up I‚Äôm afraid. You can make it easier by taking screenshots or writing down the codes fro the app per sensor. If you go Into settings per sensor it tells you all the info they will need to set it back up. \n\nIf it was a pack bought, when setting up the base station the sensors should show and they can just rename them and use the codes from the screenshots rather than removing them all and scanning them. \n\nFYI I highly recommend getting something in the tenancy agreement regarding transfer of ownership of the devices. Reason being in Rings eyes, whoever‚Äôs account the device is registered on, owns it end of. In other words at the end of the tenancy agreement, they could take it with them and ring would not transfer ownership back to you.', ""spsilk: Thanks for the advice! I'll proceed with the deregistering option.   \n\n\nDo you happen to know, when I turn off remote monitoring and deregister a Ring alarm from my account, what does the Ring alarm do after that? Does it revert to a totally brand new state, like not set up at all? And disarmed, with no configured codes, as a result? Or does it just go into an offline state, still armed (if it was when I deregistered it), and with the same keypad codes? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see this [ownership change guide](https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038010351-How-to-Take-Over-or-Change-Ownership-of-a-Ring-Device) from Ring, but it doesn't say what state the alarm will be in. So I'm just wondering do I need to give the incoming tenants a code to disarm it."", 'Wayne8766: It reverts to set up mode. I would unplug the unit and let the battery die once you de registered it.']"

Initially I was informed that the delivery date would be in June.  

I received my Ring Car Cam on the launch week of February 15th and was excited to have a some peace of mind regarding my beloved car. Like many things in security, at some point these deterrents become a false sense of security. My experience with the ring car cam (when it worked) was really a mixed bag. When it worked, it was amazing seeing what the future of car security is like. Being able to beam your voice into the car cam‚Äôs speakers, turn on flashlights to dazzle would-be car infiltrators. When motion capture actually worked, it gave you some hope. 

But those rose tinted glasses didn‚Äôt last long. 
Motion capture didn‚Äôt work properly most of the time. I‚Äôd get alerts saying the car cam had been disconnected and when you clicked into the notification, those clips would be the motion capture. But if the motion capture notification worked properly, it would also deliver a screenshot built into the notification as well (Android). 
It lasted about a week when my I suddenly stopped receiving notifications. 

My battery had completely died. After replacing the battery, I still could not get the Car Cam to power back on. The OBD2-to-USB-C adapter LED would get power for about 5 seconds and then shut off. No functionality, no LEDs on the Car Cam / Ring app. 
Ring customer service states that there are no replacement parts and that inventory is probably going to be replenished by June. 

Is anybody out there also struggling with a defective car cam at all?

I am on the fence about returning this, and I want to believe in this product! But returning it might just be the best course of action at this rate‚Ä¶"	4	"['Sad_Pie4443: Im on the fence about getting one, which is how I ended up here.  As a consumer, Id return it asap.

But also at this price point, I‚Äôm hard pressed to find something that has parking mode with interior cabin as well as cloud capabilities. Blackvue would be far more complex especially with the addition of the LTE module/box. Then you tack on a $10-$20/month LTE line. The Car Cam is free to see your videos in the cloud with the built in LTE connection - at least when the camera can actually detect motion, power on from sleep, record on 2 cameras and send it successfully while not draining the voltage on your battery to the point where you can‚Äôt start your car (it killed my battery, so whatever software functions they wrote for voltage checking sucked and failed). In my search to gauge how many people out there had defective units, I saw lots of reports of the camera just going offline after some hours. On the bright side this is also probably the simplest parking mode installation ever. \n\nI just received my returns email saying they sent out the return package. I‚Äôm just praying that my experience with this gets better asap and hope that they don‚Äôt hold my camera hostage until their forecasted June shipment arrives.\n\nHope my writeup helped somewhat and make your own decisions!', ""DidUReedit: What did you set your battery usage setting to? I have mine on high with a group 27F, 165 min reserved capacity.  After sitting over the weekend, my voltage only dropped from 12.6 to 12.5v. Most new cars with smaller motor have small battery. Either upgrade to the biggest car battery that will fit or buy a secondary battery kit. Some cars will shut power to OBD after a set time once car is shut off and that's probably why you got an alert that the camera has been disconnected.  Perhaps Ring thinks it's stolen and bricked it? For motion alert,  you have to pick from exterior or interior monitoring under motion setting.  I only had my for 2 weeks and the one thing I'm most dissatisfied about is the video quality, both viewed from app as well as the 20 second downloaded clip.  The res seems to be lower than 1080 even when the video clip is downloaded (reason why I'm here lol).""]"

I'm UK based, and have loved and used Ring for quite some time, I have quite a bit of home automation, including ring indoor and outdoor cams, and various other automation. Im talking maybe 10 cams total. 

Here's the kicker, I keep seeing other devices that seem, better, cheaper, faster, easier to install, better supported and getting upgraded more frequently in the UK. 

I also find alot of the tech sort of gives up the ghost for example the batteries or battery charger seem to constantly die, and the cameras will last maybe 1-2 years and then start getting a bit funky.

If i could get the car cam and the drone I absolutely would, including the solar path lights etc.. but it sort of feels thats unlikely to be coming any time soon.  

I have genuinely loved Ring and been a fan since it started, but i guess im getting a bit tired of some of the issues and just wondering if its time to move on. 

Am i making a mistake? Thoughts? Advice?"	6	"[""mfwood8: USA here. I think Ring still has competitive hardware and software, but it seems they are leaning more heavily on their subscription model.

I've had a Ring Doorbell 3 (RD3) for 2.5 years now and haven't had any issues until recently.  It always reports a good or excellent signal.  About 2 weeks ago it dropped off my IOT network and will not reconnect.  I have a Ring Floodlight Cam (2nd gen), Ring Stickup Cam, and Ring Doorbell 2 all on that same network and none of them are having any issues.  About half of them consistently report a worse signal than the RD3 ever did and it doesn't seem to bother them.


The RD3 will still connect to my main network but will not connect to guest or iot.  I'm not really a fan of having anything on my main network because only devices that I trust and that have all their latest security patches are allowed on it.


My main, guest and iot networks are on separate VLANs.  Guest has network isolation, so a device on there can see other guest devices but nothing on my main network.  IOT has both network isolation and client isolation.  So basically a device on iot can only see the internet, not my other networks and not even other devices on the same network.  I have a lot of iot devices and vendors running on there and the RD3 is the only one that is having any connection problems.  The RD3 will connect to 2.4ghz and 5ghz on my main network but will not connect to either band on either of the other networks.


When I try to change networks the RD3 even shows up as a client on my Ubiquiti dashboard and shows some packets downloaded but 0 uploaded, then the Ring app says it failed to connect.  But it was perfectly fine on there for 2.5 years.  The RD3 downloaded and applied a firmware update as soon as I got it reconnected to my main network but this did not make any difference.  The support rep I was talking with said there were no firmware updates applied 2-3 weeks ago, around the time I first saw this issue.


Lots of mid to high end residential wifi routers have these same security settings available so I'm hoping someone else in here has also encountered this problem and figured out what's going on."	6	"[""TheEthyr: >  About half of them consistently report a worse signal than the RD3 ever did and it doesn't seem to bother them.\n\nIf you are talking about the signal strength reported in the Ring app, then this is the signal coming from the AP. This is less important than the other direction, doorbell->AP. You should also check the doorbell's signal strength as seen by the AP.\n\nFor example, my Ring app shows a pretty strong signal (-61 dBm):\n\n[Signal strength as seen by Ring app](https://i.redd.it/l9ige9as2fx71.jpg)\n\nBut my AP paints a much less rosy picture (-85 dBm!):\n\n[Signal strength as seen by AP](https://i.redd.it/vfvnh0aw2fx71.png)\n\n-85 dBm is very low, and what I consider borderline unusable. In spite of this, my Ring seems to work reasonably well. An Rx rate of 81 Mbps is more than enough to handle the 1 Mbps to 2 Mbps bandwidth used by the doorbell.\n\nAnyway, this all boils down to the Ring having a very weak radio. I had to put an AP very close to it in order to get a decent signal through the stucco exterior of my house."", 'jhawkinsvalrico: The firmware update that was pushed a week ago created an issue for all of my cameras.

Maybe it needs to use a particular port that it can\'t for some reason, or it wants to hit a certain thing in DNS that\'s blocked.  I redirect dns for the iot vlan over to one of those ""no scam"" lists thru CloudFlare or AdGuard, maybe they put something on there that Ring was using? \n\n\nThe doorbell is hardwired and I swapped in a freshly charged battery before I started all of this troubleshooting.', 'TheEthyr: Running a packet capture is something I would do.

For several weeks I have been thinking my doorbell chime plug in was only working at random. Sometimes when the doorbell was pressed it would ring, and sometimes it wouldn't.

Today with some testing I have realised that the plug in doorbell is only ringing if my phone is one loud. Toggling my mobile (android) to silent using the button on the side also prevents the plug in chime from ringing when the doorbell is pressed.

How/why would these things be linked, and does anyone know how I fix it in settings? The whole reason I bought a chime plug is so that I would still hear the doorbell when my phone is on silent!"	0	[]

Time-Distribution-49	4	11nbkfq	Ring	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/11nbkfq		5	"[""jacob123t: It's most likely due to the LTE signal strength. Based on the information it's provided. The Car Cam will continue to record, but keep the recordings on the actual device only; until a stronger signal is available.  I wonder if it will send you notifications at the current signal strength. \n\nI've been working with a Ring Specialist for about 2 weeks now. Trying to get a better signal to the  Car Cam. I requested their assistance as the signal strength has been inconsistent. \n\nI'm in a second floor apartment with an attached garage. We're trying out a Ring Chime Pro wifi extender and he's collecting the data for their IT Dept. I last spoke with him earlier today. \n\nHe's mentioned the RSSI signal strength numbers a few times. Of course, the higher the better. But I'm not exactly sure where Ring wants that number to be, at a minimum. \n\nInteresting. Your signal strength at 61 is green. Whereas, right now...mine is 79 but red. Red indicating a lower quality connection. \n\nI was just now able to get the live view. It took about 10 seconds to load up. But sometimes it won't connect at all. Or takes a few times to get it to connect. This is why he's collecting the data. Also, the Cam is favoring LTE, instead of connecting to the wifi network. Even with the Ring Chime Pro wifi extender. \n\nCould be something that needs to be worked out and fixed through an update. Could just be that because my car is in a garage 10 to 15 feet down and another 8 to 10 feet to the side. The garage isn't exactly under my unit. \n\nI'm waiting on an update from the Ring Specialist."", ""jacob123t: I've been tinkering. The RSSI number being higher may not necessarily be a stronger signal. I can run it by the Ring Specialist. I don't want to mislead you. \n\nI took some screenshots for the Ring Specialist of the connection on LTE and on wifi. Seems like the Car Cam connects to wifi when it needs to. But then favors LTE after a while and there really isn't an explanation of what it uses wifi for or why it bounces back and forth; other than when LTE isn't available and it needs to send notifications. Wifi could be sending actual recordings to the Ring cloud network, as Ring Go makes recordings available in the cloud."", 'ButtUglee: I‚Äôm receiving same code and I have no blue light. I own two‚Ä¶ Tacoma and Tundra. The Tacoma is offline. I unplugged it and plugged it up again.

It's when it drops below RSSI -77 that I will have an issue. (the cellular signal is typically at RSSI  -73 or lower at my parking spot)\n\nI purchased a directional WiFi AP (TP-Link CPE210) to hit my car parked around sixty feet from my condo. Now I will typically have a wifi signal between RSSi -70 to RSSI -52. It's mounted inside, pointed toward my parking space. Sending a signal through the blinds and window.\n\nMy main problem though is that if there is a change to the wifi, like changing the channel, the RIng Car cam drops off Wifi to cellular. And will never reconnect to wifi unless I reboot the Car Cam or drive somewhere and come back.\n\nI also don't understand why ring doesn't change things in the UI to be more like the RIng Alarm UI. The RIng Alarm will specifically show you whether you are on cellular or wifi and show the signal strength for each one. With the RIng Car cam it always shows the signal strength by the Wifi section. Whether it is using cellular or Wifi. And doesn't specifically show that you are on Wifi or Cellular. Like the RIng alarm.\n\nPlus they don't show the cellular data usage yet. Which is important since there is supposed to be an extra charge once 2GB of cellular is used. Although, the last time I talked to Ring support, they did not know what the charge per GB would be yet."", 'Time-Distribution-49: Please keep me updated, I‚Äôm in an apartment as well.

Ring was meant as a self service alarm set up but the eero element makes me feel like I need professional set up. Constant wifi issues or what I gather is ‚Äòtechnical interference‚Äô on a daily basis is not an acceptable drawback to the system. At this point I‚Äôd rather just disable eero but haven‚Äôt found that option. 

Anyway, would welcome any advice"	8	"['Wayne8766: Who recommended to run both systems with the same SSID etc, you should never run both systems.

So I have quite a few Ring products - doorbell - sensors - spotlight cam - stick up cam - alarm system etc - I also have 3 hive cameras indoors (I know they are being switched off in 2025 - shame as quality of them is superb) and a few hive door sensors

Is there one app that would let me view all cameras within it - both hive and ring - and give me alerts within it ?

I am a complete noob when it comes to this stuff - I have had ring since 2015 and just added as i have gone along - the hive stuff comes from a previous property - I also have a nest thermostat - and it would make like a lot easier to have everything controlled/alerted from just the one app.

However, whilst no-one is going to fire up a laptop and deauth manually for a burglary, I looked on Amazon of all places and you can buy a watch mounted Arduino, which is pre programmed to deauth WiFi clients.\n\nI don't think someone breaking into a car is concerned with the legalities of a jammer, carrying thief tools is illegal in my country but that doesn't stop them, this is not much different. There have been multiple reports of jammers being used in recent years, here's a video of one in action: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Chc2hL3sdBM .\n\nMore and more people are using WiFi cams as an additional layer of security.

In the last couple of days the IR filter/night vision seems to not be working properly. When I go into the app and the cameras take a snapshot at night, the Spotlight cam is dark. It remains dark if I go into Live View. Then if I exit and go into Live View again, the IR filter seems to then be on.

There is also a delay in the IR filter coming on if it detects motion, sometimes it doesn't come on at all, sometimes it takes 30 seconds.

I have tried:

* Rebooting multiple times
* Re-connecting to WiFi
* Removing the batteries
* Tapping the cam
* Shining a light into it
* Toggling on/off Colour Night Vision

The above seems to solve it for 10 minutes or so then it reverts back. WiFi strength is showing as green. Any ideas what it could be/what to try, or is it likely to need replacing?"	3	"['Chief7064: The Plus I caught on sale last month did what you described along with some ""green"" daytime snapshots.

I recently bought a ring alarm kit which was ""restored"" by the store. The tamper alert was always triggered. I called Ring, which confirmed the there was nothing to do. In an annoyed manner, I walked to the store with the sensor and explained my issue. They were unable to replace the sensor as they didn't supply it anymore, they would need my entire kit to refund me. I walked home again.

I have some electronics experience, so I figured I'd disable the tamper switch. Permanently. At first, I carefully examined the switch, and I realized that I am absolutely disgusted by how small components can be made today. I tried bridging the contacts with some pointy tweezers with no luck. I now suspect my tweezers are insulated where the to two parts are joined. I lost my temper and gave the switch a good snipping with some ridiculously oversized wire cutters. I had in wrath exposed the very small spring inside the switch. I had a beer and played with the spring for a while. I bent the spring in fun ways until the app no longer showed tampered and I put the entire thing together again.

Call it the number and what do you get - grief. 

You get questioned why you want to return the goods. You get told to download the app. You get told to unpackage the goods. 

I feel like they are trying to do everything to make sure that it is difficult to return goods to them. And that they they will say ""Ah, but you used the goods. We can't accept these back."" 

Has anybody got any advice - besides asking for the supervisor?



Edit: Finally managed to return the items purchased. It too speaking with five different reps to get it sorted. One of the items sent was not the item recorded on the master packing slip - it had a different Serial number and MAC address. That complicated matters. 

Other problem was different approaches to using the labels that were provided. On rep said put all three on the outside of the box. (Labels said put only one on the outside of the box.) Another rep said put two in box once scanned at drop off point and then put third on outside of box. Decided to package items separately, but final rep took ages to understand that the labels provided by Ring gave no indication as to which went with which item. Plus he had problems not realising that the UK is not in the USA.

Truly a bad few days trying to get things resolved.

The only way is to supplement the Ring system with PoE CAT6 runs and hardwired CCTV camera's with 24/7 feeds. Hardwiring all the connections is the only way around Wifi jammers.  Then get a DVR/NVR to record and I would put both the DVR/NVR as well as the PoE switch on a backup battery for good measure.  Several brand PoE camera's that are popular for this are Hikvision, Dahua, Reolink.  Personally, I purchased a Synology and ran my own CAT6 with Reolink camera's back to a PoE switch.

CwzyMFer	3	11at80i	Ring	https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/11at80i/how_is_the_internal_battery_of_the_ring_doorbell/	"Hey Y'all, any electricians around this this week?

Ring is rated for a 16-24 VAC 50/60Hz to 40VA (W) max transformer and states it is compatible with HeathZenith 35 Base which is rated for 16VAC at 10W or 30W.  The transformer installed is a Honeywell 24VAC 40VA.  The RING performance has always been intermittent, and after a few years, an unadvertised non-serviceable internal battery seemed to die, or lost it's ability to recharge from the hard wiring. Troubleshooting revealed a hidden micro-usb port that was used to recharge the battery.  RING then worked for a few hours with the chime disabled via the app. However, as soon as the chime was enabled and tested, the chime rang once, but the Ring bell died again, meaning I was unable to set up or reconnect while hard wired. When I measure the voltage across the wires at the bell, it is the same as the transformer voltage.  Could the transformer overrating relative to the interior chime be affecting the performance of the RING Doorbell?

The major flaw with the system is it will shut off after 1-6 hours of your vehicle being shut off. Some people record longer times, but the average seems only a few hours. Most break-ins happen late at night, making this system useless. 

I have a brand new sprinter van, and it only lasts 6.5 hours after shutting off the vehicle. This is a terrible design by ring. They should have integrated a battery, or they need a firmware update to fix this issue.

Ring‚Äôs description ‚ÄúHelp protect your car 24/7 with Car Cam, the dual-facing dashboard security camera.‚Äù
This is not a security camera. It‚Äôs a dash camera and a bad one at that."	31	"['Algeradd: This isn\'t a design flaw or anything at all specific to Ring, it\'s just a normal accepted downside of any hardwired dashcam with a parking mode.  Running a camera + LTE or Wifi is going to use up some power, and even a low power sleep mode during idle times still consumes power.  It can\'t run off the car\'s 12V battery indefinitely, and it can\'t run the battery so low that you can\'t start the car then later.\n\nIntegrated batteries are also not a good solution as they\'d add significant cost and bulk to the system.  A lithium-based battery sitting on a car windshield hitting temps of 160+ degrees in a parked car in summer is going to not have a long life span at all.  And if you tried to route it more down toward the OBD connector area for cooler temperatures, it would make the install that much more complicated as you\'d have to find somewhere to safely secure a bulky battery and any wiring going to it, when Ring is very much concerned with safety of installs as they consider anything without a very cleanly mounted OBD2 port on the left side of the dash as ""incompatible"".\n\nLook at things like the Blackvue batteries.  They run $160-$390, only buy you 12 to 30 hours of runtime depending on what you spend, and add a bulky battery unit you need to find somewhere to stash.  All these things fly in the face of a cheap, simple to use and install solution that Ring is going for.\n\nThe only thing Ring can do to be helpful in this situation IMO is be more transparent about what their battery settings actually mean.  It\'d be nice to know just exactly what voltage levels correspond to Low, Medium, and High.  I\'m guessing Ring is erring highly on the side of caution because they\'d rather have complaints about low runtime rather than complaints about dead cars that won\'t start.\n\nAlso I\'d love a GPS-based shutdown option.  I don\'t need to run mine when I\'m parked at home for hours on end, I have security cameras on the house for that and the car parked in a garage.  I solved this in prior more complex dashcam installs with a simple off switch on the parking mode controller that I\'d turn off when I parked at home.  I\'ve actually considered routing a switched OBD2 extension for this purpose in my car, but I\'d prefer a simple elegant software solution instead.  That would also make me more willing to run at a higher battery drain option when I\'m out away from the house, knowing it\'s not sitting at the house constantly deep cycling the 12V battery every day wastefully as a side effect of that setting.', 'njtwin: Yep, very useless at night.

Was considering upgrading - overall I have been happy with it, but it doesn't start recording until the person is pretty much right at the door - so I get the backside of folks (ie, deliverys and such) most of the time.

I would like to have the Ring camera detect motion and start filming and send  signal to turn on the lights or turn on the switch.  I would ALSO like to have those lights turn off after some appropriate time (e.g. 10 minutes).  I have found online how to turn on the lights using a routine, but can't figure out the best combination that will turn them off.

FYI, I already have a Hue hub (so could use Hue floodlights and skip the switch) AND am fully in the Alexa ecosystem so could use Alexa to help.

Does this combination work?  If so, how would I do it?"	4	"['Wayne8766: Seen as you have Alexa it will be very easy. You can create a routine that detect motion for your cam and then switch on lights, you can then have a wait command of 5/10 minutes whatever you want and then the switch off command.', 'TattooedBillionaire: You could always set PEOPLE ONLY in your motion settings.', ""Jonatheber: I saw a bunch of posts that said the Alexa routine wasn't turning off anymore."", 'Wayne8766: Not sure what this posts referred to but I use quite a few routines to switch off lights.

After a bit of research and 30 minutes on the phone to the Ring helpline I've learned a bit about how these work.  We're certain that the 'Indoor Cam' listed on [ring.com](https://ring.com) is the exact one (there were multiple) but it was black not white.

I have a bunch of questions and would be extremely grateful if anyone who owns one could answer.

1. When viewing live from a phone app - does it light up red? It was a dark room, and from a lower angle could this be the infra-red that was turned on? This is not the small red dot that is always visible.
2. The microphone came on and breathing was heard - is this a toggle option or always on when viewing live?
3. Could the camera be absolutely anything to do with a CO detector?
4. Could the microphone come on WITHOUT the camera being viewed?
5. Are the cameras visible when searching for wi-fi networks? Could they be renamed or hidden?
6. How is the data stored? On the app or could it be downloaded or stored on a 3rd party cloud etc
7. In a dark room - assuming perhaps it wasn't infra-red, what would visibility have been like?
8. Are the cameras always recording regardless of a ring light being visible? Do they only record on motion? If it was light in the room would the red light not come on at all as it records passively without being viewed live?

&#x200B;

I find I spend most of my time with one or more elements of the Ring family malfunctioning. My floodlight cam started exhibiting the symptom where the lights don't turn on but rather go into a strobe effect, so I had to turn the lights off. The camera still works but interprets bugs as motion but doesn't notice cars pulling into my driveway. The doorbell has been through several types of errors but the current one is where it does not always recognize motion, and when someone rings the bell I may or may not be able to talk to them. When I am able to talk to them, I am not understandable to the visitor. When I test at home, the audio is fine.

I got the chime because despite 3 different little boxes inside my existing doorbell chime, we couldn't get it to ring reliably. But now the chime doesn't work at all. The only way we know someone is at the door is if we happen to notice their shadow in the window.

I've done all the rebooting, resetting, setting motion zones and sensitivity, and anything else Ring asks me to do. I've spent several hours with them over the phone over the years. I may or may not be able to get it to work for a while, but eventually I'm back to a $200 floodlight cam with no floodlights, a doorbell with no audio, and a chime that is perfectly silent regardless of what's happening.

It can even see out my driver's and passenger side windows.

As for the people having problems with the cameras staying on all night long. Mine stays on all night long just fine so maybe it's a problem with your ODB port only producing power for a period of time after the car is shut off. Who knows? I have a 2021 Land Rover Discovery sport and mine stays on all the time even when the car is off. The longest period of time I've had the car off since I've had the camera with the power staying on has been 16 hours before I needed to use the car again so it will most likely last much longer.

Also, as for the vibration notifications for when your car is parked I had my car turned off and bumped the car and I got a notice on my phone just fine.

I even had a voice conversation with my wife at home through the camera while I was driving and she was able to track my location and see both camera views in real time.

Your cost for this won\'t increase your rates much at all but you will get a lot more coverage. You can leave your COLL at whatever you have it at (But I do recommend asking what it would cost to lower that deductible as well for better coverage). Ask if your insurance policy requires separate glass coverage or if thats rolled into the COMP and COLL deductible. \n\n2a) After a month, make a COMP claim for your windshield. Since your deductible is $100, thats all you owe for new glass. Here is a fun fact... Flying objects or bouncing objects on the road are considered to be ""unpredictable"" in the view of insurance so anything that is bouncing or flying that strikes your car is consider to be not your fault since it would be impossible for you to avoid it. Thats where your COMP insurance comes in... it pays to fix it and your rates stay the same. HOWEVER, if you hit a pot hole, tree, building, parked car, etc... those are considered things you can avoid since its not like a building popped out in front of you.

I think the answer is yes but just want to make sure before I purchase 2 of the Ring Floodlights. I'm looking at the hard wired versions, one for my driveway and one for the garden. I understand the light is activated by motion which is fine, however I was looking for a way to also hardwire a physical switch inside the house, which seems a bit tricky with these as turning the switch off means having to reconnect the device back on the wifi.  


Lets say its nighttime and I want to switch on the garden spotlight, can i ask Alexa to 'switch on garden light'? (Rather then having a physical switch to turn the light on). If so, how long is that light turned on for? Duration of time or do I then have to say 'Alexa turn off garden light'?

Mine is arriving today and based on real world experiences, I‚Äôm not quite convinced of the implementation. 

So.. as it turns out, there‚Äôs a 2GB limit on the go sub that appeared out of nowhere. If someone with a Car Cam gets into an accident, is that footage unavailable at the scene unless 1) you‚Äôre a go subscriber and 2) haven‚Äôt gone over 2GB? My current dashcam creates a WiFi hotspot that my phone connects to that enables me to download clips directly from the camera‚Äôs SD card. 

In emergencies, is it easy to switch your car cam to you‚Äôre phones hotspot, for example, to get footage off of it in emergencies.. for example, for accidents/break ins? I know that Ring cameras in general are a pain to switch networks for security reasons.

Also, I know this will probably be a hot topic since there‚Äôs 2 schools of thought on this, but being the cam has GPS is there no way to show your speed/coordinates embedded in the video?

Thanks all.. mines on a FedEx truck to be delivered (maybe) today.. since i know how reliable FedEx is.

We are moving into a new home in the next 3 months and I am thinking of purchasing a new alarm system. We are currently with Rogers and have Smart Home Monitoring. For our move we would need to purchase another 9 door sensors which are $49.99 each ($450 total) and will be paying $24.99/month for professional monitoring ($300/year). 

We are considering switching to Ring but am not sure if it will meet our needs. From a financial perspective, Ring is the better decision. Our initial purchase of equipment will cost about $800 but the monthly Protection Plus plan is only $150/year which includes the professional monitor. Wondering if anyone has this service in Canada and what your thoughts are on the points below.

1. How is the quality of the devices? Do you find devices disconnect frequently? How's battery life on door sensors? Do device break or stop working or are they durable?

2. Professional monitoring service quality? Any issues with no/late responses? In you own personal opinion, would you recommend this service or is self monitoring sufficient for you?

3. Rogers offer back-up wireless when wifi cuts out so device continue to work when wifi is down. Does Ring offer anything similar?

4. Does Ring app have automation or rules that can be set? What about different arm setting? E.g. turn off alarm at 7AM, arming in night mode vs away mode vs. stay mode?

5. Is there anything we should be aware of if we decide to purchase a ring alarm system. Any other features/services that you find most useful which are only offered by ring alarm systems? Is there any reason why we shouldn't choose Ring?

6. Ring.com only shows prices for their alarm kits in USD even when changing the location at the bottom to Canada. The protection plan indicates it is in CAD, not sure why it's like that. We are interested in the Alarm Pro 14-piece kit with wifi6 but cannot find this on Amazon or Best Buy. Is there somewhere else where I can find these? Is the wifi6 kit even worth the upgrade or is the 2nd generation kit good enough?

I appreciate any and all feedback."	3	"['Zealousideal-Life-56: 1.  Didn‚Äôt change battery for 3 years. Still going strong.

Any chance you have to get away from them, take it. \n\n1) quality of ring devices is good. Going on a year and all batteries on sensors are still going strong. Haven‚Äôt had any breaks or issues\n\n2) professional monitoring has always been quick. Have only had two false alarms that were our fault and they called immediately. You also have the option to purchase ring-compatible smoke alarms that would connect to fire department instead if those get triggered. So for 12.50 a month, it‚Äôs worth it. Peace of mind, especially when you‚Äôre not close to home.\n\n3) the ring base system has built in battery and cellular backup. This has proven reliable a few times because of shitty Rogers home internet that disconnects more often than it should. Again, peace of mind from Ring. And again, fuck Rogers.\n\n4) ring has fully customizable schedules. We use basic schedules but you can go nuts with these. There is also an option to have it set when you leave/arrive at house based on your phone and location. \n\n5) as mentioned, there are z-wave first alert smoke alarms that pair flawlessly with the system. The $150 annual also covers cloud storage for any ring doorbell or security camera footage, lifetime warranty for products, and 10% off their site. There are also cool things you can do through Alexa, and with other systems that pair with it (like Ecobee). I also like the ring app and have had no issues with it, but I don‚Äôt know what Rogers looks like\n\n6) if you have 3 months, wait for a sale. You can buy it from Amazon.ca or from Rings site, as long as the currency exchange makes sense when on sale. Don‚Äôt buy at regular price from either, there‚Äôs frequent sales. The ring Pro (with wifi 6) doesn‚Äôt ship to canada when I checked a few months ago, but this isn‚Äôt a bad thing. There‚Äôs no major benefit to this from my perspective and I like having my router separate from my home security.']"

For phone use, I've gotten by with this by relying on WiFi Calling, but I'm now faced with the problem of my Ring Alarm Pro having a weak signal (typically 2 bars, occasionally drops to 1).  If my cable ISP goes down, this is fine for alarm notifications, but the 1-2mbps of upload speed is only sufficient for 1 camera to upload reliably, maybe 2.

I see AT&T offers a couple of signal boosters, but those use your home's ISP for connectivity, so would do me no good for helping the RAP in this scenario.  But on Amazon, there are a variety of signal boosters that, at least on the surface, look like they could help.  They consist of a directional antenna (which I could install in the attic, pointing toward the cell tower), along with a booster module and interior antenna that provide a better signal that any phones (or other cellular devices, like the RAP) in the house can connect to.

Does anyone have any experience with these devices, specifically in the context of providing more bandwidth to the RAP?  Are these things legitimate?  Are they legal?  Are they allowed by AT&T?"	0	[]
1676555239.0	16-Feb-2023 05:47:19	Ring Car Cam installation and first day impressions	Algeradd	37	113r09v	Ring	https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/113r09v/ring_car_cam_installation_and_first_day/	"--edit-- Adding bullet points

* Still works on ""incompatible"" cars, but install may be tricky and require extra effort to safely secure wiring.
* Wedging the arm in between windshield and dash is going to be difficult on lots of cars, but the windshield adhesive seems very strong and should make that less of an issue I think.  Time will tell how it holds up to heat cycling.
* Driving recording works well and presents as one event in the Ring app with no interruptions
* Footage is 540p in app, have to download individual 20 second segments to get 1080p.
* Need to test in traffic more, but I don't expect license plates to be easily readable from much distance.
* Interior viewing angle is super wide, can see great outside of side windows as well.
* Camera unit is smaller than I expected and doesn't obstruct visibility at least in trucks and SUVs it seems.
* Motion detection appears broken or horribly unreliable for anything outside of the car.  Interior detection seems fine.
* No accelerometer/not enabled it seems.  Doesn't seem to detect vehicle shaking when parked, so questionable if it would detect a parking lot collision considering flaky motion detection as well.

I want to preface this by saying I'm one who has installed probably a dozen or more dashcams and radar detectors in cars over the years.  I'm perfectly comfortable with any wiring work that needs done, removing trim panels completely for trickier wire routing, etc.  So the Ring Car Cam is not really made for someone like me at all, but still, I wanted to try it as I found the potential simplicity appealing and I thought the $60 per year price for data connectivity/cloud access was a pretty good deal.  It also seemed like a great fit for my girlfriend as she's not tech-savvy at all and would be much more comfortable using something like this over juggling microSD cards and a fiddly app from the BlackVue dashcams I'd usually use.

Actually preordered two Ring Car Cams, one for myself and one for my girlfriend.  Her 2022 Nissan Frontier actually listed as incompatible on Ring's site, but I figured this was more of a safety/ease of install issue than a technical incompatibility.  So one of my preorders was scheduled to arrive yesterday, while the other was stating March 1st.  I figured that gave me plenty of time to test fit in her truck to see if it's going to work and then follow-up with the second preorder or cancel depending on the issues.

Device/app setup was typical Ring fare.  Scan a QR code in the app, connect to an ad-hoc wifi network the camera broadcasts to configure it, get some pages/videos about setup, etc.  One thing it asks is a lot of questions about placement and safety, as in where is your OBD-2 port located, go through this checklist ensuring everything is mounted safely, etc.  They clearly are going hard on the CYA angle with this thing.

The first ""incompatibility"" issue on her Frontier was apparent as soon as you plug it in.  The OBD-2 port is not hard-fixed to the bottom of the dash and instead is just a free-dangling connector held up by the wires right over where the foot-operated parking brake is.  Plug the Car Cam OBD-2 dongle into it and it's immediately sagging down to where it's practically resting on the parking brake pedal.  Ok, that's going to be a major usability problem and I can see why they wouldn't want to claim this vehicle is compatible for the average Ring customer who isn't necessarily savvy at all with installing car hardware.  For me, I'll solve that problem with some zip ties and maybe some 3M extreme double-sided tape most likely.

The second issue we ran into was the gap between her windshield and dash is quite small and wedging the camera's arm in there did not seem like it would go in far enough without potentially excessive force.  I haven't quite decided how I will resolve that yet, but I'm leaning toward possibly modeling a 3D-printed extension shim if you will that sort of fits on the arm like the provided widener (that solves the opposite problem of too much of a gap), but gets thinner as it extends downward.  Will definitely need to use PETG or ABS for something like that as it's going to be exposed to hot sunlight quite often.  I actually had very little time to decide to go through with keeping the second preorder as to my surprise, Amazon informed me that it was being shipped last night and would arrive today.

With my test-fitting of her Frontier complete, I decided to move on to the permanent install in my 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe.  Ring mentions compatibility with the standard GC, so didn't expect any major issues.  The 4xe is somewhat significant because it has a wide LED housing on the middle of the dash near the windshield for charge status LEDs.  There was a slight chance that might've interfered with the placement of the Car Cam's arm, but it seemed like it would probably be fine.

OBD-2 port-wise, the GC was a non-issue.  A hard-mounted OBD-2 port that the Car Cam's dongle could attach to and sit tucked relatively out of the way.  It was also right by the driver's side A pillar trim and thus easy to immediately route any wire slack to some trim panels and tuck it away.  I will say the tightness of trim fittings on part of the GC surprised me and required a fair more work than I expected, especially when the Car Cam's power cable isn't seemingly any thicker than other dashcam cords I've dealt with.  It was enough to make me toss aside the included trim/wire tucking tool pretty quickly and go after my own tools which made it much easier.

Once I got up to the center of the windshield and was working on permanent mounting, I noticed the dash/windshield gap on my GC was also pretty tight and I didn't think it would go nearly as far in as the Ring example install video showed.  Still, I got it in decently and after removing the adhesive cover, it's clear that it shouldn't be an issue.  The adhesive is quite strong once it sets and I tugged on it quite a bit after a while and it wouldn't budge.  I imagine it'll take a razorblade to remove in the future.

So with all that installed, it was time to test everything out.  Going for a drive, there was no vibration or movement, so that is good.  I was worried about the visibility impact of something sticking up that far into the windshield, but there's actually no impact at all.  The camera unit is much smaller than I imagined it would be from how it looked in pictures, and in my GC at least, it sits low enough on the windshield that from my normal seating position the only view it obstructs is the top of my hood.  It doesn't reach into my normal field of view at all, so that's a win.  One minor annoyance is due to the angle of my windshield and aligning the camera to get a fairly level shot, there's a small bit of the camera arm in the frame, maybe in the lower 10% of the frame.  Still, it's garbage space in the frame anyway that would otherwise just be showing your hood and dashboard.

So I did some drives around the neighborhood to get some test footage and to play around with the app and see how interacting with footage was.  One thing you immediately notice on driving footage is that there's a little SD card icon in the corner, that's just an icon to warn you that this footage is stored locally on the camera and not on Ring's servers.  There are a couple caveats with how you interact with footage because of that.  For one, any normal viewing of footage in the app is only 540p, and it shows.  It's pretty low quality and has a lot of compression artifacts, but for quick skimming to find a specific time location, it's fine.  To actually play a 1080p version of the video, you have to choose to download that video.  The annoyance there is that the Ring app only allows you to download 20 second segments at a time.  So you're not saving copies of entire drives with this thing unless you have a lot of free time to do a lot of downloads and stitching.  However, most actual important events you'd want to save probably are less than 20 seconds in total anyway, so for actual practical use, it's not a huge deal I don't think.  Still I'd love to see that increased to maybe at least a minute if possible.

The other thing I'm not sure about is motion detection when parked.  It seemed quite flaky and unreliable and not at all what I'd typically expect out of Ring.  The interior view camera can clearly see not just the interior, but a good portion outside of the front windows as well.  So for tests, I turned off the ""Interior Motion Verification"" setting that is intended to only trigger motion events on interior things and not exterior.  It warns that with this setting on, you likely won't capture parking lot bumps/crashes, so I see no reason to ever have this setting on.  Still, I went out in my garage and waved my hands violently outside the driver and passenger side windows in addition to in front of the camera and could never get motion events to trigger, both with my garage lights off and on.  I even shook the vehicle from the top fairly hard and nothing triggered.  It seems there's no accelerometer in this thing like most dashcams would have for motion/event detection when parked.  If there is, it's definitely not doing anything.  In theory that would be fine if the image-based motion detection was OK, but it doesn't seem to be doing much at all.  Occasionally I'd get it to finally pick up something and start recording, but it seemed very random and it missed a ton of things.  This was with the sensitivity set to Max and the frequency set to Frequently.  This clearly seems like a software issue more than anything, so in theory it should be able to be fixed down the road.  I also haven't given it any real-world tests out in parking lots or anything yet, so who knows.  Still, I don't quite trust it for that yet.  I'd be more inclined for now to trigger the traffic stop mode for 20 minutes while I run into a store than to rely on the flaky motion detection.

So in summary, I think it's decent enough that I'm going to keep it and keep trying it out and hope for some software improvements on the motion detection side.  At home it's parked in a garage, so I didn't buy it for home security anyway, but I would like a bit more piece of mind that it's going to detect something in a parking lot.  Time will tell on if that improves I think.  The second unit is supposed to show up today and I will get to work on a proper safe and clean install for the girlfriend's Frontier because she is very excited to have not just a dashcam, but one she can easily share footage with me from and vice versa since it's basically just like an extension of our home cameras.

I‚Äôm struggling on the decision of whether I should utilize the remaining five zones for existing hardwired glass break sensors, keeping the legacy alarm panel in place just as a power supply/battery backup.

Regardless, I‚Äôm still going to have at least a few Ring glass breaks (for non-hardwired areas). Just trying to decide if I should remove all the legacy stuff and go ‚Äúall-Ring‚Äù for these sensors, or make use of what‚Äôs there. It appeals to me to have fewer batteries to replace, as well as having a more discrete look (current glass breaks are small and are recessed-mounted). I just happen to have five of them, which since that‚Äôs the number of open spots I have on the Retrofit kit, feels like maybe it was meant to be.

However, I‚Äôd also appreciate getting rid of the big alarm panel in the closet, and using the Ring sensors would feel less ‚Äúhacked together‚Äù than the somewhat makeshift arrangement of hardwired glass breaks set up as window contact sensors through the Retrofit kit (it just ‚Äúfeels‚Äù like this would be more prone to glitch-prompted false alarms than sticking with Ring sensors).

Those who have hardwired glass breaks set up through the Retrofit, how has this worked out for you?"	0	[]

&#x200B;

**Huge thanks in advance to anyone that answers some questions for me.**

&#x200B;

Does the floodlight camera with solar panel connect with the app, and can it alert me when there is movement in my driveway well and accurately? 

How quick/accurate is the app when notifying of movement?

&#x200B;

Do the window sensors connect to the app or do I need to purchase the alarm system? If so:

can view battery life, get notified when windows get opened, do they work on doors, and activate/deactivate them within the app?

&#x200B;

Are the battery packs for the spotlight pro easily chargeable/replaceable and what is the expected battery life? 

&#x200B;

Do you have any recommendations for doorbells, I am looking for one where the battery won't need to be replaced. 

&#x200B;

Did anyone get the floodlight system or any of the ring products professionally installed, if so what was the estimated price range? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lastly, does anyone have any positive or negative notes about ring"	8	"['Wayne8766: The floodlight can is wired, there isn‚Äôt a battery version, did you mean a different device?\n\nI get alerts within 1-2 seconds normally, as for accuracy it all depends on how it‚Äôs setup. The ‚Äúperson‚Äù detection is ok, it can be tricked as they aren‚Äôt looking for a person shape per say, they are just looking for a large enough heat or pixel shift (battery devices use PIR and wired use pixel based, although in low light and nighttime wired devices jump to PIR). \n\nWindow/door and motion sensors all connect to the alarm, they use zwave as opposed to WiFi so that why you need the base station, it‚Äôs the brains behind the alarm. You can see the battery level in the app and also get open/closed alerts if you want. \n\nThe activate and deactivate them part is bit tricky, you have 3 modes for the alarm, disarmed, home and away. By default on home all door and window sensors are on and away all sensors Inc motion are on or armed. You can choose per sensor if you want it seemed and in what mode. The open & closed smarts are separate from that. \n\nBattery packs are very easy to charge and replace, I suppose it all depends on where you locate them. You want them high enough so someone cannot just walk up and touch it but you don‚Äôt want it 25 ft in the air as it hard to change batteries and the you will loose a lot of detail that high up, they recommend 9ft. \n\nIf you have power going to your doorbell get a wired, I have the cheapest wired 2021 and it‚Äôs great. The wired devices perform better for motion as there aren‚Äôt power save settings to try and save in battery. \n\nIf you want 24/7 or are worried about the fact WiFi cams (not just rings but anyone‚Äôs) can technically blocked with a WiFi jammer look at a different system.

I'm getting ready to hopefully swap it out myself with a new Ring Pro 2 I just bought. Yesterday I tried turning off 2 breaker locations I thought the doorbell might be on. The first one is to an outlet outside and the second is to the porch light (also my living room lights). Here are some questions:

1. Does the Ring Gen 1 Doorbell's battery allow it to work even if the breaker is off? 
2. I got a Multimeter coming from Amazon tomorrow. If I'm not sure the breaker is actually off, it's fine for me to unscrew the security lock one and use that to touch the connections to see if it's off right? I'd just touch the wires together, not sure if that'd work or I need to unscrew them to fully test it.

Is there a way to set only visual alerts on the echo shows for motion and person detections?	1	['Wayne8766: I‚Äôm not 100% if you can do it fully, but if you used a routine instead of the built in ring announcements, at the very least you may just get an OK depending on the type you setup. \n\nFor instance to display the video feed I tube it will still say OK, the same as if you ask to display the video feed now, for example. If you just wanted a text display, for example, then it will just display text.\n\nIf you did want a video display if there was a person detected from example, the first action could be set volume to 0, display video it wouldn‚Äôt say okay you would have a wait of 5 to 10 seconds maybe and then turn the volume up if you wanted to hear the volume']

I have a NuTone doorbell that appears to be the first one my house ever had, but it didn‚Äôt work on the old school doorbell buttons and clearly isn‚Äôt working with the video doorbell attached.

Given the original wiring goes deep through my floors and the actual original doorbell transformer is in an almost completely inaccessible location, it‚Äôs been basically impossible to troubleshoot and I want to just redo the wiring.

Do they make just plug-in transformers that operate as a pass-thru to the doorbell? All I‚Äôve seen on Amazon so far appears to just be plug ins to power the video bell unit itself, rather than bridge to a mechanical chime."	1	['Wayne8766: Firstly they do operate differently, 2 different companies with 2 different apps and software.

When you press a doorbell that‚Äôs connected to a chime you are completing a circuit, the power is briefly passed to the chime to ring.']

When the lights come on it goes back to normal but as soon as they turn off it goes to night vision again. All my pics/vids are greyed out now. 

I‚Äôve reset the camera, updated, and scoured ring and Reddit for the issue and how to fix. Of course ring had absolutely no documention or support for fixing this issue. A simple reset should fix this but it‚Äôs Ring; I guess they just want me to buy their new model..

Anyone here know how to fix this issue?

PS Ring do better, this is ridiculous."	2	['Wayne8766: Give it a slap, technical term is ‚Äúpercussive maintenance‚Äù.', 'anon_swe: Womp that did not work actually. \n\nFunny enough it randomly fixed itself for a couple days before the battery died and then after replacing the battery the issue came back now and has been that way for 1+ week.

* [Home from the 1930's. New Ring Pro 2 only getting 5v but I cannot find a transformer anywhere...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/10x42t4/home_from_the_1930s_new_ring_pro_2_only_getting/)

I have searched every square inch of our 1000 sq ft house - either we do not have a transformer, or if we do it is under the house where there is no crawl space (under the small bedroom, where the mechanical chime box is). I can see the space from an opening in the cellar, but not even a small child could fit under there.

Here's (bad) drawing/diagram of my home:

                5v cable
            ^>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>v    (This is the attic)
            ^                v

                             power cable seems to

                                Transformer must be here, but I cannot find it / it is                 
                             inaccessible 

[I read here that the Ring Pro 2 cannot use a battery](https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review) \- is that true? If so, what else can I do here?

Is it possible to wire the transformer in here?

1676039129.0	10-Feb-2023 06:25:29	Is there a discount for the annual Ring Protect Pro with central monitoring - ie, military/veterans, teacher, healthcare, etc? It‚Äôs $200 annually so looking for a discount annually. Does it save much on insurance?	samsam2019	2	10ytaj9	Ring	https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/10ytaj9/is_there_a_discount_for_the_annual_ring_protect/		4	"['Murphdog223: So far just a 20% discount on devices.  The insurance savings is going to vary. It saves me $10 year on insurance. Still a value with the alarm and unlimited cameras compared to the competition I have seen. I wish they would still offer the $100YR plan. Some of us have no need for the Eero integration and the wireless data.', 'None: I saved 29.95 with USAA homeowners, ha!  The discount is not offered on the pro monitoring, only devices.', ""blaine_the_train19: You'll have to check with your insurance company if they offer home monitoring discount.

I only could find the faceplate at home, and I don't know where the rest of the parts are. Thanks.	0	[]
