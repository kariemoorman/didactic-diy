https://www.homedepot.com/p/Master-Flow-1500-CFM-Shingle-Match-Weathered-Wood-Power-Roof-Mount-Attic-Fan-ERV6SMWW/205924959 

I originally had a Kasa HS110 installed and working without issue for a month or so. I then wanted to use the plug for another use and installed an IKEA Tradfri plug. This plug seemed to kill itself and the fan motor within the first few uses ( can’t recall the amount of time but it was quick). 

I finally replaced the fan motor and want to get another smart plug installed but am being a lot more cautious. 

I would prefer to not use the Kasa since it’s Wi-Fi and hit and miss when comes to home assistant compatibility due to firmware versions. 

Does anyone have a suggestion instead of that model and brand? I am open to WiFi, zigbee or z-wave.

I'm new to home automation, and I'm looking to set up a few simple smart light automations in my flat. I did some initial research, but I am a bit overwhelmed by which ecosystem and specific products to choose. I'm leaning towards setting this up with ZigBee products.

I would be grateful for recommendations of products available in the UK that could fit my needs. I'm also open to suggestions for changing my preferred setup or protocol if there is a better way!

Here is what I'm hoping to do:

**Walk-in wardrobe** \- Bayonet light bulb, white. Triggered by a single door opening/closing sensor.

**Storage room** \- Bayonet light bulb, white. Triggered by two door opening/closing sensors, one for each door. Lights up if either door is open.

**Hallway** \- 3 x GU10 lights, white. Triggered by 2 motion/light sensors, one at each end of the hallway (or one exceptionally sensitive sensor, 5+ meters). Triggers if it is dark and senses motion. If sensing motion and light at the same time is an issue, a timed routine could be used instead.

**Bedroom** \- E27 light bulb, colour, dimmable. Three modes/routines.  
The first (morning) mode switches the light at a specific time, slowly increasing the intensity, and stays on until the next mode. Can also be switched on/off with a portable button.  
The second (daytime) mode triggers the light with a motion/light sensor during the day (or just motion if it can't be done). Can also be switched on/off with a portable button.  
The third (nighttime) mode switches on/off dimmed/easy on the eyes reddish light with a portable button.

I suspect some kind of App and Hub would be required as well.

Some hikvision nvrs can be accessed via URL which might work with homeseer\'s IP camera features.\n\nSome devices, like Ecobee, only have cloud APIs.

Some security systems have ""ip communicators"" (ethernet cards with some extra firmware) so you might be able to link to the panel directly.\n\nIf you look at the wiki you can see a list of different hubs.

I'm probably being super dense,

and I'm getting some odd results, basically the manual swicthes work perfectly, but when it comes to the smart switch on app, whichever switch I switch on the app/alexa BOTH light switch on and off....  
(they should switch independently)    


Note this is a UK property  


I have two separate lights hence the use of a 2CH switch  
so you can see from back box I have   
1/ Live, Neutral and Earth  - for light 1  
\+  
2/ Live, Neutral and Earth - for light 2   


I have connected both the RED LIVES into L  
and the BLACK NEUTRALS into L1 and L2  


then the standard 2 ch manual switch connceted up as seen in the pic  


The manual switches work perfectly BUT when I use the app to switch lights on/off  
it doesn't matter if I'm switching light 1 or 2 , BOTH light gets switched on or off, which is annoying!  


I'm thinking I've either wired this up wrong \*(most likely OR this thing only works on a constant LIVE circuit or something....which I don't have... I think!?)  


any help much appreciated!

I am looking for a recommendation for a normally closed (NC) contactor that I can use to automate a power disconnect for my well pump. The intent is to use leak detectors that will send signals to a lower power relay, which actuates the coil on the contactor and breaks the circuit to the pump.

The issue I am running into is that most NC contactors seem to have much lower current ratings than NO ones (see the highlighted spec for the attached Schneider coil). I would like to use an NC contactor so that the coil doesn't need to remain energized 24/7 just for the pump to run, but if the running amperage of the pump (\~6-7A) welds the contactor shut then it won't perform it's intended function either.

Would appreciate any insight from folks that have done this before.

Thanks!

A little bit more background... I have the Anthem controller (listed above) and a hard wired controller (required), a remote control on/off button, and the app on my phone.  The system works great.   The finish on our remodeled bathroom looks very refined, and the controller definitely adds the right touch.   Overall, beautiful system.   Definitely hard to justify the front-end money.   

The problem was that the (iphone) app ""Kohler Konnect"" was not detecting the controller.   The solution was to just go through the **wired controller** and ""add to app"".  From the app adding a new device put it in search mode, and it replaced the original entry.   All setting came forward through this process.

1678377905.0,09-Mar-2023 08:05:05,Question for installers/vendors - is this cable management acceptable?,rockloverthegirl,455,11mvzng,homeautomation,https://i.imgur.com/Nx3C4pA.jpg,"When we purchased our home, we replaced the old home automation wired in the house with URC. They essentially had to rewire everything, and much of the equipment in our media closet was no longer needed. They removed the old equipment but left lots of old cabling. And there is absolutely no cable management in here at all. I couldn't begin to tell you what comes from where. There are daisy chained surge protectors, and the switch for all of our wired connections is just floating in there not mounted or set on anything. 

Is this acceptable? I complained to our vendor and they basically didn't care and said pay our hourly rates to do something about it. Why didn't they do it properly to begin with? Like I understand that it would take more time, but why would they ever do it this way to start? Maybe I'm naive, but this just strikes me as absurd.

EDIT TO RESPOND: 
Thank you all for the responses. I figured this wasn't acceptable or at least not something an installer with integrity would do. My area claims to have only 2 URC verified installers. Are installers sometimes not verified through URC? Or do you think I really only have one other option for cleanup and work moving forward?

EDIT 2 RESPONDING: 
I wanted to clarify that the cable management definitely wasn't great beforehand. My question was more around when doing a complete replacement what is the standard for cleaning everything up. I've learned a lesson in ensuring better language on our agreement, but also am taking away that this vendor should have broached the subject first based on responses I'm seeing. I would have paid had I known that wasn't immediately included. And they should have at least cleanly installed the new cables and equipment. 

For those interested in the cable management situation before though, it wasn't good but at least there was some before they removed it. Link below shows how the previous home automation cabling was managed and the mounts for the previous switches. I don't have any before pictures but I did find a video. It appears that all the white, yellow, and green cables in the top wall inlet are new. There are tons of cables at the bottom that likely no one knows what they do. They probably predate even the previous home automation.

I believe HA will be the route I go, based on reading, but I do have two quick questions:

\- Switches. For smart switches, are they similar to mechanical switches? I have two young kids, and I've seen SOME setups where a smart bulb is used, but the switch is a normal switch and flicking it - well, it shuts off the light completed. Are smart switches different so they can be toggled physically and also through whatever smart setup is being used?

\- Range. I've seen many references to USB dongles for z-wave / zigbee being plugged into whatever automation hub is installed. I'm curious what the range of these devices are? My wifi is a Unifi setup, with 3 x wifi6 APs (I have 3 floors in my house). Just curious how much of a factor range will be.

Sorry if these are silly questions. I don't have any smart switches, so haven't been able to play with them and learn.

Thanks.",11,"['cornellrwilliams: Yes smart switches can be turned on and off from the switch as well as from an app. Some switches also have a smart bulb mode where the bulb is wired to always have power then the switch controls the bulb remotely.\n\nZ-Wave uses a different frequency then Wi-Fi. So its range is will not be affected by your wifi network and vice versa.', 'kigmatzomat: Zwave and zigbee are meshes. Battery powered devices (and bulbs) are end points, things with 110v/220v power act as relays. \n\nSo range is per-hop.

Pair regular, dimmable led's with smart switches. Smart bulbs are the only option when you want color or color temperature, but they add complexity and latency. I use a mixture of both options.\n\nAlso, another option to consider is relays. A relay is a small z-wave device that is tucked into the electrical box and wired into a regular dumb switch. They may or may not offer all the features you are looking for in your use case, but they are often cheaper than smart switches, and preserve the tactile feedback of using a mechanical switch, which you might miss after switching."", 'Original-Rooster9777: \n\nSmart switches are different from mechanical switches in that they can both be toggled physically and through a smart setup like a dimmer switch.

Wifi would be nice to have, but as I'll need to provide power, POE can be used as well.

The must-have is integrated web server so I can just forward the ports on the router to the cam so it's publicly visible (with or without authentication). This could be done differently, but for the sake of simplicity, I believe it's the easiest way.

I'm hoping to replace a regular thermostat with something that I could control via Google assistant.

1 a smart thermostat I could replace this with. I am slightly concerned that the boiler is ancient, hence unsure which TS would work.

2 we also have regular uk radiators, and I wanted to replace the valves with smart ones that would allow me to control temperature per room:

3 a combination of both?

I'm in the process/testing of moving from Smartthings to Home Assistant.  I used a VM (Vmware Workstation) and the Zooz 800 series Z-wave still (USB Passthrough) and things are working good in terms of adding Z-wave devices so far.

I have a three Schlage BE469 that I use for all my door entries  (which I have not added yet because I want to add them last away from ST) and I heard a lot of hiccups and difficulties adding this to HA.

One of them is to make sure I have the stick ""taped"" or really close to the lock at the moment of adding -- which I can manage.

The other one is to make sure there is a close by (like 5-feet) Zwave device that will serve as a repeater to make the lock more stable.

The closest to this lock is a light switch so I'm deciding to buy a Zwave light switch as a repeater.

I saw the Zooz ZEN71 which seems to be an older model of the ZEN76 which indicates S2 authentication.

The Schlage BE469 is definitely very old and I believe uses S0 or some legacy connection/authentication.

I'm wondering if I should buy the newer one (Zen76) to help with the schlage lock or should I stick with the older one Zen71 for better compatibility to the lock.

Is the Zen76 a better buy as a repeater for newer and very old Zwave devices?

The difference is like $1 from the older one.

I also verified the age by look at the firmware changelog.\n\nThe only difference I noticed between the two devices were not Z-Wave related. The Zen76 has a max resistive load of 8 amps while the Zen71 has a max resistive load of 15 amps.\n\nAlso Zooz is releasing new long range devices.

Very new into the whole home automation community. Started off lightly by purchasing the Ikea Dirigera gateway and some bulbs. Now, we just had our kitchen renovated, and among other things we installed some LED strips over the countertop. These were however from a third party, all I received was the strip, some connector and a dimmable driver.

After some researching I realized that I needed to install some dimming controller to be able to actually dim it, and ideally one with zigbee protocol so I can connect it to my Ikea system.

Ordered [this one](https://www.amazon.se/LIGHTEU®-Zigbee3-0-LED-remskontroll-kompatibel-röststyrning/dp/B09F6Y7KKQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=196IGY5NSVQDM&keywords=zigbee+dimmer&qid=1678282496&sprefix=zigbee+dimmer%2Caps%2C120&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1&language=en_GB) and installed it between the driver and LED strip. So far, so good. It came on and I was able to pair it on my first try (which is rarely the case for me) but now to my main problem.

Whenever I turn the LED strip off through the IKEA app (it's the only way except for pulling the wall plug), **the dimmer turns itself and LED strip back on again immediately after!**

I'm almost certain that I'm doing something wrong here, so any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated! You can see my setup below, in case there might be some compatibility issues:

I’ve found it rare to find an RGB strip to meet my expectations and nothing addressable came close when it came to white reproduction. Look for a dual white LED strip with a CRI value of 90+ and a decent lumen value (eg 2500lm/m).\n\nRGB and addressable lights are great for a party or holiday lighting, but for a comfortable supplemental light the priority is the white channels and getting a good colour balance. If you want to add accents, it’s usually best to just run two strips for the full range (eg 1xRGB strip and 1x warm white - cool white strip).

Often the best LED companies don’t have the best controllers. It also gives you a much greater chance of finding a controller compatible with your system.\n\nAnother thing to note is most 24v LED manufacturers recommend runs of ~4m(16’) so if you need a longer run you will need to inject power from both ends.\n\nHave you considered where to put your power supplies? Having these separated from the strip will help a lot with hiding wires.

Each wifi client, once linked to an AP, will generally try to stay connected to that AP until the signal drops off to a very low level, even if the same SSID is available from another AP with a much stronger signal. (Example: You walk in the front door and your phone associates with the AP near the door. But you walk to the back of the house, where there\'s another AP, and your phone is getting bad performance because it\'s still using the first AP it connected to.\n\nCellular phones have a very sophisticated handoff mechanism; as you walk or drive around with your phone, it may be in contact with half a dozen cell towers, and each of them is measuring the signal strength, and send commands to your phone to switch to the tower it predicts you\'ll get the best service from.\n\nConsumer-grade wifi AP\'s don\'t have any mechanism like this.\n\nCorporate-grade wifi systems try - with limited success - to employ various tricks (see IEEE 802.11k or 802.11r if you want to nerd out) but there is little standardization; I\'ve built systems that will do well with a few models of phones or laptops with specific wifi chipsets, but it sucks compared to cellular networks).\n\nProblem #2: your network switch may have a feature (spanning-tree) that is designed to protect against network loops. It it sees the address of your wifi device move from port 1 to port 2, it may react in a number of different ways, few of which will make your network feel stable.\n\nProblem #3: if you\'re using 2.4 ghz at all, your two AP\'s are almost certainly overlapping on certain frequencies; there are only 11(iirc) channels available in the 2.4 band, and speed-improving systems like 802.11n will make your device use six of those channels at the same time. Basically, think of two TV stations broadcasting on the same channel. You may be able to manually configure one AP to use the lower channels and the other AP to use the higher channels, and it may help a little... unless you have neighbors with wifi too.\n\nif you\'re using 5ghz, you\'re in much better shape. There are a lot more channels available which don\'t overlap. If you can, make your 2.4 and 5ghz SSID\'s different, and as much as possible, only use the 5ghz ssid unless the device or distance prevents that.\n\nThe best recommendation I can give you is to at least move the two AP\'s as far away from each other as you can; if they have a feature to ""detect congestion"", you can try to have them use channels that your neighbors aren\'t.\n\nEven a fairly basic AP can handle 40-50 devices with no problem at all - provided it\'s in an environment where there are no other wifi networks in use, which is pretty rare these days.\n\nJust curious; if you open up your phone and look for other wifi networks, how many do you see?', 'AVGuy42: Lutron publishes their API.

Wifi is one ""media"" shared by all wifi devices, while each ethernet cable is a dedicated ""media"" for that device with no interference (until the router itself is overwhelmed).\n\nSo if you have 100Mb ethernet cables hooked up to a honking big router, you can push 100Mb down each cable.  5 cables?  100Mb x 5=500Mb.  20 cables?  100Mb x20 = 2Gb\n\nWifi is like an old-fashioned party line, where lots of people have a single connection and can all talk.  They use time-slicing and collision avoidance to prevent that.   However the net result is that a 108Mb wifi connection can provide as little as 10Mb when there are dozens of connected non-idle devices that are a mix of low and high-speed devices.  (Low-speed devices, like most IoT stuff, use a large time slice with low throughput)\n\nModern wifi adds things like beam forming antennas to try and have multiple directional ""media"" where the ""west"" beam is separate from the ""east"" beam.\n\nHowever wifi channels have external interference from other wifi networks (aka neighbors).  Which means those beams are essentially megaphones that blast directional signals at your neighbors.

It’s exposed to the elements, no top cover and bounded on both sides by my wall and my neighbor’s wall. 

I currently have a lift master residential garage door motor (3850 model) that’s about 12 years old. It’s enclosed by sheet metal on all sides except for the bottom. I live in SF where it gets foggy/rainy regularly, and the other day my door stopped working. The repair guy came out and said the board in the motor is dead and needs to be replaced. I could either replace the board only and hope my motor works for a few more years or install a new motor. But either way because the entire motor unit is exposed to the elements he would not be able to guarantee any warranty since the unit is not designed to be exposed as it is. He said the newer models of the lift master also have more electronic components which would be more at risk of malfunction if exposed.

- A single wireless room thermostat connecting to a receiver below the boiler.
- A hot water cylinder with a thermostat on it (it has an immersion heater but it is never switched on).
- A seven-day programmer that allows for timing of heating and hot water.

I have a bunch of temperature sensors that communicate with HomeAssistant over MQTT, and I would like to use this temperature data to control the heating, as well as to be able to control the heating and hot water remotely.

TL,DR; I want to replace the programmer in the image with a relay board that I can stick an ESP onto for MQTT control.

I had heard good things, a few friends are big UBNT advocates, so I decided to give it a try with the UDM Pro and an Enterprise 48 PoE, along with about three U6 APs.\n\nSo far so good, we don\'t do any camera work right now, and when we do, I\'m at least going to a UNVR, maybe the Pro, depending on the retention I want and what I can afford (as well as availability at the time of purchase, the UNVR Pro seems to be a bit of a unicorn, even now).\n\nI set it up for my brother, because I wanted something that was relatively good, easy to administrate, and just nerdy enough to keep my interest while I worked on it.  It has been a bit of a nightmare.\n\nMy most significant issue is with the L3 routing they\'re advertising on the enterprise/pro line of switches.  I\'ve told the story in detail on reddit and other places (including the official support forum) and I\'ve even put in a change request to have an option added to the UI to make it easier to manage, but so far no official response from UBNT, either on the forums, reddit, nor to my ticket.\n\nThe short version is, I wanted to add a segment to the LAN which was routed by something that wasn\'t UBNT.  So I set up L3 switching for the capacity, and connected a 10G SFP+ to another device, tried to do a /30 between the switch and the new device on a dedicated VLAN, but it wouldn\'t route.  I came to realize that the UDM controller software ""autoconfigures"" the routing on VLAN 4040, and will not change it; using subnet 10.255.253.0/24, which also cannot be changed.  The UDM is at 10.255.253.1 on the VLAN, which also, you guessed it, cannot be changed.  Every other UBNT device participating in L3 is then given an incremental IP on that same VLAN/subnet, again, which cannot be changed. It also doesn\'t support any routing protocol (like OSPF, EIGRP, or even RIP), which cannot be changed.\n\nThat\'s inconvenient, but okay, I get it, the sacrifice is for the simplicity of the product, no problem. I can adapt.  Until......\n\nI got everything working eventually, put my device on a vlan 4040 access port, gave it an IP on the 10.255.253.0/24 network (what a waste of IPs), and got it programmed.  LAN subnet IP to 10.255.253.2, everything else to 10.255.253.1, and added my device\'s IP to the route list in the UDM, for the other subnet, cool. \n Except it wasn\'t.  I got a weird asymmetrical routing issue that was messing up some traffic, both others flowed without any issues.  I couldn\'t make heads or tails of it, until I looked at the config.\n\nBy default, any L3 devices that are not the UDM, get only ONE ROUTE; the default route.  So the traffic had to make a round-trip, from the switch, to the UDM, back to the new equipment, for no good reason, anytime a packet flowed from the L3 net in the switch, out to the net on the new segment.  I managed to get into the cli configuration mode of the switch and added an ""ip route <newnet> <netmask> <newsegment router IP>"" to the config - basic destination, next-hop type command line config; and everything started working.  Now the issue is that if the config gets updated, or the switch reboots or something (feels like even if I look at it wrong it will do this), the config reverts to whatever the UDM gives it, which doesn\'t include the extra route statement.  Broken again.... back to the command line, I guess.\n\nThis experience is eye-opening. It would be trivial for the UDM to build the config, and take all the routes and package them into the switch config, and send it off.  But it doesn\'t.  Their gear looks great on paper, and if you\'re using it for something REALLY BASIC, then yeah, it\'s great. I\'m not going to beat them down for that.  If you\'re in a fairly simple/flat network with only the UDM and only one ISP connection, then it works really well; dare I say, better than most residential equipment.  As soon as you step outside the UBNT ""comfort zone"", you\'re in the twilight zone, and the only support you get is from the forums, who laugh at you for wanting to do it in a way that makes sense, telling you that everything should be routed by the UDM or something.\n\nI suspect a lot of the crashing issues you may have been having with your UDM Pro is that you did any level of cameras with them.  I will assert that I don\'t believe the processor in the UDM is powerful enough to actually do anything productive when it comes to cameras, only capable of handling a few at most, without cooking itself.  I\'ve heard horror stories like yours whenever cameras are involved, and I\'ve heard success stories about those same people buying a UNVR and having all their problems evaporate rapidly.  Not that the UNVR is without issue, just the use of the NVR features in the UDM is largely an ill advised move.  They put all their eggs into one underpowered basket, and replied with the shocked pikachu meme when it went wrong.  Again, the UNVR isn\'t without it\'s issues, it\'s just not something I\'ve experienced yet, and maybe never will.  I\'m still on the fence if I want to get anything further from UBNT, aside from network line ""unifi"" products to enhance, upgrade, or otherwise augment my brother\'s network, or if I want to see how deep the rabbit hole goes and buy all their products to see how hilariously bad it gets (though, my wallet will probably hate me).\n\ntime will tell.  I don\'t recommend UBNT to anyone who needs anything more than a basic setup, either now, or in the future.  Anyone who is into networking or routing at all, steer clear; you\'ll hate it.

I factory reset it, and it broadcasts a wifi to connect to to setup. 
Once I connected, it automatically added itself to apple home. And there is the setting was the 10 digit setup code!!!!

There should be a notification about X new devices. Go to Settings, Devices, Integrations and ""Add"" integration Wiz for each of the lights you added (you add them by their IP address).\nNext:edit the lights, add them to the area you put them in (you need to create the area in HA as well, just a name though ;))\n\n\nAt this point you have a running Home Assistant setup, with lights in an area and you can control it via your browser or mobile companion app.\n\nNext you can extend by setting up Scenes (pretty much a ""macro"" to set devices/entities to a set state).

Suffice to say, you can start small and go as large as you want.\n\nI would also recommend HA as a starting point if you\'re new to the home automation scene. This is due to its extensibility and compatibility with many systems, such as Hue and Tradfi, as well as with protocols, such as WiFi, Zigbee and Matter (albeit these last 2 need a USB extension stick (such as Conbee) to provide the hardware).\n\nGood luck with the adventure!', ""AnAmbushOfTigers: Do you have any systems currently that you're looking to stay with?

By changing out the switch all,of your lights, fans, etc stay the same.   2nd would be an automated thermostat.   Just my experience.', ""Winter_Victory3771: \n\nI recommend starting with something like a simple light switch, as it's a pretty straightforward project that'll help you learn the basics of home automation. There are many tutorials online and plenty of forums to help answer any questions you may have. You don't even have to buy expensive components, as you can usually get the necessary parts for a few bucks."", 'ChipBeef2354: I always suggest starting small but allow for zero waste. That means using one of the 3 voice assistants as your beginner hub and getting devices that can be moved over to a real hub once you have learned a bit more.  Personally I recommend Alexa and specifically one of their echos with Zigbee built in. The full sized 4th gen is perfect. If you want to save a few bucks go onto woot and look for a refurb one or either generation of the echo plus.\n\nThen it\'s time to pick up some devices. I strongly recommend sticking with Zigbee as they can be easily set up for now on Alexa and can be moved over to a better ecosystem such as Hubitat or Home Assistant later. Brand wise I absolutely LOVE Third Reality. They fully conform to the Zigbee standard where some companies don\'t (looking at you Aqara, Ikea, and Linkind), but even better is they use AAA batteries. It may not seem like a big deal now, but check back in a year and tell me how much you ABSOLUTELY despise cell/button style batteries if you dont heed my advice.\n\nZigbee is a mesh system so make sure you have plenty of repeating devices. Typically anything powered by your mains power is a repeater. The easiest by far are simple plugs. I like one in every room but am aware that it\'s overkill. Pro tip... Use those little oil warming plug in air fresheners if you have nothing to actually plug into the plug. Set up an automation to only work when you\'re home and watch how long they last, it\'s amazing.\n\nBulbs are the last thing I am going to touch on. Most Zigbee bulbs act as repeaters but make dreadful repeaters. As soon as someone flicks the switch or manually turns off the bulb it will drop from your mesh. This leaves not only itself connected from the mesh but also everything that is being repeated from it, including other repeaters. Your mesh goes into emergency mode as it rebuilds itself. This is a freaking nightmare and I recommend not doing that. Alternatively, use a Sengled Zigbee bulb as they do NOT have repeater capabilities. The other option is just go wifi for your bulbs. Kasa makes affordable bulbs that are very flexible for other ecosystems down the line. Think hard about lighting, color bulbs are fun but after some time the novelty wears off and switches with dumb bulbs become more attractive as they typically are more reliable.\n\nDont forget your sensors. Contact and motion sensors are what really turn home automation on. Asking Alexa for everything will get old real quick. A thermostat is also a good place to automate as it can actually save you money down the road.\n\nThat\'s about it, my recommendations are just that. The world is full of interesting devices. My recommendations are based on the thought that you will outgrow Amazon, google, or Homekit\'s limited ""smart"" home capabilities. It allows you to move onto one of the powerful ecosystems later but maintain the assistant for voice control.  Dont worry about Thread and Matter for now. Zigbee isn\'t going anywhere. The promises of the CSA (matter governance group) have already been broken about interoperability. It is nothing more than a fresh cash grab.', 'amiibohunter2015: Thank you for the thorough answer!

Depends a bit on how long the outrage was for. \n\nMany reasons it can happen. Worst in my case was complete router failure, so have since gone a bit overboard and gone Unifi,which backs up configurations to their cloud service.\n\nBut you might have noticed with some integrations, like the mentioned Wiz lights, is that you add them by IP. So, if in a room bulb 1 and 2 were to switch IP, it might not matter much. However with a new address they need to be added again (and to scenes / Automations, etc).\n\nA good practice then is to also back up your IP tables (MAC Address plus IP address combination) in case you have a router failure or an outage without static IPs.\n\nTo be fair about the above, this is due to experiencing the failures, not debugging the code of HA.', ""Gravitom: Do you have a preference to Apple or Google ecosystems?\n\nWhat's your budget?

We are undecided how the lights should be wired best in order to prepare lights automation and be future-proof. So far we have 2 main ideas, each with pros/cons, I was hoping you could share your thoughts on the ideas or maybe provide a better alternative.

&#x200B;

**Alternative 1:**

Classic wiring: Live and neutral to wall switch where Live wire is switched and passed on to the ceiling light.

Pros:

* Classic approach
* Switches removes power -> Safety
* Smart bulbs can be used by not switching Live in the wall, Live/neutral can provide current for a wireless switch plate.

Cons:

* If 2 lights are on the same switch, they cannot be toggled separately
* Smart bulbs cannot be turned on by app when switch is off

Possible extension:

* Add RJ45 for PoE in the wall, maybe there will be PoE-powered switches in the future. This would resolve the problem of having too many wireless devices (see wifi congestion)

&#x200B;

**Alternative 2**

Individual lights are wired directly to the junction box in the garage, a relay (machanical/SSR) box, controlled by wired ethernet switches live wire to the lights. Wall switches don't do any switching, they just communicate to the home automation hub. Wall switch locations are not needed as zigbee/zwave can be used as battery-operated devices and ""glued"" to the wall where needed.

Pros:

* Wiring less complicated
* Switching in one location

Cons:

* home not usable without home automation server

They went off twice yesterday afternoon, as well. My home was built in 2019, and in 2021, this happened fairly often, so I replaced all my smoke detectors (even though I suspected they weren't the root problem, just cheap). The new ones follow the best guidance I found at the time of alternating ionization and photoelectric to detect different types of fires. They are interconnected and have a sealed 10-year battery (they're FirstAlert if anyone cares, the old ones were Kidde). Since then, they've been pretty good.

All that said, I suspect my issue is voltage fluctuations in the power lines. I have some cheap LED bulbs that flicker all the time (a telltale sign of unclean power). If my suspicion is correct (and I've yet to observe any signs of a fire), do any of you have this same problem? Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix it?

Whole home 12/24v DC feasibility?",-Tilde,2,11ivob3,homeautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/11ivob3/options_for_powering_low_voltage_diy_esparduino/,"Hey all. Been doing a bit more smart home/iot stuff recently, and ran into the inevitable problem of power.

I'm also a big fan of microcontroller projects, so I make some of my own stuff with ESP32s. You can get away with a battery for some projects, but ""we want more"" ;), and sometimes a battery just isn't a good solution. And there are some commercial products I've got that are designed for some DC voltage (usually 5v usb), not mains AC.

The simplest option is a standard PSU for each device, like a USB adapter. This is great for some things, but if it's a device that needs to be mounted away from the wall socket, you have to run a wire up the wall. This is ugly, and not always practical. A common use case for me is replacing a wall switch in a gang box.

If there is mains AC (230v in my case) available at the device (in the wall or ceiling), you could convert that to the DC you need (I'll assume 5v). You can use very small SMPS modules, like the HiLink HLK-PM01, and integrate it into your PCB/project box, wiring it directly to mains. But this has some problems: Safety and certification. Whatever design you hack together is very likely unsafe, and probably not up to an applicable code. Not ideal.

Another option is using a small commercial USB psu in the wall/ceiling/project box. Unfortunately, connecting 230v to that safely + legally is tricky. Maybe wire up an outlet in the ceiling and use a usb cable to get to the device? This might not be legal where you live, and doing it properly with an electrician would be fairly expensive for more than a couple of devices. Connecting 230v wires directly to the prongs of a USB psu seems... unsafe at best and probably illegal.

Okay, what about generating DC power centrally and distributing it to the devices? Obviously not 5v because voltage drop, but using a higher voltage and a cheap/small buck converter at the point of your device would be much smaller/easier/cheaper/safer than 230vAC -> 5vDC at the device. 

The two obvious options (to me anyway) are POE with cat6, or using a central 12/24v PSU and running some smallish wire to each device. A big advantage is that at these low voltages, it's usually completely legal to run these yourself. In my country the ""ultra low voltage"" cutoff is I think 50vAC or 120vDC, no electrician required (although your insurance may want some sort of approval). My biggest concern with a POE splitter or buck converter in the project box is potential RF interference. I really don't know how much of an issue that would actually be in the real world.

POE is great. But expensive. Especially because most of the devices we'd use don't actually need ethernet. So we'd mostly be using POE splitters. As much as I'd like all my ESPs to be hardwired to ethernet instead of wireless comms, I don't really think it matters for the amount of data we're transmitting (although there are TTGO ESP32 boards with full blown POE, very cool for the right project. They're just expensive and much larger than most boards). a 24 or 48 port POE switch is expensive (and usually loud) on it's own, and if you aren't already using POE cameras or something, hard to justify. If I was building a new house, CAT6 in every room, POE everything. A few thousand is hardly noticeable when compared to the rest of the price of the house haha.

So that leaves me with doing dedicated low voltage runs. For power, a used server or PC PSU will easily do a few hundred watts at 12v - complete overkill. Server is better because they're designed for 24/7/365 operation, and more heat tolerant. 24v could be achieved with a boost converter (although don't connect the **outputs** of multiple boost converters for more amps), or using a dedicated 24v psu. These are much less common than quality 12v units, though still not hard to find. 

I was thinking of having the PSU go to a mini ""switchboard"", with a fuse, toggle switch, and connector (unsure of which - JST might be too small for the wire size, XT60 seems excessive. 2 pin PCIE maybe?) for each device. The wiring can be surprisingly thin - the voltage drop for 20 metres (~65ft) of 20AWG/0.5mm^2 at 12v 0.5A leaves us with 10.6v, plenty for a 5v project. 24v is of course much better again. Higher amperage devices would use thicker wire and/or 24v.

This option is MUCH cheaper than POE (even for someone who already has some POE infrastructure like me). A dell/hp server PSU can be had under $30 easily (if you're a homelabber too you probably have a pile of them haha), and the wiring is FAR cheaper than CAT5/6. Speaker cable is available in a range of gauges, and it's already in pairs and usually designed to go in the ceiling. CAT5/6 is about $1.10/metre where I am, plus you need to terminate it, and get a poe splitter, adding ~$4 per cable. 20AWG speaker wire is about $0.40/metre, a JST connector at each end is a few cents, and a buck converter is ~$1. For comparison, a hilink SMPS is around $8 by the time you've got the supporting components.

Wow, that was a lot of words. Has anyone here done a central low voltage DC project like this? Are there any tips you have or good resources? Have I massively overlooked something obvious? And what are you using to power your low voltage devices? Thanks in advance.",0,[]

Not sure if I'm in the right community but it seems there is lots of competence here so I'll try!

I'm super new to home assistant and automation in general, but recently got inspired to try to learn and automating my home step by step.

I found and ordered a second hand Lenovo thinkcentre m93p with 16 ram and SSD, significantly cheaper than any of the scalper prices on raspberry pi's out there. It comes with win10 pro.

I'm thinking to start by installing:

- home assistant
Got some cameras and smart plugs and lights, mainly from IKEA and TP link. Seems almost any brand can be integrated with HA which is why I'm sold for it as per main home smart platform.

- Home cloud server service
Not sure which app/platform is best for this like nextcloud etc. Suggestions are welcome! I have two portable SSDs I would like to connect here to the Lenovo.

- pihole or Adguard home
Not sure which is better here. Simply want to block as much ads as possible while maintaining privacy. 

Other than their definitions, I don't yet understand much about Dockers and VM like proxmox. I would love to have early advice from you here on how to best install and maintain these 3 services mentioned above, into the Lenovo tiny PC. Also, the Lenovo will be tucked away hidden and run ""headless"" and connected to my router.

Thank your so much in advance!",5,"[""BE_chems: I'd suggest going straight into Linux and using containers.\n\nUbuntu server would be great for this.\n\nThings like proxmox you can hold back on so you don't get completely overwhelmed with new technologies.\n\nThere are loads of videos on YouTube about installing those services on docker !\n\nGood luck you are gonna have so much fun 😁"", 'RoganDawes: I installed OpenMediaVault on my M93p tiny, and then HAOS as a virtual machine inside that using qemu/KVM.\n\nIf it is going to be out of the way, and headless, I\'d suggest enabling the management extensions, so you can get a serial console, or at least reboot it remotely if everything goes pearshaped.\n\nWhile booting up, press Ctrl-P to enter the AMT console. Log in with password ""admin"", then change it to something you will remember. Probably best to give it a fixed IP address in your network, so you can find it when you need it.

trigger sends push notification to my android phone while i am away from home (fast as possible), and I respond with button press, which closes a switch for a few seconds with a relay. Ideally that is directly from the push notification, speed is important, but otherwise a widget etc.

I can bodge about and probably fumble my way through existing code but to do that I really need a starting point, so I would love to know if a) there's something easy that does close to this already and b) what I should be looking at if not. 

I have seen stuff like gotify or apprise which can send push notifications from a pi - can they also receive responses to do something?

The simple brain solution i came up with is to send a push with gotify from a pi then separately use a kasa smart plug widget with a low voltage adapter plugged in to a relay and use a 555 timer to switch for a few seconds (i can trigger the plug to turn off as well as just do it manually but minimum is 1 minute, and i might forget to do it manually) - it sounds very clumsy.

I plan to use it mainly for streaming, so I’ve been looking at the NAD 720 CI for each zone. But one thing I’d like to add is a wired audio input on the wall near the door to the deck, so I can plug in a DJ setup for parties and play over the 4 zones on the main floor.

It seems like they are able to connect to a phone. But then someone mentioned they are not usable if the phone is off?

I started with wifi and, with the possible exception of Shelly relays, I will never buy another smart wifi device again. The ~$20 dongle is well worth the price for the convenience.\n\nWhat you want to look for is ""local push"" devices, at least with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2016/02/12/classifying-the-internet-of-things/).

Wifi is fine and a good choice if you're cost sensitive as the other choices are much more expensive.  \n\nIoT devices will not add appreciable to wifi bandwidth, though it may be necessary to add a few APs because because people (and many router companies purposely) conflate max \\*lan\\* clients (usually about 254) with max \\*wifi\\* clients on an AP (usually 20-50).\n\nApart from being a poor choice for battery devices, wifi based devices are often cloud managed - a good thing for remote access but a bad thing for privacy and future proofing if the device API only works via the cloud (most all have manual override for local but bulbs do not).  \n\nBest to choose wifi devices that have a local API use for future proofing (and that is \\*not\\* smartlife/tuya!).

Because Z-Wave has defined 'command classes' that means any device or controller can just support that command class, and it'll work.  For example a dimmer switch uses the switch_multilevel command class, so any hub can work with it, driver or not.  Until very recently, Z-Wave was kept under the control of Silicon Labs, who were the only ones making Z-Wave chips.  Since it's a single source the chips cost more, thus there are fewer overall products and the ones there are cost more, but the products are generally good quality and have few/no firmware issues.  \nZ-Wave also uses a dedicated frequency so there's little interference.  \n\nZigBee is a much more open protocol, anyone can build ZigBee chips and devices with no royalty.  That means the chips are plentiful and cheap, thus ZigBee devices cost less and are available from more manufacturers.  So you'll find a wider variety of gadgets at a lower price point, but interoperability and security is lower than with Z-Wave.  ZigBee also uses the same 2.4 GHz spectrum as WiFi, cordless phones, microwave ovens, and baby monitors, so there's more potential for interference.  \n\nIt's worth noting that both are evolving.  Z-Wave is now an open standard, so we will start to see competition in the chip segment.  Z-Wave is also introducing a new 'Long Range' variant that should greatly increase the range even without meshing.  \nZigBee is mutating into a new standard called Matter, which is more IP-based.

I understand that they do now, but from what I gather, you have to do it through their app, which, if true, is limiting. If you can do it through Home Assistant, Smartthings, etc, that would be great, but everything I saw implied it had to go through the Lutron app. I prefer to keep a much of my functionality within one place as possible. With Inovelli or Zooz, I can program any functionality/automation/routine/scene I can set up in Home Assistant to operate through the switch itself. For example, I have a good night scene programmed into my master bedroom switch that shuts off every light inside the house (except my bedroom lamp), locks the doors, shuts the garage door if it's open, arms my alarm, etc. I have another one that controls my lamp from the light switch, multiple that can control lights in other rooms from (like shutting off the dining room lights from the kitchen, or the light above the sink from the main kitchen switch, etc).  I can handle all of these things through voice control if I want, but sometimes it's just easier to use a switch, like if I'm leaving the kitchen but notice the dining room light is also on, it's easier to turn off the kitchen lights, wait half a second, then tap it twice to shut off the dining room. \n\nThe biggest one for me is simple 3 way switches. Zooz and Inovelli both allow you to pair a smart switch with your existing dumb switches in a 3-4+ way situation. With Lutron (and GE and other companies), you have to buy their slave switches for them to work, which adds to cost unnecessarily. \n\nFinally, looking and functioning like a normal switch is a nicety for a lot of people. I personally liked the fact that they look different, even if I didn't necessarily like the button layout/function of the stock Caseta switches, but a lot of people just prefer a normal paddle switch, or even an old school toggle switch (who still wants these, I don't know, but I frequently see people commenting on how they love that Zooz makes toggle switch form factors).\n\nAs for what I switched to, initially I switched to Zooz, and still using it in many places, but I'm gradually switching most of my bedrooms and most commonly used rooms to Inovelli for a handful of reasons (#1 being their ceiling fan controller/light switch, which Zooz doesn't offer in any useful form, although their fan/light switch is great for bathrooms)."", 'Jeearr: 100% agree.

I discovered that using IFTTT, I could connect setup an email inbox, that when the email hit that inbox with certain parameters, it would trigger a Nuki smart lock to unlock. Then instead of using a credit card machine on site, I could setup a shopping cart on Shopify and use a QR code to access it locally. Once payment is complete, then it dispatches the email to unlock.

Does that make sense? Is there a better way to approach this? 

Also, taking this one step further, can you make a suggestion on how we could add a pressure plate at the bottom of the freezer and anytime a product was removed, we could tell if it was just 1 product or someone was being dishonest and grabbing multiple? The food (frozen TV dinner in this instance) would be all the same product an all way the same amount.

Both are non-ip mesh networks using tech that is managed by non profits (Zwave Alliance & CSA)\n\nController depends on how much you want off the shelf functionality vs development. \n\nHomeSeer is the granddaddy of reliability in the consumer commercial home automation space, being around for 2 decades with tons of features for managing large systems over the long haul. It has a large number of official integrations with cloud services, like Alexa, Google, hue, etc. It is able to run on Linux or windows and scale to hundreds of devices across dozens of technologies. Anyone can build a plugin (app) in mono but there are certain standards to get into the plugin marketplace. And they produce their own zwave radios dongles, sensors, switches and even ethernet-zwave dongles so you can have one controller cover wide physical areas.\n\nAt the complete other end is HomeAssistant, an open source project built on dozens (hundreds?) of other open source components. You can get it all from github, with all the ranges of features and quality you typically see in open source projects: some awesome some a bit more ramshackle. It supports a lot of devices that have no official APIs.   There is a company, nabu casa, selling hardware and services  for it, particularly the remote access and cloud connectors to leverage alexa/google.\n\nThere are several controllers in between, commercial products from Hubitat and ISY, or open source like OpenHab.', ""rockhstrongo: You should check out Home Assistant.

They also offer local control, so you don't have to depend on an internet connection to get things working.

There are pro’s and con’s to each (only smart bulbs can change color on a whim; smart switches might be more straightforward for a hallway switch with 3 lights on it). But the main point is that you should make that decision (and you can decide differently for each light) before heading out to buy 75 smart bulbs.', 'Think-Gap-3260: Thanks! I’ll check it out.', 'Think-Gap-3260: Thanks! Do you have any experience with either of these?', 'kigmatzomat: Eh, opinions are easy, most people have at least one. \n\nI try not to be too opinionated right off the bat until there is more clarity on use cases. I personally prefer zwave + HomeSeer but that is a US-centric preference. Elsewhere Zigbee is a better choice as 2.4ghz is open globally while  zwave has to use 4 or 5 different 900mhz bands . HAss might be a good choice or maybe Fibaro or Homey as a controller, based on the person\'s aptitudes.\n\nHowever my general decision points are around budget, need for stability, current technical skill, type of learning desired (if any) and feature set.\n\nLow budget may push towards open source, but if you also need alexa/google and remote access, the recurring fees of Nabu Casa will dwarf the up front cost of HomeSeer or the cost of major version upgrades every 5-7 years. Cheap wifi devices can be more appealing than more costly zwave but the vast majority of wifi devices have an uncertain lifespan due to cloud/app dependencies while all zwave stuff works until the device physically dies. (As zwave is used in the security system market for close to two decades, reliability is quite high and proven)  \n\nThe other issue around controller choice is scale. People will point at open source as inexpensive but they ignore the management time cost. If a zwave device dies in HAss you have to rebuild all automations. In HS there is a ""replace"" function that swaps in a new device, no coding. That isn\'t a feature you need at year 1 or 2 but at year 5 or 6, things will start dying from power surges, especially as the number of devices goes up.  Homeseer has their own zwave radios that can be cloned completely; no one else does that. \n\nThis means the long term ROI math is often opposite of what people want and closer to the old mantra of ""buy quality once vs buy cheap stuff multiple times"". \n\nHowever if someone only wants two or three convenience lights, is it really worth the cap-ex of a hub infrastructure? Probably not. \n\nIf their two or three lights are because of safety issues and they need to ensure it works, maybe a hub is worth it.\n\nOn the learning front, most people underestimate the time it takes to work out the logic that fits their life and overestimate the tinkering time family members are willing to tolerate.  That means, IMO, that they are better off focusing just on the automation configuration and not get a platform that requires its own learning curve for maintenance. \n\nPeople have HomeSeer installs that have been running longer than HAss or any open source project has existed. Maintenance needs are very low. In part because official HS code from the marketplace all uses official APIs.\n\nConversely, some people want to experiment with everything.  There the accomplishment of getting there ""first"" is its own merit. Stability then isn\'t as valued as rapidity of available code, irrelevant of an official API.  While I find a heavily mixed system to be inherently less stable as you necessarily must have more drivers/plugins/libraries in play, that\'s the fun part for some people.', 'Think-Gap-3260: Thanks! The current wiring is for the sconces to be always hot. My thought is to do as little rewirering as possible.

There would be a lot more options for drivers if OP changed for 24v lights instead of rarer 48v lights.\n5. If the driver is not the part where the dimming happens then the driver could be called a power supply. The dimming can still happen before or after the power supply.\n6. If the dimming happens before the power supply then the 220v dimmer and power supply need to be compatible (for example both supporting phasecut)\n7.

I’ve used a lot of the Zooz ones, the Jasco ones and Home Seer and the bulb compatibility with LEDs is the best.\n* It has the smoothest dimming I’ve ever seen on a smart dimmer. I’ve never been able to get my bulbs to go so dim (<10%) without any flickering whatsoever. And unlike Inovelli’s gen 2 red series dimmers, the dimming is super smooth, without the stepped feeling that’s super common. It’s on par with the Lutron non smart dimmers that came pre-installed in my house.\n* It’s more advanced in functionality than anything Inovelli has come out with before (and their configurability and features are miles ahead of anyone else). There’s 3 different buttons with 5 scenes each, full support for neutral/non neutral applications, non-smart switches in 3-ways, aux switches in 3 ways (with full scene control), up to 10 device Z-Wave Association, so many different notification options and individually addressable LEDs in the light bar.\n\nHere’s a [video](https://imgur.io/a/fFOTymP) of the dimming performance I took a couple of nights ago and posted on their forums. I’m starting out at 100% brightness and dimming down to 1% over a 5 second period with the exposure locked on my camera. It’s that good, every single time. No flicker, no sudden cut off, no jerky dimming steps.\n\nMy house is currently filled with Inovelli Red 500 series dimmers/switches, some Zooz and a couple of Jasco ones. I’ve pre-ordered enough to replace all of them with the Red 800 2-1s.\n\nAs for availability, I’ll let /u/InovelliUSA tell you for sure, but I know that Eric & the team there are working to get them manufactured and in the US as soon as possible and are trying to do their best to keep them stocked up.', 'eye_can_do_that: Are they making a Red 800 series switch that can handle fans (bathroom exhaust fans, ceiling fans)?

As an aside, each of the switches ships with a precut neutral pigtail, so the install shouldn’t be too bad. I also replace the neutral wire nuts with WAGO connectors which makes the connections much easier to do.\n\nAs for downsides, there are a few of them (this list is probably not exhaustive since I don’t normally run the switches without neutrals):\n* The switch has to constantly leak some current through the load to power itself. This can result in some lights glowing slightly when the switch is turned off. This is mostly corrected by installing a “bypass” device (basically a large power resistor) in parallel with the load.\n* The switch is unable to pass through the entire wave form to the load (since it is effectively stealing some of the current for itself). This can result in slightly dimmer lights at maximum brightness than when running with a neutral (or with a non smart switch).\n* The switch is unable to run with a non smart switch in a 3 way configuration.

Buy one of the devices, program it for your shades and your good to go.\n2. If you have Somfy's IO system, it uses a frequency range and signaling system that blasters like the BroadLink IR/RF Smart Home Hub cannot emulate.  That sucks!

The larger circuit board is a MHCOZY Smart Wireless WIFI Relay Switch with two relays that can emulate pushbuttons.  The device is compatible with Alexa and Hey Google smart home systems.  You can buy this or something virtually identical on Amazon for about $20.\n\nThe relays are activating a small module made by Somfy that is intended to go in an electrical box on a wall.  The wires would normally hook to a switch or buttons on the front that would let you raise/open and lower/close your blinds with the flip of a switch or tap of a button.  Instead, I used the Smart Wireless WIFI Relay Switch to take the place of the buttons.\n\nThe Comfy device is called the Somfy IZYMO Transmitter, Part No. 1822609.  I paid about €38 for it for a company in Spain.  (That's about $41 plus a bit for slow boat shipping.)  If you Google the device you'll find prices all over the map.

For up and down, you'll need two Sonoffs.They will show up as two devices with on/off buttons in whatever app you'll be using, unfortunately not as one device with an up and down button. But if you turn them on, they will switch off immediately because of the setting i mentioned. I named my sonoff devices 'Shutters up' and 'Shutters down'.

They have the, ""smart bulb mode"" on their switches as well -- it was my gift to them (still semi-salty, but oh well). \n\nKidding aside, they have been around for a long time, have great prices on their switches, and they stand behind their products. I recommend them all the time as a budget option and have no problem doing so.\n\nHomeSeer is another great option if you want more bells/whistles. I believe they also have a 700 Series option. You can also do the notifications on their switch if that\'s something that interests you.\n\nThose are probably the only other brands that I recommend when we\'re not an option.\n\nHappy to answer any further questions about us or the other companies as best as I can.

I currently have almost no smart home stuff, so I can jump on any solution path there is. I do have one Nanoleaf Shape kit and one LED stripe that is currently controlled via a 2.4GH RF remote control (can change the LED controller, as its a custom setup). Right now, I'm planing a new LED stripe which got me thinking.

I would love to control all LED lights in one app. This is my end goal here. So, for the new stripe I considered the following options:

* Nanoleaf stripes: Can't really use them because the cutting points to fit the measurements.
* Philips Hue Stripes: Pro: Works with Zigbee, has cool stuff. Con: High pricing, need the hub as well
* [No name stripes](https://amzn.eu/d/cSyJRZb) from Amazon which offer HomeKit support: Pro: Cheap, might be enough. Con: Prob not the best LEDs, no idea how good they're working
* Going for 'custom' stripes and adding a [Wifi gateway](https://amzn.eu/d/fAnZKet) for 2.4GH RF controllers: Pro: Will integrate my existing stripe, not too expensive. Con: The controller seems to require a different app. I would prefer one app for all lights.
* Going for custom stripes and use the existing RF remote control. Pro: Cheap, one control for both stripes, not much overhead for setup. Con: Different controlling places for Nanoleafs and LED-Stripes --> **will I ever match the same colour using an app and a remote control???**

I would be very happy for suggestions on solutions here. Maybe I'm even missing options? 

In the long run, the Matter standard is what I consider the best. However, there's little stuff atm (maybe I'm missing something here as well). If there's a solution that is currently expensive or hard to setup, but offers future perspective in that way, it might be worth a consideration for me.",1,"[""Royal-Art8273: \n\nIt sounds like you have a lot of options available to you and it's great that you are researching them all.

So if you start closing valves, the water normally going through those loops would be redirected elsewhere.  Probably not an issue if it's a small amount.  But if you are redirecting 50% of the system's water capacity to other parts of the system, now you are doubling the flow in that other half of the system.  This could be an issue.  A bypass would take that excess 50% and redirect it back to the return.\n\nIf your system was meant for you to turn on/off zones throughout the day then maybe it's fine for you to automate it.  Also, I wouldn't expect a pump turning on/off once per day wouldn't be an issue.  A sump pump may turn on multiple times a day and last for years.

We wanted to see if we could also turn on the lamp in our bedroom when the garage light turns on, to serve as an alert / security feature in the night. 

To do this, we changed the location of the bedroom lamp from bedroom to garage in the app, then linked it to the sensor.

The problem: we don’t necessarily want it to turn on/off all day when we go out to the garage. 

Tentative solution: plug bedroom lamp into smart outlet that only is active during night time hours. Then, during the day when the garage sensor tells the bedroom lamp to turn on, it won’t have power and stay off.

Noob homeowner here trying to set up a few home automation routines but struggling to navigate what feels like incompatible ecosystems. 

A few months back, I was looking for smart window sensors (without subscription services attached) for my first floor, with the intent to connect them to my Google Home to act as an alarm hub. I purchased these [Stitch door and window sensors](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=33048) but have not been able to get them to do what I intended them to. I've connected them via Stitch app to my Google Home, but cannot get them to do anything other than set off a phone notification when triggered. Ideally I'd like an alarm to go off on my Google Home speakers when the windows are opened.

I've heard Home Assistant may be able to help, but frankly don't know enough to get started and I've gone down so many Google Home rabbit holes with no real answers. 

Any advice on how to move forward? Do I scrap this project and find a more compatible sensor?",2,"['Suprflyyy: Home Assistant has pretty good docs around [getting started.](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/)', 'cliffotn: Google home may be able to sorta do what you want, but a centralized hub is what you’re really asking for. \n\nHome Assistant is the god of such, however no matter how much my fellow tech heads say it’s easy enough for a kitten, it ain’t.   It’s still fraught will a steeper and higher learning curve, needs way more love in a regular basis, and for many installation and setup is beyond challenging.

My declare in I.T. just made me understand non techies out of necessity, so I’m a bit more understanding when folks say they aren’t technical  I have no clue your level of knowledge or desire!

An automatic timer to turn the thing off avoids most of that waste.  If the cost of running the timer is less than the cost of the power that would be wasted, you come out ahead.  Even wifi plugs only draw a fraction of a watt, on average, so they don't have to save very much.  \n\nBut it's not always about energy cost.  Other costs can also be avoided.   I use smart controls to operate bathroom exhaust ventilation to avoid mold growth.   Mold is *extremely* expensive when it occurs.  I can justify rather a lot, to avoid that cost.

My main objective with home automation is to monitor that a sump pump I have installed keeps working to ensure our basement doesn't get flooded (again..). 
On top of using some sort of water leak sensor, I thought of monitoring the power consumption of the pump using a smart plug. When operating correctly, the pump senses water level has risen and automatically turns on for ~1 min - this happens every 1-3 hours. If the pump for some reason does not start correctly, I wish to get a warning in good time.
More precisely I want to receive an alarm, notification etc, whenever one of the following occurs:
 - The pump did not turn on within the past ~3 hours.
 - The pump has been turned on for more than 5 minutes (indicates that the pump might be stuck).

My thought was using some sort of a countdown timer to trigger these routines, but where the timer can be reset from other routines.

Is this solvable in some of the more simple apps, or do I have to go to something as advanced as Home Assistant?",0,[]

It appears that the vulnerability of S0 is that an attacker can sniff the key **during pairing only** and then use it later to access your devices because the key exchange encryption algorithm is published and reversible. S2 uses a Diffie–Hellman key exchange which prevents this sniffing threat.

But this is all at pairing time! Once I install the device, S2 has no further security advantages since the key is already exchanged and stored on both ends. So all these posts about the need for S2 are confusing. I'm not worried about a hacker bad guy being present during the 10 minutes that I set up my device.

Am I wrong?",10,"['85kqq5cZbcxs: You\'re not wrong. The vulnerability in S0 is so ridiculously obscure and, like you said, only applicable IF someone is sniffing your data during inclusion.

Using either on lights, switches, etc, just slows everything down. S0 triples network traffic, and while S2 doesn\'t amplify traffic, I still find it has very significant negative impact on the network, presumably from the tiny CPU being bogged down with the encryption/decryption process.

The wall switch is dumb and just switches the power on or off; all functions are controlled by either an app or a provided remote control. The light is dimmable and contains both cool and warm LEDs (colour temperature adjustment actually just dims one and brightens the other). The fan is DC and can be operated independently from the light with 6 speeds, both forward and reverse.

Options ruled out:

* RF bridge (control is bluetooth)
* Sonoff iFan or similar (motor is DC)
* Reverse engineering bluetooth packets (it's actually BLE Mesh, which is way beyond my skillset)

The only remaining option I can see would be to open up the control box, and replace their bluetooth controller with an ESP, reusing all of the power electronics for the fan and LED control. Has anyone done something like this before?

Details from the labels:

* Motor: 24V, 20W DC fan motor (1200rpm) 
* LED output: 200mA

Stock controller wiring:

* Inputs: 230V AC Live & Neutral, bluetooth antenna
* Outputs: 3wire to motor, 3wire to cool LEDs, 3wire to warm LEDs

However then you run into the additional problem of the other outlets on the circuit also being limited to that same 10A. That's only ~1200W, it really wouldn't take much to trip that breaker especially when there are usually quite a few outlets on a single circuit. If you are talking about an inline breaker, a junction box is pretty extreme for this. An inline fuse would probably work but I can't say I've ever heard of one being used on an outlet before so I couldn't begin to tell you if that was code or not. \n\nIt's not an issue with most smart switches because 10A is ~1,200W and you will not ever exceed 1,200W with modern lighting unless you are hosting a concert. With most lights being LED now days you could quite literally light up a neighborhood with that much power. Depending on the bulbs efficiency that would be about 100 100W(equivalent) LED bulbs (they average 11-15W) on that switch if it was rated to 10A which is a crazy ~130,000 lumens of light. \n\nThe better, safer and easier solution to all of this is to get a relay that's rated for higher amperage. No subpanel, no new breakers, no janky inline fuses, etc. Or better yet, just get a smart outlet for outside. Putting a 10A switch on a 20A outlet is about as dangerous as using a 18 gauge extension cord for you 1,800W heater.""]"

(So without direct wired connection between the lightpoint and the light switch.) Meaning the lights will always be powered onn. And then installing smart switches to controll my lights. Would this work if it was a Wifi/ZigBee smart switch? Or are there smart switches out there that can have a wired connection to a smart home hub? What would be the best type switch to choose in this situation?

I also thought about not having any wired light  switches and totally relying on the Philips Hue light switches that work wireless. But wireless is always less reliable than a wired system. Also I might not use Philips Hue everywhere in my house , plus I would hate to have to replace the batteries of the light switches every once in a while or having to charge them.

I'm a bit overwhelmed by all of the options. Right now I'm using a ton of Philips Hue bulbs, but this house also has some track lighting, some fan switches, lots of switched outlets, and a lot of 3- and 4-way switches. I've also got rooms with LIFX bars, Nanoleaf panels, and smart plugs.

I ordered a Home Assistant Yellow, so I was thinking a switch that can keep power to the bulbs at all times and send a signal that can trigger an automation would be the best option. This would let me do things like have the switches do different lights at different times of day, or turn on smart switches in certain rooms.

The ones I've found that can do all of this and control the track lighting switches they replace seem to be Zooz, Inovelli, and Brilliant.

* Zooz can't replace the fan or switched outlet switches, except for that combo switch and I'd rather those just always stay powered on. I don't want anyone accidentally powering off an outlet. I've also read complaints about the switches feeling cheap. They certainly would be the most cost effective choice.
* Inovelli seems like it has all the same issues as Zooz, but at a higher price point.
* Brilliant can do everything, but those capacitive sliders and the touch screen are weird, and it's extremely cost prohibitive.

I looked through previous posts but I couldn't find one that has exactly what I'm looking for.

I really hope someone here has some recommendations!

I'm looking to setup a multi-room audio system in my apartment (specifically 3 speakers). I don't want to setup a server or have to configure raspberry pi's for each one. 

They'd probably have to be wireless since I don't think it'd be possible for me to run wires between them. 

I want to use 3 audio sources: my TV (Vizio smart TV w/ Roku), my record player (has a line out) and my phone (android -- bluetooth). And I'd like it to be fairly easy / quick to switch between them.  

I'd prefer not to have a ""smart"" system -- I don't really want voice commands or apps or really anything other than a speaker. Or if it has that I want to make sure that it has a way to disable the microphones. 

I know that Sonos has some off the rack options but I don't care so much about sound quality that I would want to pend $250 per speaker.

This seems like an easy problem in the abstract but I think my list of requirements drives down the number of options pretty substantially. 

My suspicion is that I'll need to have some sort of hub that takes in all of the audio sources, allows me to select between them in an app, and then transmits them to the speakers which will probably just be synced bluetooth speakers. 

But I don't know if this app exists or what hardware I'd need. I also don't know if it would make the TV audio lag behind the video. 

If anyone has suggestions or recommendations I'd really appreciate it!",24,"['wgc123: Sonos one SL doesn’t have a microphone and is $199.

I would like to also have a wall switch, though.   When I search for 'smart home switch', I always get the switches which also want to control the light power.   Would these also work for me, if I just hook the light up to the hot wire instead of the load side of the switch? (that would leave the light permanently on.

Trying to figure out how to deal with this situation:

* My office is basically a single room warehouse with overhead fluorescent shop lighting. There's a master lightswitch, which we use daily, and pull strings for individual lights, which we typically don't use.
* The light switch is inconveniently located at a door we don't use, 100 ft from the door we do use. It's a pretty treacherous walk in the dark, so we leave a desk lamp on 24/7 just to provide basic safety lighting.
* We'd like to put a lightswitch by the door we do use, without hard-wiring it. Anything we use needs to be able to operate without a reliable internet connection, because our ancient heater creates some sort of interference that causes our cable modem to reset several times per hour. Our wifi router is more stable than our cable modem. 
* We need a physical switch, not just voice control, to accomodate an employee with a disability. 

What I think I need:

1. Some sort of smart switch to replace the existing master light switch. Suggestions welcome. No dimmers or anything, just simple on/off.
2. A battery powered switch hung near the other door, which I understand probably needs to use Zigbee. Again, suggestions welcome/needed.
3. Some sort of hub to relay button presses from the battery powered switch to the master switch. Will a basic Echo do the trick for this, even with our broadband problems?

Hi all,

never posted before, so bare with me. I have scoured for simple answers to my questions for several months now not only have not found them but have become more and more confused as seemingly new technologies are added and compatibilities change (improve?). I'm hoping someone can drastically simplify things for me.

I am somewhat tech savvy, though the only coding I have ever done is website-related (HTML, CSS). I currently use 5 Alexa Echo Dot's throughout my home as the smart speaker, I have several Wiz bulbs throughout every room, a Google Nest thermostat, Wyze security cameras, and a few Feit smart plugs. I DO have Apple everything for computer/phone/tablet but did not opt for the smart speakers. The priority in all this is being able to maintain (or improve) the functionality of the custom Rhythms in my Wiz bulbs/Wiz app. These Rhythms and the ability to trigger specific Scenes via the app (less desirable) or through voice command to Alexa (MUCH easier) to manually override a Rhythm when needed is key. The rest of the smarthome components could just be replaced with something compatible if necessary, but I do not want to spend the money on redoing the lightbulbs with Hue when they dont even make an A21 100w bulb, which is one specific thing I need. The question I have is this: everything thus far is wifi-based, and I don't know how far I can push it before it potentially bogs down the network or becomes a security risk. I also want to expand the collection of devices to include smart switches/buttons, which will either further congest the system (if I even can find some that are truly compatible with Wiz bulbs and wont buzz/flicker/etc) or require a new expense of some new tech that I haven't yet implemented (SmartThings/Zigbee/Z-wave/Matter/Thread/or all manner of other names that I have yet to actually figure out what they mean).

What I'm wanting to do is add smart light switches into the home that only send and Off signal to my smart bulbs rather than killing the power. I would like all the Wiz bulbs (or other brands if they also end up getting incorporated later) to maintain power supply because if they dont and they are truly electrically off during a time when one of my Rhythms changes to the next scheduled/timed light mode, it gets hungup somewhere and I have to pull my phone out and manually re-trigger every rhythm for every room, or give Alexa a voice command to trigger a scene that equates to the same setup the Rhythm would give if it were functioning normally, but then at some point during the day I would still have to get my phone out and manually re-trigger the Rhythm for each room in order for them to dim automatically at the next timed trigger point. So I need input on what switches to buy. Which I'm assuming the most likely consensus will be....

Should I then be saying ""Welp, wifi-based was great to start with, but now it's time to buy a hub and build a different system that is compatible with all my devices""? This is where I get lost. It at least seems like a SmartThings hub (Aeotec?) is the best? option, then buying switches that are SmartThings compatible, and potentially buying buttons/sensors that can trigger certain commands. I just don't know what the REALWORLD implication of Matter and Thread and Zwave and Zigbee and SmartThings and IFTTT and whatever other millions of other names are out there.

I have a client who has several indoor intercom units scattered around his house (All Hardwired) and two individual outdoor gate stations which both need to able to unlock their respective gates.

So the client wants to be able to view both Outdoor gate units on everyone of the indoor units and of course have the ability to control the gate.

Now to make matters worse the client wants the one outdoor unit to only call through to the staff room when the first button is pressed and through to the rest of the house if the second button is pressed. The Second unit and its buttons will call through to the rest of house.

This client also wants to be able to call in-between indoor units. E.g He's in the study and he wants to call the intercom unit in the Snug Lounge.

Now I know that these units cannot call each other if let's say the Unit in the study has a different master unit to the unit in the Snug Lounge.

Previously this system was set up with each outdoor unit being a master, so the staff room was a slave to the outdoor unit at the gate and then all the other indoor units were slave to the other outdoor unit at the other gate. This of course doesn't work the way the client wants it to.

Please let me know if this system can function the way the client wants it to.

Thank you so much guys !",0,[]

Enbrighten?,TundraKing89,1,11ddexg,homeautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/11ddexg/no_neutral_zwave_dimmer_lutron_enbrighten/,"Hey folks. Long time lurker. I've got Home Assistant setup at my house and am running Phillips Hue and Zwave for lights primarily. 

We recently moved into a two story home, one floor has neutral wires in the switch boxes and the other doesn't. I started installing a few Zooz Zwave dimmers on the floor with neutral wires in the switch boxes and am totally happy with that product. I've got other Zwave devices like some plugs and sensors. 

On the floor with no neutral wires in the switch boxes, I've used a few Hue bulbs in targeted locations but I don't want to necessarily scale the whole floor with Hue bulbs. I'd much rather have smart switches. 

So I'm trying to decide what the best path forward is for no neutral Zwave switches. 

* Lutron seems to get the most praise here but is the most expensive and complex for an install (new bridge, new Home Assistant integration, etc). 
* The other option seems to be something like the GE Enbrighten dimmer, but I've heard the functionality is very limited with that switch and it's still pretty expensive. I think you also have to purchase the Add-On paddle to get into 3-way wiring which I will encounter on this floor. 
* Innovelli would have been nice but seems like the Red dimmers from that company are never coming back.

I'd prefer not to get into a separate Zigbee implementation. 

So anyone in a similar situation and have any experience here? Bite the bullet and go Lutron throughout the house seems to be my inclination to have consistency and full features throughout the house.",2,"['kigmatzomat: I use a no-neutral zwave dimmer from homeseer.  It also requires an add-on switch for 3 and 4-way switch/dimming.  It provides central scene with up to 5 taps and has 7 rgbw indicators you can control.

We've just moved into a new property and looking to turn this into a sort of ""Smart Home"" after looking at the recent crime reports in the past 6 months, we're looking to make out house as secure as possible. 

&#x200B;

One of the options I was looking into was the Nuki lock with the universal cylinder. Has anyone gone for the Nuki Universal Cylinder? What makes it worth spending the extra ££ on it? I'd also like to understand how it works with ordering additional keys? It mentions on the site that we can only order with our certificate we get given. What stops me or someone else from just going to get a new key cut at a local store?

&#x200B;

Has anyone had experience with this combo before? Our current cylinder lock isn't supported by the Nuki lock so we'd need something more compatible (Hence the question about Nuki's own!)

&#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated on this",1,"['sembee2: The main reason for using their cylinder is because of how the lock works - it is basically turning the key, but allowing a key to be turned from the other side.  You can get regular cylinders, which will do that as well. \n\nAnother option is the yale cylinder designed for their locks, which also work well  - I have two.']"

I have seen so many redditors on this thread complaining their switches are burnt after some time. 

Am I right to say that because these redditors' switches are using WIFI connections, they are using more power to communicate during standby mode as compared to zigbee switches? Therefore zigbee switches will not have ""big"" residual currents?

Is this why my vendor is so confident in selling no-neutral smart switches?


I am a ultra noob at circuitry, but I did my own due diligence and googled a lot before asking, but I'm still unsure.. so please bear with me! Thanks!",6,"['SnooEagles6377: I think you’re conflating a few things. \n\nA typical smart switch requires a neutral wire because it provides power. The neutral and line wires are like the left and right slots in an outlet. Hook up to this, and the switch has power even when the switch is off, so it can listen for commands. \n\nSome homes don’t have a neutral wire available in the box. They only have line and load (the wire that goes to the light/fan/etc). When you switch it off, the switch opens the circuit and there is no power at all. To accommodate this, switch vendors have created “no-neutral” switches that don’t really turn off, they just added circuitry to trickle enough current to power themselves. Because it’s  not 100% off, it’s more like a dimmer on a super low setting, some efficient lights will actually glow dimly. This is not about current “escaping” and generally does not cause any problems. \n\nThis has nothing to do with the communication protocol, whether it be zigbee, z-wave, or Wi-Fi. Once the switch is powered it will behave normally.', 'iSmellPowder: Ahh thank you so much for your explanation! I have a better sense of the concepts now... \n\nBut, do you know why some Redditors\' switches burns out after some times?

A normal smart switch uses a relay (a mini physical switch controlled by electricity) and you can generally hear the click when they are activated. But a no-neutral switch acts more like a dimmer (as I explained above) and uses electronic circuitry with something called a triac. I won’t go into detail about how it works, but if you look at the instructions for any dimmer switch they’ll say they are not for high current loads.\n\nI found this out the hard way many years ago in a former house. I had a smart dimmer controlling an exterior post lamp. Now this lamp was near the end of my driveway by the sidewalk. It happened to have an outlet on it which I used to for a lighted wreath. No problems there. But one day a concrete crew came to repair the curb. They decided to be lazy and plug their jackhammer into the outlet. The plastic face of my switch literally melted before the switch failed. Fortunately nothing worse happened. I replaced the switch with a non-dimmer and learned a lesson. \n\nSo if you had a no-neutral switch on an outlet and decided to plug in a space heater, iron, vacuum, etc. you could burn out the switch.', 'iSmellPowder: Okay!

I currently have several Philips Hue bulbs/strips that I use in HomeKit. I have a few standard (E26) bulbs that I’d like to be brighter than the G1 or G2 Hue (max or 600 or 800 lumens respectively). I use it on warm white quite a lot and research shows that bulbs vary a lot of that settings. The Innovelli Z-Wave bulb was compared and measured via a YT creator (with lots of other bulbs) at around 1700 lux on warm white compared to the Hue 800 which was a little over 700 for the same color.

Does anyone have any other suggestions for a bulb that at least has tunable white (if not full RGB) and would be very bright at warm white and daylight? I initially thought that warm white was always less bright but it appears to be specific to each bulb brand. I’m less concerned about cool white as I don’t use it as often. Or even a video or article that would compare them? I’ve searched and found a few but most are missing some of the bulbs I was looking for including the 1100 lumen IKEA Tradfri or the Nanoleaf Essentials. (If an IKEA bulb was tested, the ones I found were the earlier (lower lumen) versions and I didn’t see actual numbers for the Nanoleaf.) I’m also fine with other brands. I have a Hubitat Elevation hub and a Thread border router so most any zigbee or thread (z-wave as last option) would work. Any info would be amazing.

Installed a GE Smart Dimmer switch for my living room ceiling fan lights about 5 years back and its worked pretty much flawlessly on my LED dimmable lights in them.  Some months back I had this issue start where if I turned the lights up to 100% it ""crashed"" the entire switch.  So I could only turn it up to 90/95%, its slowly degraded to lower and lower now I am about 55% max.

What I mean by ""crashed"" is this.  If I turn up to 100% the lights go up bright, then immediately turn off.  If I turn them back on they keep doing this same thing over and over again until I just set it to a lower brightness level.

I would like to connect them wirelessly. The entry gate has a receiver (we control it with a radio remote), so there is no need to buy another receiver.

I need a box remote control that I can connect to the 12v power supply that is fed to the gate station. I would connect it to the COM2 and NO2 pins. When the COM2 and NO2 circuit is closed, the remote (mounted in the box behind the intercom) would transmit on the appropriate frequency and open the gate.

Unfortunately, I can't find a suitable solution. Does anyone have an idea what kind of device I could install to open the gate remotely from the intercom without having to run a cable? Or maybe I should solve it differently?

My toilet is in a separate doored room/closet from the main bathroom for reference. Turning on the light wakes me up too much and makes it hard to go back to sleep from the brightness. 

It seems like the best bet would be to have a motion sensor so I don’t have to fuss with a switch, but I’d like it to have a warm, very dim color at night. 

What’s the best course of action here?",6,"['Far_Ad717: Set up an automation that turns on the light to something like 3-4% that only triggers at night time when the motion sensor detects motion and turns them off after a certain amount of time. You will need some smart (dimmable) lightbulbs or a smart switch, some sort of Controller (e.g. a RasPi with HAss) and of course a motion sensor.\n\nThe idea is pretty straightforward, the setup however depends on the system you are using for your automations. It‘s easy to set up with HAss and other systems and I assume that there are a ton of videos on YouTube on how to set something like this up.', 'Jazz_homeassistant: using home-assistant, automation for bathroom motion is time-dependent (between 10pm and 6am, it lights a single bulb at level 1 (of 1..255), reddish hue. using adaptive lighting to control brightness and hue.', 'puzzleandwonder: I have my house filled with Wiz bulbs. They sometimes catch flack from people because they can be glitchy, but at $19/per for a 100w-equiv. bulb vs $30-40/per for a 60w-equiv. on Hue or some other brand it\'s well worth it. Plus, I\'m now finally after 18 months of smart bulbs switching my system from purely wifi and dumb switches over to Hubitat/Z-wave and smart switches, which will solve ALL the glitch problems that I have had moving forward.\n\nHow I use them: I am HUGE on circadian rhythm lighting as light therapy has been one of the biggest treatment inclusions for fixing my insomnia without medicine. I have a 4-bulb fixture above my vanity in my bathroom and installed 4 100w-equiv. Wiz color bulbs and create a specific rhythm in the Wiz app for that room. At 4am the rhythm schedule is 5200K color at full power, and remains that way throughout the day until 6:30pm when it automatically dims and warms to ""Cozy"" setting which I think is 3000K and like 50% luminance? Then at 8pm they dim and warm the rest of the way to the ""Night Light"" setting which is like 2700K at the lowest power/luminance setting there is. It\'s very non-disruptive if I get up in the middle of the night. Its all automated. The only real glitch I have left with Wiz is sometimes when the power is actually cut to the smart bulb via the regular dumb switch and it is off at the transition time in the Rhythm it may not switch itself to the correct color/brightness setting automatically. This can be fixed by either getting the phone out and tapping the Rhythm button for whatever room the glitch is in, or, I have set up different Scenes (scenes and rhythms are different in the Wiz app) that have the equivalent settings in terms of color temp and brightness so that either the rhythm or the Scene activation can get the correct light setup that I want, and then made Alexa skills or commands or whatever that will trigger the right scene quickly and easily that way (The downside here is that you can\'t activate a \\*Rhythm\\* with Alexa, but you can activate a scene, so if you activate a scene via Alexa to quickly get the light right, you will at some point need to open the app and reactivate the Rhythm in the Wiz app.) It\'s annoying, but, it\'s still worth it with the cost savings per bulb, and is also what is getting fixed with the aforementioned Hubitat/Z-wave switch setup I mentioned wherein the smart switch in that scenario will not kill power to the bulb, it just sends an Off command. When the bulb is off via an Off command rather than the power being cut via the switch being flicked off the Wiz bulbs do not have the issue of forgetting where in the Rhythm the bulb settings need to be at any point in the day.\n\nLong story short, Wiz bulbs will do exactly what you\'re asking, that is exactly what I utilize them for. I have now just decided to take the next step forward and am beginning to incorporate a Hubitat hub (to get away from Cloud connections) and a specific Z-wave switch to avoid killing power to the bulb so that they no longer have the Rhythm glitches. Other bulbs I believe can do the same sort of thing, but I don\'t have experience with them, but I do with Wiz and I am going to continue using them specifically for my circadian light therapy stuff.', 'TARS1986: Cool thank you.

What hardware can measure electricity consumption but also turn it off? A smart meter.

The meters are going to be owned and installed by us. We can choose the hardware. General prepaid meter solutions don’t work for us, we looked at them, we need more control than that.

Has anyone done this? What meters did you use? And what software to control them?

So you do need a hub. \n\nIf you’re looking for the simplest option, the smart home hub from IKEA itself is probably your best choice as it does support HomeKit AFAIK.', 'lifereinspired: Yes, you need a hub, period. It has to connect Zigbee to an internet connection so it can “talk” with other items.\n\nYou have a few options. The first and simplest is getting an IKEA hub. They switched over from the Tradfri hub last year to the more expensive Dirigera hub. There are reasons for this. First of all, the latter hub has more protocol radios included. It’s zigbee, a Thread border router, and will shortly (if not already) support the new Matter standard which is going make it much more future proof moving forward. I think I remember reading that it also has a Bluetooth radio. This would also support any other IKEA (or Thread) smart home products (any of their many smart lighting options, sensors and remotes, smart blinds, etc) and bring them into HomeKit. You might still be able to find a Tradfri hub on eBay or similar but I’m not sure if it’s worth the effort. It was a little odd about how things paired and not as straightforward as the newer hub plus at some point, it will be considered EOL and no longer supported.\n\nYou could also look at third party hubs that support zigbee - but you’ll have to research whether they support the specific device you have. The top two options on this would be Hubitat (Elevation is the hub name, IIRC) or the SmartThings hub (though I’m thinking that ST won’t integrate directly into HomeKit). The hub would have to have the IKEA smart plug device handler in order to support it. The IKEA Tradfri smart plug is listed on the Hubitat supported device list: https://docs2.hubitat.com/en/devices/list-of-compatible-devices. You would likely have more possibilities with the Hubitat vs the IKEA hub because it’s very popular, also support Z-Wave, and I think is the first hub of its kind to integrate info HomeKit natively (without using HomeBridge/Hoobs or being a specific’s brand’s offering like Hue, IKEA, etc). \n\nEither way, the hub will be an investment but will generally last years and it’s a vital piece to a smart home setup. Your only other other option that I can think of would be to consider going with Thread smart plugs but those will still require a Thread border router to get into HomeKit (either an AppleTV 4K 2021 or the higher spec’d 2022 model, or a HomePod min or the newly released HomePod 2023). At some point, you’ll want one of the above anyway as it connects your HomeKit from local only to being accessible from anywhere with internet. But you’ll likely pay way more for the Thread smart plugs and the hub will give you a lot of additional options and connectivity anyway.']"

All of the sensors work in Alexa routines though. 

For a variety of reasons, this doesn’t work for me and I want to figure out a workaround using all of the Wyze contact and motion sensors I have installed in my house. 

I’m looking for a keypad that’ll work with Alexa. I’ll use this keypad to disarm the Alexa routine security system. For example I will have a routine that will make all the Alexa’s in my house start screaming if one of the contact sensors is open…ideally on a slight delay…and I’ll want a keypad to be able to turn this routine off like a typical security system (if keypad entry = 1234, disable routine).

I live in an old apartment building and making my home smart is a challenge sometimes. 

It's time for the next challenge - the doorbell, and I really need your help.

My current doorbell installation is very simple - two buttons close a 220V circuit to my 220V chime. As long as one of the buttons is pressed, the chime rings (it’s not impulse).  
Diagram: [https://imgur.com/a/ccWocDK](https://imgur.com/a/ccWocDK)

What I want to achieve is to use Shelly relay to send me notifications when someone ring the doorbell.

The question is which Shelly relay model to use and how exactly to wire it, considering the whole circuit is 220V. 

I have access to the chime. I can run another 220V line to the Shelly if needed. I can insert AC/DC convertor before the chime, but not before the buttons.

I don’t have access to the buttons and I cannot change the current to the whole circuit.

At some point I will remove the chime and use only the automation, so using modified sensors on the chime itself is not an option.

I prefer Shelly solution because I can flash it to work with Homekit.",6,"['badoctet: I did basically exactly the same, I used a Shelly1 and fed 220VAC to the SW input. The 220VAC goes live when the doorbell buzzer rings. The Shelly1 calls a url of the ffmpeg plugin on Homebridge, which is configured as a HomeKit video doorbell, with a motion gif as the video feed. This then generates a „Somebody range the doorbell“ native HomeKit notification.  I also used the same Shelly1 to activate the door-opener buzzer, so I can buzz people in. Works really well.  The Shelly1 needs to be permanently powered, so if you have 220VAC close to the chime circuit, this will be easy for you.', 'ElegantlyWasted3: So I have to wire the Shelly like this:\n\nL&N - Permanent 220V AC\n\nSW&L - Button 220V AC\n\n0&I - Chime\n\nIs that correct?', 'badoctet: No. You do not want to control the chime with the relay 1/0 contacts. You want the 220VAC chime to control the Shelly1 via the SW input. WARNING be very sure that the chime does indeed have mains voltage on the chime. Use a multimeter. I isolated my chime to Shelly connection using a relay as my chime was 10 VAC when ringing. So I used an 8 VAC relay. Isolation between circuits is important. If you power the Shelly1 from the same mains feed as the chime, then isolation is less important.', 'ElegantlyWasted3: Yep, pretty sure - 220V on the chime as soon as I press the button. \n\nOkay so:\n\nL&N: Permanent 220V AC  \nSW: 220V AC from the chime\n\nCorrect?', 'badoctet: Yep, as long as the permanent 220V is from the same circuit breaker or fused supply as the chime is on.', 'ElegantlyWasted3: Thank mate, you are the best!']"

I'm presently running a home system which has 5 Phylink outdoor POE cameras, and I'm looking to replace and add to my home environment.

Presently, the cameras have an internal SD card  which is recorded to on motion trigger. Once the recording is complete, the camera FTPs the video to an internal server for storage, and deletes the video on the SD card. My POE switches are on battery backups which will allow for 36 hours of recording to SSD, and when my home server comes back online, the videos are dumped to the FTP server.

I am able to view the cameras live on a website I created which has a composite of all the .mjpeg outputs, and each of the cameras can be monitored separately with flash (bleh, I know, they're old), or streaming. These cameras are fine for now, but no longer available, and I would like to start replacing them with some higher fidelity cameras with some better features.

One thing I like about these cameras is their simplicity in configuration, with each of them hosting a web site for configuration. I can set motion capture areas, ftp site negotiation, and everything else without the need for an app or installation, and I really value that.

Does anybody presently produce a camera with this feature? I'm not really looking to replace my current environment, as it's functioned nicely for years. I just want to get some newer hardware.

Hello everyone!I have a samsung heat pump (air-water) installed. It heats or chill the water in inertia tank. I also have a firewood water boiler (fireplace) heating the inertia tank water in winter. It’s a double coil tank. The inertia tank send hot or cold water to daikin fancoils and heater elements for towels, and when it has hot water, send it to the hot water tank for baths, etc., and this tank is heated by water solar panel, heating element (disconnected for now) and inertia thank. I have thermostats starting circulation pumps and for that part (hot water tank) it works fine.My problem is that I have the heat pump controlled by a radio thermostat that reads only the temperature of the room I have it. It’s an Elesta RTU300B, and it’s connected to the samsung heat pump thermostat (controlled by the Elesta one)All works at 220v.For now, the working mode is:

* Heat pump or fireplace heat the inertia water
* When water gets hot (50ºC), the fancoils circulation pump starts delivering hot water to them
* Elesta thermostat reaches temperature setpoint and shuts down heat pump or water in fireplace gets cold, circulation pump from fireplace or heat pump turns off, and fancoils make the inertia water temperature drop, because they don’t stop.
* Inertia themperature drops 10 to 15ºC until heat pump gets Elesta thermostat order to start or the water in fireplace boiler is got enough to start it circulation pump.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, I have some issues:

* The Elesta thermostat only allow hourly programming. And it only measures one room temperature.
* The Elesta thermostat only sends turn on/off signals to heat pump.
* Daikin fancoils work all time, even if their circuit circulation pump stops because of too low/high water temperature.
* Daikin fancoils are split units, only controlled by IR remote, with only one on and one off schedule possible, and only hour based, but I’m working on them.

So, what I’m thinking is to replace the Elesta thermostat with something smart, with preference to ZigBee. And, if possible, using inertia tank temperature sensor values. I read somewhere that Shelly 1 can read wired temperature probes values, is that true? And using water temp does sense to me because I think the heat pump will work a little bit more time but with less energy consumption, just trying to maintain water temperature instead of trying to heat or chill the water as fancoils use it.And I’m trying to controll fancoils with esphome (WeMos D1 mini by wire or IR), and if those don’t work, I’ll use some IR blaster. And I’ll have thermometer/hygrometer placed nearby to read temperatures to give setpoints to shutdown/start fancoils as needed.

My questions:

* Am I thinking right?
* What thermostat to replace the Elesta?
* How to read inertia temperature?

For those who don't know, BOINC is a tool that enables you to donate your computer's spare computational power towards scientific research. Cancer, alzheimers, climate research, you name it, there's a BOINC project for it. And when your computer is computing, it generates heat. It's as efficient as using a space heater or any other form of ""electric resistive"" heating aka anything that's not a heat pump/reverse ac. 1 watt into your computer = 1 watt of heat, same as any space heater, electric baseboard heater, ceiling heat, etc.

In winter, BOINC and Folding at home make up 100% of my indoor heating, and I wrote a script to tie this all to a thermostat. It will turn BOINC on/off depending on the room temp, and if you have multiple machines you can have each at a separate setpoint to give you slightly more granular control than ""off"" vs ""full blast"". The script can pull in data from a web url (what I use), a command-line command, or a custom python function.

Recently, I found myself needing scene-switches for various rooms in my home. There are plenty available, but most of them are regular ""switch-like"" multi-buttons that would require either remembering each button's function, or a label stuck to them.

Instead, I thought of something like below; a small e-ink based button with icons that can be easily altered, or even realtime-data being displayed, like solar-panel energy production or air-quality. This is a quick design I made of what they *could* look like.

I imagine them to be reasonably low-cost and powered by an ESP32-H2, supporting both Zigbee and Thread, with open-source hardware- and software. It could even contain various sensors to provide air-quality or other metrics.

I'm looking for a temp and humidity that has a good battery life in cold - colder temps

I plan to use them to survey fridges and freezers mostly so they need to perform well in the cold but also in a fermentation chamber and several other different uses. They would automate some process such as fans / heating /cooling humidity control +/- etc

Ideally they would have good battery life and %left reporting.

They could also have infrared sensors has an added bonus if such a thing exist all rolled into one or I could

I am installing a home automation network in my house to control the lights and I have a problem with the living room lights.

My idea is to do the installation using **Sonoff Mini switches** (for the rest of the lights)**, Tuya Smart Hub and Alexa Echo Dot** 4th generation.

The problem is that in the living room I want to have **dimmable LED lights, which can be turned on from a normal switch, a dimmer push button and from Alexa or APP**. I can't find any device where I can commute multiple switches, uses Zigbee protocol and is compatible with the rest of the devices. I have only found the SONOFF D1 but I think it is not commutable.

Could you help me or recommend any? I'm open to change anything but the Sonoff Mini Switches because I've already bought them.

My mom was diagnosed spring 2022 and lives alone in a different city, so I started using “smart home tech” to make sure she was ok and can be notified of any issues. While discussing my installation in my local support group, the feedback I received was very interesting and the one thing which stood out was that I was alone thinking this way and using these tools.

From there I documented what I did and converted a hobby into something I hope will prove useful for all in our common context, and published it at [www.alzheimerstech.com](http://www.alzheimerstech.com/). This site is my personal initiative which will hopefully lend a hand to others and there is no commercial angle to this at all.  I simply wish to give back and help.

Any feedback is of course appreciated and feel free to share with anyone or any organization you feel may benefit from this information.

Cheers,

Thanks for taking the time to share it with the world!\n\nOne point about batteries: match the type of battery with the type of device. Alkalines are made for high current devices - motors of any kind, camera flashes whose capacitor needs to recharge quickly, electronics with screens and processors. But there are some electronics out there that use very low currents: infrared remote controls, wall clocks, thermometers... These will benefit from getting the classical zinc-carbon batteries, usually labeled ""long life"" without the ""alkaline"" note. These batteries are cheaper and they hold up very well for years of continuous use, where an alkaline battery would already leak and fill the device with some nasty corrosion. Usually the manufacturer of the device will specify if an alkaline battery is a must; some also specify if NiMH rechargeables are not going to work (they usually have cells at 1.2V instead of the 1.5V of batteries, and some electronics will show very fast a ""low battery"" warning and might not work until you put in some fresh ones).\n\nOn cloud-enabled cameras: watch out about the service limitations.

I just recently acquired my own home and am interested in tinkering around with home automation and homelab kinda things.  I had this 24u cabinet in storage from an old call center that I helped decommission about a decade ago.  The boxes you see, minus the router, had to come out of the rack before I was able to lift the rack into my truck - it was too heavy.  I don't expect to find much use from these boxes, but I do wonder if the cases might be useful.  

https://imgur.com/a/Bi3v6fV

As I mentioned above, the rack is 24u, enclosed on 4 sides and the top.  The bottom is open, and the whole thing is on casters.  Not pictured at this time, an APC power backup unit, and a rack mounted 2 color monitor (green/black), mouse and keyboard.  Neither box has a hard drive, and I think the black box had several riser cards that were removed.  I've not tried to power either of them on, doubt they'll do anything.  The photos of the internals are mostly for documentation/sharing.  This stuff is so old, I don't think there would be any use, even if I could get them working.  

What I want to know - should I bother gutting and saving the cases?  Are these things worth keeping or selling?  The only hair-brained idea I have for either of them is maybe I could eventually fit one of the cases up to be a massive storage server or something.  I've no idea how far down the line that might be though.  

Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.",4,"['TheSoCalledExpert: None of this is really specific to home automation, but the rack is probably the only thing worth salvaging.

A raspberry pi could outperform those boxes. \n\nNow the rack itself on the other hand… a 24U enclosed rack in decent condition (as yours appears to be) is probably worth $100-$300 over on r/homelabsales. \n\nOr, keep the rack and fill it up with whatever goodies you like.

I run sharehouses and have the Arlec Orion Grid Connect Door Lock at the front, which is excellent as it enables fingerprint, pincode and fobs. We almost exclusively use fobs as they can be easily passed to new people who move in, and easily deactivated if someone takes that fob (no key changes). However they require a small second hole drilled into the door, so I was hesitant to put them on the bedroom doors.

Orion have just released the DL021HA, which is a smaller version compatible with standard door knob holes, and I was super excited until I realized it is only fingerprint/key, not pincode or fob. We have massive issues with fingerprints being unreliable and I want to be completely key less, strictly fobs.

I was thinking about getting the Switchbot Tilt for each blind but was wondering if I need to also get the Hub Mini?

I [open sourced](https://github.com/calebolson123/BabySleepCoach) it and wanted to share for those who may be interested in running it in your home (you'll need a baby, although I guess it would work for adults). You just need a camera & a computer.

The baby sleep tracking system (computer vision task largely, [here's the core of that code](https://github.com/calebolson123/BabySleepCoach/blob/924e7b55d3aa36acd706519c446c1172dbbda4a7/main.py#L322)) writes timestamped records of when my baby fell asleep or wakes up. The code is pulling images from my reolink baby camera, and largely just applying heuristics over time to decide whether he's awake/asleep.

I wrote some JavaScript as part of a web app I have running on my raspberry pi to generate some charts so I can see how his sleep is changing over time. [Here's an example of what that visual looks like](https://imgur.com/BdwBoeG) (orange is awake, blue is asleep).

The door to our nursery is always closed when the baby is sleeping and always left open when the baby is awake. So I put a door sensor on the nursery door and whenever its closed or open for 5 minutes, the state of the baby sleeping switches. This information flows into a timer which is displayed in the kitchen which we reference constantly. It also exports to a Google Sheet where we can keep track of all sleep data. It's not a true sleep tracker like you've made here (nice work), but its been really robust given its simplicity."", ""GoochCommander: Ah interesting, yeah that's probably even more reliable if you guys are consistent w/ the door handling.

1676909666.0,20-Feb-2023 08:14:26,Three Years with a Control4 Home Automation System Update,Just_Learning_Guy,23,117bss9,homeautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/117bss9/three_years_with_a_control4_home_automation/,"I have had my Control4 system for three years.  Every year I report back to Reddit on my evaluation so far.  First, I will list what my system is made of and then Pros/Cons.

**My system**: I designed it based on years of DIY home automation projects.  

* My home was being built so I could finally wire my home properly.  
* I cannot emphasize enough the general rule. When you can use wires, it is better than WiFi or Wireless.  
* Because of many issues in the past, I wanted the same brand in as many components as possible.  That brand was Control4.  I really hated when something went wrong on a system and one company blamed another company.  
* I have Five TV's, Three Thermostats, Five Deadbolt Locks, High-End Video door Bell, 28 automated window shades, three wall touchscreens, three handheld remotes, security system and every single light switch in the home: all under the Control4 system. 
* In our rack, we have a Battery Back Up for the occasional blackouts.
* The system is set up for remote updates and access by the installer. 
* I own and utilize a Control4 Owner Program called ""Composer HE"". The HE means Home Edition.  This allows me to change, alter and improve most aspects of my system myself.  I rarely even need to call my installer and when I do, I simply ask a question. 
* **TV's:** Four are Samsung Frame TV's and one is a SunBright.  
* **The Shades:** They are all Screen Innovation ""Boxes"" with four being dual boxes that include blackout and shades in the same unit. The shades are rechargeable never having to replace a battery or take the unit down. 
* **Lights**:  I choose to use individual switches from Control4.  Some are light switches that dim.  Others have four to six buttons that also control macro functions of the home system.
* **Not On the System:** The Garage Door and the smoke detectors which are the only items that have separate apps on my phone. 

**Pros**: 

* **WiFi Access Points:**  This is first on my list for a reason.  My wife hated losing signal while in bed.  I have a four floor 2,800 ft townhome with two outside living areas.  Every single floor has a wired access point that is centrally located.  The quality is upper end because of the issues my family has had in the past.  One of my installers was an IT expert and his design was on point.  Never an issue, never a problem.
* **My Professional Installer:**  First I did a makeshift diagram.  Second, I listed in great detail what I wanted to have my system to do being very realistic.  Third, I wrote a manual with all this information.  Fourth, I did an excel spreadsheet of every single component.  Fifth, I interviewed six companies.  Five local and one out of state.  Sixth, I choose the company that did not lie to me and told me many of my thoughts were off base with solutions, often that would cost me more for the right reason were better.  My installer was not the most expensive or least expensive. 
* **Remote Controls**: On system that controls everything. This means that every remote control looks and works the same.  This is much more important for my family than for me especially my wife. 
* **Making Adjustments**: Composer HE allows me to make updates, changes, macro's, messaging, and most all adjustments.  This is the best part of this system for me.  My wife can be completely nut's especially on the shades.  If I had to call the installer each time, she wanted to change something I would be bankrupt. 
* **Messaging**: I have added a email massage to message that tells me when any of the door locks need a battery change.  This is done when it has 20% battery left. I also have a notification if a lock attempts to lock and does not. 
* **Everything Works:**  I rarely have an issue.  If I do it usually is fixed with a system reboot.  99% of all issues I can fix myself with simple troubleshooting.  
* **Shades by Screen Innovations:**  The Nano Boxes are the bomb.  I looked at every type and brand of window shades.  I read everything written about the pros/cons.  These bad boys were simple to install, two had to be replaced and it was simple to do so.  The coordination of wireless signals has not been an issue.  I had a separate installer for this shade brand because My Control4 installer did not represent that product. 
* **The Control4 Video Doorbell:**  This item is very expensive but works GREAT within the system.  I added a macro that unlocks the doors, turns on the porch light, turns on the entry light and relocks the door after 30 seconds.  The video intercom works perfectly with the wall Touchscreens.  
* **Control4 Thermosets:**  Most third-party Thermostats send the request to the cloud and the cloud sends it back to the Thermastat.  This sometimes takes time.  The Control4 unit is instant.  It makes a difference. 
* **Coordination with the Security System:**  A computer board is put into the Honeywell Vista system so the security system can work in the Control4 system.  This is the first home that every single night, the security system is engaged.  
* **Macro Wall Buttons:**  I love messing with macros.  We have a lectern on either side of our beds that have six buttons.  Hit a button, lots of things happen instantly.  Morning wakes the home up; Evening shuts the house down; snack turns light on to the kitchen and turns them off in 15 minutes; bathroom does the same for walking past for night bathroom breaks.  the list goes on.  We have these kinds of buttons on the walls on each floor.  
* **RoKu vs. Apple TV:** I was an Apple TV guy until I got RoKu.  Apple TV makes it hard for these system to work together and RoKu makes it much easier.  I would never use Apple TV again. 

**Cons**:

* **Hand Held Touch-Screen:**  The issue is the battery life not the unit.  The unit looks and works exactly like the wall mounted wired touch screen.  If you leave this unit off the docking station for a couple of hours, it needs a charge.  
* **Choose of Video Matrix:**  My mess up completely here.  Learn from my mistake.  I choose a Control4 Video Matrix that allowed for 5 TV's and thought I did the right thing.  What I did not realize was one of the inputs was HDMI.  I also have no room for expansion so my Master Bath TV is simply a WiFi Smart TV and not on the system because there is no room for it in the current matrix. 
* **Music**: I did not think I would enjoy music as much as I do.  So, I only put ceiling speakers in my Living room, master bath and two outdoor locations.  I should have wired all bedrooms.
* **TV**: I should have put a TV in the Master Bathroom and wired it to the system. 
* **Wiring**: I did several things wrong or not complete with wiring. I did not wire the shades which would have eliminated having to recharge the shades twice a year. I only put three CAT6 wires behind each TV vs. 4.  I did not use the installer to do the wiring so the length of the wires at both ends could and should have been longer. I did not put enough speaker wires in the ceiling. 
* **Lighting**: Some recessed lights were not compatible with one of the Control4 options of inwall sight switches.  I fixed this problem by replacing the ceiling recessed LCD lights with a better unit or using the more expensive Control4 Switch unit which was a bit expensive and overkill. 
* **Ipad/Iphones As Remote Controls:** This is not a Control4 issue.  I tried to cheap out on the number of remote controls hoping that Iphones could get the job done.  They work fine but take time just to open the program because they are not dedicated to the system.  I ended up getting a few more of the Neo Control4 remote controls based on my wife's request.  
* **Placement of Thermastat:**  I put the unit in the power room in my kitchen great room area.  It should have been in the great room.  My mistake and so we have to keep the power room door open for the temperature to work properly.  
* **Video Camaras:**  I did not wire for them with the exception of my Video Doorbell.  I should have had one in the front, back and roof (We have a roof deck) and cheapen out.  
* **Garage Door:**  Control4 does not have a decent solution for Garage Door controls within the system.  The have a way to make it work but it is not a fix for me.  I hope they will have a solution in the future. 
* **Automated Shades**:  Every window should have only blackout shades.  My wife refused to do this and now wishes she did.  Too late.  You can see out and in even with 95% sunblock.  My mistake for not overriding her.  I knew better. 

**Conclusion**:  

Most of the con's in my system was there because of me.  No matter how much you think you know, you are missing something the experts can solve.  I also messed up not using the installation company for all of my wiring.  Live and learn.  Yet, the biggest lesson was pro's that know what they are doing eliminate many of the issues I messed up in my past projects.  That is hard to admit for someone as detailed as I am.  

As you can see, I would have done somethings differently, but most did not affect my overall satisfaction with the project.  Did I pay to much, yep.  Do I regret it, nope.  Why?  This is my last home and I just wanted once in my life to do it right from the start.  No regrets and most importantly, my wife can use the system and only complains a few times a year.  This is better than every day like before.

Got a question, I will answer it.  Just be nice and considerate with those questions.  Before you ask the main question, I will answer it here.

You probably can’t power that with one power supply, in one long run.\n\nStart small (don’t go for 100ft from the start), and learn about LED strips, and especially their power requirements.\n\nThe forums on [Pixelblaze](https://www.bhencke.com/pixelblaze) are a good place to start.\n\nChoose wisely!', 'flobbie1: I recommend going with the sk6812 strips.

I am very new to home-automation and IoT stuff - please bear with me.

I just ordered a Somfy Tahoma Switch to remote control our shades - which is its primary use-case. The Switch supports Zigbee 3.0 and can act as a hub for various products using this standard.

But what does this mean exactly? For example, I am looking at some temperature and humidity sensors that support Zigbee 3.0 in order to connect them to the Switch. Most of those will say that they need a specific hub or their own app to work (e.g. Aquara Temperature Sensor). Is that just marketing lingo to get me to order their brand-specific hubs?
What would be the point of Zigbee or any standard if I need specific hubs and apps to connect to these devices, especially since there are few manufacturers that can cover all areas of a home, meaning you'd end up with many hubs, each for one brand?

I'll eventually get the entire house wired up for hard wired network connectivity, so this assumes I'm at that stage and the extra installation costs are negligible

I've seen Reolink who sell smart PoE doorbells for around £90. Eufy sell a hard wired one for around £150 or so

Let's assume that the specifications of both were the exact same except for the fact that Reolink has PoE. Realistically what's the difference between PoE and hard wired?

The main advantages appear to be that you don't need a dedicated socket, and that latency is much reduced but realistically, doorbells don't need to be ""real time"" I mean, really who cares if there's even a 1000ms delay between someone pressing the doorbell and you heading it?

It may sound like an odd thing to do, but with two WFH setups, plenty of expensive commercial gear for our jobs, regular entertaining of guests, and children in the home it has always been a gripe for us to manage access to rooms. Curious and potentially drunken minds will be.

Traditional locks are generally forgotten from our experience, so to complement our complete smart home automation it feels like this investment has become a necessity.

There are two options that stick out to me for the doors themselves; the Aperio H100 and the Paxton door handles which seem to align the closest with what we'd like to deploy.

The hard requirements are:
-	RFID compatible [both of the resident adults have RFID implants, and any sleeping over guests/children will be given festival-style wristbands with a tag attached - we already have plenty of these - unless y'all have a better idea 😅]
-	Existing doors with mortice latches can be easily retrofitted without too much modification to either the door or the strike plate.
-	Can be centrally managed with an EAC of sorts to issue new tags/mobile access/timers etc., I'm completely open to options here but I'd shy away from anything too proprietary for integration's sake. I'd likely end up wanting to write some code to bridge it into HomeKit/Hass/Control4 etc.
-	Fire code compliant in the UK, all exit routes must have no more than one mechanical operation to open. I'm only interested in securing entry, not exit, so this should be fine.
-	Not ugly af if possible, it's a relatively period home, so keeping to a sleek/discreet aesthetic is awesome. I'd also like to avoid a tonne of rewiring, wireless/battery-operated is acceptable as long as they fail to an open state.

---

If anyone knows of a good ecosystem to fit this use-case, or any anecdotes around attempting the same style of deployment, I'd love to hear them!

The options I can see from initial searches  range in the £500/per door region which I'd like to pull down to £200 or less.
I'd also be interested in cabinet/cupboard locking, if it's in the same ecosystem, that's be sweet.

1676707699.0,18-Feb-2023 00:08:19,Fixing a software bug in a digital power meter by correcting SML messages on the fly?,GoofAckYoorsElf,17,115accj,homeautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/115accj/fixing_a_software_bug_in_a_digital_power_meter_by/,"Hey everyone, I'm affected by a bug in the software of my digital power meter (DZG DxS74) where below 655.36 watts the value is read as negative. This is a known bug that - to my knowledge - can only be fixed by replacing the power meter. That's not actually an option since I'm not the owner of the house but only a tenant, and my landlord isn't really interested in fixing the problem. Due to the bug I cannot use an SML reader to enjoy hourly billing, I cannot optimize my power consumption to favor periods of low prices/low demand.

So I'm wondering... SML is just digital data. The reader is attached to the power meter by means of a magnet, the data is transmitted via infrared serial. I'm wondering if I could build a device that comes in between the power meter serial interface and the reader that just intercepts the signal, corrects the error and sends the corrected data to the reader.

I think my actual question is if there already exists such a man-in-the-middle device or if I would have to build it all by myself. The biggest challenge for me would be to create the PCB. I'm a software engineer with quite some additional CAD experience, but I've never created a custom PCB so far.

What's your opinion on this? Is it feasible, does it make sense?",33,"[""ralphofages: Could you provide a link to the device you are talking about, or maybe some pictures of it or something.

They would assume that the purpose of the modification is to falsify the measurement and to pay less money.  It seems likely that there is a law to prohibit this.', ""Zarukh: From a legal standpoint I am rather sure it'll be a bad idea. While it'll certainly be possible to fix wrong values and send onwards the corrected ones, if you provide these to the power company to bill you hourly, it could be taken as modified/falsified power consumption reports. Theoretically, nothing would stop you to just report lower consumption than you actually use. I'd say you talk to the power company first and see whether they are okay with this in the first place. Otherwise it can get really expensive really fast for you."", 'UnintelligentSlime: You can get IR receivers and transmitters pretty cheap I think. There are plenty of arduino libraries for decoding/encoding, as well as circuit diagrams. Then it’s just about reverse engineering the protocol. \n\nAs others have said, I would be cautious about altering what the meter receives. Instead, perhaps only use the receiver, to collect an alternate report to send.', 'Exitcomestothis: If the value is read as a negative, couldn’t you add some code (in whatever system you’re using to read and parse the data) to make it a positive number if the value is below 655.36?', ""Formal_Star_6593: Do you mean a smart meter put ton the outside of the house/unit to measure consumption?  If so, any messing around with a these new meters will trigger a tamper alarm at the utility.  Don't go there.\n\nTo fix this so-called bug, just have the account holder call the utility.  It's  simple swap of the device, no messing around."", 'GoofAckYoorsElf: True. However, see my other comment about the total consumption being transmitted as well. I can\'t cheat the system with faked values even if I wanted to. All I\'m doing is fixing a meta information about the data type of one field. The actual bits and the sum over time remain the same. There might be a law against that. But does that even apply if I do not manipulate the data itself, and am furthermore dealing with a device that has a software flaw that they don\'t seem to be willing to fix? Almost a question ""right to repair"".', ""GoofAckYoorsElf: Fair enough. However, there's still the total consumption that wouldn't match up if I did something like that. Only thing I could do to cheat was to shift my daily consumption around to always have the high consumption during the cheap hours. But that would require some sophisticated predictions of my daily consumption to make sure that the values add up by the end of the year. Considering the total that is also transmitted, it'd be very difficult to cheat the system."", 'GoofAckYoorsElf: Right. The problem is that my energy provider only accepts their own reader. So I would have to buy a reader and build a ""writer"" if you will that the reader of my energy provider would attach to. A man-in-the-middle that simply corrects the flaw and keeps the rest as it is.', ""GoofAckYoorsElf: Right. That's my point. I could if I had access to either the code of the reader or the code of the power meter. Unfortunately I don't."", 'GoofAckYoorsElf: Not a smart meter, just a digital power meter without direct internet access. The extraction and transmission of the data is carried out by a small IR transceiver that is mounted to the IR port of the power meter. It reads the data sent by the power meter through the IR interface and sends the data, consistent of momentary energy usage (in Watts) and total absolute consumption (in kWh) to my electricity provider. The problem is that the signedness of the momentary consumption is wrong. Below 655.36 Watts the values are interpreted as negative values which is plain wrong.', 'squigish: Your arguments seem completely reasonable, and morally correct, but in my experience large organizations like utilities are typically unpersuaded by reason or morals. It\'s much easier for them to just say ""no"" than to allow you to reach someone whose job involves applying logical reasoning to make the rules, rather than simply apply them slavishly, and pay for that person\'s time to listen to you. Indeed, such a person may not even exist.', ""Zarukh: I didn't think of the total consumption being transmitted accurately, my bad there. I'd still check in with the power company to be safe, it's still changing data transmitted by a power meter, faulty from the start or not. Legally there is unfortunately no differentiation between good or bad faith modifications as far as I know, and should it come to the attention of your provider, it's up to them whether they'd let it slip or actually charge you on principle."", 'UnintelligentSlime: No, to be clear, I am explicitly not recommend you to MitM the energy company. Do not send the alternate report to their reader, instead just keep it for your own purpose and send it to them if you are billed incorrectly.\n\nAnything else is a lawsuit waiting to happen, even if you would be in the right, it is surely illegal to alter the data sent to their reader.', 'Exitcomestothis: How are you getting the data from it?\n\nSorry for asking mundane questions, but I’m unfamiliar with that device, software, purpose, etc.\n\nIf you’re connecting to it via a serial cable, you could try using a serial analyzer that reads the raw data?\n\nIf you’re connecting to it using an API through the web, that would make things significantly easier and open some doors pretty quickly.', 'Atworkwasalreadytake: I think the “ask forgiveness not permission” clause comes into effect here.', 'MaterLachrymarum: The right way to do it is get a class action lawsuit going (or threaten one seriously by getting at least a petition started) because the meter is transmitting faulty data.

I think for my own needs it's sufficient to have the corrected value locally. As long as the energy provider does not miscalculate my bills due to the wrong readings and demands a large payment of arrears by the end of the year, I'm fine with that. Just a bummer that the app itself also shows the wrong values and I suppose due to that I aso cannot trust the projected bill of the current month (variable price). I'll have to build my own because of the unwillingness of the manufacturers to fix a tiny error."", ""GoofAckYoorsElf: You mean how am I personally reading the data from the device? The app on the phone shows the extracted data (also false negative value on consumption) and the provider has an API that I can call, which also sends the wrong consumption. \n\nI *can* correct the value that's coming out of the API.

In the jurisdiction where I live, altering electric billing data, or interfering with its collection, is a felony.', ""GoofAckYoorsElf: Question is, who's responsible for this bug? If the data type is part of the SML protocol, it might be the manufacturer of the power meter who's to blame, not the manufacturer of the reader. And I'm not sure if I want to be the one to throw the two in the ring."", 'UnintelligentSlime: Good. In that case, it’s a pretty easy build, there are plenty of diagrams out there for making a simple ir receiver- I would just get an arduino nano and a couple of jumper wires, look up how to wire up a receiver, and figure out where you want to log to. Probably best for persisting the data would be a web server of some sort, which may be easier with a full arduino than a nano. You could even use a raspberry pi for easy log persistence, but the diagrams for wiring up the receiver and the code might be a little harder to find.', 'Exitcomestothis: Gotcha.\n\nSince they have an API, I would write a small script either in Python or JS and simply correct the negative value at that stage, and then forward that data to whatever service you’re using to optimize your power usage, I.e.

The bits themselves remain the same. My solution would just correct the way they are interpreted, the meta information.\n\nActually, I'm not even sure why this bug exists at all. Is the data type of the fields part of the protocol? Because if it wasn't how can this be a bug in the producing device? It would just send a data stream and the consumer would have to interpret it.

I suppose for the remaining requirements a simple software solution should suffice, like I said, as long as my provider does not calculate the bills wrong themselves because of the wrong data type. The data itself (the bit stream) should be good; it's just the signedness of the value below a certain threshold that's wrong. So I guess I'm sticking with reading the value provided by their API and correcting that instead of correcting the value from the power meter directly. For my needs that should do for now...

They call it ""hubless"" but it really means ""hub you don\'t own or control"".   \n\nThere are some wifi devices that use local APIs, the most common of which (for now*) is the MQTT API. Shelley uses it as does the Tasmota software which can be used to overwrite some wifi devices\' operating system.  However you then need something to give the devices commands (aka a hub)\n\nZwave and Zigbee are ""full stack"" standards. They describe the radios, network layers, security model, access control, and command APIs.  Zwave requires certification, zigbee doesn\'t which means zwave devices have a higher ""just works"" factor but zigbee is usually a few bucks cheaper per gizmo. Z-wave is also certified for use in security systems (ring, vivint, alarm.com, etc)\n\nZwave and zigbee are both mesh networks that do not use tcp/ip.  This means that they cannot carry or be infected by normal computer viruses. Both are ultra-low bandwidth, short range networks to maximize battery life. Zwave operates on 900Mhz (used by some cordless phones, baby monitors) while zigbee uses 2.4Ghz (used by wifi, Bluetooth, thread, microwaves, etc). \n\nThread is a TCP/IP-based mesh radio that runs at 2.4Ghz and is also a low-bandwidth network to provide good battery life.  It does NOT include the command APIs, meaning thread devices can be on the same network but may not interoperate. (Think of an Xbox and a Nintendo Switch on the same wifi network; they can\'t talk to each other because they don\'t share any APIs)\n\n*Matter is an API that runs on WiFi and Thread that supports local control...ish. \nCommands and functions defined by the Matter standard can be run locally but devices are allowed to have unsupported features use a separate API which is usually cloud-based. We see that now with Matter smartplugs unable to support power monitoring without using a separate (cloud-powered) API. Basic on/off commands can be used over the Matter API but finding wattage consumed requires giving the device internet access and pulling the data off a cloud server.  \n\nSo local-ish.\n\nMatter is a joint venture by Samsung/Apple/Google/Amazon. (SAGA). They effectively used a giant bucket of money to mostly co-opt the organization that operated Zigbee (the CSA).  SAGA are essentially super-members of the CSA with special voting rights due to the giant bucket of money. Anyone else who ants the same rights will need to bring their own bucket of money. They also raised the price of the lower memberships, which cuts down the amount of rabble they have to deal with.\n\nCurrently there is varying support for Matter devices on SAGA platforms (Apple Homekit, Google Nest, Amazon Alexa and Samsung SmartThings) hubs for Matter devices. Unlike mqtt, there are various security features of Matter that make it complicated to implement in controllers so at the moment, only SAGA  are selling Matter controllers. \n\nWhich doesn\'t mean much as there only like 3 Matter devices on the market with a couple more at the pre-order stage. However since Matter has the backing of SAGA it will be a large part of any conversation about wifi devices as the potential for Matter is very high. \n\nConversely, being a spec designed by a committee of billion dollar companies with competing and often opposing goals, it is vulnerable to becoming the lowest-common denominator, where devices support a bare minimum of functionality over Matter while the cool stuff is locked behind a vendor-specific API.  It is also possible that new features will only be allowed in the standard based on the development speed of the slowest SAGA manufacturer. \n\nIMO, the net result will be in 3 years the most common wifi devices (plugs, bulbs, light switches, etc) will be Matter. They will be safer than the current crop of vendor-specific APIs and they won\'t become totally useless when a manufacturer shuts down their cloud. It won\'t completely eliminate cloud dependencies as long as fancy features are excluded from the Matter spec and security risks will still exist from those extra APIs.\n\nHowever I suspect it will take 10 years for Matter to reach feature parity with zigbee and it will never reach feature parity with z-wave as they will likely never get security-system certified.\n\nMatter will likely introduce some functions that aren\'t possible with zigbee/zwave (i.e. voice assistant, TV integration) but we will have to see how useful those are. \n\nIt is almost certain that the things Matter will be ideal for (i.e. video doorbells) will be huge points of contention as Apple will  want the video to never leave the home while Amazon will want to add it to their Ring camera system to sell the data to police departments.', 'siegmour: This is why advice like this can be very confusing and misleading, much like the HomeKit routers can offer a false sense of security. \n\nYes, these devices are ZigBee, but they all connect to the main hub which is connected to your router. The hub itself can transmit data, unless you block it from internet access via router firewall settings. If you do that, you won’t have things like firmware updates for the devices.']"

Hello, I want to have my tv turn on at a certain time in the morning and play in shuffle mode some videos.

I don't know what is Nest.

I have the Google Home App on an Android phone.

\- Way 1:  Ideally I would like this to be by playing videos located in a USB stick attached to the TV. I have no idea how to do this.

\- Way 2: Play a youTube playlist.  

I have been successful with Way 2, by creating a routine that has step 1: turn on TV and step 2: custom action. Then in the custom action I have typed: PLAY YOUTUBE <Channel name> <playlistname> on Android TV

This has sort of worked, but it always starts with the first video and does not play in shuffle mode. I have tried inserting the word shuffle in the syntax, and the result has been disastrous. With the word shuffle included it just looks for any video on youtube that has names matching my playlist name plus the word shuffle.

Even the syntax I've used does not work with all playlists and channels...  For example if you create a new playlist, it won't work because I think it does a straight forward search in youtube and new items don't show up in results.

If  you have any ideas of how I could do this please give me step by step instructions. I'm total novice.

I have a ton of ThirdReality Zigbee Devices and use the pushbutton switches that snap onto regular switches.  If you own one of these they are great for switching the light switch without wiring in a new switch.

I created a 3D Print that solves all that.

I still don't plan on expanding it beyond a few switches and lamps (<10 devices) so I initially wanted to stay on WiFi. So I really don't want unknown firmwares running in my network, I really want to flash everything that I run.

I mostly shop my devices on Aliexpress because it's much cheaper than buying locally, but I'm starting to have a hard time figuring out if a device is compatible with Tasmota or anything similar. But most Zigbee devices I can find reviews reporting good compatibility with Zigbee2MQTT or similar.

After reading about Zigbee, I read that I can flash Tasmota on the Sonoff Zigbee Bridge, which is super cool. And I started think about ditching WiFi devices to avoid any incompatibility problems (with open-source firmwares).

I'm aware I can find Tuya compatible devices and integrate them with Home Assistant using localtuya, but that feels a bit too hacky/sketchy too me, but I'm not fully against it (I think).

My plans are 3 power monitors, 1~2 RGBCCT lamps, and a switch panel, and I'm going to install them in my bedroom and kitchen, which are not super close together, my server is next to my bedroom. I currently only need to replace a lamp ASAP and I really want it RGBCCT.  I plan on using Home Assistant (I currently just manage my lamps directly). The main reason I'm not commiting to Zigbee right now is because I don't really wanna deal with the setup right now, I'm sure I'll use it in the future as I get more into automation.

So here a my questions:

- How often are random Aliexpress devices full incompatible with any open-source WiFi firmwares?
- Is localtuya good enough to be used as a ""backup"" solution if I end up buying something I can't find a firmware for it?
- Is Zigbee okay for a decent sized house use few devices?
- How often are random Aliexpress devices full incompatible with any Zigbee solutions (zigbee2mqtt and similar)?

Any thoughts or suggestions?",11,"['Chuckles6969: Hey there, you\'ve got some interesting verbiage that makes me think you might not have a great grasp on what you are trying to do. That\'s fine, we all started somewhere but I am going to try to address some things then make recommendations at the end.\n\n1. Zigbee vs Tuya vs Tasmota etc : My understanding is tuya operates on its own a little bit, there is some overlap with zigbee but you can\'t bank on it 100%. I have purposefully stayed away from tuya as I\'ve heard some less than favorable reviews and I\'ve had no issue finding zigbee alternatives. Tasmota is a firmware that can be flashed on ESP devices and while you can really go above and beyond to connect zigbee2tasmota, I don\'t know why you would. Tasmota tends to be on WIFI, not Zigbee, in my limited experience.\n2. Zigbee is local. Tasmota is local. Zigbee product bridges might not be. You shouldn\'t plan to flash tasmota on zigbee devices, I don\'t think it accomplishes anything for you.\n3. Power Monitoring: I could be wrong on this but power monitoring will be a pretty constant stream of data, I do not think zigbee is well suited for this. It might overload your zigbee network as you get more devices.\n4. Zigbee range: You asked about zigbee for a ""decent"" sized house. There is no way to know without more info. If you have a zigbee device plugged into power (not battery) it will act as a router and extend your signal. You may benefit from spreading out some bulbs or plugs.\n5. You keep referring to aliexpress products as if they are aliexpress branded, there are a lot of random brands but Zigbee is a standardized protocol and should be standard across many products as long as it says Zigbee. \n6. "" I read that I can flash Tasmota on the Sonoff Zigbee Bridge "" This one doesn\'t make a lot of sense to me, sure you -can- (after a quick google) but I don\'t know why you would.  I use a Sonoff Zigbee USB 3 Dongle (I think P is the usb 3.0 one) with Zigbee2MQTT, not sure what benefit tasmota would introduce here. I really don\'t think you run a risk of a compromised stick but other zigbee devices won\'t need to be flashed as they won\'t have internet connection. \n\nAlright, hopefully that wasn\'t too rough. I am not an expert but just trying to help :)\n\nRecommendations time:\n\n1. Zigbee vs Tuya : I went zigbee route and have no regrets. I started with the hubzsb mixed Z-wave / Zigbee stick and had issues. Switched to a ConbeeII and had issues. Switched to the Sonoff USB 3.0 zigbee dongle with Zigbee2MQTT and it has been great.\n2. RGBCCT : It sounds like you already have lamps so maybe  a bulb would be better but if you are looking for a RGBCCT LED controller I used a Gledopto Zigbee RGBCCT led controller and it\'s been fine. They have wifi versions, zigbee versions, different LED types, and power settings. read carefully before you order.\n3.  I use a sonoff S31 (wifi not zigbee) with tasmota for my smart switches with power monitoring. \n4. I have had no issue with many Aqara Zigbee products from Aliexpress. Not sure if this helps as alternatives to Tuya.\n5. You mention incompatibilities.

Most Zigbee ones you can scroll the reviews and find someone saying that device worked with ZHA or zigbee2mqtt, which is reassuring.\n\nI was expecting people to share any experiences buying stuff from there, may someone bought a bunch of things and always managed to find a firmware for it, maybe someone found a really unusual chip that no project supports. Stuff like that.\n\nMigrating to Zigbee, while being on a more expensive side for a super simple setup I\'m looking for, would make shopping and setup much easier in the future. So I was kinda expectng someone to just say ""I\'ve bought multiple lamps from Ali, always managed to get a custom firmware to work on it"".\n\nWhat I ended up doing is getting 2 WiFi power meters from Athom and a local retailer RGBCCT lamp that I found in the compatible devices list for Tasmota (the only company in that list that sells their stuff here in Brazil).\n\n> "" I read that I can flash Tasmota on the Sonoff Zigbee Bridge "" This one doesn\'t make a lot of sense to me, sure you -can- (after a quick google) but I don\'t know why you would.\n\nThe reason I wanted that is to fully run on open-source software.

I was originally looking to purchase the Ring doorbell (wired) as well as the Ring spotlights (wired) for the front driveway and rear garden, as a cheaper option then having a full CCTV system in place.

The subscription fee (around £80)  isn't a huge issue for me although a cheaper / free one would be better. My main concerns with the spotlights are, especially for the garden one, I would like to have a physical switch which I could turn on the spotlight with, as well as having the motion activation aspect of it.  


I know you can turn it on with the app, but that would mean having everyone in the household to have the app installed.   


I'm not not too clued up on the available products out there, hoping someone could suggest some that could do the above. Currently getting the house re-wired so this would be the perfect time to get something installed.  


TIA",3,"[""Suprflyyy: >I would like to have a physical switch which I could turn on the  spotlight with, as well as having the motion activation aspect of it.\n\nWhat home automation hub or software are you using?  For Home Assistant, the Ring devices could still work.  I have full local control of mine.  You just use a zigbee or z-wave switch and set up an automation that turns on the light for x time if you press up on the switch. You could also have a privacy toggle that shuts off the power to the camera and light in certain circumstances, but automatically powers the camera back on at a certain time of the evening.  That's definitely better than putting tape over the switch to make sure no one turns it off.  I assume that the options are similar using other hubs or systems.\n\nHere's a snip of the control interface I have for one of my floodlight cams:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5btojohuytia1.jpeg?width=647&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=803240dfd38477a5cdfd5e3ab2f4891e77ce5917"", 'Upstairs_Push8025: Tbh its in a new house which i am doing up, not living there just yet.

It's pretty easy to expand once you get started and there's no limit.  Also you'll find home assistant users are somewhat of an evangelical cult.  We're all very happy with our projects.

Wi-Fi has high peak current draw during transmissions which results in needing to use bulky batteries like CR123, CR2, or alkaline batteries.

I was hoping anyone would have suggestions for me. I'm looking for:

* An intercom or doorbel ""combination"" that has a relay (i.e. door-opener)
* PoE connectivity (the front door is two floors lower and I doubt WiFi is strong enough to have a reliable connection;
* Access management, e.g. RFID tag
* Integrations, e.g. Homey
* Indoor screen, but this may be an unrelated tablet too, as long as there's a clear ""calling"" screen when the doorbell rings, not just a notification
* It has to work in a non-smart way as well; so even if the internet goes down, I'd have to be able to answer calls and open the door using the internal network

The only two options I found are **DoorBird** and **Hikvision.** However, Hikvision lacks proper integration with other systems and Doorbird... the app is just plain ugly (but it might work)

I've also been looking to **UniFi Doorbel G4 Pro**, which features RFID access management, a fingerprint sensor and integrations with Homey. The app looks good too, however I feel like I need an entire setup with Access Control here which might get super complicated.

Lastly, the **Fibaro Intercom** is possible, but needs a lot of space to be built in the wall (which I doubt I have)

If anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear it!",0,[]

I would like to create my one intercom system using gstreamer software. Writing the software is not a problem, but I am not sure which hardware to use. 

 I thought about using a raspberry pi 4 with a usb/blootooth speakerphone like the Jabra Speak 510 or cheaper alternatives.

There is no ""smart"" smoke alarm that meets these requirements, but the bright side is they don\'t \\*chirp\\* as often because when the battery dies in 10 years, you just replace it. \n\nI still wanted to know if a detector goes off when I\'m not home, so after replacing my expired detectors with the new 10-year battery model, I added the First Alert RM4 interconnected relay — which uses the wired ""bus"" between alarms to trigger a switch when any alarm goes off — connected to a Z-wave dry contact that, in Home Assistant and HomeKit, appears as a smoke detector. I spent about $35 per detector, plus about $45 for the ""smart"" alert capability. I chose Z-wave because it\'s the most reliable subsystem in the house, and supports direct associations so, if I ever want to, the relay can trigger lights or a siren even if Home Assistant/server is offline.

1676482887.0,15-Feb-2023 09:41:27,Lowes Allen+Roth motorized shades review,Gazoo382,5,1133shd,homeautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/1133shd/lowes_allenroth_motorized_shades_review/,"I just bought 3 of these, 58”W x 72”L.   They arrive in a few days.  I also ordered a Bond Pro.   I will update this with my comments as I go forward.  I am pretty much a Lutron Caseta house.   Lots of switches for fans, lights.   Just couldn’t stomach $700 each for the Serena shades.  The ones I bought will NOT be nearly as good.  (I paid $130 each).   My dad has a 70”w x 50”L (estimate) Lutron Serena shade I installed for him.  It’s SUPER quiet and the batteries last a long time.   Hoping I can get basic automated operation from the AR blinds.

1.  Blinds arrived today via FedEx. (Took 4 days total from Henderson, NV to central California.
2.  Give yourself 4-5 hours to enjoy your blinds.   1st blind took 45 minutes (read all of the instructions, took down old blind, install).   2nd-3rd blinds took about 15 minutes.    (I could do the next one in 5 minutes).   But then you have to charge the batteries for a few hours!!
3.  Out of the three blinds, it appears I have one bad battery.  It won’t charge.  I have to go back to Lowes and exchange.  
4.  WARNING:  It appears that you cannot buy these batteries. So when the time comes in a few years to replace them, might be cheaper to buy a new blind (smallest available) and toss the rest in the trash.  Still investigating. (More to come)

[video of two blinds paired to one remote](https://imgur.com/xc0j7CJ)

Next: Bond bridge arrived.  Will pair it and post in the next day. (Life got in the way)

Final:  Bond bridge is easy to set up and works.  Has a specific listing for the Allen + Roth blinds.   You can create a group of three blinds (example) and open all at once.  It triggers #1, then #2, then #3.   Next was  to integrate with Alexa.  Fairly easy to have Alexa skill recognized and the three blinds were found.   (I had named them blind 1, 2, 3 in Bond app).  Voice activation works as, “Alexa, open blind #1, or close blind #2”.   I have yet to be able to open close all blinds, even though the remote AND the Bond app will do it.   (I’m sure I’ll figure that out).  Schedule worked fine, open at 7:15am close at 10:15pm….  

The Blinds:  meh,   Not great.  Price is right.   Motors are not as loud as I had feared and the remote is fairly easy to use (although setting up/down stops sometimes takes a few tries because it doesn’t always register right away.  What I am NOT HAPPY ABOUT:  2 of the blinds roll up crooked.   1 is sort of ok, but one is pretty bad.  I have untied and retied the string, lengthening/shortening one side about 5 times.  Perfect at bottom, by the time it gets to the top it’s crooked.  Perfect at top, by time it gets to the bottom it’s crooked.  Tried opening all of the way, etc.   very frustrating.   Sometimes you can see one side of the blind “catch”, kind of like a hiccup.   There is nothing behind it so it’s something in how it rolls up.   And it’s not the same every time.   Just when you think it’s perfect, 4 raises later it’s crooked again.   (Suggestions?).    Therefore, I cannot recommend the Allen + Roth blinds unless money is the prime reason for purchase.  Again, one battery was dead out of the box which Lowes’s switched out for me no problem.   Total purchase was $400 for three 58”x46” motorized blinds versus $650 for one (GREAT) Lutron Serena cellular shade.

LAST UPDATE:  After a few days with these shades I can honestly say they are ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!

I bought a Bluetooth transmitter so that I could connect it to the speaker.  
On the one hand, the audio quality is ok (I'm not an audiophile by any means), and the delay is very much acceptable.   
On the other hand, pairing the transmitter and the speaker is a pain in the ass (especially if I wanted to change the speaker), also as the transmitter is portable, its battery life is not great (I guess I could disassemble it and power it directly).  


Another setup that I come up with was transmitting music over LAN using RPi Zero with an external soundboard.  
Pros:   
\- It seems to work well with streaming to any Chromecast device, so I could play music basically anywhere, also straight from the Internet browser.  
\- I was able to create fun automation with Home Assistant (scan NFC tag, turn socket with Rpi and record player, stream straight to Chromecast speaker)  
Cons:  
\- The delay was soooooo long  
\- Starting RPi was taking a good while  


So my question is - maybe there is something out there that could combine (most) of pros, and not the cons? Bluetooth transmitter on which I could select to what sink I want to connect to, or some audio-over-LAN solution?

Wiring my garage with a DIY 16 zone controller rafter lighting system. Went all out with a relay per rafter or rafter pair near the soffits. Stopped after 5 rafters. Don't like the amount of wiring. The finished wiring bundle into the controller will be absurd. A better solution exists.

Given that a microcontroller and buck converters are so cheap it makes more sense to go with the functionality shown in the third picture (per rafter). A daisy chained topology as opposed to star.

What do you think. Agree? Know of good components or complete units for building the unit shown in the third picture?

Input:

1. 12V DC supply.
2. MOSI / I2C / RS232. Don't care. Whatever works. Rafters are 16"" on center. So, short distance between nodes.
3. Chain 12V DC house guage wiring for power (576W max). Three 12V rails in ATX supply.
4. Will daisy chain CAT5e or CAT6a between rafters for signaling. Leftover wire from spools. Don't believe it is suitable for power bus. Only signalling.

Output:

1. MOSFET or transistor PWM or ON/OFF control per rafter for LED control. 12V 2.5A measured (max).
2. Power chained to next node as a bus.
3. MOSI / I2C / RS232. Don't care. Whatever works. Daisy chained not bussed.

Useful comments appreciated. Will tie into existing DIY monitoring system, already running for years, MQTT bus. Hardwired only. No wireless. Want lighting to be aware of door sensors and motion sensors through an Ethernet capable root node.",5,"['kerouac01850: Learned that MH-Tiny and Digispark ATTiny85 have on-board linear power regulator. Both can tap into 12V directly (5v linear regulated). Buck converter in third picture is not needed.\n\nIt occurs to me that a boost converter may be possible instead of a buck converter. Would overcome voltage drop as referenced by u/kigmatzomat and also allow tuning V at each node. Cost < $1 per node. Reduces power distribution to one 12/2 house wire per ATX 12v rail. Three in total. Assumes the extra current draw of the booster is acceptable or accept voltage drop.

Can use as is without any other electrical help.\n\n**12/2 house wiring** requires boosting at the LED strip to run LED at rated voltage. Need to reclaim 43W of energy from the predicted transmission losses. Assume a  boost converter will be ok. Unproven. Never done it. May not be necessary depends on required lumens.\n\n**2 Pair CAT6a**. Need to boost at source to 15V. Not terribly expensive using 150W booster but must also use buck converter at the LED strip to down regulate. Total power draw to overcome voltage drop will likely exceed 635W. Very close to maximum ratings of 650W supply.\n\nIf source boosted then LED will need regulation too.

That is 4 rafters per cat5e for 4 total cables. \n\nYou should get a power supply with adjustable voltage to account for transmission losses as the strips themselves often cause enough dip that the end of the strings are noticeably dimmer. You would want to run somewhere around ~26V at the source so its around 24v at the strips.\n\nUse your mqtt relays of choice in the box with a cheap switch or something like a beaglebone with a relay daughter board, though you will have to find a mqtt stack to run on it.', ""kerouac01850: There are reference tables to estimate voltage drop for 12V 23AWG and standard house wiring at 16' span.

Sorry if this isn't the right place for that by the way.  
  
Right now every room has a Sonos speaker for Spotify and an Echo Dot for quickly controlling lights or setting timers and the like.  
The main issue is that grouping multiple speakers with Sonos is unreliable and tedious (might be just me?) and it seems to be way better with Alexa. But simply connecting external speakers to the Echos wouldn't give give me enough of an advantage to give up my Sonos setup.  
What I'd rather do is run 6 instances of Alexa preferably in docker containers on my system thats already running Home Assistant, Mosquitto, Octoprint and all that stuff anyways, connecting it to an amp as individual inputs and running wires to speakers in every room.

Not only that, but a universally-translating, culturally aware, and sentient peer species is probably the only way we ever see broad peace and understanding on this planet. That's not esoteric, that's what art is for, and it doesn't take a postgrad to see this being better.\n\nC) Developing more accessible ways for the differently-abled to express themselves through art is pretty bloody useful in my mind. I can't use my hands, feet, or teeth to control brushes or styluses because I shake too much. I can talk though, and speech to text has meant I can draw for the first time. I'm sick of the tired argument I kept getting from the youtuber community that those with physical and mental challenges should be made to pay 'real artists' to do the art for them. Admittedly youtubers are pretty young so I won't put too much stock in that.\n\nBut what an ignorant, copy-paste question to ask? How self-defeating can a question be? If art is not worthless, then developing the methods for art's creation is also not worthless. If art is primarily worth the money it gives artists to live, then economics says developing the technology to allow artists to create more with scarce resources will grow their position in the market. If art is primarily a cultural product, then more is better and artists should be in there with their sleeves rolled up and helping. \n\nNow can someone post an argument that isn't a one-liner copy pasted from TikTok?"", 'noman_032018: > The patent office usually relies on lawsuits later to kill badly issued ones.\n\nWhich is bad for the same reason SLAPP is bad.', 'joshuahtree: Actually, I hold a patent for an inverted alphanumeric sorting system so my lawyers will be contacting you for even mentioning it', 'briodan: Same people who decide now only they apply a set of more stringent criteria.

I’m a new Reddit user but I’ve been trying to find a few particular answers/opinions on Simplisafe vs Wyze Home Monitoring.

Current Ecosystem: Google (Flexible and willing to switch. 

I was gifted a simplisafe smart deadbolt a year or so back knowing I needed to buy the system in order to use it. 

I am now ready to purchase either simplisafe of wyze for home security but have a few questions/concerns. (I do realize the smart lock will be useless if I go wyze, but willing to take that loss if it’s better overall to go with wyze)

My issues with simplisafe are that it appears they hold certain features and integrations hostage unless you pay the 27.99 a month premium cost. Also, from what I’ve read, the home assistant integration api is less than ideal… door sensor status is delayed which is not ideal if you want to the sensor to trigger a light or have an assistant make an announcement or anything like that…simplisafe has no iftt support so I can’t utilize that to make the most use of the door sensors for any kind of routines or anything. The positives I’ve heard are that simplisafe has been in the security game for a long time, they are pretty consistent, cell backup and battery backup and I already have the smart lock. 

Now as far as wyze, the system is affordable although when you add all the extras it’s easy to get up to 350 or so. The wyze system seems to be decent, it does not have cellular backup but it does have battery backup. Wyze does show as having iftt support and Google integration. I’ve read good and bad about wyze…. Some about the built in siren being too low, some about the system going offline frequently but many good reviews as well. I feel like this system would be more flexible as far as working with other home automation tasks and utilizing the door and window sensors for more than just the security system. They seem to have great smart locks as well. Their monitoring costs 9.99 per month.

I’d love some feedback on this from anyone that has experience with either system. Are there any caveats or drawbacks that I’m overlooking or perhaps I’m overthinking the whole thing and I should just allow simplisafe to simply serve its purpose as a security system and nothing further. Thank you for your input.",12,"['BAFUdaGreat: Google “Wyze security breach” and then decide if you think Wyze is still a good product to use.', ""AmbiguousDavi: Any reason why no Ring Protect?

1676313173.0,13-Feb-2023 10:32:53,One of my Chamberlain Garage Door Openers suddenly won't respond to myQ open/close commands,eengert,1,111g9s8,homeautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/111g9s8/one_of_my_chamberlain_garage_door_openers/,"Just installed two Chamberlain C2405 Garage Door Openers a few days ago.  Got both setup on myQ app and they were working perfectly the first day or so.  Starting yesterday, one of them no longer will respond to open/close commands from myQ app.  The other opener still works fine with myQ app.

Strangely, the unresponsive opener is clearly on WiFi (status light on the opener is solid green, indicating a good WiFi connection, and I can see it as a connected device on my router) and when I operate the door with a remote or wall button, the myQ app can see the opener and correctly displays the current status in real-time (""opening/closing"", ""open/closed"").  But when I try to use myQ app to open/close that door, it just spins for 30 seconds and then displays an error that ""Garage Door 1 is not responding."" 

I've tried everything I can think of:

\- Power cycle the opener  
\- Reset the WiFi settings on opener  
\- Clear memory on opener  
\- Factor Reset opener  
\- Remove and re-add opener many times in myQ app  
\- Power cycle WiFi router  
\- Try myQ app on different phone  
\- Create different myQ account and try opener using that account

Nothing has had any impact on the issue.  I have no idea what could've changed between the evening that it was working and the next morning when it no longer worked.  The opener continues to work fine with the wall button, remotes, and keypad.  Like I said, the myQ app can see the opener's status, but can't control that opener.

I talked to a Chamberlain myQ support agent, but no solution was provided other than ""it's a known issue"" and someone will call me back in 24-48 hours.  That sounded vague and doesn't make much sense to me, given the circumstances.  But while I wait to (hopefully) hear back from support, does anyone have any other ideas?

If worse comes to worst, I can always return/exchange the unit, but that would be a big hassle to disassemble and repack.

I recently installed an Enbrighten zigbee dimmer switch and Enbrighten standard zigbee switch, both power monitoring models, dimmer to control 3 rows of led lights and standard to control the ceiling fan. Last night I installed two more dimmers of the same model and split the light rows into their own switches. 

Prior to the change the switches worked perfectly except the lights dimmed erratically or not at all and the ceiling fan was incredibly slow in it's fastest setting and wouldn't reverse. After fussing with the wiring in the fan canopy I got the fan working correctly so I assume I had a loose wire or something.

After the new switches were installed the lights dim properly however there are now 2 issues:

* The row of switches have a high pitch buzz/hum if I get close to them. I fiddled with them and took out one here and there but can't narrow it down to a single switch, the sound is only present when multiple are live.

* The ceiling fan is now back to being slow as hell. I disconnected and reconnected the wiring in the canopy, in the attic where I split the line to the fan/light row and at the switch, none of it made a difference. The result is the same, the fan goes slow on the highest setting and when switched to reverse, it doesn't move but does make sound like it wants to. I checked the voltage at the switch and the wires at the fan, both 120.x",1,"['supalurker: I have some Jasco Enbrighten Z-Wave smart switches that have coil whine also.  They only make the high pitch sound when they are off though.\n\nAs far as the fan goes, maybe the Zigbee switches are not compatible with the fan? Not sure what the specs are for those particular switches.  I also have some of the Jasco Enbrighten Z-wave Fan switches and have no issues with the 3 fan speed settings.']"

Directly in front of my house, it stays red but once they walk out of that zone, it will then change from red back to white again.

I recently bought and hooked up a shelly1 to my water heater, which is controlled by my home assistant installation.
I want to know when the water heater is actually on (it might be powered by the switch, but it turns on only when the heater thermostat does).
Since shelly1 doesn't offer power monitoring, I was thinking I could use the SW input (which is normally used by connecting it to a wall switch) and connect it to the live wire after the thermostat. Then setting the device to ""detached mode"" I'd get the sensor input in home assistant but the switch won't automatically act based on that input.

Sadly, I couldn't find any diagrams or understand how the internal connection of shelly1 work. I have no idea if connecting the live wire after the thermostat back to the SW input on the shelly is going to cause any shorts or if (as I expect/hope) the device uses the SW input just to measure the voltage and doesn't actually connect to anything else.

New construction
Already purchased Phillips hue white and color recessed lights for nearly all 107 recessed lights in the house... Waiting to install. 
Already purchased a lot of treatlife smart switches (WiFi type).  I have used treatlife in my current house and love them, I'm considering selling my brand new treatlife switches purchased for new home (still in the box) for cassetta before installation because too many wifi switches may slow down network. 

There are a few locations (pantry and closets) that will have regular white recessed lights. 

There are a handful of old school light fixtures that will use regular LED bulbs (dining room chandelier, island pendant lighting, kids rooms ceiling fan lights, bathroom vanities, etc) 

Here's my understandings:
I know it's generally friends upon to use smart switches if you are using smart bulbs. (But they serve different purposes.)

I know you can't use a smart or dumb dimmer switch to power smart bulbs (although smart bulbs are labeled ""dimmable"" because you can dim them through software .. false advertising)

I understand that Phillips hue now sells it's own behind the switch control, but I'm not sure I want to to buy plain paddle switches and install Phillips brand behind the wall (expensive) switch override in addition to control Phillips hue recessed lights. Theoretically, you would have to install these overrides behind every single switch location (including all locations on 3-4 way switches which seems ridiculous).

I understand it's possible with any switch (smart or dumb) to turn on Phillips hue bulbs,  you can choose default setting for each hue bulb and what it does when power is restored. My thinking is when power is restored you have most lights turn to regular white and select few that are always colored, return to their preferred color choice, HOWEVER, I absolutely hate if there's a power flicker in the neighborhood and all the house lights turn on 100% white in the middle of the night. 

Here's my questions:
I'm installing Phillips hue smart bulbs (hue recessed) and desire a smart switch that operates like a regular switch (so I don't have to tape all the switches to the ON position).  

Is there any out of the box thinking (through routines or otherwise) that allows a way to use smart switches to turn on smart bulbs and then the bulbs can be set to change color after the switch is powering the bulbs? 

My headache would become trying to automate the lights after a certain time of day or change those default behaviors to be dimmer during night time hours if I want to automate lighting in the house. 

I want switches to work like normal for non-tech kids, grandparents and guests but want smart lighting that is compatible.",19,"['Dangerous_Welcome392: For the hue bulbs, you take out the old switches, wire them so they always provide power , and install hue dimmer modules on top of the old place where the switches were : [https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Installation-Free-Exclusively-562777/dp/B08W8GLPD5/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?keywords=Philips-Hue&qid=1676229629&s=lamps-light&sr=1-1](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Installation-Free-Exclusively-562777/dp/B08W8GLPD5/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Philips-Hue&qid=1676229629&s=lamps-light&sr=1-1)\n\nFor making dumb lights smart, if you want to make them smart with just on/off functionality, and still keep them in the hue bridge / ecosystem , just buy some Sonoff ZBMini modules : [https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-SmartThings-Philips-ZBBridge-Required/dp/B08MJL8G3C](https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-SmartThings-Philips-ZBBridge-Required/dp/B08MJL8G3C) , add them to your hue bridge, and re-use your old dumb switches\n\nAlso, you set the power on after power grid loss behaviour of the bulbs in the Hue app, set them to turn back on after a power outage if they were ok when the power was cut, or remain turned off if they were already off when the power went out', 'Far-Ad-9679: See this\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/110496u/when_i_unscrew_one_smart_light_bulb_the_other/j89jlk8?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3', 'peterxian: First off, let’s dispel the myth that too many WiFi IoT devices slows down your network. Good smart switches generate very little traffic so in a properly designed network you can have several dozen with no issues. \n\nSecond, for smart bulbs you should be looking for smart switches that have “smart bulb mode” — i.e. they send a signal when pressed, rather than cutting power. Note that you may still want a way to cut power at the wall, and there may even be an electrical code requirement to do so. I configured my switches to toggle their relay only on a double click, for example. When you do cut power, the most sane setting (in my opinion) is for the bulbs to return to their previous state; hopefully yours have this option. \n\nTo answer your other question, I have not seen any smart switches with built in color control. There may be a way to use two smart dimmers, and program one for brightness and one for color control, but that might require a more advanced home automation server like Home Assistant.

My challenges are that it's large and I want to know when any door or window is opened.

What would be the best system that supports this many sensors?

Bonus items:

I also want smart locks on 3 of the doors with doorbell/smart lock cameras, ideally on the same system as the sensors.

3 smart thermostats and smoke/CO detectors would be great as well.

I also plan to have 8-14 outdoor cameras for which I've already wired CAT6. Again, ideally on the same system for ease of use but not a requirement.

Does anyone know of a system that would support all of this? What about everything but the wired cameras?

If there's nothing that can do it all well, what would be best to support the 60-ish sensors only? I know I can piecemeal the rest together.

Doesn't have to be monitored, but I'm not opposed to it.

A quick look reveals that I can pay whatever I want for a motorized blind, but my question is what are the major brands and where do they fall with respect to longevity and use? I can install both the hardware and deal with the technical integration myself, so I just need to blinds and motors themselves.

I would prefer that they use Matter protocol since that is set to become the default in future, and I don't want to make a habit of replacing blinds just because they aren't using the universal protocol 5-6 years from now.

Bonus: I would love to find blinds that can retract two layers, with one being for total blockout.

Thank you!!",4,"['peterxian: There are no smart blinds or shades that I can find currently supporting Matter, even though it is part of the version 1.0 spec. I\'ve been doing this research lately, and where\'s what I\'ve found:\n\n* Hunter Douglas implied their gen3 shades would have Matter upgradability, but as they\'re not a member of the CSA and the motors only support BLE, which is not even compatible with Matter, so I would very hesitant to invest in them.\n* Eve is shipping Thread shades called MotionBlinds and has committed to supporting Matter on its IoT devices (and is a member of the CSA) so they have the best chance of adding Matter, but you can never be 100% sure until it is shipping.\n* SmartWings is also shipping Thread shades with promise of Matter upgradability, but they are not generally available for sale yet — they are currently only shipping orders from their indiegogo campaign right now, so expect availability later this year. SmartWings is also the only one on this shortlist that sells a double shade with blackout layer.\n\nOther options in general to watch out for:\n\n* Many motors are only 433 Mhz, which tend to be harder to control because they lack positional feedback even with the WiFi ""bridge"" which often locks you into a cloud service\n* WiFi motors could theoretically support Matter, but are going to generally use more power than the others, so will require a hardwire plug or solar-panel charging to avoid constantly swapping batteries. I have yet to see a WiFi motor maker promising Matter support, or even a vendor with firmware updates for WiFi motors.\n* Bluetooth options are available but generally only support HomeKit.\n* Zigbee options are available but I\'ve seen lots of reports of connectivity issues, and Zigbee is very possibly has the murkiest future as Thread becomes more popular (since they use the same radio chips). \n* Z-wave options tend to be found only on higher-end brands (like, not at Amazon or IKEA). Personally I went with Bali blinds because I am extremely happy with Z-wave and Costco had the best pricing on them (currently on sale through 2/24). Most Z-wave hubs are already working or likely to offer Matter bridging in the near future. I think they have a dual-shade motorized option, but options may be more limited. \n* There\'s always DIY options using a basic 24V motor and a forward/reverse controller, but again positional feedback would be limited, protocol support is whatever you can program, and the cost of parts tends to add up quickly.', 'siegmour: I’m really happy with the IKEA blinds.

1676153167.0,11-Feb-2023 14:06:07,It all started with an idea...,diehardbattery,9,10zzb1h,homeautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/10zzb1h/it_all_started_with_an_idea/,"First off, a bit of a back story.  Being a proud first time homebuyer, I wanted to make some things in our home a bit smarter than what things are already.  In particular, the house came with Qmotion branded roller shades.  They are pretty great.  I like them a lot.  Except for the fact they are not smart (unless you count having [remotes](https://imgur.com/G3hQi6l) for each group/room).  

It does not look like there is a way to make them smart either.  I have seen something about a Qconnect hub but they are scarce and apparently only work with iOS and possibly not available in the US anymore (Qmotion, now part of Legrand).  At first I thought something like a [Broadlink RM4 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Broadlink-RM4-Universal-Automation-Compatible/dp/B096TXWMPV/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3LN76CHUUWW3P&keywords=broadlink+rm4+pro&qid=1676152336&sprefix=broadlink+rm4+pro%2Caps%2C109&sr=8-5) would work.  Despite being RF, I believe the remotes use rolling codes which the RM4 Pro does not support, only working up/down if it happened to hit the right frequency.

Enter my idea.  I thought maybe I could use a [Switchbot](https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-switch-button-controlled-compatible/dp/B07B7NXV4R/ref=sr_1_3?crid=S0Y3HVM0JY&keywords=switchbot&qid=1676152379&sprefix=switchbot%2Caps%2C113&sr=8-3) to press the up and down buttons on the remote.  But the dimensions of the switchbot [aren't playng nice with the remote](https://imgur.com/TJXyltt).  Each remote has a [magnetic wall plate where the remote can attach to](https://imgur.com/rSgTXFt).

So I'm wondering how to make this possible without having to possibly fabricate something that would allow a Switchbot to press the buttons.  I would only need the up and down buttons as the others I either never use or are for radio channel selection.  I do believe I would need 2 Switchbots in my case.  I dont have access to a 3d printer nor do I have the knowledge/equipment to possibly create a cad drawing or similar for.  

I know this probably sounds like overthinking, and maybe it is.  Just trying to find a way to make these smart as I've seen quotes north of $20k to do my entire house over with newer smart shades.",8,"[""n4te: Anything with a remote can be made smart using optocouplers and an ESP32. An optocoupler is basically an LED on one side and a switch on the other. When the LED is off, the switch side is open. When the LED is on, the switch side is closed. So, you wire your remote buttons through the optocoupler and the ESP32 microprocessor turns on the LED side of the optocoupler. You can connect to the ESP32 via WiFi or Ethernet to tell it when to turn on and off the optocoupler.\n\nThat's the good way to do it. I wouldn't try to rig up something to mechanically press buttons like the mousetrap game. I can give more details on how to build the good solution, if you're up for it. It's not hard. The circuit is basically: ESP32 -> resistor -> optocoupler. You could even design your own PCB and plug it into an ESP32 board. That's what I do, using a wESP32, which has PoE (Ethernet instead of WiFi and gets power over Ethernet). I also 3D print an enclosure."", 'AmbiguousDavi: Check out New Smart Blind controller, I think it can do rolling codes but just email them to ask they are a small shop. It\'s a 433mhz hub essentially but only for blinds. They integrate with Alexa but don\'t know if controling via voice is your end goal or something else. \n\nThe qconnect also only connects with rs232 :/ if I recall and they are range based if you have other shades. \n\nAprt from the above, Ive cannibalized the pads the button is actually connecting when you press (usually connecting a pin to gnd) and used a esp or Arduino to ""press it"" (pulldown to gnd) takes some soldering though', ""diehardbattery: Sure, I'd be willing to at least learn more about it."", 'diehardbattery: >New Smart Blind controller\n\nIs it the [Neo Smart Blind Controller](https://neosmartblinds.com/smartcontroller/)?', 'diehardbattery: Checked with them this morning.  Turns out they are not compatible with my blinds.', 'n4te: Alright, you\'ll start with an ESP32 dev board or something like a wESP32. They have a bunch of pins, you just need to be able to turn a pin on/off for each optocoupler. You\'ll have one optocoupler and one resistor per button on your remote you want to ""push"". You can write code for the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE. The code is very simple and there are many examples. The optocoupler is just an LED and just about every beginner starts by having the ESP32 light up an LED.\n\nIt\'s a little more advanced to control it over ethernet, but it\'s not super hard. One way to go is to use MQTT, then it will be easy to control with Home Assistant or others.\n\nYou can use wires or protoboard and a soldering iron to connect the remote, optcouplers, resistors, and ESP32. You can put all that into a cheap project box from Amazon. That works fine, though there are many more levels of fanciness. It just depends on how much fun you are having dorking around with this stuff.\n\nI did it like that for a long time but [now my boxes look like this](https://imgur.com/a/elPiXii). I use DipTrace to design a PCB, then I pay JLCPCB to make it. It turns out super professional and the cost is only $2 + shipping from China. DipTrace is great, much easier to use than KiCad and others, but still quirky. I buy parts from DigiKey and solder them with a hot plate and hot air tool rather than a soldering iron. The paste goes on using a stencil, then the parts are placed with tweezers, then I heat the whole thing and the solder melts. Everything is soldered at once with no fuss, much easier than a soldering iron. Many people do this using just a toaster oven.\n\nI use SketchUp to design the enclosure and JLCPCB to print it. Their stupidly expensive 3D printer is going to be better than a home unit, though the cost can be ~$50 for MJF nylon. That material looks and feel super nice, it doesn\'t even look 3D printed, but costs a lot more than eg resin. My enclosures have snaps to hold the wESP32 and the lid snaps on, no screws. The enclosure has holes in the side for connectors (ethernet and my PCB). My PCB plugs into the wESP32 and the connector matches up with the enclosure hole so I can plug external things into the PCB.', 'AmbiguousDavi: Yeah.

Unfortunately, due to various complicated contract requirements I haven’t had much success pushing this avenue of the electrical plan. Most notably-we had to give up on the KNX install I wanted to get done while the build was going on (we are contracted to us specific electricians and they refuse to let us bring in a KNX installer or hand over parts of the electrical contract).

Fortunately, I have contacts who are able to help me get hold of certified KNX cable and a site manager who is understanding and okay with us going on site to run our own DC cables. The current plan is to wire the house back to the comms/electrical panel as standard and just leave cables in the wall. Has anyone else had to do this? I’m reading through the guides over on r/KNX to understand the network topology and will be running this past a former KNX installer - unfortunately he is more familiar with commercial projects (as is usually the case).

Primarily I just need to get all my lights controlled by KNX (the current plan is to use Shelly’s in every switch) and manage to bridge this KNX system with HomeKit/Home assistant to save me buying KNX devices and paying for expensive KNX licenses (apparently if I have less than 20 devices I can use the “basic” tier which only costs €200 but if I have more I need to go to the “home” tier which runs a cool €800 euros - more than I have ever spent on a piece of software).

1676097880.0,10-Feb-2023 22:44:40,Confused about motorised blinds,QF17,2,10zehe8,homeautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/10zehe8/confused_about_motorised_blinds/,"Hi all,

I’m after some reviews and recommendations on smart blinds. I’ve currently [got these](https://expo.tuya.com/product/939022) in my bedroom attached to some roller blinds. The goal was to have blinds that could close at sunset and open at sunrise and then I’d wake up to the sun and not an alarm. 

The issue is that the motor is too loud, and rather than waking up to sunlight, I’m waking up to a grinding motor (not the idea I had in mind).

I’d also like to buy a couple more for the other windows in my house - primarily to help with heat retention in winter. Not all of those have access to power points, so I’m guessing some of them may need to be battery operated.

Then there’s the connectivity. The motor I have is Wifi, but I understand that it absolutely eats through battery life - so a Zigbee/Z-Wave model would be preferred. Ideally, I’d like something that’s Thread/Matter compatible so that I can one day consolidate all my bridges into one.

But I’m really confused about the state of the market at the moment. If I buy something Zigbee based, is it guaranteed to work with matter routers in the future - or am I better off waiting a couple of months for new matter products to hit the market?

And then there’s the products themselves. When I search on Amazon for Zigbee based roller blinds, I get options [like this](https://www.amazon.com.au/Rechargeable-Compatible-25mm-1-Channel-Remote/dp/B0B2P34MVX/ref=sr_1_20?crid=D42YZ00BAMT7&keywords=Zigbee+blind+motor&qid=1676097216&sprefix=zigbee+blind+mot%2Caps%2C242&sr=8-20) for about $100, but also options [like this](https://www.amazon.com.au/SmartThings-Compatible-Upgrading-Existing-Automation/dp/B07S63GSN2/ref=sr_1_14?crid=D42YZ00BAMT7&keywords=Zigbee+blind+motor&qid=1676097310&sprefix=zigbee+blind+mot%2Caps%2C242&sr=8-14) for $180. I’m curious as to what the difference between the two models are?

Finally, there’s Aqara, who [seem to be](https://www.aqara.com/en/article-1583275073188196352.html) rolling out support for matter whilst also having both an [in-rod](https://www.aqara.com/en/product/smart-roller-shade-controller) and [chain operated](https://www.aqara.com/en/product/roller-shade-driver-e1) options which appear to support battery or AC power. I’ve seen a couple of threads here which seem to indicate the Aqara use the own proprietary protocol and may not be as reliable as other brands.

So /r/homeautomation  \-  what  should  I  do?!",4,"[""fredsam25: I just brought motorized blinds. I bought a sample one first to see how loud it was, and it was surprisingly quiet. I then ran low voltage wire to the windows because no matter the technology, you don't want to be charging batteries every few months. There are options with solar charging, but that just adds to the cost. Putting in the LV was also pretty easy with a single story home and an attic. You just drill straight up from the window sill with a very long drill bit. Then use a wire fishing kit to get it through. \n\nIn terms of the technology z-wave/zigbee/wifi... I actually went with 433 MHz rf because I already have an rf hub to control various rf devices. That actually makes things pretty reliable and opens up the brands of blinds to select from, although it also means there is no feedback. I have never been happy with how buggy done z-wave devices are. You might have four of the exact same device, and one will just decide to do its own thing. With RF devices, I program the hub to just press the correct button a bunch of times and it works flawlessly."", 'QF17: I don’t think that’s allowed in my country (Australia). All internal wiring must be done by a licensed electrician - so I think that rules out that option for me.\n\nI thought I could just buy a battery bank and use that to charge each blind on a weekend every so often\n\nAnd I presume that RF blinds need line of sight to the transmitter?', 'jjbine11: Please name the brand you are using.', ""fredsam25: Even for low voltage? We're talking about 5v...\n\nYeah, you have to recharge them every so often, and that might not seem like much work, but I would eventually get lazy. Then they would stop working. But there's also batteries going bad or holding less charge. Now some blinds might need to charge more frequently than others. If you hardwire, you never have to think about them again. \n\nThe RF is not line of sight. It's the same as z-wave/zigbee. It just doesn't follow their protocol. Depends on your hub, but the range can be ~30m depending on what's sitting between. I know it seems backwards to go to some proprietary standard instead of one of the mainstream ones, but I feel for some applications, z-wave/zigbee add a ton of overhead without much benefit. Instead of worrying about the mesh and syncing and joining/pairing, you press a button and the blind goes either up or down."", 'QF17: Yep, any internal wiring must be done by a licensed contractor\n\nhttps://www.obrien.com.au/members/electrical-warana/articles/what-electrical-work-can-i-do-myself-in-australia/']"

I'm trying to figure out what solutions might be out there for   
 1/ Opening the garage door  
 2/ unlocking the interior door that connects the garage to the house.  


For my own convenience (i'm lazy!), and for letting guests in occasionally, I'd like to have as close to a hands/key free system as possible 

The ideal solution would use iPhone (NFC, not an app) or Apple Watch, and each would be controlled independently, but could be linked together.  I'd also be open to some biometric based approach but haven't seen any consumer friendly ones, and i'm not sure i want to hack something together myself.  


It seems like [home key](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/unlock-your-door-with-a-home-key-iph0dc255875/ios) might be a good solution for the interior door, but I am not aware of any good options for the garage door that don't involve an app or a physical keypad.  


I also looked at [Unifi Access](https://ui.com/door-access), but it doesn't seem to be iPhone compatible from what I can tell.  


I am planning to use homeassistant for some automation, so anything that requires or is compatible with homeassistant would be great, but is not a strict requirement.

A keypad based approach might be acceptable if it can be integrated intelligently with homeassistant to allow a single (exterior) keypad to optionally a) just open the garage or b) also unlock the interior door. It looks like MyQ supports hass integration but I haven't dug into the details to see how seamless this was all be.  


Anyone done something like this, Any suggestions?",6,"[""Suprflyyy: It depends on how far you want to go with home automation.  As u/CAP123D133412D mentioned, you can get this done pretty easy with a code pad deadbolt and MyQ garage control.  I've had good experiences with the Schlage version of these deadbolts as well.  This is where I started.\n\nBut if you are willing to put in a bit more up front effort, you might consider r/homeassistant.  This would allow you to to use Z-Wave relays on your garage doors, and Z-Wave locks on your entry doors, all controlled by automation you can fire via Apple Watch, iOS quick actions, in an app whose dashboard you design, or even automatically based on your location.  The effort to get it up and running at first might be a bit front loaded with learning curve, but once you have it working It's really easy to expand to all sorts of things.  If you are interested, I put the hardware links in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/10rvs1h/comment/j6yl984/).  \n\nBefore you ask - yes it's a cult.  Yes it's more work at first, but with most other solutions you inevitably end up with cloud dependence or multiple apps that make your automation more effort than less.  The only question is how much of the wrong stuff you buy and integrate before you finally try it.

2. Battery-powered sensors - Unfortunately the builders ""forgot"" about running alarm cables etc, so all the walls are freshly skimmed, painted, and finished and I'm not going to start channeling stuff through them now!
3. A powered sounder - I'm able to run additional cables through the loft-space if needed, so that side of things isn't a problem

1676045385.0,10-Feb-2023 08:09:45,Please help me understand my switch wiring (description in comments),burajin,62,10yvthn,homeautomation,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/10yvthn,,27,"['nick2253: /u/goodonesaregone65\'s recommendations are the right way to fix this, in my opinion.\n\nHowever, I had a couple suggestions that haven\'t been brought up yet:\n\n* Don\'t use the neutral jumper for your ground connection.  Electrical wiring has strict color-codes for a reason:  black is hot, white is neutral, and green/bare is ground.  If you\'re going to be doing a bunch of wiring, get a spool of bare copper or green-sleeved copper and make your own ground jumpers.\n* Add a ground connection to any ""normal"" switches.  It\'s extremely common for these switches to be wired up without a ground because it\'s more time consuming, but adding a ground is a super-effective safety measure.  In the unlikely event that the switch fails and shorts hot to the frame, the part you touch will be electrified, and could pose a shock hazard.  The ground connection will protect you from this.  The ground connection will also help discharge static electricity that you might pick up as you move through your space, and prevent it from feeding into your power system, which could (again, unlikely) damage LED bulbs or other electronics.\n* When you use the provided jumper wires, there\'s a long end and a short end.  The long end is supposed to go into the wire nut, and the short end into the switch.  This is important, because you need the longer end in the nut to ensure sufficient contact, and the shorter end is sized so that no metal is exposed.  It appears you have that backwards.\n* Red typically means traveler wire, and is used to enable two (or more) switches to control a load.  I believe that the Jasco switches require a special add-on switch for this setup.  If you\'re not sure why there is a traveler, I\'d recommend disassembling the fixture to try and figure this out.  It\'s possible that, at one point in time, there was a second switch, but it was removed during some renovation, and there\'s some box somewhere that joins the red wire to load.  If that\'s the case, then you probably want to label (or at least wrap with electrical tape) that line, so it\'s clear what it is in the future.', 'goodonesaregone65: This is what I would do. \nTake everything out. Bundle the neutrals and grounds as normal. \nLocate the hot and then use three jumper wires from that (one to each switch). \nThen load wires out as normal. \n\nNo more daisychain', 'nickichi84: Looks like 1 hot wire from the circuit breaker is controlling 3 different lighting groups. All neutrals are in a wire nut & another wire nut for grounds', ""burajin: Hi everyone!\n\nIn the living room I have this box with three switches. From left to right they power a set of lights, a fan, the lights on the fan. \n\nThe before picture shows how they were wired before. All three components worked normally. \n\nI tried to recreate this when replacing the fan switch and fan light (using a Lutron Caseta fan switch and an UltraPro Z-Wave dimmer switch).\n\nUnfortunately, now the left light does not turn on, and fan does not turn on, but the fan LIGHT does turn on ONLY if the left light switch is also on.\n\nI'll try to explain the setup as I understand it in case the pics aren't clear, but I may be wrong.\n\nBEFORE:\n* Ground wires were not connected to the switches\n\n* Natural wires were not connected to the switches\n\n* A load wire was connected to the left switch top terminal, with another wire connected to the bottom terminal, and then continuing in a daisy chain to the top terminal of the fan. This daisy chain continued to the bottom terminal of the fan light.\n\n* The bottom terminal of the fan was connected into the wall\n\n* The top (only red wire!) was connected from the fan light into the wall\n\nThere are no 3 ways in this configuration. \n\nAFTER:\n\nTo try to recreate the daisy chain, I tied the Caseta fan switch's yellow wire to the wire coming out of the bottom terminal of the left switch and also going into the top terminal of the right switch.\n\nI connected the neutral wire on the Caseta switch to the group of neutrals that were disconnected before \n\nI connected the wire previously connected to the bottom terminal on the fan switch to the lower screw terminal on the Caseta switch \n\nI connected the ground wire so the group of grounds that were disconnected before\n\nI connected the UltraPro (fan light) switch to the group of grounds \n\nI connected the group of wires coming from the left switch lower screw to the top terminal on the UltraPro\n\nI connected the red wire going into the wall to the bottom terminal on the UltraPro.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Thanks in advance!"", ""amarao_san: Why they are different colors? If I understand right, it's dazy chainging of three switches from a single live source. In this case both colors should be the same, because it's live isn't it?\n\nI don't know US colors for wires, but suppose red should be live, and neutral is black. In this case this wiring make no sense."", 'jkread: The whites are all neutral. The bare wires (covered in paint) are ground. The black wire that comes in and extends to all 3 switches is the hot line coming from the source.  The other two black wires and the red wire are the load wires delivering to the consumers when the switch is active.', 'burajin: I want to thank everyone for the helpful comments\n\nI was able to figure this out in the end. I was misunderstanding how neutrals work, and what was breaking the whole thing was taking one of the spliced neutrals and connecting it to the right light switch. This was supposed to be the neutral for the left light. In hindsight this was extremely stupid and probably dangerous as I did notice that light was at max brightness at only 50% and would only flicker after that. This also explained why the left light stopped working and the right light would only work if the left switch was on. \n\nI fixed it by splicing the neutrals again and using the provided jumpers for their intended purpose, to also connect each switch to the spliced neutrals. \n\nI unspliced the grounds and connected one to the right light switch. \n\nFor the line wires I tried what was suggested and undid the daisy chain and sent a jumper to each switch. This worked, but I had way too much trouble getting it all to fit in the box. So now with a better understanding I just recreated the daisy chain, correctly this time. \n\nThe load wires I just connected as normal, I fixed the Caseta one as some had suggested. \n\nI have another Z-Wave switch that was supposed to replace the left dumb switch, but at the time of this post I wanted to figure out what was already wrong. With a better understanding now, I wired it as well. \n\nAll three switches work normally!! Thank you everyone!!', ""jthorpein: Like others have said, you have the fan switch wired incorrectly, the yellow wire goes to the fan itself, not the line in.\n\nWhat I would do is to disconnect all wires and labeling them with tape, i.e. painters tape. Note the wire on the bottom left switch terminal is the hot/main supply for the switch box. I'd then create 3 jumpers/pig tails (with black wire) and connect them to the hot/main supply wire. Make them long enough to go to each switch with a little extra. I'd connect one of the pig tails to the bottom terminal of the regular switch (the one on the left) and then connect the top terminal (this will be easy to find as it should have only a black, a white and a bare copper wire). Then repeat for the following switches.... connect the hot/main supply pig tail to the screw terminal on the bottom of the fan switch, then connect the yellow wire to the black wire that's coming from the bundle that has a black, red, white and bare copper wire, then the black hot/main supply pig tail to the bottom terminal of the second casata switch and then the red wire from the bundle that has the black, red, white & bare copper wire to the top terminal ... also don't forget to connect the ground wires.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's a YouTube video showing how to wire 3 switches to one incoming power supply lead:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HocLKQ-k91U&ab\\_channel=HowToHome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HocLKQ-k91U&ab_channel=HowToHome)\n\nAnd here's a video showing how to wire the fan control switch:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMvhCsDRsho&t=40s&ab\\_channel=LutronElectronics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMvhCsDRsho&t=40s&ab_channel=LutronElectronics)"", 'Natoochtoniket: I am continually amazed how many of the pictures in this sub are of boxes where there is white paint all over everything.

Hi Everyone,

I  am hoping someone can help me with some guidance on choosing a smart  thermostat for our home. Its an old home, with no A/C at all. The house  is heated by a gas powered boiler heating up cast iron radiators. And  the water is heated up by a separate, water heater that is electric.

Right  now we have a manual thermostat plugged into the main floor, while the  boiler/heater are in the basement. I would like to replace this with a  Smart Thermostat, and I've been looking at either a Nest, or a Wyze, as  they have google integration.

I  am just confused on which thermostat I can use, as I am not  knowledgeable in how to hook them up, and the current electrical wires  we have for the thermostat. As you can see in the image below, the  current thermostat is connected to a black, and a ?yellow/brown/tan?  wire, and there is an unused red wire. The two wires are plugged into  the current thermostats ""R"" & ""W"" slots.

Do  you think we can use the current thermostat wires we have there to hook  them up and be compatible with either a Google Nest, or Wyze  Thermostat? Thank you for your support ahead of time.

It's got this  [True Radiant - Google Nest Help](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9250165?hl=en) feature that figures out how fast your house warms and starts heating at the right time.

We’re hoping to install Phillips hue light strips as under cabinet lighting in our galley kitchen. There are two walls with cabinets.

The only plug is in the cabinet above the microwave. Is this doable? I think to get from the left cabinet to the center cabinet I would need 3 extensions?

You can check details of my electrical fire I posted to the Sonoff subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonoff/comments/10ryizb/yikes_sonoff_th16_for_small_greenhouse_heater/). It was suggested that I look into a smart switch and a contactor by one poster and another suggested [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LEUJU6?psc=1) as the relay. [Functional Devices](https://www.functionaldevices.com/product/rib2401b/) makes these in the US and have UL and other important certifications. Our hobby greenhouse/mediation area is very close to our detached garage which I wired up for electrical 2 years ago. Originally I had only one 20amp line run to the greenhouse that would power the 1500w heater, dehumidifier, small fall and LED lights but after the close call I ran a separate 20amp line just for the heater and put the relay in the garage between the breaker panel and going outside to add better climate protection (even though the greenhouse provides lots of protection but can get very humid in the summer). The set up consists of the above relay and [Kasa Smart Light Switch HS200](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EZV35QU?psc=1) to provide the low power contact mounted into a 2-gang weatherproof box (this is overkill but I had one handy). I used the Kasa switch (no dimmer!) because I had one and it's wifi, zigbee has too much latency for this particular application but could work for others.  If you are going to mount this out of the way like I did, I recommend using a 3-gang box because there's a lot of wires involved and the extra room would have made for an easier set up. You could put an outlet this the box to plug your devices in directly but I ran 12 ga wire to the greenhouse I put a red outlet there in a weatherproof box and cover. This easily tied into the already existing Home Assistant automations I have to controlling temp in the greenhouse. The temperature and humidity are monitored by a spare Sonoff TH16 that I had which will only be used for monitoring going forward. Don't compromise your safety by using cheap smart switches for high wattage draw devices, there are lots of horrible stories out there that show just what I've experienced but I was lucky that my greenhouse and garage didn't burn down. Probably would have also damaged the house as well since they are 15 feet apart. If anyone needs more details or help with setting one up let me know. I've ordered 2 more to covert some other projects (medium wattage draw) because I feel much more confident with this setup.

Because I can't attach pictures to this post I'll post them separately.

Today I discovered I can change my trigger IDs to just be a number, and then give each script a single action that uses the trigger ID as the value to set.

I am having three underfloor heating wiring centers installed in different locations. Each of them should be able to activate the (single) circulation pump. The wiring centers are designed to send 240V to the pump.

Is there a straightforward way of sending the 'signal' to the pump, perhaps via a 240V transmitter/receiver set up? I'm struggling to find options that aren't hundreds of pounds...

So what is cat6? Well normally it means the frequency of data it can handle at a given length, not the gauge of the copper, at least to consumers. In enterprise, you are likely using actual cat6a. \n\nMost builders and contractors say cat6, but it's really not... \n\nHence voltage drops at length. \n\nUnrelated, devices only needing 24v when supplied with 48v doesn't really make sense, unless you're saying the actual hardware might run lower after down volting?

In that case, yes, everything you're saying is correct. You'll see voltage drop on the relatively small gauge cat5/6 lines very quickly. \n\nActive poe (ie spec'd poe) however is a voltage range because its anticipating the voltage drop. The device has to ask for power from the switch (or active injector). 802.3af for example has source voltage of 44-57 and endpoint voltage of 37-57. That difference is the voltage drop due to cable length. A device that is truly poe capable (not passive) then must accept a range of input because the cable could be 5', or could be 300'. See this camera for example, its poe range is 36 to 57v. And if you power it manually, it's input voltage is 12v. Most likely its regulating the variable poe voltage to 12v.\n\n[https://www.hikvision.com/en/products/IP-Products/Network-Cameras/Pro-Series-EasyIP-/ds-2cd2023g2-i-u-/](https://www.hikvision.com/en/products/IP-Products/Network-Cameras/Pro-Series-EasyIP-/ds-2cd2023g2-i-u-/)\n\nI'm sure theres some cameras that require 48v poe at a minimum, but I think those would be limited to higher end ptz models."", ""silvenga: This was active 48v via the BT spec using dedicated BT injectors.

Look at the specs around DisplayPort, VESA's spec says 50 feet - but you would be very hard pressed finding any cable that can actually do 50 feet reliably - you mostly find 15 feet passive cables, and anything more uses active repeaters (which, if only looking at the spec, shouldn't be needed)."", ""HootleTootle: You were using shitty CCA cable.  Or you terminated it wrong.  Or tested it wrong.\n\nFor example, I have a Unifi Flex-Mini POE powered switch running a Unifi external access point and a G5 Bullet camera.

They're running over a piece of CAT5e (solid copper) that goes along my workshop roof beams (40ft wide, 15ft high), across the yard in a duct (30ft), up in to the house attic (8ft), and then most of the length of the house (60ft), plugged in to the POE switch (UDM Pro SE).

If you set up an automatic cat feeder and large bowls of water, they'll have food and water for 1 or 2 weeks (they won't like the litter situation though), and by that point someone you trust and have your house keys will likely have noticed your absence without an automation's input and gone to take care of the cats.

Tentamos fazer ele desarmar pelos meios normais (ligando secador, ar condicionado e chuveiro) e não desarmou.

Ligamos os interruptores corretamente e testamos várias vezes.

We are building a smart apartment with Zigbee Hub and switches from ZemmiSmart. We have a total of 10 switches, but when we went to install the eighth, our DR breaker tripped.

We think it was something related to the neutral, since this eighth switch was 4 gangs and with neutral (the one without neutral is not available). We then tried using a 1-gang non-neutral switch and a 3-gang non-neutral switch as well (since we hadn't closed one of the small boxes on the wall yet). 

But even so, when we tried to turn on the office light, the DR tripped. We tried to make it disarm by normal means (turning on the dryer, air conditioning and shower) and it did not disarm. We wired the switches correctly and tested them several times.

I have a heating system consisting of mini-split heat pumps and resistance heaters. The heat pumps work well above around -10c but below that they can't keep up and the resistance heaters need to kick in. Running the pump below that temperature also uses more power than the resistance heaters anyways so they should be shut off. This is at a cabin, meaning I'm often not around to manually make the switch.

Are there any systems that would be able to handle this? The Sinope interlock system is exactly what I need but unfortunately isn't available to consumers.

When coming to different automation techniques for a new house, what is the best option: Keeping all the things on local network and wifi operated ensuring everything has a electric backup and also works in case the local network goes down by wiring up a pc to the brain (control board)
Or, automation by keeping the physical electric connections, not buying expensive wifi/ bluetooth controlled devices and using a relay (connected to controller board) parallel to physical switches on wall, ensuring these devices work as usual even in emergencies such as wifi going down.

2.
A lot of companies have their different ecosystems and stacks for home automation that may not or may be compatible with others. I know a lot of control board are designed to work on major protocols that are followed by major brands. Yet I feel that an fully open source concept, where I would be using raspi as the control board and using open source home automation os such as homeassistant or openHAB would be better just in case some company stops producing some hardware or using some the same protocol as it use to.

3.
Where do I get started. There are a lot of categories that I'm looking forward to automate

*Lighting & Music 
*TV, Playstation, Music System
* callSecurity (House Gate, Cameras, Doorbell)
*Network (Switches for all ethernet connected devices)",12,"[""kigmatzomat: You are missing options:\n\nUse a multi-vendor wireless home automation standard that isn't reliant on tcp/ip like zwave and zigbee.

For the systems that require physical switchs (lights, fans, heaters) in a conventional house, I'll go with a system wherein I'm automating the switchboard itself (using relays) and not the device, ensuring that the systems will work despite the local network being down.

Therefore still susceptible  to virus, etc .', ""kigmatzomat: Not silly, just uninformed. Which you can't address without asking."", 'kigmatzomat: FYI, most smart switches/dimmers work fine as regular switches when their control system is down.  The only exception are where you are using events/automations so devices on different circuits interact.\n\nEven that isn\'t always a deal breaker. Z-wave (which uses a mesh network) can allow two devices to communicate without needing a hub using Associations.\n\nAs for ""best"", well, it depends. If you need remote access, commercial products can have a lower long-term cost due to economies of scale.  Some commercial products like HomeSeer, have been for decades, while open source is less than half that. Open source is also more likely to be used in hobby projects, so a much smaller percentage of projects are used in large installations, while some commercial products are known for scaling to hundreds of controlled devices, again HomeSeer.\n\nMost people dont start out planning to install 25, 50, 100 devices and spending thousands of dollars so they start with a low cost solution, which they outgrow.  \n\nOnce you hit that point, the cost of the controller becomes a much smaller percentage of total system cost, while at the same time, the stability/scalability/performance directly drives the value of all the other connected devices. The time cost of platform migration is non-trivial at that scale as well. \n\nIf you have $3,000 worth of sensors, locks, switches, etc that aren\'t working and are looking at spending 1-2 full days migrating devices & rebuilding logic to a new platform, is saving $200 on a controller really a value?\n\nBut since everyone doesn\'t install 50+ device, not everyone outgrows the low cost solution.  \n\nSo again, ""best"" kind of depends.', 'kigmatzomat: I have 80 zwave devices and one controller.  Not one of those 80 devices can infect or spy on me. The risk model of securing 1 device vs 80 is completely different. \n\nPlus I can unplug the ethernet cable on the controller to isolate it and it works just fine (minus internet weather feeds and such).', 'siobhanellis: Can isolate it? So you don’t, plus not much of a smart home then as how you going to communicate with the hub?\n\nLastly, what type of devices, that are typically deployed in a- wave, are going to spy on you? How they going to do that?', 'kigmatzomat: If you are using an app, that is remote control, not automation.  Needing an app inside the house is poor design. \n\nMy house does 99% of events automatically.  Lights turn on and off, doors lock, the water valve closes when an interior leak is detected, the announcers tell us when the washer is done, the bathroom floor is warmed before we wake up, pipe heaters respond to temp sensors and weather reports, if smoke is detected the lights come on/doors unlock/alerts sent to text/email/notifications, etc.\n\nAnd of the 1% of manually triggered events, the house itself is the UI, with hardwired buttons and remotes. The remotes see use mostly as ""snooze"" buttons for the wake up lights and usually the upstairs scene controller is just used to display/change which of the 4 wake up schedules is in use.\n\nI only use remote control when I am away from home and need to do something unusual, like open a door for someone I didn\'t already  give an access code.  \n\nThe rest of the time hub access is for configuration & testing. \n\nMy hub is connected but it has very limited ability to communicate. Routing configuration prevent it from opening a connection to any device inside the network (but not the reverse). External outbound connections are limited by dns & hosts file to Google.com (gmail), weather.gov, openweather.com, and homeseer.com.\n\nThis gives me remote access via http tunnel, email notifications and weather feeds. \n\nAs for spyware, there are three flavors: operational information, network observation and outright attacks. \n\nOperational information for most automation devices is limited (motion/presence, door acces, temperature, water leaks, light levels, switch status, fire/co presence, etc). That doesn\'t pose a direct risk but would irk me if there is also a local API (i.e. every homekit device that also has an app). \n\nI am more concerned with network observation, such as a wifi devices that reports back on all the different wifi access points in range, the connected devices, etc that would turn me from user ABC1234 to John Q Public, 100 Main St, Anywhereville USA, who has an XBOX, a Roku, a Samsung smart TV, three iPhones, two iPad, three Kindles, an Epson printer, two echo dots, a Roomba and a Ring security system (all of which I made up for this example)\n\nI would rather not be ""productizable data that can be sold"" as it means I am the product and not the customer.\n\nWhile far less likely, we can\'t ignore the possibility of wifi devices being truly malicious and do things like man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept traffic.\n\nNone of those is possible with z-wave.', ""siobhanellis: But it is, because you have a hub and you have it on.\n\nDespite saying you can unplug it, you don't.\n\nI have a system built on HomeKit. It uses a mixture of protocols (WiFi, Bluetooth, Thread and Zigbee). Most importantly it runs locally, and I too can pull the plug, but this time being internet. However, as I use HomeKit,  also use HomeKit Secure Router which gives me a level of protection.\n\nAnd, BTW, I agree with you that automation is not using an App or a voice assistant. Those should be the exceptions. My point was that you would have to use the app to do configuration. I should have been more explicit.""]"

* How do I set up zones that already have an AVR in the space for home theater and music listening?
* How do I run a source from an external AVR back to the Monoprice whole home amp for sound across the home?
   * I currently have a set up in the main living room with a dedicated 7.1 amp that we use for watching movies/tv as well as music listening. I want to be able to source this audio to the rest of the home when sports or tv may be playing through this AVR to the other zones. I would also like to use the Monoprice amp as a source to the whole home when listening to music. I see that the Monoprice has RCA pre-out that would work here, but I already bought in wall speaker wire ([https://www.monoprice.com/product?p\_id=2817](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=2817)) and am trying not to buy more cable for such a long run from the 3rd story down to the 1st. 
      * Am I able to use in wall speaker wire as RCA pre out to my current amp in the living room? Can I double up the speaker wire run to the front speakers so I have wire coming from the Monoprice amp AND the AVR and switch the source independently? 
      * What is the best way to get the source from the living room back up to the control room and playing over the whole home? Line out or run it over ethernet with a converter? Another speaker wire run somehow??

Below are my zones with each component that currently exists or may exist in the future. All zones will have ethernet ran to them as well.

* Control Room - 3rd Floor Loft
   * Will house as much as possible here, but I am not looking to have everything controlled in here (yet). Some zones will have an external AVR/Amp in them to power the speakers. I have thought about running everything from this control room and running HDMI over ethernet, but am not budgeting for that right now. Most zones will have ethernet drops for expansion if needed.
* Zone 1 - Living Room
   * 7.1 AVR. Main area for viewing sports/tv. Will want music from whole home amp, local viewing, and source from here to the whole house.
* Zone 2 - Front Porch
   * 2 speakers that will be powered by the whole home amp
* Zone 3 - Back Porch
   * 2 speakers that will be powered by the whole home amp
   * Will eventually add TV and source to power current speakers. May want that sourced to whole home as well.
* Zone 4 - 1st Bedroom
   * Currently empty, eventually TV/AVR/speakers added. Whole home audio and local audio for TV viewing.
* Zone 5 - Second Bedroom
   * Currently TV with Chromecast. Will want to eventually have speakers for whole home audio and local audio for TV viewing.
* Zone 6 - Master Bedroom
   * TV with AVR and speakers. Want to play whole home audio to this zone as well as local speakers for TV.
* Future??
   * Zone 7 - loft area with AVR for local viewing. Will want music in here from whole home audio source.

I was fortunate enough to have open walls so I was able to run wire wherever I want.

I regret not running some extra wires to a few hallways, guest bathroom, etc.  Basically places where I want background music while entertaining so it\'s not just in specific rooms.\n* Wireless technology is competing with WHA and getting better every year.  Grouping a bunch of Alexa is easy and works just about as well. Plenty of reasons to not want Alexa, just bringing that up.\n* I would separate out the WHA and individual AV rooms.  I wouldn\'t even bother trying to use the speakers in the room for both (though it\'s possible with A/B boxes).  If you want a room for audio or watching movies make it, but don\'t link it to your AVR.\n* I even see limited value in using a bunch of inputs to the system.  Example: you put speakers in your kids room, then put a bunch of Alexa as inputs to the amp, now they can select music from that Alexa and play it to their room.  Why?  Just put an Alexa in their room.  Or small stereo system.  It\'s not worth involving WHA for individual rooms for family members, or AV rooms, IMHO.\n\nI use the WHA downstairs for ambient music, and a couple key areas upstairs - though less often.

I can tell any Alexa to play music on ""Home Audio"" and it feeds into the amp.', 'None: [deleted]', 'poopwithmetony: If you’d like to have your 7.1 act as a source for your WHA, I’d recommend running 2 RG6 or RG59 cables from your AVR to your new amp. These cables will be made safely into RCA cables. I would not recommend turning your in wall speaker wire into RCA as you will likely not get reliable performance. RCA at the living room will be an audio output, and an input at the control room/amplifier. Sonos is a great solution for a lot of people if you aren’t bothered by the cost (or aren’t overly concerned about audio quality. Sound quality is good enough for 99% of people, audiophiles may dispute this.) I’m noticing you would like multiple locations in the future to possibly act as a source for your whole home audio.

im building a new flat, im looking for smart light switches and wall plugs. I was looking at the LeGrand Living Now which look really minimal and modern. Though i think they only support Zigbee.

They might seem easy to dismiss for now, but I\'m not so sure if you\'ll keep putting up with those for years until you throw in the towel and want something that doesn\'t need continuous tinkering. For a new construction, you cannot go wrong with the reliability of wired connections. If I were you, I\'d go with KNX as a very stable standard running on a bus that can be branched (no loops needed). The command buttons in the walls will be connected to this data bus, and so will the actuators in the electric closet (the relays that actually turn on/off the power to lights, wall outlets, window rolls etc.). It is an elegant solution tested for decades and continuously evolving, ""programming"" is not difficult, it\'s fully independent from cloud providers or apps or interfaces. A 4-button keypad is under 60€ (can have from 2 to 8 buttons, with or without LEDs), a 16-channel actuator is under 300€. You can add a light/wind sensor to automatically control window rolls to prevent too much light/heat overheating the house at the peak of summer, and a lot more built-in automation that just works.', ""amelore: There is not a lot of Matter stuff available yet.\n\nSince it's a new place you can do bus cabling and relays, that's not cheap but very reliable and definitely a good option.

You can use a bridge to get to HomeKit from KNX.\n\nOverall it’s a pretty awesome system, but it’s something that needs to be on your mind early in the build - it’s a significant investment so you need to make sure you have allocated enough budget before it gets sucked off into other parts of the build (if there’s one thing I have learned through this process it’s going that no matter how much money you have, it’s never enough…). You need to think of it like you would HVAC - expensive but necessary.\n\nWireless stuff is more reliable than it used to be but wired is still going to be better. KNX also has the advantage of longevity. KNX gear will last 10 years or more with minimal tinkering so it’s a great solution for high-end apartments etc where access is difficult.\n\nIf you are in Europe, Loxone might be an easier solution. They are both very similar. Again, probably too late as both require some pretty major modifications to your power board (at least it does here in New Zealand and I assume the Eu too).

Wired sensors and switches are far more reliable and impossible to jam; which is a plus if your alarm system is also sharing sensors with your smart home.\n\nYou could have empty conduit and sockets ready for every point where you plan to have sensors. Then you could add low power and a bus where needed eg. KNX. Or you could add Ethernet everywhere, which with PoE and splitters allows you to provide power and/or connectivity to a lot of things.\n\nWere I building a home from scratch today, I'd have Ethernet sockets everywhere, more than one per room, both near the ceiling and near the floor. Some of those sockets could be used for sensors, some for WiFi access points, some for whatever smart home automation hub, some for PoE lighting etc.\n\nWhatever you choose to do, just leave plenty of empty conduit and empty sockets anyway."", 'Mirthgiver: The “Chinese Spyware” argument always makes me chuckle. I’ve just given in to the fact that everything is monitoring me at all times.

Support will go to getting it set up for the US first and I know getting stuff through Eu electrical regulations is tough.', 'puterfixer: Loxone is a proprietary, closed system that promises everything you need. But you are stuck with what Loxone has in its portfolio and no other choices for features or prices. It seems to require to have a server that coordinates everything, including visualization and remote control.\n\nKNX is an open standard with hundreds of manufacturers offering competing products for the same need with different feature sets and different prices. This avoids vendor lock-in. KNX devices, once ""programmed"", only need to be connected to the common bus in order to talk to each other, no server is needed for a button to turn lights on or off. This decentralized approach eliminates unnecessary dependencies. The downside is that if you want visualization and control on a tablet, that\'s an extra component to be added to the bus; you can go for a KNX native solution (will be expensive af) or just a USB or Ethernet interface to your choice of automation, visualization and control - HomeKit, Home Assistant, openHAB, etc.\n\nTo me, KNX is excellent for lighting - manageable cost, flexibility for growth/redesign, excellent reliability over decades, reasonable interface for integration and control to a central hub that manages multiple systems. But for heating, it\'s 1) stupid expensive, 2) lacks some additional features that other systems offer (for example learning the thermal inertia of a room or motorized control of an electrovalve to only partially open it, thus reducing the discomfort from temperature swings), and 3) the ultimate reliability is not justified by the price.\n\nI mean, after paying a small fortune on stuff in the house, I expect that the lights will turn on every single time I press the button when going to the bathroom in the middle of the night, but if I can get a significantly cheaper wireless thermostat with more features and just the risk that maybe sometime it might fail to broadcast a message to open or close the valve, but it will succeed in a few minutes, that\'s not essential to me.\n\nI will need to set up openHAB or another automation solution to integrate with the wireless heating system as well as KNX, so that it reads the information about humidity in the rooms from the wireless heating system and sends it to the ventilation system connected to the KNX system.

looking to replace my now ancient TV with a smart one that I can integrate into my smart home (HomeAssistant and Alexa), so I'm looking for feedback suggestion etc.

Right now I'm using a Roku stick and while its been great, I hate the fact that I need to use two remotes (one to switch TV inputs, one to control the roku). 

I'm also looking for something that runs YouTube Kids by default (this unfortunately excludes Roku since they don't have the YouTube Kids app).

Most of the feedback I'm looking is on the various OS's the TV's come with today, Android TV (google TV), webOS, Tizen OS, etc...

Some of my other requirements:
- ability to change inputs via an automation (either via integration to alexa or even better local integration via HA)
- ability to change apps via an automation (thinking something like turn on TV and switch to Netflix)
- ability to use parental controls

This is a Nakamichi Receiver 1 or E60407. There are only 4 channels, A+B, with left and right channels. There are four sets of wires coming in though, and three of them are connected to Channel A, and 1 wire connected to channel B. The three wires connected to channel A are tied together through a resistor to the positive terminal of channel A, with the negatives just being tied together directly into the reciever. I have no idea how these four wire sets correlate to the 9 different speaker sets throughout the house and their volume controls. 

[https://imgur.com/a/RnNyGGN](https://imgur.com/a/RnNyGGN)

So now I'm basically looking for a 4 channel amplifier/receiver that can mimic his original function. Not looking for multiple sources through multiple speakers simultaneously, he just wants the one source amplified through the whole house. 

Original Post:

My father had a whole home audio system installed probably 30 years ago and they are now experiencing issues with it, and can't find anyone in town to work on it. I've looked at it, and it looks relatively simple but I think there may be some things going on in the walls that I can't figure out. It appears that he has a receiver with 4 stereo pairs outputting to at least 9 different speaker pairs. On the back of the receiver there are 4 sets of stereo outputs, and that appears to be it. In each zone he has a volume controller that looks very similar to this:

[Monoprice Speaker Volume Controller RMS 100W (Rotary Type) - White - Monoprice.com](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=8243&utm_term=&utm_campaign=PMax:+Smart+Shopping+-+Monoprice+-+Adapters&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&hsa_acc=6614305189&hsa_cam=18132465494&hsa_grp=&hsa_ad=&hsa_src=x&hsa_tgt=&hsa_kw=&hsa_mt=&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQiA54KfBhCKARIsAJzSrdo9rrDfbQPj3bAZKxQNNwURTAz8w_qFQ860_70hSU7GhIkoQYf16bYaAsuJEALw_wcB)

When I took off the wall plate, from what I could tell it looks like there are three sets of wires tied in together, I'm assuming an input coming from the receiver, wired in series with another set of wires going to another set of speakers, and then an output from the volume controller going up to the speakers in the ceiling. First question, is this normal to drive 2 sets of speakers through a single output on the amplifier? Is there another amplifier buried somewhere that I'm missing? Can you adjust one set of speakers in a setup like this without it affecting the other set connected to the same zone?

The amplifier seemed to be on it's last legs, and my father told me it seems to have finally hit the dust. In looking for a replacement, I was looking at a multi-zone amplifier. I think this should fit the bill:

Am I barking up the right tree? Can anyone provide me with some more details on what I should be looking up to verify the wiring for a system like this?r",16,"['hedg12: Those are most likely impedance matching in-wall volume controls. There are probably jumpers  on the back of the volume controls that let you configure how many stereo speaker pairs are connected to each volume control and pass the load through a resistor network accordingly to maintain a safe  load for the amplifier. \n\nIf it was working up until the old stereo died, your easiest course would just be to replace the receiver with a comparable stereo unit (most have ""A"" and ""B"" speaker outputs, so stereo is probably OK). The biggest limitation of that system is that you\'re limited to having the same source playing everywhere. The Dayton amp would let you play different sources in different zones simultaneously, but it would require you to run new wires to the speakers. The Dayton is also just an amplifier, so you\'d need sources (tuner, mp3 player, streamer, etc.) to provide the actual source material.', 'ksh3rm99: You are on the right path, but you will need a zone controller as well to push the right music to the right channel.

I\'m also a little OCD, so I would re-wire everything so I know *exactly* what is going on behind the walls. For all you know the reason the last amp bit the dust is because the speakers were not wired correctly and there was too much strain on it. Two speakers can be driven through one output, but no, it is not ""normal"" and depending on if you wire them in series or in parallel it completely changes the resistance on that circuit.\n\nAnyway,  I\'m sure you\'ll hear from some people here that are way more knowledgeable than I am in this area.

I was infuriated to see my new ""automated"" house came with zwave devices -T6Pro Honeywell thermostats and Zwave switches, skybell door bell camera and IQ Panel. They asked to me to shell monthly some money for all to be activated, I refused it thinking I will find some hack later. May be a mistake.

I just need my thermostat connected to phone to control. Nothing fancy. I already changed skybell door bell camera to an wifi doorbell camera after I noticed that it wont work unless I pay and activate my IQ Panel. I hate paying monthly subscriptions. I would rather pay one time and own it.

Is my IQ Panel in my home completely useless without service? When I tried installing apps to connect my T6 Pro thermostat, it said I need a zwave bridge. What is the best way forward here?

If you want to leverage your zwave devices, I suggest a Homeseer. Hs has been around 20 years and it has a proven track record. Every 7-ish years they release a major software update, where the purchase price amortizes the cloud services for another generation. They manufacture zwave hubs, zwave radios, and zwave products so they have engineering proficiency.  Their platform is a complete automation system and it can use their app or 3rd party apps.\n\nIf you get the HSPi model, make copies of the SD card and add an external drive to store the apps & logs. Its pretty common for SD cards to die in general and constant log writes are the most common cause of death.""]"

I have an Echo in my room that I have connected with a 3.5mm audio cable to the line-in on my Windows PC. The PC is connected to my home theater receiver for audio from my on-board HDMI. Everything works as intended and the audio from the Echo and my PC are mixed, however when I turn off the receiver to go to bed, the speaker is no longer audible since the line-out is connected. The receiver has a setting to allow signals to pass through the ""TV out"" HDMI port, but I have connected my TV directly to my Nvidia card to allow a higher refresh rate, and in any case the TV is turned off at the same time the receiver is.

This is obviously problematic for things like important voice announcements or alarms through that specific Echo.

Does anyone have any good ideas about how I can get around these limitations while maintaining the connection between the Echo and the PC/stereo and not having to leave any components on 24/7 aside from the PC and Echo?

Not ideal for someone living with others, but I live here alone so I don't have to worry about that. If I get fancy I can use room occupancy status to narrow down which zone should be solely active.\n\nMy current receiver has Bluetooth built in, but it does not mix the other audio sources with the bluetooth stream, so that's a no-go.\n\nAt this point I am seriously considering leaving the TV on at all times and just sending a signal to turn the picture off when I go to bed.

Also, I've been having a lot of trouble with these f\\*#%ing Sony components. I thought everything would play nice since Sony should be used to gaming systems (ie. Playstation / PC) being connected and I got a Sony X90K TV and a Sony STR-DH790 receiver. No such luck.

For those who are system integrators and installers, what do you recommend?

Pakedge, Araknis, and Access Networks are owned by SnapOne, right? Understandably, these cater to the AV side a bit more? At least what I see in the interfaces. I think Pakedge calls VLANs zones.

I want to make sure that the network setup will not sacrifice function and security while it is catering to a home end user experience, if that makes sense. In other words, does a Pakedge switch cater to the home AV side but at the expense of dumbing down the functionality? Or is a system that uses say a Pakedge switch, Access Network controller and wireless access points, and Araknis router a more than capability network setup, regardless, with or without considering AV or home automation?

That said, the Pakedge switches, at least, are certainly not cheap so if cost says anything about performance.

Thank you.",1,"['poopwithmetony: As an AV integrator, I have to say my personal preference is to stay the hell away from Ubiquiti. While they are quite cheap (and hard to find at the moment), they have absolutely no tech support, minimal documentation, and their products are difficult to warranty. On the flip side, I love the SnapOne networking pieces. I love Araknis routers, switches, and access points. The araknis switch in particular comes built to handle MoIP and other heavy network traffic. Access networks make the best access points in my opinion, but cost will come into play here. That being said, all of the SnapOne products will integrate easily into Control4 because they are all owned by SnapOne. It sounds like you’ll have 8-10 PoE devices at max, so it may be worth calculating what you need from PoE. If the power budget is on the lower end, consider going with the 210 instead of the 310.  Control4 integrates well with whole home audio setups, and it works amazing with Lutron Homeworks, Ra2/Ra3. Long story short, I’d go mix and match with SnapOne products.

I'm looking for a system that performs monitoring and can switch off circuits under certain conditions.

I was wondering if anyone here had put together a system that covers most of the functionality of span? Like an Emporia system with some smart breakers and a standalone control system coordinated by home assistant. I figure that installing a leviton panel isn't much less expensive than span, and I'd prefer a standalone system that could be upgraded in the future without a whole new panel.",6,"['combatwombat007: I haven\'t taken a really deep dive into Span, but I don\'t remember seeing anything about it that didn\'t look like it couldn\'t be easily handled by other devices + a normal panel.\n\nFirst off, if you have a 200 amp panel, replace it with another 200a one that has a 225a bus. That gives you more room for solar.\n\nThen for monitoring, one or more iotawatt / emporia vue flashed w/ tasmota or a box full of din-rail mounted shellies like  u/sancho_sk mentioned. That will also get you the most touted Span feature, the AI appliance warnings—""this motor is using a lot more energy than usual.""\n\nAs for circuit control, I\'m not totally sure what the value of that is beyond toggling them while working on a circuit by yourself and away from the panel. Saves a minute or two running back and forth to test your work. But how often do you need that? \n\nAnd I don\'t know for sure, but I believe Span\'s circuit level control is ""trip only""—meaning you can only remotely toggle it off, not on. That\'s for safety. Believe all smart breakers are the same.\n\nIf you wanted to mimic that and have room near the panel, you could do a bit of rewiring and add heavy duty smart switches as the first device on each circuit. Probably want to choose carefully which circuits to add that to as they are kind of expensive and again, limited usefulness in my mind.\n\nFun project. Hope you post it here if you go for it.', ""Spottyq: I sort of do this already.\n\nKeep in mind, I'm in the EU so our electrical panels are different. I have 3 phase AC, and our electrical panels are designed on DIN rails (standard circuit breakers & other devices are all DIN rail mount.)\n\nI have an Iotawatt to monitor electricity usage per circuit. Besides that, I a PLC (a [Unipi Neuron](https://www.unipi.technology)) to toggle the circuits or parts of circuits I want to control. My PLC's relay are only rated for 5A (of resistive) load, so basically only lights. For anything else, I use the PLC's relay to control a bigger relay that will actually switch the load.\n\nAs u/combatwombat007 said, I don't really see the need to control all circuits, so didn't install this for all circuits. I only control stuff I want to regularly toggle (so electric heat, hot water, lights, blinds. But not for example the electric range, oven even though they are high power draw devices.) \n\nI saw your answer saying you're on solar, do you mean off-grid ? If so I would definitively control all high-power draw devices as well. Not sure I would bother with anything else. If you're so low on battery that you probably want to switch everything off anyways. Or just have a big relay switch off a complete sub-panel with all non critical circuits.\n\nYou'll see that the cost of a single channel is quite big. You need an extra output on your PLC, a big relay, more cabling and a bigger electrical box.\n\nAlso check out how much power a relay requires to be kept on.

My usecase is that I'm on solar, so when my battery gets to X percent I'll want to shed certain loads.  Like I'll automatically set my AC/ heat on the thermostat, but then at 50% battery power, I'll cut the AC circuit.  \nTBH, this isn't something I need, I can automate all of my most draining circuits already without the panel.  But if I can do something like this ~2k, then I will.  I am planning on monitoring either way, just hoping someone has experience with remote controlled smart circuits to see if there's a way to put in something like the eatons and a controller without paying for a new panel."", ""EntropySimian: Thanks,  \nI should probably mention that I'm in the US, so most of my circuits are above the Shelly 16A capacity, but that does look close to what I was looking for."", ""combatwombat007: Well, now I'm headed down a rabbit hole to learn more about span's remote circuit control.

I'm not a fan of wireless objects and, since the house is new and we can use cables everywhere, I want to go full wired!  
I also want to avoid cloud services, all the automation will be managed locally with Node Red and, at least the lights, must work even if the controlled goes offline.  
I like the Shelly products because they can work without the cloud and they can work even without the controller (in case the latter would fails).

I was going with the Shelly Pro, they seam perfect, but they don't do dimming :(  
Do you guys know any other product available in Europe that can dim lights?  
For the switches, I think we will run all the cables into the switchboard where we will install the devices.

I'm having a look at the KNX devices too, but I guess that with that protocol the project will be more expensive (and I don't know if the KNX switches have the same ""shape"" of the other switches/sockets).

Do you know about any good wired temperature sensor? Maybe one with a singe controller and multiple sensors so that I can put the controller in the switchboard and one sensor in each room.

I am pretty sure around here it would be frowned upon to have fuses go to some “switchbox” where people then connect individual light switches to various fuses. Ability to easily change which circuits go to which fuses sounds… unsafe. Usually you have one run from fuse box to entire section of the house and then there’s many lights and switches that branch off of that one circuit.

Realistically all these systems need maintenance eventually which for most users means paying another  consultant a premium in the future (don’t even get me started on selling a hardwired system).\n\nI know these are great, and definitely something I would want to have in my forever house but the fact is the market for wireless devices is just so massive.

Following [Lutron’s instructions](https://webapiaw1proddat01st01.blob.core.windows.net/assets/documents/368-4493_Page_3.pdf), I joined the two travelers and load wire in Box A together, and capped the ground. In Box B, I joined the two travelers to one of the black wires from the Caseta, joined the load wire to the other black wire, and connected the green wire to the ground.

When I turned the breaker back on, the light is flickering constantly, and I can’t turn it on or off using the Caseta, it just constantly turns itself off and on.

I tried switching between Box A and Box B, but got the same result.

I have installed dozens of Caseta dimmers in my home to replace single pole switches without issue, but this is the first three way I’m tackling.

Instead of getting no-neutral switches, I am wondering if I can wire it up as below? Using grey color as neutral.

Switch will be using tasmota which I can uncouple the physical switch from relay. Light bulb is Hue so it's always powered anyway. I plan on using home assistant to pair the two. Down side is if HA is down, then I can't turn on the light. Down the road I might replace light bulb with tasmota compatible ones so they can talk to each other without HA.

Has anyone tried this?

Update: Took a few days since the original switch box was too shallow and I had to go to hardware store to pick out a deeper box. The switch I am using is this: [https://cloudfree.shop/product/cloudfree-motion-light-switch/](https://cloudfree.shop/product/cloudfree-motion-light-switch/)

The button and relay can be detached using setOption73. Once set, home assistant can detect single to 5x presses and each can be configured for different automation. I have set single press to toggle the light bulb so far. The lag is almost imperceptible, maybe 0.1 - 0.2 second.

It does rely on home assistant running to function. Down the road, I will change the light bulb to tasmota, which will rely only on a working wifi, or change the switch to zigbee (if there was one with motion) then it will just depend on the zigbee network.

That means the switch box does not have its own neutral, which was fine 20+ years ago. Now we have all kinds of devices to go in switch boxes that require a neutral. \n\nYou *can* rewire the switch feed in the light box to use the switch leg for a neutral instead. It might confuse the next guy if he isn’t familiar with smart home tech, but that’s his problem. The fixture would always be powered at that point.

The light bulb used is also a smart bulb so it needs to be powered all the time anyway. Usually when you flip the switch the switch closes a relay and it in turns supplies power to the bulb through the (usually) red load wire in the smart switch. \n\nUsing tasmota it is possible to uncouple the physical switch from the relay so flipping the switch does not open or close the relay. Instead, flipping the switch sends signal to home assistant which then sends signal over wifi/zigbee to toggle the light bulb. There will be 0.5 second lag. It kind of makes the smart switch functions like a light remote except it’s powered by wire. \n\nReason I want to do it is because I want to use a switch with motion sensor and there isn’t one without neutral.', ""Gowlhunter: No, a smart switch that requires a neutral is what OP is looking for.\nAnd no, not necessarily a ground unless it's a metallic switch plate or ceiling rose then it's always required"", 'clin248: We renovated the whole house and strangely enough this is the only switch box without neutral. \n\nThe light will be powered by hot wire directly in the light box.

And it works by tapping a minimal current across line to neutral and it switches or dims line to load. And a no-neutral is a high resistance when off between line and load that draws enough power to do the smart stuff. Ground being for safety in both cases. Sorry for the basic question/assumption- just want to learn/understand.', ""Gowlhunter: Hi, I could only find the time to reply now.\n\nSome smart switches have multiple wires such as the Shelly 1 or Sonoff mini.  \nThese are only usable when you either have a live and a neutral at your lightswitch\n\nOR\n\nYou have a live wire at your lightswitch and another live and a neutral at your ceiling rose.\n\nSimple explanation: \nThe smart switch IS CONNECTED DIRECTLY to the live line of a NON-SMART bulb.\n\nIf you only have a live wire at your lightswitch and the same live wire and a neutral at your ceiling rose, a Shelly or Sonoff mini will not work as the switch in the off position will cut off the power to the smart device. \nA smart bulb also suffers from this problem - flicking a standard light switch to the off position cuts the power to the smart bulb. This doesn't make your house very guest friendly.\n\nSo OP proposed converting the live wire that is at their light switch to a live and a neutral as explained here: https://rithumhome.com/neutral-wires-are-easier-than-you-think/\nand then using a smart switch which requires a live and a neutral to control a smart bulb...WIRELESSLY\n\nSimple explanation: \nThe smart switch IS NOT CONNECTED DIRECTLY to the live line of a SMART bulb. \nThis method should not be done unless you own the house and hire an electrician. It's an unconventional approach and could easily result in a fire if converted back to a dumb light switch by an electrically incompetent person.\n\nA ground is not always present at a lightswitch and smart switches don't typically require them. One is meant to be run to all modern light switches where I live now but plenty of houses still don't have them and they should stick to non-metallic light fixtures and light switch plates.

My initial attempts a few years ago were a bit frustrated through integration issues and the sheer number of apps so I gave it away.

However, As the new house is going to have 4 doors to the outside I started looking at how to create some form of lock sensors; which looks like is solved by smart locks. Looking into that further led me to SmartThings which sounds like the answer to the integration and fragmentation challenges.

I’m just now starting to understand how many possible angles there are to this and it’s a bit overwhelming.

I had a couple of questions.
- is Smartthings a good choice as a central hub to base things on? E.g., does it make sense to change air conditioners to one that is smartthings compatible?
- are there any competitors to smartthings for joining it all together?
- what do people think are the most important things to integrate when doing a new build? 
- are smart locks any good? My worry is it all going out of date and becoming obsolete in a short time frame

I resisted for awhile, finally switched and couldn't be happier.\n\nIve interacted with august locks, nest, Yale they all have their nuances on how they work / integrate. Some support zwave or zigbee integration which is really nice for local control of the device by a hub. I like August but it's a preference.\n\nFor any device, even if you don't go with home assistant, check out their integration list and look to see if a device is cloud or local. Cloud depends on a vendor internet service which sucks, local typically needs an hub supporting zwave,zigbee like home assistant/hubbitate interfacing with those protocols but in the end it's more reliable and less locked into a vendor.\n\nBuild suggestion, cat6 is cheap, run it everywhere you can and then some spare. Leave some spares in the attic, basement if you have it etc. And have it all run to a structured media cabinet inside the house.\n\nAlso plan your lighting well, it pays to think through where and how you want to control lights, it's the biggest pain to fix post build.\n\nMy favorite lighting trick is having switched outlets in the soffits of my house for Christmas lights.

We put in a Moen Flo (there are other brands) and I'm just blown away at how smart it is.  If the refrigerator connection starts leaking in the middle of the night, it will notice the extended flow pattern and alert me.  If I don't respond to the alert in a certain amount of time, I can have it automatically shut the water off - in fact, that's the default action.  And it's also a default that it will call your cell # with a text-to-speech prompting telling you your water has been running abnormally wrong, and unless you press 1 it will shut it off in 5 minutes.

Why does it matter anymore *where* a leak is?  Who cares.  I don't need a sensor under every sink and toilet any more.  ANY break or leak, will cause water to slowly flow and the monitor will pick up on this.

I think they're great, and at the cost of some of them it might be less than placing a dozen leak sensors around your house.

Now, for my sump pump ... I'll still put a leak sensor there obviously.

Oh, and another nice thing - the Moen can do a nightly ""leak check"" where basically it shuts off the water main in the middle of the night, and then it applies a bit of pressure I guess to see if the pressure decreases on the ""house side"" of things ... which would mean you have a leaky toilet or something somewhere.  It will, of course, alert you if it finds this.  It actually did start alerting us at first, but I checked all our sinks and faucets and couldn't track down the source.  Eventually I figured out what it was - our whole house humidifier was set to go on a schedule at the same time as the leak check.  So of course ... it looked like a leak.

In any case ... if you're thinking about putting a bunch of leak sensors around, think about having a plumber just install a whole house flow monitor.  It's way easier, and a lot more peace of mind IMO.",2,"[""sandfrayed: We have Flo and also use leak sensors.  The Flo is great, but what nice about leak/water sensors is they work much faster.  If a laundry hose starts leaking, it'll make a big mess by the time Flo shuts off the water.  You can use the Flo brand leak sensors that will make the Flo turn off right away if they detect water.\n\nAlso, we use leak sensors for places like under sinks and the laundry room where the appliance or waste lines may leak, which Flo won't detect. For that I personally just use cheap dumb leak detectors that just beep loudly if they detect water."", 'lastMinute_panic: I need to find a well designed system like this for a multifamily (12 units).

Plan is to flash it ESPHome and reflash the TFT to create my custom Home Assistant dashboard that's powered by mains. I won't be using the relays so L1 out and L2 out won't be used.

Now for my question, I read the way wires terminate in the homes in big/older cities here is you have two line wires (both have 120VAC each). They call it line to line. Can I just connect each of those line wires to L and N ports of NSPanel?

For more context on how it works in older cities, here's an excerpt from a blog post (https://myphilippinelife.com/philippine-electrical-wiring/):


MANILA AND CITIES: Three wire 120/240V Systems.  In Manila, Iloilo City and other large Philippine cities, residences are supplied with 240 volt, alternating current, 60 cycle power.  Power from the utility transformer to the residence arrives through three wires, two 120 VAC load (“hot”) wires and a single neutral.  Circuits in the residence are generally wired to supply 240 VAC to outlets using the two 120 VAC load wires, much the same as a heavy appliance (dryer, hot water heater etc.) would be supplied in the U.S. All small and large appliances sold in the Philippines are designed to use 240 VAC, 60C.",0,[]

It should be as simple as: 

 Push Aurora Dimmer> Office lights turn on

  Push Aurora Dimmer> Office lights turn off

Unfortunately, Amazon in their infinite wisdom decided to limit the ""Toggle On/Off"" for only certain supported brands. 

I have a philips hue bridge that allows me to bring the aurora dimmer into Alexa. Alexa recognizes the dimmer and its functions,  allowing me to trigger actions when the dimmer is pressed. 

So I tried creating two routines: 

Routine 1: Push Aurora Dimmer> Turn Office lights ON

Routine 2: Push Aurora Dimmer> Turn office Lights OFF

The issue with this method is that Alexa triggers BOTH at the same time so every time I push the dimmer it turns ON and then back OFF my lights. 

There exists no option to TOGGLE the state of a device unless it's a supported brand. It only lets me turn it ON or OFF. 

Now you might be wondering why use a physical button to turn on/off a group of lights when you can just tell Alexa to do it. You're right, I can just tell Alexa to do it, and all would be fine and dandy, but I want the ability to also use a button so when guests come around they dont need to know the automation to turn on the lights, and it would be way more intuitive.

This token (which is a long, encoded (sometimes encrypted) string that when decoded contains information about your session (who you are, what permissions (if applicable) were applied to this session, and can contain a valid MFA claim if you have successfully completed an MFA challenge)) is then used to talk to web services (websites, APIs, etc) until that token or MFA claim on that token expires.\n\nThis token IS your identity.\n\nFor example, you can enable MFA on your discord account and have to complete an MFA challenge when signing into the discord browser app, desktop app, or on your phone. However, if you are already signed in, you can launch discord in developer mode and access the cookies used within discord and extract your session token. Once you have that, you can use your token and successfully interact with the backend discord API without ever presenting your username and password or facing an MFA challenge.\n\nEDIT:\nThese tokens are/can be stored in cookies.\n\nin short, you can send a payload to the password reset service to initiate the password reset using the token stolen from the browser session. Using the same token, you can access the inbox and obtain the link. That link ultimately takes you to a page that that talks to an API. Since your already have the session token and you have the link from the email, you skip clicking on the link and just hit the appropriate API to confirm the reset.\n\nThey don't need to authenticate because they already have the (stolen) session token that you get from authentication."", ""spinozasrobot: 2FA: Something you've lost and something you've forgotten."", 'cpc_niklaos: There is a sweet thing called ""Windows Sandbox"" , it\'s a Windows Pro only feature but if, you have any doubt about something, spin up a Sandbox (it\'s very fast) and open it in there.

I have IKEA Tradfri smart light bulbs all around the house but regular switches.

I purchased a Zigbee No Neutral (because I don't have neutral wires) to replace one of the regular switches.

The Zigbee switch has 2 buttons:

Button 1 is wired to a smart bulb

Button 2 is wired to a regular bulb

Button 2 works fine but if I try to use Button 1, the smart bulb will come on for a second and then the whole switch with the bulb will turn off. This cycle will repeat itself endlessly if I don't press the switch again to turn it off.

Why does that happen and what can I do about it?",4,"['5c044: No neutral works by using a voltage difference over a resistor or similar.

A few months back, I wired overhead lights into the garage door light receptacle so that the garage would be lighted for ~2 minutes when a car pulls in or out.

I've been using the ""light"" button on the garage door opener to turn the lights on, but this has an issue in that It doesn't turn off, and of course it isn't ""smart"" so I inevitably forget to hit the light button again (not thinking if the garage lights were on ""timer"" mode or ""forever mode"")

What I'm envisioning is creating a logical  ""OR"" circuit in which if either a z wave switch is ON *OR* the garage door is on its 2 minute ""opening""/""closing"" sequence (it is outputting to its light outlet) then the overhead lights are on.

My ideal end state: 
 - Never have to use the ""light"" button on the garage door opener, so the lights aren't accidental left ""on"" and can be set to auto-shut off with the rest of my house
 - Use the physical switch to turn the lights on or off manually, or use z-wave to also turn them on/off (even if they were turned on by the physical switch)
 - If the garage door opens, the lights will turn on for the standard 2 minutes, REGARDLESS of the state of the switch/zwave
 - Ability to see the state of the light (rather than the switch) in HASS is a bonus


By using a 3 way z-wave switch I think I can achieve this with the diagram below

https://imgur.com/a/GTrkIAF

However I'm not sure if wiring a 3 way switch with a traveler tied directly to HOT is to code, I also don't know if this will mess up the ""smarts"" of the z-wave switch as it is not a standard wiring of a 3 way switch 

Looking for any input on this predicament (or alternative solutions.)


TLDR: Want to make my garage lights smart, but don't want to lose the functionality where they turn on when the garage door opens.",17,"['None: [deleted]', ""hedg12: I think your code concerns with the traveler wiring might be valid. You might be better off using the output of the garage door opener as a trigger to turn a z-wave switch off and on. Plug a wall wart into the opener outlet and have it trigger a relay. Then get a cheap contact sensor and hack into it & tie the common and normally open contacts of the relay to the points where the reed switch connects to the circuit board. Then when there's power to the outlet, the switch will read closed, and when there's not it will read open. Then let HASS turn the light on and off via an automation."", ""wivaca: Monitor and control should be separated and use HASS logic so you can make a very complex OR gate.\n\nStart by simply having the garage lights on a smart switch.  Lights go on/off manually at the switch or remotely controlled from HASS.\n\nNext, detect if the garage door is opened by tapping into the 110V light socket on the opener as you have. Have that power a relay with a 110V coil and use dry contact closure detected on a Rasberry Pi, Arduino, alarm system, or other HA gadget and read that from HASS to detect if the garage opener light is powered.\n\nNow, if lights are turned on manually, set a flag and clear it when the lights are turned off manually.\n\nSeparately, monitor the light socket on the door opener.  If contact closes/power comes on (garage door opened) send a signal to turn on the garage lights (whether or not they may be on manually).\n\nWhen the garage door light power goes off  (e.g. 2 minute timeout) check the flag of whether the garage lights were turned on manually or not.

It's possible that a Zwave switch exists that supports the parallel switch setup you're contemplating through a bastardized 3-way config, but I'm not familiar with one.

The front door has a panel with four switches:

[View of Panel](https://i.imgur.com/lXkUu2L.jpg)

* Top Left (Switch 1) : Controls the light outside of the front door
* Bottom Left (Switch 1) : Controls an inside outlet against the wall
* Top Right (Switch 2) : Controls two fans on the front porch (fans have no lights)
* Bottom Right (Switch 2) : Controls the light/fan combo in the Living Room (There is a wireless device to control the fan's speed)

I imagine this would be a whole lot easier if it was a 4 x 1 panel, but the wall framing prevents this (exterior door on one side, exterior window on the other, no room to expand).

Looking at Lutron's website, I'm not sure if they sell a switch that would easily replace my current setup.  Their basic light switch is just ""on and off"" so that won't work.  The only switch that I see is close is the switch with a fan control, but in my case I don't think that would work.  Maybe I'm wrong here.

&nbsp;

Any help here?  It sounds like I need two switches that can each handle two separate ""devices"".  My initial thought is that I need to treat one device as a light and the other as a fan.

I have a pond pump powered by a 750w BLDC motor w/ onboard controls consisting of 3 momentary buttons for power, speed up, and speed down.

It also has an esp-wroom-02 wifi chip on it.

It's a decent pump, but the controls are junk. Onboard buttons work fine, but the app that controls them remotely is hot garbage. Totally unusable.

I want to figure out the most pragmatic way to hijack the controls so that I can automate the speed settings. Power monitoring would be nice, too, but not required.

I run home assistant (not skilled with that either, tbh) and have a number of z-wave and wifi devices from before I knew better.

From my very novice view, I think I have 2 options to achieve this:

1. Use something like a [Zen16](https://www.getzooz.com/zooz-zen16-multirelay/) and figure out how/where to solder the leads into the buttons on the PCB and then use the relays to ""press"" the buttons for me.
2. Flash the wifi chip with some new firmware that will allow me localize it and run it with tasmota or esphome or something.

Currently I have little understanding of how to do either of those things. But I'm ready to learn. What I need is some guidance on which path will get these controls into home assistant with the least resistance for someone who's never done either.

Just wondering if there are better NVR packages than Frigate, since getting hands on a Coral seems to be a bit of a problem, and that was the main reason I was going to go with Frigate in the first place, for the AI object detection.

Will be running at least 5x 5 megapixel POE security cameras externally, and eventually another 2 or 3 2MP PT wifi cameras for monitoring the interior and the pets. (these probably don't need object detection)

Same box will also be running Home Assistant, some sort of Media server solution, and also some very minor webserver and SQL database loads as I fiddle with learning this stuff.  My plan was Proxmox, home assistant and frigate, with mariadb, nginx and opencloud/nextcloud.

Original build was was going to be a HP Elitedesk mini G1 (with a 4570T and 16GB ) for size, and it was going to be installed in the roofspace, but installing in the roofspace is out due to heat (it hits 55deg C on an average summers day so neither the switch nor the PC would survive).  

I now also have available a mATX system with an Intel Core 10105 and plenty of ram, and willing to throw a basic video card in if needed. So I now have far more options on disks/IO/cards than with the Elitedesk Mini if needed.  (If i can get a solution with the EliteDesk thats performs well enough i'll probably donate the mATx system to a local family).

I also ran a new cable, so I still have full fan control and full capabilities for heating, cooling, etc...  I also have multiple room temperature sensors. The sensors are in my living room (same floor as nest). One in my bedroom (floor above), and one in my office (basement, 1 floor below). 

So my nest is in my dining room. I don't know why, but this is the warmest room in the house by a good margin.

If I run my fan to circulate the air in my house it's a lot better. I run it though like 30-45 minutes every hour. This seems excessive, and it can be annoying.

I haven't worked with IR before, so I assume I have to somehow capture what signal the remote sends for Up/Down, then repeat that signal in automation for the time needed to fully raise or lower the TV.

Has anyone done something similar before?",3,"['undeleted_username: There are off-the-shelf devices that can do that: look for ""Broadlink RM4"" or similar.', 'Dansk72: Home Assistant does have a Broadlink RM4 Integration so that should make it fairly simple to use a RM4.\n\nBroadlink does have a huge library of over 50,000 existing IR codes but it they don\'t happen to have one for your TV wall mount then you can use the ""learn"" function to read your current Monoprice remote control.

I'm pretty sure this can be achieved with a simple function in NodeRed but I'm no expert with those nodes.

Hi

I have the Sonoff ZBMini L2 and it's quite cute. I even replaced the switch connected to it to a momentary one for more consistent experience.

I wanted to know whether it's possible in any way to use more options, such as double click or long press to respond to other actions.

For example, a long press will turn toggle the light, while a short press will just send an MQTT command to Home assistant.

Is it only firmware dependent?

I started in r/homesecurity, decided to looked more closely at a DIY home security setup, went down a several hour rabbit hole, and here I am with some questions. 

I'm hoping to start with an automated security system, plus some lights and thermostat, on the HomeKit ecosystem. Does this setup make sense:

* Alarm Panel- Honeywell Lyric
* Motion Sensor- Aqara P1
* Door/Window sensors- Aqara
* Flood sensor- Aqara Water Leak
* Doorbell- Logitech Circle View 	
* Outdoor Camera- Eve Outdoor Camera
* Outdoor Lights- Phillips Hue Welcome
* Thermostat- Ecobee3 Lite

And then to run it, I understand I'll need a hub to run the Aqara (M2)- I think everything else works without a dedicated hub? And an Apple TV or HomePod to coordinate everything at home?

1) Does this setup make sense? Am I on the right track?

2) For the alarm system, I'd like to have active monitoring. Do Alarm Relay, AlarmGrid, or others allow you to set up your system/gear? 

3) I have an old DSC 1550 Alarm Control Panel and wiring installed in my house. Am I (or a professional) able to swap that out for the Honeywell? Or is there something easier I'm missing?

Thanks... I'm still figuring this out so please let me know if I'm missing something obvious.",1,"['mahk8: It is doable but it really depends on your skills, effort and $$.  You have several options but if you go with your current list, you have introduced yourself to several different underlying technologies and protocols which may make problems difficult to solve.  Honeywell Lyric uses z-wave. Aqara uses zigbee. The remaining Logitech, Eve, Phillips, Ecobee (likely) uses wifi.  Try to minimize the protocols if costs aren’t a signifcant issue. \n\nActive monitoring can be purchased on professional installations or DIY systems. Alarm Grid seems to offer both options. \n\nThere are options to reuse a DSC Alarm system. Envisalink or Konnected.io allows you to leave the whole system in-place and run in parallell (with Envisalink or Konnected.io) to make it a smart system. This is a good option since you wouldn’t need to repurchase sensors that you already have in place with the DSC system.\n\nFinally, you’ll probably want to think about a coordinated system rather than having disparate systems on your phone. Homekit (with Homebridge) is a good start but you’ll find that you’ll out grow quickly from either frustration or feature capability (i.e. lack of). As for a starter, homekit/homebridge would be fine.  Look at Home Assistant or openHAB for a more robust integration platform.\n\nHome automation is an addiction, once you start down this path, you’ll spend countless hours and money working on and expanding it.  🤣']"

I want to change that and maybe head towards a HA installation on a Pi4. I got a bunch of Shelly 1L to put behind my switches since this is a prewar NYC building and does not have neutral in the switch. In my living room i have a 3 seed fan with lights. The switch controls power to the fixture and a chain is used to turn the fan on and 3 speeds. The main power goes to the light/dan box then there is a 12x2 that goes from that box to the switch for on/off operations. What i want to do is use this switch wire to bring hot and neutral to the switch box so i can use it as a power for the HA tablet and install the Shelly 1L at the fixture without a switch connected to it and eventually have a on/off toggle on the tablet. So my question would be can this be done? Is it a good way of achieving the wanted result?  What options do i have to separate the fan and the light on the fixture or the chain mechanism is the only option? 
Thank You all",2,"[""Vlad_the_Homeowner: I'm having trouble following.  Let me see if I have this right:\n\nMain power comes into the fan box then a 12x2 runs to the switch box, and only the 12x2.  In other words, the 12x2 is used to bring the hot leg in and run switched power back to the fan.\n\nIf that's the case, you have options.  But I'm not sure any would be to code.  Was a grounding wire run between the boxes?\n\nYou could use the 12x2 to run a hot and neutral to the switch box (again, ground?).  You won't be able to physically control power to the fan, and this is likely off code, but it's done. You now have a switch box with both line power and neutral (ground?), which could be used to power just about anything.  If you used either a Shelly or any Smart Switch then put a Shelly in the fan box you could control it via smart system.  Personally I'd only do that if you have a local based system, the delays in smart communication bother me (Z-wave+ direction association notwithstanding).  \n\nThere are ways to convert the old school chain fan speed to smart control.  Some switches claim to be able to do this. I can't say I've tried it with a chain pull, but I did it with a couple of my fans that use a remote, and it likely works the same way - the chain or remote just triggers a switch that lowers the power delivered to the fan.  So you set the fan to max, then install a smart fan switch, and the switch reduces the power instead.  Just note that there are a couple different ways to regulate that power to the motor, so these switches work with most fans but not all."", ""SNKWIRED: You could install the Shelly in the light fixture box and then use the 12/2 that is in the light switch run to connect to the switch contacts on the Shelly. You just have to be sure they don't run anywhere else first and there is nothing else on the line.""]"

For example, with the Zen34 remote switch,  you'd want to add the nano module to both Group 2 and Group 3 on the remote switch.  \n\nNote that for associations to work- you must use the same security level on all devices.

I'm building a new kitchen and we're about to put drywall on the walls. Before that gets done, I want to plan for how I will wire LED strips under the cabinets (connected to a DigUno/Quad) and potentially along the floor in the future (see photo). 

I am a complete novice at this so please be patient! 

I think the electrician has just hardwired on/off LED lights in the past (non smart ones). Electrician told me he was just planning on putting a main wire (120v) throughout the kitchen and connecting the LEDs that way, but I don't think that will work.

Should I have him install a two wire cable to hop the sink and stove? 

Alternatively, is it worth having him put some conduit back there to hop?

Can I wire a main 120v line to a power supply or should I have him install an outlet that will be hidden inside the cabinet?

Rant: 

1. too many smart home options
2. shelly is what I use today but all my wiring is 12g and it is tiring
3. tired of trying to smash a shelly or several in a box
4. shelly turns my switches into 3 ways which works great but I think I'm tired of trying to figure out which way to flip the switch

Looking for:

1. Something extensible to homekit or somebody tell me something that will get great WAF in it's place..we are an apple home but can adapt.
2. I use homebridge but something that goes behind the scenes is ideal
3. I love to tinker/program things but I don't want to play with it every day..this is where homebridge seems pretty nice. Home assistant seemed great but I don't have the rest of my life to dedicate to tinkering and patching. 
4. reasonable price point. I did a recent count and I have somewhere along the lines of 35 switches and 20 or so 3 way switches...very few dimmers but a reasonable priced dimmer might make me change that. 

Some of the shelly positives - off timer, built in homekit with OTA firmware swap, they **just** work in general, and their price is actually pretty good when you put them side by side.

My background - I work in IT which is where I say I like to tinker, however..I also have 4 kids and sometimes the thought of coming home and ""working"" more isn't something I long for at this point in my life. I might spend some time on it but overall I want it to take very little dedication over the course of a year. 

Overall, if I spend more than the price of a shelly I want some incentives...fits in the box better, provides me a better view, etc. In my current smart home I have a mix of camera solutions but have mostly stuck to shelly for switching. I did install a smart fan controller from sonoff but would like to find a solution that has more of an on/off at the wall in a traditional sense without their junk remote. I really want my smart home to appear dumb when you walk in so nobody feels like they are trying to figure anything out but I have the option to set timers on lights or just control them via apps. I have tried to read through similar posts but if you scroll a page or two you find somebody that says...use zooz, use GE but I don't ever find a good direction on a whole solution. Maybe there just isn't a narrow(speaking in terms of vendors) way to get the whole job done without spending a ton of money! Maybe I'm not RTFM'ing enough here and you can all just downvote me..I've been on this journey for some time, just seems like a never ending battle with more vendors/solutions coming onto the market.",7,"[""ChipBeef2354: Hubitat hub supports Shelly and has Zigbee and Z wave built in.

The problem with changing switches is that most require a neutral wire, but most boxes are not supplied with a neutral because it has never been needed, until now.\n\nThere are some technical solutions which don\'t require a neutral. \n\nOne uses a battery in the switch, that simply sends an activation signal when pressed. You still need a relay elsewhere, typically at the light, where the live and neutral are both present. And you then either need to pair the switch and the relay, or else program your home automation with what to do when the signal is triggered.\n\nThe other allows a small amount of power to pass across the switch, enough to power the switch itself, but not enough to activate the load (make the lights glow enough to be perceived as ""on"", etc)\n\nBut for either of these solutions to act natural, the switches typically need to be momentary ""bell push"" switches, or else to send the activation signal only on transition from one switch state to the next, and not continuously. i.e. edge triggered, not level triggered.\n\nMy personal preference is to have the signal relayed through the home automation, as this allows you a lot of flexibility in terms of which relays you buy (now and later, across ecosystems), as well as having the switch trigger more complicated actions (turn on more than one relay, etc).

The doors we have automatically lock behind us, and the university I'm in charges us $30 to get a loaner key or to be let into the room, and unfortunately, I'm forgetful. I've been trying to automate this process for years with several different ideas to no avail.

&#x200B;

[Front view of the door](https://preview.redd.it/qsr8a12hy8fa1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1dc8ec3e25d6fa0275ac3f40f2a60437483bd51f)

My freshman year, before I was an RA, I unscrewed my peephole and glued a string in there, and tied the other end to the door knob. This allowed me to pull the peephole to unlock the door. but now I have an open sign on my door and fed a cord through that hole:

&#x200B;

[open sign](https://preview.redd.it/v5lhthzky8fa1.jpg?width=1576&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b4639924c16f739ba5eee265cb8dbe892ef46576)

My first idea after I could no longer use the peephole was to soft-hack one of these: [Electric Jar Opener](https://a.co/d/7B02vLM)

I thought that I could attach it to my door and have it grip onto the doorknob and twist it, I did get it to work with a fingerbot, but I could not use it normally and when I tried to solder it to a WiFi chip it did not go well, and now my mother uses it for jars.

I've had a lot of other ideas with one being just a motorized pully that would tie to my doorknob and pull it. I feel any freshman engineer could easily figure that out, but AutoCad is overwhelming, and I might run into the same problem of it not working as a doorknob. It is infuriating to see products like this that with a motor and connected to WiFi would solve my problems: [Door Closer](https://a.co/d/hgzpMOU)

Lastly, I've drawn up an idea that would work and not restrict the useability of the door knob as is, but I'm too much of a novice to know how to make it happen. I tried modeling the idea in AutoCad and Blender but both proved too difficult for a proof of concept, but my drawing is horrendous.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kgly80bzy8fa1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc7f93617efb69084161aa1adcc8cdb112b1fed0

Again I am aware I can't draw to save my life. The idea is to just have a gear move a ""stick"" up which would push the handle up enough to unlock and then I could push the door. I know I'd need some sort of motor (that would need to go two ways) but I'm not sure how to get the functionality to connect to Home Assistant or how to power it and whatever else is needed.

if there is a solution I'm not thinking of please let me know, it feels absurd that with all the smart locks that exist today, there's nothing that'll work. I'd be fine with taking this apart to an extent if you all have an idea but the outside has to look the same so I don't get fined by the school. so as long as I can put it back together the way I found it, I'm game.

Otherwise, if you have ideas of your own please do share my crude drawing is not the end all be all obviously.

My setup is Alexa based with home assistant running 24/7 on a VM with a ConBee zigbee stick. I understand this feels like a lot of effort to have a smart lock in a dorm room but I'm paying $30 2 or 3 times a month just to get back into my room, and I'm tired of eating that expense. Any help is appreciated.

What devices should I get to automate my home in 2023?,TomerHorowitz,5,10pxz9x,homeautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/10pxz9x/new_to_everything_what_devices_should_i_get_to/,"Never used home assistant or anything smart home until a couple of weeks ago. But I’m still a bit in with everything that’s going on with matter and thread.

I’m looking to automate everything in my home with my (new) local home assistant. What devices should I get that are “modern” and “future-proof”?

Basically looking for the whole ordeal:
1. Lights
2. Temperature sensors (not a thermostat, the homes where I live don’t have them)
3. Door sensors
4. Motion sensors
5. Light sensors
6. Power sensors

And honestly I’d like to know about any other sensors that you guys would recommend

Thank you!",4,"['Suprflyyy: I don’t know about future proofing but if you already have home assistant installed you should add at least zigbee and z-wave dongles. The matter stuff will be a while but with these two you’ll have a broad array of options that aren’t going away anytime soon. Depending on your needs and ability you might want to add an rtl_SDR radio but that is a lot more complex to set up. \n\nYou’ll have to decide your approach and user experience. I wanted my automation to be mostly hidden and useable with normal looking household switches. So I used Enbrighten Zigby and Z-wave switches for light control instead of bulbs that need to stay always on. They have a good setup for three way switches, motion, and dimmers. I also don’t want to be cloud dependent so I’m skipping any products that require that. \n\nI used Ecolink Z-wave tilt switches on my garage doors, and their magnet door switches on my outside gates and shop door. They also make a good motion sensor. I also Zoos Z-Wave Zen17 relays for control of garage doors. This still allows operation with the wall switch or remotes, but most of the time I open/close them with my Apple Watch using an iOS fired action. \n\nI already had Ring devices so I’m using those for outdoor motion detection, and I’m controlling my HVAC with two Honeywell T6 Pro Z-Wave thermostats. Those work great. My house came with an ADT installed wireless DSC system that transmits on 433 MHz, and I just recently got all of those door and window sensors added into HA with the SDR radio. \n\nIf you are very new to Home Assistant, read the docs, check out the sub here, and the online forums. Start small with an outdoor light and an indoor light and try out the simple sun-based triggers and automations, set up your automatic backups, and tinker around a bit to learn how it works. Build your first dashboard and get your presence sensing solved. Make sure you are happy with whatever hardware you put your OS on and that you have a good recovery plan if something breaks. \n\nThen have fun adding to it.', ""isitallfromchina: Can you describe your current home lay out ?  For example:  you talk about sensors - are you in a home that has an alarm system already installed ?  If so, is it hard wired or wireless ?  If it isn't, what are you planning to do with the sensors you describe?\n\nAdditionally, take a step back and discuss what you want to really do and start small and build on it.  HA is a powerful Home Automation tool, but it will burn you out if you don't have a good idea (and plan) to learn and build.\n\nI started really simple coming from Sammy Smarthings and installed light switches.  Created a couple of automations just to get the feel for how things worked.  That was in YAML where I did not feel that the GUI Automation area was mature enough to do what I wanted, even though they were just simple automation.  Taught me a lot doing so.\n\nMy first big automation was connecting a Tuya relay to my garage doors.  That is the point where I realized how powerful HA is.  I've since moved on to a brand agnostic relay switch via Zawave connectivity on my garage doors.\n\nPlan, plan, plan!  I cannot stress this enough - think through your approach and what really matters.\n\nFor example:  I wanted to integrate my home alarm system into HA.  Well I could not do that via the system as it was installed, I had to add a 3rd party device to do so.  I purchased a [Konnected.io](https://Konnected.io) alarm interface card with an ethernet port on it and connected directly to my network.  Then I started building automations around it.  Like, setting the alarm, locking the doors and ensuring my garages were closed at night and if these things were not set, set it.  That was fun and a great approach to a worry free automation that managed key functions in my home that I did not have to worry about.  Now it even tells me the status of all these things at bed time.\n\nSo for me, it was what really helped or provided time saving results.  Things like, automating opening and closing blinds for the wife so she did not have to turn the wand for 50 blinds to open and close them.  This was an almost 20 min task and started hurting her arm.  When these were automated, it was an amazing thing for her.  Same with watering her plants installed an irrigation system to do so.\n\nThese are the type of things I would start looking at if I were you.\n\nGood luck!"", ""ChipBeef2354: I recommend Hubitat for your hub.

Currently I have everything plugged into my Samsung projector using it's remote. It works alright, but ideally I would like to just plug everything into my Onkyo receiver. The downside there is now I have to deal with a good method of changing the receiver's input when I want to go from device to device. The Samsung UI is nice in that it throws up a switch icon so it is basically like selecting the switch as just another app.

Back in the day I had a harmony remote, but I believe they are discontinued at this point.

So back to my question, how are people dealing with this? There are many different directions that I could go (I have considered making an input tablet that controls the Onkyo receiver via IP and I believe I could control the projector as well the same way), but I want things to be as seamless as possible.

Currently I have an Nvidia Shield TV, Samsung projector, Onkyo receiver, and a Switch. The biggest thing would be to make sure when the wife hits the power button that the projector comes on, the receiver turns on to the correct input, and there is a remote she can point at the screen to select the content she wants to watch.

Any thoughts?

It is also possible to hook up an ir receiver to home assistant so you could then use any universal ir remote to trigger your scenes etc. Very powerful, ultimately customisable, but of course it is a lot of work and overhead to get there, and a bit of maintenance involved too.\n\nBiggest advantage is that it is fully local and self hosted so will just keep working as long as you care to keep it working.

1675107380.0,30-Jan-2023 11:36:20,Light bulb that can be triggered by HomeLink universal garage door transmitter,PantherkittySoftware,1,10pbr4f,homeautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/10pbr4f/light_bulb_that_can_be_triggered_by_homelink/,"I recently bought a new car. It has a built-in HomeLink universal garage door remote control. I don't have a garage (sigh), but I *do* have a front porch light that I'd love to be able to trigger via the car's HomeLink remote.

So... does anybody make a smart bulb that works something like this:

* Bulb has logic to detect power-switch toggling to enable the following states while energized:
   * dark
   * illuminated for 5 minutes (ie, enough time to exit the car and get in)
   * illuminated for 30-60 minutes (ie, plenty of time to unload the car, or wait for a pizza being delivered)
   * illuminated for 6-8 hours (more or less, ""all night"")
   * illuminated until told otherwise.
   * enter pairing mode (some long sequence that would be damn-near impossible for even a child to trigger
   * toggling the power off and on while it's already been illuminated in one of the above modes for more than a few seconds puts it into 'dark' mode (ie, this is how you'd deliberately turn off the light before its countdown timer reached 0)
* Bulb reacts to HomeLink button presses:
   * 1 press: illuminate for 5 minutes
   * 3 presses: illuminate for 30-60 minutes (on for 5, briefly off, on for 30)
   * 5 presses: illuminate for 6-8 hours (on for 5, briefly off, on for 30, briefly off, on for 6-8h)
   * 7 presses: illuminate until told otherwise (I think you can see the pattern by now)
   * 9 presses: state machine rolls over, and treats like 1 press.

I've never used HomeLink before, but I think ""pairing mode"" would work something like:

* screw the bulb into a portable lamp with switch so it can be taken into the car and held a few inches away from the HomeLink control.
* get it into pairing mode

In pairing mode:

* blinks some pattern when powered up to indicate that it's in pairing mode, then listens for its code. At this point, the code toggles it on and off (possibly, with some periodic blinking pattern to remind you that it's still technically in pairing mode)
* toggle power off and on, and it begins transmitting its code every 2 seconds so your HomeLink transmitter can learn it. Each time it transmits the code, the bulb lights up. To get out of this mode and return to pairing-test mode, toggle the power off and on again.
* To get out of pairing mode, you'd do something like toggle it off and on a dozen times, see a confirmation blink to let you know that it's going to exit pairing mode the next time you power it off for more than {n} seconds, then turn it off. The delay will basically take care of itself, because at that point, you'd have to unscrew the bulb and move it back to its real fixture anyway.

Does anything like this actually *exist*?",2,"[""arkutek-em: My chamberlain non-smart garage door opener came with a plug in wall adapter to turn on an interior light.

That was a pain as the remote signal was so strong. I tried going into the basement, upstairs , in the garage behind cara. Ended up having to walk down the street behind a hill for the others to stop receiving the signal.",0,[]
