JustHereForTheTips	3	13kmi6z	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/13kmi6z/whats_everyone_doing_for_long_runs_of_backyard/	"I have about 250 feet of fence I want to put lights around. It's a rectangle with 100ft sides and 50 across at the back and only need to light up those three sides. We've tried using a bunch of different string lights (the bulb kind, most recently these: https://atomismart.com/product/smart-color-string-lights which were thankfully much cheaper at Costco) but they all seem to die within a year. 

I'd like something either zwave or zigbee that I can connect to Home Assistant but wifi is fine. My HA machine is in the basement so getting an IR blaster outside would be a problem for IR-controlled lights. My first thought was some IP67 ws2812b LED strips but I'm starting to think the length will be a big problem to power it and I really, really don't need 30 LEDS/meter let alone more. Maybe it's not a problem, but slapping those on a metal chainlink fence feels like it's asking for problems, too. 

Needs to be bright enough to light up the back yard so I can see the dogs at night and my girlfriend wants RGB and not just white. 

Girlfriend is less than pleased because she's tried to solve the problem herself by buying three different brands/types of lights in the last month to replace those Atomi lights and all have failed and so now it's (urgently) on me to figure out. 

Would it be stupid to just cut up some LED strips and wire them up so it's just 1 or 2 LEDs per foot around the perimeter? I know I'll certainly have to counter voltage drop no matter what I do if I'm not buying something pre-made -- and I'm definitely **not** opposed to buying pre-made for this, I just can't seem to find any bulb style or similarly bright outdoor string lights that connect on zwave/zigbee from my searches so far. 

Any examples of what you've done that you're happy with or any suggestions?

Edit to add that solar isn't likely an option. We've tried solar string lights and we end up with only half of the yard lit by the time I let the dogs out as the other half doesn't get much sun due to trees. Unless they can all share the solar and/or batteries, or can use one larger solar panel at the start of the string, solar isn't likely to work."	4	"['siddharthnatu: Following!

The back is just simple LED lights on a transformer with a timer.

That might be why yours died. The way get around this is to use extension cords and break up the string lights into 2-3 parallel runs. Depending on how much power each run takes, you can use 1-2 z-wave/zigbee relays/switches to control them all. I've had 100' of string lights up like this for 5 years, and not a single bulb has died yet.""]"

I'm looking for a way to run audio through speakers in multiple rooms with an easy-to-use app to add or remove which speakers are active. Here are a few use cases:

&#x200B;

* I start watching YouTube on a Fire TV Cube in the living room, then I go to the kitchen to cook and want to mirror the audio on a speaker there. I'm familiar with the multi-room speaker setup through Alexa, but it looks like there's not much customization for enabling or disabling certain speakers within the group at various times based on the specific situation. In other words, I don't want audio to be mirrored on all sources in the group at all times.
* I start watching YouTube on a Fire TV Cube in the living room, then I go to take a shower and want to mirror the audio on a speaker there. Similar to above, I want to easily enable the bathroom speaker without impacting the kitchen or other speakers in the group.
* I'm listening to Spotify while I shower on a speaker in the bathroom then want to quickly disable that speaker and enable a speaker in my bedroom to transfer audio after showering.

I know most of my examples include Alexa device references, but I'd like the option to use better speakers in some rooms. Ideally everything would be linked through Amazon's Alexa network (or something better - open to suggestions), but I could still use speakers of my choice. I looked into the Amazon Alexa Echo Input, but it looks like that product has been discontinued.

Thanks!"	3	"[""Icehawk11: Monoprice sells a 6 zone amp. Home assistant can control the amp to turn zones on and off and select what source plays where.

I'm on a mission to automate the blinds in my apartment. They are standard roller blinds, but they are quite big. There are 5 windows and each one measures rougly 2.75m wide by 2.25m tall. 

I fitted 5x Aqara E1 Roller Shade Drivers, which roll up and down by using the chain, but ran into numerous issues with these. Mainly, I think the motor was just not strong enough to roll such a heavy blind, and since chain is also quite long they weren't able to roll them efficiently - the chain would often skip or snap. The battery charge also didn't last long at all, I assume because the blinds are so heavy.

I found a company which makes custom size electric blinds, but for windows of this size each blind would be ~£550. For 1 window this is reasonable, but for 5x it's far too expensive. 

I also came across some DIY kits which seem to insert into the roller tube itself. This seems like a much better approach, but does anyone have experience with these or recommend any reputable brands? Are they able to roll such a heavy blind reliably? I'm not sure what sort of torque rating would be required.

Ideally I would like to wire the into the mains (so no reacharging them all the time) and also have integration with HomeAssistant

Whilst I believe he has an iPad and may need such to configure the units and then also offer remote control and scheduling, a dedicated remote (or two) may be the beset option (especially for carers etc).

Upnp is not available outside of typical router firewalls so a man-in-the-middle attack wouldn't be feasible using this particular API.  This isn't a cloud risk.\n\nWhat they show is if they can enter the owners home carrying a soldering iron they could demonstrate that it is \\*theoretically\\* possible to take control of the device - they  were not actually successful in taking it over.  The other vector of attack is if they had direct network access to the device they might be able to gain control over it via the API.  Again maybe, not demonstrated.

A successful intrusion into a manufacturer\'s cloud service would be a lot more serious than this - for example download new firmware to bridge network access to operators in an unfriendly nation (tuya scares me a lot).

(Ring alarm not available in Australia)	What_in_ptarmigan	1	13joabm	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/13joabm/possible_to_set_up_ring_cameras_with_alexa_to/	"Ok so I have a Ring doorbell and two floodlight ""security"" cameras.

When I leave the house, I can switch the system to ""away mode"", but it doesn't automate any security features. The security cameras have in-built sirens but these can only be activated manually, unless you have the Ring Alarm system (which unfortunately isn't available in Australia).  


The other day I saw a would-be thief too late. By the time I got the notification that someone was in my yard, they had already left.   


What I'd love is for the doorbell person detection to trigger a loud dog barking sound from a big speaker inside. Then maybe if the security cameras person detection triggers in my yard, it triggers the speaker to play a siren sound.

&#x200B;

Is there a way to make this happen perhaps with Alexa (I've never used it) Or any other solutions?

**Here's the problem I'm trying to solve:**

*I miss having a light switch.* 

I don't like that I have to use ""Hey Google"" or pull my phone out every time I want to quickly flip the lights on or off. I'm aware of smart light switches available on the market, but they are pricey, almost all of them require you to buy a hub to work, and I don't want to replace the current light switches because we're renting.

I've seen the many DIY projects available online through raspberry Pi's and creating a custom dashboard full of smart controls, but that's not exactly what I'm trying to do. I already have a Google Nest Hub which acts as a central hub to control my home.

**The idea is this:**

What I would love to try and create is a miniature touch screen, say about 2""-3"", which only holds a single light switch toggle on it. Google Home already has the perfect light switch toggle, a simple click on or off, and slide to dim:

&#x200B;

I'd love to just slap that single light toggle onto a mini screen, stick it on the wall of each room, and regain that physical light switch in each room again. The only projects I can find online at the moment are for building large dashboards to control the whole home on 7 or 10"" screens.

I feel like the simplest solution would be to make a simple web application, connect it to google home through their API, and then create my own light switch toggle to be as simple as the one above, then just load it up onto some sort of Raspberry Pi that's set up to load up a web browser leading to my app. I've never built something like this before though so not sure if it's that simple or not.

My other major concern is the hardware itself. I'm aware that there are mini 2""-3"" touch displays for Raspberry Pi's out there, but ideally, I'd want this to be battery operated so I can just stick them up onto a wall and recharge when needed. What's the feasibility of adding a battery to this? How long could it last, and how could the battery be best optimized in the smallest form factor?

If there are any existing projects like this around, feel free to share! I'm not the most experienced at electronics or software but have plenty of time to learn and experiment at home."	11	"['Ninja128: You\'re vastly overthinking this.

I'm looking to update the two large ceiling fans in my home. Currently, I have some old fans installed and Lutron Caseta fan and light switches to control them via Alexa and the Lutron app.

However, I'm struggling to find modern fans that I can replace them with. And ""pull-chain"" options are limited and/or dated.

Initially I was looking at Kicher model 330000PN for the design but since it has a built-in receiver and its own in-wall switch, I'm pretty sure it won't work if I use the Caseta fan switch.

Ultimately, I want to be able to Alexa-control my fans and ensure the motor isn't impacted and that I don't have any buzzing or other issues from either the motor or the light.

Has anyone had any personal experience with this or has anyone been able to find a helpful guide outside of the limited guidance that Lutron provides? I'd prefer to stick with Caseta for fan control, but I'm open to other options if I have to consider others.

Thank you in advance for any advice or help!"	26	"['wee-o-wee-o-wee: I ended up buying the ""Hunter 52"" Cassius Outdoor Ceiling Fan with Pull Chain"" in Black and control it with a Lutron switch.

You wire it without the remote receiver. See page 5 here for wiring diagram: https://image.hunterfan.com/3773-01.pdf\nNote: If you want a fan with a light, you will need to have separate switches and wiring at the wall that goes to the light and fan location for this to work. \n\nAnother option: Get a ""smart"" fan with built in home automation controls.

A) easy to hide in standard plastic wall socket box (not sure how they are called in English)
B) works with home assistant without a problem

Mostly wanted it for the style but also wanted to use a cool blue light as a night light so my parents can see if they get up in the middle of the night. That I can do with automation no problem. 
Issue is my parents are dead set on using the old toggle style light switch. Now the traditional dumb switch will cut power to the smart light... Killing it's functionality. 
I need to find a solution where I either by pass the switch and have the light powered like it was plugged into an outlet. And a false toggle style switch that sends a signal to home assistant that toggles the light state. 

Or a smart switch that works with smart lights, bypassing the relay. Ideally in the old stick toggle format.  Communication type is a non-issue as I'll get wifi, ZigBee etc to work with home assistant. 

Basically the end goal is to let my parents use the light as they always have with as little change to them as possible. 
And use home assistant to set routines for night time automation. 

Any advice on a products or solutions?

The plan is to  
\-Install a home network with a switch that has PoE ports and 2 x  Ubiquiti Unifi Wifi 6 lite WAPs.  
\-Control relays for electrical devices to be shelly branded. and will be as mentioned below  
\-Shelly Plus 1PM, SHelly Plus 2PM, Shelly Dimmer2, maybe some shelly RGB to control RGB in my computer room.  
\-Use  Aqara Roller Shade Drivers for all blinds in the house   
\-Install a control board in my garage where all shelly devices are to be installed on din rail with 3d printed mounts and wired in one location for ease of access without having to get in the roof or shove things behind wall plates (plus gives me something to play around with).  
\-Set up Home Assistant to act as my server and run this with a raspberry pi 4 4gig version.  
\-Maybe install extra relays for future lights to be installed in the garden.

I have included a rough plan of my house I have made while counting relays,  
\-Is there anything I can do to make this system more streamlined?  
\-Would I have any gain from choosing shelly PRO line over the basic ones I have chosen

It's been so handy that I'm now expanding that to every room. Walk into a room and the lights come on, as you walk through the house the lights come on and then turn off as you go on your way. \n\nIt's super useful for things like occupancy of rooms to turn off lights if no movement is detected. It's to the point if I now go to the kitchen to get a drink I often don't bother to turn off those lights as I leave, or quite often if my hands are full, I don't have to worry and they will just turn off. Likewise Lux sensors that I've been picking up as you can get motion and lux ones in a single unit for a minimal extra outlay means if it gets overcast, I can set a minimum threshold in darker rooms to ensure that the lights come on when it will be useful. \n\nIn my living room the lights come on if it's getting dark and there is motion, so if either of us get home late from work the lights will come on naturally for us as we get in but won't waste power unless we need them. \n\nAll the sensors I've been using use sticky back pads to attach to the wall but you can get more traditional ones and I've seen hard wired ones too.

You can normally update the container independent of the underlying OS.\n\nAnd you can copy the whole thing to another system that can run docker / docker-compose without having to install anything else - so if your Pi or whatever is too slow or fails (assuming you have backups) you can pretty easily move to another setup.\n\nI'd avoid all cloud based IOT devices, as they aren't private and you depend forever on that cloud service both existing and being accessible."", 'Blitherakt: Gotcha.\n\n>\t…dimmers are like any relay…\n\nA relay is a physical make/break circuit, while a dimmer is a resistive (or duty-cycle, or other method) in-circuit device that tweaks the power delivered to the load.

It feels like a violation since you could leave stray voltage on one or more circuit legs with only one device in an “off” position, but that’s 100% a guess.\n\nI’m also totally out of y realm with CBUS stuff, so I’ll just defer to the Euro/Aus guys instead of confusing the issue more. :)', 'Blitherakt: I’m using Ubiquiti gear and a mixture of LR-6 and the older exterior Pro APs.

I finally got things sorted out by repurposing a coax run between the basement and living room for a MoCA pair to an 8-port switch to run the media and main AP, and then running another MoCA pair from the main floor to another unused cable drop upstairs. That upstairs run handles two of the older APs as the wireless backhaul to the second LR6.\n\nBefore running things that way, I was getting constant contention across a mesh pair that caused all sorts of client reconnects and packet retransmits.

So I just moved into a house that im renting, and none of the rooms have ceiling lights, or outlets powered by switches.

I would like to be able to use a wall switch to turn the lights on. Are there products that can be connected to wifi where the switch could wirelessly control the outlet which then powers a lamp that I have plugged in?

Zwave calls it association.\n\nIn the Zigbee ecosystem, Hue is a popular option, but can get expensive. As long as the Zigbee devices support binding, they should work together.\n\nIn the Zwave ecosystem, you could pair a battery powered remote switch like [this](https://www.getzooz.com/zooz-zen34-remote-switch/), with some smart plugs like [this](https://www.getzooz.com/zooz-zen04-smart-plug/).

By grouping devices together, they all switch as a group. You can group smartbulbs, switches, smartplugs, or even relays together. When you turn the switch on/off, all the plugs in the group follow. You can even customize the group controls (ie, switch turns everything on/off, but if you toggle individual lights, the whole group doesn't follow until you toggle the switch again). This option does require a bit more configuration, but doesn't require a hub, and allows you to use cheaper WiFi-based smart devices.

I'm on an exciting quest to redefine the boundaries of traditional cleaning methods, and I need your wisdom! I've recently undertaken a job as a cleaner at my local MMA/BJJ gym, where my task is to mop and vacuum the training room mats. As a member of this sub, you can probably guess my immediate thought: ""Why not automate this?""

I've been eyeing Roborock vacuum models to aid in this automation project. The gym mats are a hotbed for dust, dirt, and sweat, so the Roborock model will need a strong mopping feature and efficient vacuuming capabilities.

Models like the Roborock S7 and S6 MaxV have caught my attention as they seem well-equipped for the task. However, I am here to seek your advice and experience. Has anyone ventured into a similar project or used a Roborock for heavy-duty cleaning?

Your insights will be highly valuable in this automation journey, ultimately contributing to a cleaner, healthier gym environment. Plus, having a Roborock as a gym member would be quite a futuristic sight!

Thank you in advance for your help!

P.S. In case you're wondering, I will still be getting paid. If this endeavor turns out to be a success, I aim to help other local gyms automate their cleaning processes. We could be on the brink of a new era in home (and gym) automation!

Here is a link to the different mat types used in BJJ: [https://www.greatmats.com/mma-mats-materials.php](https://www.greatmats.com/mma-mats-materials.php)"	6	"['dmo012: I have an S7 and Q7. Both have mops attached and run almost daily. I\'ll say, they are nice to run for daily cleaning but will never replace a deep clean by a human. If you\'re lucky enough that they can complete the space in one pass without getting stuck having to go back to the dock to charge then you\'ll notice light dust is picked up, anything heavier than that and the vacuum can\'t really handle it. As for the mopping, lightly drag a partially wet (with water only) rag across your mats and tell me if they are clean to the expected standards. Again, good enough for daily tidying up, but if there\'s a mess in the kitchen, we have to get the real mop out. The S7 has ""sonic scrubbing"" or whatever they call it where a portion of the rag vibrates back and forth some, but it doesn\'t do much.\n\nIn short. It\'s not going to replace you but it might take a little bit off your plate to let it run while you\'re doing other tasks, you\'ll still need to go back through and sweep and mop yourself. I like the enthusiasm, though.', ""400HPMustang: I don't use either of these vacuums so I can't offer any advice on them honestly. \n\nI'm curious, I see a few obvious questions \n\n1. How large of a space do they need to clean? \n2. How long will the robots to take vs a human?\n3. How long the battery life is on the vac/mops?\n4. How often are you going to have to empty the reservoirs/vacuum bins?\n5. Will the robots get in the way of people going about their business or will the run overnight?\n6. Will you have to babysit them?\n7. Will the robots clean well enough that you don't have to follow up after them?\n\nIf all of these questions amount to the robots being better than having a human, why would they keep paying you after you get them set up?

It is a fantastic time saver and I see no reason it wont do a great job cleaning a gym I think you would still need to spend a few minutes getting spots it missed around equipment but I would imagine it would eliminate 90% of your cleaning time. Be aware it takes the robo vacs a few hours to run, they are probably slower then a human vacuuming by hand but you can let it run at night when the place is empty.\n\nBUT \n\nYour post makes it sound like your employed by the gym as opposed to the owner of it. If that is true how long will it take the owner to do the math on just buying his own robo vac vs paying you?', ""LostMyKarmaElSegundo: The biggest issue is that the robot will take longer than doing it yourself.  You're looking at shelling out $1000+ for a device that will take longer and do a worse job.\n\nYou can put cleaning solution in the mop tank and get some disinfecting action, but maybe not to the standard you're looking for.\n\nMy opinion is that a robot vacuum might be a good way to supplement your cleaning by running at night when no one is around, but it won't reduce your workload much.  Probably not worth the money."", ""ntsp00: The model with the larger water tank is the one you should try, I think it's the S7. It will take longer than you doing it yourself. Roborock sells a cleaner that's safe for the water tank but you can also spray any cleaners you want as a pretreatment which helps it clean heavily soiled areas tremendously. It won't remove scuffs and it can't mop edges, so that will probably still have to be done by hand. As far as vacuuming, I don't think you'll have any issue with this vacuuming sufficiently. Roborocks can vacuum and mop at the same time as well, but if you're pretreating you generally want to vacuum then mop since the vacuum part will suck up any liquids before the mop pad runs over it."", ""ntsp00: Light dust? The S7 is far more capable than you're saying. There are numerous reviews and tests on YouTube showing its suction power and how much it picks up compared to other robot vacuums. Mine has no problem picking up cat hair, food, litter, leaves, etc. There is literally no difference from the S7 to a human besides getting into nooks and crannies with a broom.\n\nHaving it mop daily is also far from necessary for it to clean well. There have been times where I let my kitchen floor go longer than I'd care to admit and the S7 always does amazing. And it isn't just water only, Roborock sells a cleaner to add to the tank and of course you can pretreat spots with any chemicals you want - I use an all purpose cleaner. The problem with mopping is it can't do edges so eventually at least the edges have to be mopped by hand. How often that needs done will vary by household.""]"

Is there a more reliable method? Maybe have google control the fans directly through Lutron? A separate ST automation just for fans?

I was hoping I'd be able to tie my home thermostat and swamp cooler together somehow.\n\nWhoever installed this unit extended the wires to the original dial controls on the faceplate so it all works like a window unit would. The power cable that comes out of the faceplate plugs and into a wall outlet. The way it is mounted has the vent airflow go towards a furnace thermostat, making it trigger the furnace if it gets too cold.\n\nEventually I want to install AC and call it done. In the meantime I want a way to control and manage these so they don't trigger each other. For now I have my Honeywell T9 set itself to 60 degrees around 11AM and a smart outlet triggers at 11:05 with the swamp cooler at low cool into the evening.\n\nI'm south facing with a large window and metal roof so it gets toasty in the mid-west desert. Its a 2 floor split foyer so only the upstairs gets cooled. The downstairs can get warm too so I'd like to have these compliment each other by having the furnace circulate the air around.\n\nEdit: I originally asked for a weather checking outlet because I used to have this function with a Global smart outlet but the platform used was clunky and not consistent.

I purchased four Yale Access Assure locks for the purpose of keyless entry into my home and integration with Amazon Alexa. I purchased the version with an access module and a WiFi bridge for each lock. My total cost has been well over $1,000.

These locks have been nothing but trouble and Yale support has been absolutely no help. Some of the locks burn through batteries quickly which is annoying, but even worse, every \~6 mo or so I have to fix something around the connectivity of each lock. The Wifi bridge has to be reset, or maybe factory reset, or maybe just power cycled. Or perhaps I have to re-register the module in the lock. Or maybe factory reset the whole lock. Pretty much every 1-2 months I have to spend an hour or two fixing something with one of these locks.

And then there is the Alexa integration. It only works about 1 out of 10 times. The only thing I want to do is automatically lock all of my doors at night. That's it. But I can't do that because most of the time I can't even control the locks from the Alexa app due to a ""communications error"". I have also tried IFTTT integration, but that integration doesn't allow any control of the locks. I have also tried Hue integration, but the same issue -- you can't lock the doors from the Hue integration.

Let me tell you about the last time I called Yale Access support on the Alexa issue. Me ""I am getting a server error trying to lock my lock from Alexa"". Their opening question: ""how far are you standing from your lock?"". I mean, my phone is using wi-fi to talk to Amazon's servers, Amazon's servers are talking to Yale's servers, and Yale's servers are talking to my Wifi bridge, and that's talking to the lock. It has nothing to do with my proximity to the door lock. Eventually, if I try hard enough they'll get me to do a full factory reset on one of my locks, but when it is all done, I get the same very intermittent behavior with the Alexa integration. 

Usually, it ends with ""you'll need to contact Amazon as it is a problem on their end"". Yeah right. Amazon's not going to help, and that's because it isn't their problem. All of my other Alexa integrations work just fine, including a few that I have written myself. The problem is on the Yale access side, but I'm closing in on two years now with no resolution."	106	"['jmuguy: We used Yale Assure zwave locks (yrd216) for our short term rentals, and they’re like tanks.

If the indoor air temp is changing (which it will be if you’re using your HVAC), the dew point is going to vary over time and you’re code could wind up trying to chase that dew point set point for a reason that I’m not entirely sure about. If you want your house to be dehumidified by your AC, the system refrigerant line (~40F) is well below the dew point in most if not all homes if you’re targeting a normal humidity and temperature set point.

Dehumidifiers can counter higher internal humidity, such as boiling soups/stews all day, needing to run any outdoor air intakes longer than normal, or more guests in your home.

I bought a house last year and I'm working on deploying Home Assistant right now.  I have 2 Rheem tankless gas water heaters, they are not EcoNet.  I already looked into adding the Rheem modules, but it's a no go for this version.  They do have remote control panels that control the temp and power to the units, these control panels are both in the attic on either side of the house upstairs, so they just stay on.  I don't want to run a sub-control remote downstairs, I want to be able to save some gas by turning the heaters on and off on schedules and be able to remotely control the temp.  

So I've been looking at getting something like this:

I see in the wiring diagram that this setup has a dry contact switch, if I understand correctly this should be sufficient to turn the tank on and off.  The remote control is a UMC-117.  It only has 2 thermostat wires coming from the heater to the remote and no separate power source.  So the question is, am I able to use one of these to replace my current remote controls?  Should I look at another solution?  What has everyone else seen or done in the past?  Thanks.

I want to be able to monitor uptime of these and get a reasonably timely notification if they have failed, power outage, or low temperature.

My instinct is that there should be a pretty easy way to do this in AWS IoT or with some sort of lambda function? I can write code, not genius level, but I can figure things out.

I am in the construction phase of my house and I would like to automate some things and since I am building I have the possibility to start everything from scratch and not adapt to what is already built.

My goals is to automate everything that is lights, blinds, curtains, gates, air conditioning, mini security system (optional depends on the price) I wanted something that is good, reliable and that would not give problems and of course not to expensive :D

Currently I'm in the process of budgeting what I need, number of switches, blinds, etc., to know how much to buy.

I need your help with tips and suggestions of brands (zigbee, z-wave, shelly, etc.) because I have some knowledge of this area but not much, and if I can get help from someone who has already gone through this configuration better. My idea is to have HomeAssistant integration and be able to use alexa/google.

All tips will be welcome :) note that I am in europe so if you have suggestions for stores and brands preferably European because of shipping.

TIA"	10	"['Apple2T4ch: Check out my [smart home prewire guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LNONZXsLi-R9ejamD9Bd2UfzpqjqEWVt0ZepTGmMC50/edit) for wiring tips :) I’d recommend going with something like Home Assistant to manage all of your connected gear.', 'Mirthgiver: That pre wire guide is really good. It’s probably worth noting down your construction method (eg the process for pre wiring a single story stick frame house will be different from a double story house of structurally insulated panels etc) or limitations to your build (for example, I had to use electricians that refused to use conduit making my pre-wire much harder).\n\nIf you are outside the US there are other considerations than simply shipping, a lot of products will simply be incompatible (like most smart switches) or restricted (US Z-wave frequencies may not be legal in your country).\n\nI’ve heard really good things about Casambi products for lighting, less expensive and problematic to wire than KNX or DALI but a lot more reliable than Zigbee.\n\nIs home audio important to you?', 'peixinho3: Thanks!!!', ""peixinho3: Thanks for the tips, yes a lot of things in the guide don't apply to me because it's a different type of construction in europe. In my case I want a more simple scenario like good brands to focus on automation switches, hubs etc. Home audio is not important for me."", 'Mirthgiver: What are you building? Single story, double story etc. I’ve found while building the particular items and ecosystem are more or less interchangeable and the *techniques* matter a lot more. Eg rather than pick “google home vs Alexa”, the bigger question is “do I want a wireless system like Matter or Zigbee or a hardwired automation platform like KNX, Control4 or Loxone”. A lot of the time your device and automation choices will be somewhat dictated by the building or lifestyle.\n\nRegarding home audio, do you think you will still want a smart speaker in each room for assistant access?', ""peixinho3: Yes I understand that. It will be a single house. For me wireless instead of hardwired it's ok and I would like to have a smart speaker in each room."", 'Mirthgiver: I think your biggest problem as you have probably worked out is likely to be smart switches. There aren’t a lot of great options for those of us on 240v (that I’m aware of) as the Lutron switches etc commonly recommended won’t be usable. Your best option is probably going to be Shelly modules (shelly 1 etc or shelly dimmers). These are modules that go behind your light switch and basically just replicate the functionality of the switch. You need a shelly *per switch* (eg if your dumb light switch box has two switches allowing it to control multiple you will need two shelly modules to maintain independent control of those lights. There is a physical limit to how many Shelly’s you can fit in a single switch box, so if you plan to go this route it’s probably a good idea to space out your light switches (eg instead of one 6 switch box install 2x3 switch boxes instead). Generally you can fit 2 modules per switch).\n\nShelly’s are fine and assuming you can fit enough of them they will allow you to automate most lights either simple on/off (Shelly 1 etc) or dim them (Shelly Dimmer) just as if you were using the physical controls. Please be aware that the Shelly dimmer is *not* compatible with a standard dimming switch (eg the knob style). The physical switch is only used for on/off functionality and all dimming needs to be done on the app.\n\nThe biggest issues you may run into:\n\n* Shelly’s are WiFi only and can suffer from congestion, lag etc if you have too many\n* Shelly’s do fail sometimes so it’s a good idea to carry spares\n* It’s challenging to get all the functionality you would expect from a Lutron smart switch (on/off, dimming etc) while using a physical switch so you are likey to end up using the app more than you would like.\n\nAs to smart speakers in each room, I’m quite a fan of installing recessed power outlets in the corner of rooms to keep speakers out of the way. This keeps the cable much tidier and makes it easy to swap speakers in and out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/613lbpq38cza1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5f25c1bbb6dc769f87dc9213b4a0d3200d86c6bd', ""peixinho3: Thank you very much for your help.

I have a neurological disorder and use a stairlift to get up and down the stairs in my house. I’m having a tough time figuring out how to get Alexa to control it. I bought the Bond bridge and was able to link the remote for the lift to it but wasn’t able to figure out how to get it to hold/long press the buttons. I emailed support and they replied with:

“The Bond Bridge does not support commands that would require a long press or a double tap. It can only mimic the commands that only require a single press or tap.
 
We also do not have any information if or when the Bond Bridge would support commands that that would require a long press or a double tap in the future.”

I’m still within the return window for the Bond - is there another bridge that has that option? Is there a workaround you can think of?  Ideally I’d love to be able to tell Alexa to bring the lift up and down the stairs (which takes 53 seconds) when my hands aren’t working well and I can’t hold the button myself. 

Thanks for your time!"	14	"['talljerseyguy: Make and model of the lift?', ""Jools_36: It's definitely a safety thing to have the lift not move without someone holding the button. I don't mean to sound synical but realistically I wouldn't want alexa operating what is essentially heavy machinery without substantial safety measures in place, at least presence detection, and several accessible e-stop buttons. It's definitely doable, but no off the shelf solution would be likely to achieve the functionality you're after, and I probably would want it checked over by a professional otherwise if it injures anyone your house/medical insurance definitely doesn't cover it."", 'Silent-Piccolo: How about 2 switch bots?', 'Affectionate-Pen7062: It’s a Bruno Elan straight indoor & it has a frequency of 318 MHz. \nAny help or ideas would be greatly appreciated!', 'Trevlavo7: For sure.

If my dog brushes the footrest as she rushes past me I’m instantly stopped and have to release and reengage the the trigger on the armrest. There are handheld remotes at the top and bottom of the stairs to allow others to control it if the user is unable. It’s those remotes that I got linked with the Bond.

I assume that the bond or any other bridge still won't control the lift, but in that case, I'd be comfortable to potentially think about wiring one of the buttons on the controller to a smart relay, so it can be triggered that way. If they're normally open switches, then you should be able to wire something like a shelley (as long as the switch is 12v or more) in parallel with it and trigger it remotely using Alexa. I would still maybe have alexa announce thoughout the house that the stair lift is moving just to be sure everyone is looking out for it as another precaution."", 'Affectionate-Pen7062: How can I help?

Originally these were two dumb switches. I first added a switch to my to my south wall (call it south switch from now on) which is the first one shown in the video linked to this post in the two gang box. This worked fine with the dumb switch with no buzzing, but when I would turn off the dumb switch on the other side of the circuit, it would cut power to the south switch. Naturally in my mind I assumed changing the other dumb switch with a smart switch would fix the issue, so I added a second smart switch to the circuit on the north wall (call it the north switch) which is shown as the second switch in the linked video in the three gang box. After adding this north switch, the lights started buzzing while they are on. Also, when I turn the lights off from the south switch, everything functions normally (aside from the buzzing), but when I switch it off from the north switch, the north switch starts power cycling. I tried to capture all of this in the linked video. Both switches are connected to the neutral and travel wires and these two switches are the only ones on the circuit. Also, for reference I am using home assistant with zigbee2mqtt. Any ideas what the problem is and why it is suddenly buzzing? In an ideal world I can keep the south switch and return the north one so I have a one smart and one dumb switch configuration. If that isn’t an option because of the way the circuit is set up, I don’t mind having two smart switches , but I would like to get rid of the buzzing (that again wasn’t present until I added the second switch) and ensure they are connected so if my home assistant instance goes down I am still able to use both of them (I.e. I don’t want to have to use one as a scene switch and have it in smart bulb mode if I don’t have to). Anyway, thanks for any help. I will answer questions as best as I can and I can always link more pics, videos if needed.	7	"['stevekuchta: This is a 3-way setup (AKA “2-way” outside US) right? Meaning that both switches control the same lights? There can be many types of 3-way setups; are you sure that you followed the correct set of instructions? Did you happen to take photos of the wiring before disconnecting from the dumb switches?\n\nIf not, you may just want to start fresh with your connections. Start by taking photos of the connections now and then disconnect both switches completely. Then determine which wires are live with a multimeter or a simple voltage detector. This process will involve switching the breaker off and back on multiple times, so be safe. \n\nOnce you have figured out which wires are live, see if that helps determine what the correct 3-way setup is. If it doesn’t match the ones in the instructions from Inovelli, checkout their website or email them (or post back here). You may even want to reconnect your dumb switches to verify correct functionality. \n\nIt would be best to label wires and take photos (from multiple angles) to help through this process. Taking photos is free, so take more than you think you will need as they may be helpful!\n\nI don’t have blue switches, but do have red and what you are trying to do with one switch should be do-able from my understanding.

The technician also mounted this [Resideo Pro](https://www.resideo.com/us/en/products/security/security-systems/proa7-proseries-7-inch-all-in-one-panel-proa7/) (but ours says Honeywell?) screen on the wall which integrates with the thermostat, door sensors, and door lock (e.g. ""Arm Stay"" and ""Arm Away"" functionality). The last thing Safe Streets showed us was how to control the devices mentioned earlier with an app called M.Connected which just appears to be a white labeled version of [Resideo's ""Total Connect"" app](https://www.resideo.com/us/en/total-connect-app/).

Additionally, included with the home was another box from [SimpliSafe](https://simplisafe.com/) which contained a SimpliSafe [indoor camera](https://simplisafe.com/simplicam-security-camera), [base station](https://simplisafe.com/base-station), two [water hazard sensors](https://simplisafe.com/water-sensor), a smart [smoke detector](https://simplisafe.com/smoke-detector), and two more [door entry sensors](https://simplisafe.com/entry-sensor). When I go try to add devices to the M.Connected app, the only products it seems I can add are August, Resideo, Brilliant, Genie, Overhead Door, Chamberlain Lift Master, or Carrier. When I tap ""Other Devices"" I see a message that says I need to ""contact my dealer"" which is Safe Streets. It's quite frustrating that I can't seem to find an easy way to add new devices and the app itself feels rather limited.

I'm new to building smart homes but have been working in tech for over 10 years and am fairly comfortable with this sort of thing. I also have been spending quite a bit of time over the past two weeks following a few YouTube channels like Home Automation Guy and some of the threads on this sub. I've learned more about the benefit of a flexible connector like Home Assistant and wonder if I'm too boxed in with what came pre-installed with the house...

In the near future, I know I want to get two floodlight cameras, an indoor camera, 4-5 smart dimmable light switches, a few LED light strips, and a couple motion sensors as well. Ideally I want be able to integrate *all* of the existing products I mentioned above into a *single* smart home controller that doesn't tether me to cloud services, subscription plans, or one specific company's products.

Any advice or recommendations? Is this possible, or do I need to replace some of my existing equipment? Has anyone else out there dealt with a similar situation?

But there is one issue, the AC will not retain the selected power consumption level **when there is power cut off and restoration!!!** 

So i have two questions as i am new to smartthings:

1- are the 5 levels of power consumption shown in smartthings app?

2- can i automate the process of retaining the selected power consumption level?

SuperAleste	1	13dyq7a	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/13dyq7a/some_basic_n00b_questions_about_coordinators_and/	"I have two identical Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongles.  The first one I just plugged in and it worked fine as the default coordinator.  After much trouble, I have flashed the second one to a router using firmware **CC1352P2_CC2652P_launchpad_router_20221102.hex**.  It does appear under the device of the coordinator.    
     
My main questions are this:    
    
1. Is it correct to be a device under the main coordinator, or should it be its own 'standalone' integration?    

2. Do I need to manually detect devices from the router via 'add devices via this device' or will they just connect automatically    

3. How do I know it actually working?  Is this just plug and play, or do I need to change some sort or setting?    

4. Why are some devices seeming at the opposite ends of my house connecting to the farther device?  Example back room sensor connecting to far away front room coordinator even though the router is very close to it?    
    

Thanks for any help and tips! This is all pretty overwhelming for a n00b!"	8	"['agent_kater: 1. The router is a normal network node, connected to the coordinator or another router. Any mains powered device is also a router, your router is only special in that it has no *other* function.\n2. ""Add device via device"" is just a technicality. As soon as any device has joined the network (i.e. has gotten the network key) it is free to connect to any router and will also switch between routers at its own discretion.\n3. What software are you using? Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA, deCONZ? There should be a network map where you can see your router as a node. Be aware that it might appear completely unconnected if it hasn\'t routed traffic recently. That\'s alright.\n4. Zigbee routing is complicated. They might prefer a shorter connection (less hops between them) or they might actually get a better signal from to the coordinator. Some devices are very reluctant to switch to a different router, so you should pair them in the same spot where you\'re going to actually use them.', ""SuperAleste: Thank you so much for this info, exactly what I was looking for!      \n      \nI'm not sure how to tell.  I know Zigbee2MQTT won't load on my Pi due to an **Error while starting zigbee-herdsman**that seem really difficult to resolve.    \n    \nI have something called  Mosquitto broker running.  Other than that I'm not sure how to tell if I'm using ZHA.     \n    \nWhat do all these brokers do?  Just make it, so I don't have to use the sensors built in hubs /app?  Are they all basically the same?    \n    \nI do see the map you are talking about that lays out the network connections.  So does that mean I'm using ZHA?     \n    \nAlso, lastly, I bought a ZWave only device by mistake.  Is it possible to use without an actual Zwave hub/antenna via one of these add-ons?    \n    \nAgain, thank you so much for the help!"", ""agent_kater: I'm assuming we're talking about Home Assistant? If you have a Zigbee network map in Home Assistant, you're most likely using ZHA, which is (I should have said that earlier) the Zigbee implementation that comes with Home Assistant. Personally I like Zigbee2MQTT better but ZHA mostly works fine as well.\n\nIf you want to try out Zigbee2MQTT be aware that it will fail to start (with a helpful error message in the log) when ZHA is still active because only one program can use the Zigbee dongle.\n\nMosquitto is an MQTT broker. You use it because it's the standard protocol to connect sensors and other home automation products to Home Assistant. Theoretically the Home Assistant developers could integrate this functionality into Home Assistant but they decided against it for a number of good reasons.\n\nThere is no way to use the ZWave device with a Zigbee dongle, you'll need another USB dongle. (There are devices that can do both but they have drawbacks.)"", ""SuperAleste: Yup, sorry, I am using Home Assistant.    \n    \nHow do I know if I'm using ZHA for sure?  How would I disable ZHA to use Zigbee2MQTT?    \n    \nI'm still a little unclear on the differences between Zigbee2MQTT and Mosquitto broker?  Do I still need Mosquitto if I start using Zigbee2MQTT?     \n     \nGotcha, ok, need ZWave hardware dongle to use ZWave.  I thought there was some way that could be done through an add-on.  Thanks!"", 'agent_kater: > How would I disable ZHA to use Zigbee2MQTT?\n\nYou would go to Settings > Devices and Services > Integrations and delete the one that says ""Zigbee Home Automation"".\n\nThen you would start Zigbee2MQTT and in its configuration interface you would configure credentials for your Mosquitto.\n\nThen you would join Zigbee devices to your new network and they would appear in Home Assistant.\n\n> Do I still need Mosquitto if I start using Zigbee2MQTT?\n\nYes. Mosquitto is how you connect most local devices to Home Assistant. (You connect the devices to Mosquitto, they will then announce themselves to Home Assistant.) Zigbee2MQTT connects to Mosquitto as well and announces all connected Zigbee devices.\n\nHome Assistant is your secretary, Mosquitto is the phone company and Zigbee2MQTT is an interpreter you hired in Zigbee land because your secretary doesn\'t speak Zigbee. (And installing the ZHA integration would be paying for a Zigbee language course for your secretary.)\n\nNote how it\'s call ""Zigbee to MQTT"", it translates Zigbee to MQTT. Mosquitto (MosQiTTo) connects devices that speak MQTT. Home Assistant has the MQTT integration which also speaks MQTT and connects to Mosquitto.\n\nWhen a device connects to Mosquitto *and* the device has support for Home Assistant (Zigbee2MQTT does) it will use a special MQTT message to register itself as a device (or multiple devices) in Home Assistant.', ""SuperAleste: Thank you so much! This info is really helpful!  I think I have a grasp on this now.  I'll try and make the switch from ZHA to Zigbee2MQTT.  I'll be sure to make a backup first!     \n      \nI really appreciate you taking the time to break all this down for me!"", ""agent_kater: > I'll try and make the switch from ZHA to Zigbee2MQTT. I'll be sure to make a backup first!\n\nIf you're happy with ZHA you don't need to. I didn't like that it is poorly documented (How do I restore a coordinator backup?) and the config UI had some issues. Oh and renaming entities is thoroughly broken. The actual usage of the Zigbee devices works completely fine though.\n\nYou probably won't be able to migrate much, you'll have to re-pair all devices and also re-configure them in HA. Automations will continue to work if you assign the same names to your devices (assigning names works flawlessly with Zigbee2MQTT), *unless* you're using those stupid `device` triggers. (Get rid of them and replace them with `event` or `mqtt` triggers.)"", ""SuperAleste: Interesting, ok.  Good to know.  I'll stick to ZHA unless something ends up braking.""]"

The are shutting down in the end of May. I really liked using it because of the simplicity. If there are enough others who would miss it if it was gone, maybe I (we?) could ask them to move it into the open source world and maintain it. But before I ask I just wanted to know how popular this platform was, maybe an estimation how many users were registered. I can barely find information about the platform on other websites to I would guess not that many. Does anyone has more information? Thank you :)	0	[]

I have been in Home Automation for quite a while and noticed there are a ton of apps that does offer an app to control a device, even via internet connection (and not just BT), but do not offer an automation capabilities (ie. you can't really ask siri from homepod to do whatever you want to happen, or add it to IFTTT, or include in Zapier flow etc,).  


I am gathering a list as I'm super curious how many more are out there. My list is below:

* **Vimar Entryphone -** Has an app, has siri, but it requires to open the app to run
* **Jura coffee machine J.O.E app** \- Has an app, has siri, but requires to open the app to run
   * Multiple efforts were done to hack this but it requires hardware modifications AFAIK which voids warranty...
* **Nanit Baby camera app** \- Has an app, has Alexa capabilities which are poor. I tend to forget to turn on breathing monitoring here and i can't automate that

I've got:
Several zigbee sensors, lights and switches... Mostly Aqara
A few z-wave devices
Alarmo set up for an alarm 
WiFi devices through Tuya. 

HA seems unstable for me.. About every 7 of 8 months, my automations simply quit working. My Aqara devices disconnect requiring a week of constant re-pairing. 

I'm considering a move to Smartthings and am interested in hearing the good, bad and ugly from people who have made the switch. ."	10	"[""IDFGMC: I have no real world experience other than Hue, Tuya and Alexa.

I still have ST integrated to HA for a single z-wave device. I have 60+ zigbee devices, which around 50% are Aqara.\n\nI found that pairing devices with HA was much easier than with ST. I found that in HA the devices tend to stay paired and online until the battery goes. I have a couple of problem devices that need a nudge occasionally (just holding the paid button will bring them back online), but that is the same across both ST and HA. From memory I probably needed to remove and re-pair devices in ST more often than with HA for completely dead devices. \n\nIt has been a few years since I moved to HA and I've not had any devices that are not recognized. In ST I had to install custom handlers, sometimes with multiple choices. HA has been more plug & play for me, but I don't know how far ST has improved on device compatibility. \n\nI stated with Conbee/Deconz but didn't much like it - I'm now running a Sonoff Zigbee stick and zigbee2mqtt and it's been the best solution for zigbee for me. Maybe there is a different combination of stick and/or integration that would work better for you? In any case ensure you use a USB extension to be able to place the zigbee stick away from the host.\n\nI run some fairly complex automations. With ST I had to run webcore to do this because the automations weren't capable enough on the native ST platform. For HA I use Node-Red (NR) exclusively for my automations. ST was cloud reliant for webcore so automations were not quite as snappy as NR locally. When I was migrating from ST I know more local control was in the works but I don't know how far that has come. I also have many automations with dependencies on each other that I just couldn't do easily outside of NR. My NR automations reliability is hit and miss, but I put that mostly down to the complexity and load I put on my system. Even in the last 24 hours I've made some wholesale adjustments to how my automations are triggered that seems to have resolved most problems. I believe I've just been overloading the system - but as I said my automations are numerous and complex. With HA there are often different ways to solve a problem, and therefore different ways to find a working solution. With ST I remember being more limited - which meant less could go wrong but also less could be done. \n\nI have a zwave stick installed in my HA but I haven't been motivated to move my single zwave device from ST to HA. If I find that motivation then ST will be removed from my setup. In the meantime, it actually provides an extra level of redundancy for my door lock. If I can't reach my lock via HA I can fall back on ST. It hasn't been required yet but it's there if I do need it."", 'ElectricCharlie: I’ve been using ST for a number of years and I outright hate it.\n\nTechnically, there’s nothing wrong with the system. I don’t generally have a ton of problems with instability or disconnections - most of my devices are Z-Wave, however.\n\nBut my system is highly fragmented. It’s got Hue, KASA, some wifi HomeKit devices, Aqara, etc. Most of that stuff talks to HomeKit, but SmartThings won’t, so I have to use a bridge to expose it to HK.         \nThe plugin I had been using and was working great for a number of years recently lost support because Samsung kept changing the API for ST, making it more onerous to develop for. The replacement plugin I brought in reports no issues, but I have no control or reporting over any of my ST stuff.\n\nIt’s so fragmented because I switched from Android to iOS a few years ago. My girlfriend was on iOS, and I wasn’t enjoying the Android user experience. Samsung is all in on Android, and I don’t like their app experience, even on iOS. It’s a distinctly weird experience for me to navigate. \nI’m also a privacy conscious user, and I don’t like how much data ST harvests from its systems, or tries to harvest from users. It detected one of the wifi devices that’s paired with homekit and keeps asking me to pair that device with ST, instead. It frequently asks for permissions on my phone that aren’t needed, etc.\n\nI imagine a lot of that won’t apply to the normal folks. I’m just… weird.        \nBut I hope it’s useful info to someone.', 'ww_boxer: I dumped ST last summer, before the migration to edge drivers after using it for 5 years.  Good riddance!

We’ve mostly moved to edge drivers with most everything working local. It is a mix of zigbee and zwave. We have a set of Wi-Fi light bulbs because there are no equivalent zigbee or zwave, warm and daylight, Edison bulbs on the market that I have found.\n\nIt requires a little tracking down of the edge drivers for everything we had set up in the past. \n\nWe have Alexa for voice control and use it with ST virtual contact sensors to automate things that ST can’t control directly: ceiling fans, blink cameras, StreamLabs water sensor. It’s like using IFTTT to integrate devices, but as we have Alexa already, we use it. I could probably do the same with Google home, but haven’t looked into it.\n\nI am using mmWave for motion sensors now and find this has improved things greatly. Lights in the common rooms are automated. I’m using smart bulbs as I like circadian lighting and I’m able to use an edge driver that has an option to allow that without having to setup a lot of routines. \n\nBedroom lighting is controlled with smart buttons and Alexa commands. Bulbs are using the edge driver with circadian lighting as well.\n\nWe’re using zigbee contact sensors on the windows and a few doors. We have routines to turn off the AC or heat, when one or more are open, and to turn it back on when they are all closed. ST home monitor is using them for home security as well as the motion sensors when we aren’t home. The contact sensors also have a routine to turn the RGB bulb at the front porch red if any windows or other doors are open when the front door is unlocked and opened. \n\nST is using the Ecobee sensors we have around the house to increase heat and AC at desired temperatures in rooms that are occupied that the Ecobee thermostat doesn’t have programming ability for. We don’t want to trigger the thermostat to come on if someone is just in the room for a minute. \n\nOur smoke detectors are Nest Protects and to get that to work with ST we have a Ecolink sound monitor set up. When an alarm goes off, ST will turn on all the lights, turn off the thermostat, and unlock the front and back doors.\n\nThe backdoor lock when unlocked, and open, will turn on the yard lights, turn them off when closed and locked. August doesn’t have Alexa notifications, so an ST  routine will throw a virtual contact sensor to toggle an Alexa routine to make a voice announcement that the lock has jammed when auto locked. \n\nWe have pretty simple lighting, and the only scene type thing we are doing is to dim and turn off lights when the TV is turned on. We just use an energy monitoring smart plug to determine when the TV and sound system it turned on to activate a ST routine for the lights. We turn the TV on and off with Alexa. \n\nWith ST we can monitor multiple people leaving or coming home, so when the house is empty, the robot vacuums come out to play, the Blink cameras are armed and the StreamLabs water monitor is also armed. ST arms itself and arms Alexa to guard the house. \n\nFor us, automation, not panels, dashboards, or apps, are how we want our smart home to function. We have an Echo Show for the blink cameras and doorbell, so we do have a panel, we just don’t use it to control anything else other than cameras.\n\nWe haven’t come up with anything we want to do that ST hasn’t been able to accomplish with a little help from Alexa, but I’m sure we aren’t doing anything really special. Anything that isn’t local now in our house now, isn’t really time critical, so we can weather an internet or cloud outage. \n\nIt’s stable, pretty easy to set up, and maintain.', 'Silent-Piccolo: You should migrate from home assistant to Hubatat because Hubatat has much more powerful automation software than smart things.']"

Did you know you can run hyperhdr (hyperion) right on the TV?	5h4d0w	11	13ddy0g	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/13ddy0g/have_an_lg_webos_tv_did_you_know_you_can_run/	"If you have an LG WebOS TV, you can run hyperion entirely on your TV hardware with just an ESP32 to control the LEDs. No raspberry pi needed, no HDMI capture device needed, and full support for your gaming pc with gsync and HDR.

For example, this is on my LG G1 (2021):

 - https://imgur.com/0sZ9xsH
 - https://imgur.com/1rwZz50

Unfortunately HDCP is not supported, so this will NOT work with netflix, amazon prime, disney, etc. You can still watch that content, root doesn't affect it, you just won't get lighting. 

It works great with Jellyfin and I would assume Plex too.

**Risks:** You need to root your TV to do this. Yes you could fuck up your TV, but I wouldn't worry about it personally. The webos homebrew channel seems to be fairly well maintained and helps out with recovering itself after webos updates. I've had this setup for over 6 months now and worst case sometimes you have to telnet into the TV and fix a file. If you're uncomfortable with that, you probably shouldn't proceed.
	
**Hardware requirements:**

 - An LG web os TV **that you can root**. See https://github.com/RootMyTV/RootMyTV.github.io#is-my-tv-vulnerable
  - https://gist.github.com/throwaway96/e811b0f7cc2a705a5a476a8dfa45e09f apparently this works on the latest firmware. I recommend going to the discord I linked to below for more info.
 - An ESP32 CH9102X - You want this model for the faster usb serial chip and driver support. Other models may not work or have shitty performance.
 - LEDs. I used the SK6812 RGBWW (60 led per meter) since I had them sitting around.

**TV Setup:**

 1. Go to https://rootmy.tv/ on your TV web browser to root your TV and install the homebrew channel.
 2. Open the homebrew channel on the TV and install HyperHDR and Piccap - https://imgur.com/zQR9Hzi
 3. Launch both apps on your tv, start the service and set it to autoboot
 4. On your PC go to your TV's IP on port 8090 to configure hyperhdr
 5. Open piccap and configure it to feed to 127.0.0.1
	
**ESP Setup:**

 1. Make sure you have the ESP32 CH9102x (aliexpress it). This has a faster serial controller than most esp32's, and the ones you have sitting around probably won't have a driver on the TV. (Mine didn't).
 2. Flash it with https://github.com/awawa-dev/HyperSerialESP32
 3. Hook LED's up to it and plug it into a USB port the back of the TV
 4. Follow the steps on the github page to configure hyperhdr

**Tips:**

 1. Setup hyperserial as multistrand, I'm getting some odd flickering on the last few LEDs in my strip that I think might be due to the high LED count. I didn't see this until after and now wish I'd done it: https://github.com/awawa-dev/HyperSerialESP32#multi-segment-wiring
 1. Your life will be way easier if you attach the LEDs to the TV first, and solder them while they're on the TV. If you pre-solder and try to install after, you're probably going to tear up the traces.
 1. Nothing says power and ground need to be connected at the ends of the strips. I attached them in the middle of each piece - https://imgur.com/ccM7kke
 1. This kept my corner wiring much tidier and easier to tuck away, since this is a more visible spot - https://imgur.com/2BZcQcp
 1. The LED's on the bottom will sag, do not trust the glue on the back. I ended up adding black gaff tape to hold mine into place, but I'd probably recommend just using some small dabs of hot glue every few inches instead.

I have a 2gig hub and Bali motorized shades. I was able to configure the shades via the Bali app and have them working with remotes as well. I was trying to also add the shades to my 2gig hub, but am failing. Has anyone done this or know how to do this?
Thank you"	1	"[""WDBarry: While I don't have experience with Bali directly, Graber is mostly the same. For learning the Graber into a hub, you had to reset everything, learn the shades into the hub, learn the remote into the hub, and then associate the remote to the shade via the hub.""]"

I am moving to my new home this weekend and cant wait to start automating everything, specially lighting. I discovered that my new house does not have a neutral wire, which is a bummer since that limits my options in terms of smart switches and I dont quite like the idea of smart bulbs. Thats when I happened uppon the idea of using smart relays like the Shelly 1L that apparently does not require a neutral wire to function. The problem is that I cant seem to buy them from the Shelly website nor from  Amazon.  


Is anyone familiar with using Shelly 1L in houses without neutral wires and where to buy them?"	9	"['ww_boxer: I think you may be confused with the terminology.   If your home is in the US and connected to the grid, you have a neutral conductor from the distribution transformer to your service panel, and beyond.  A better understanding of residential wiring systems would help you frame your question and/or problem more clearly.    You may have 1 or more wall switches without neutral conductors, but not the whole house.', 'Ninja128: As the previous poster indicated, the individual switch boxes may not have a neutral wire present, but your house most certainly does.\n\nI believe the Shelly 1L was discontinued with most of their Gen1 devices, so sourcing them may be difficult. If you want to stay within the Shelly ecosystem, their Dimmer module should work without a neutral. There are also several other no-neutral switch and relay alternatives, depending on what connectivity you need. That said, it\'s not terribly difficult to pull a neutral wire down to the box, which would allow you to use ""normal"", neutral-required switches/relays, and give you more options.', 'Old-Line2445: Put a Shelly one in the light fitting', 'andrelmartinsf2: Oh yes, I did not express myself correctly. The house has neutral but it is either in the fixtures or in the breaker box but since I dont have them in the lightswitch cavity my understanding is that it would be impossible to install most of the regular smart switches in the market and/or most of the smart relays from shelly.', 'andrelmartinsf2: Thank you for your response. Yes, I am sure the house has but I do not have any neutrals in the switch boxes. Regarding pulling a neutral to the switch boxes I have been told that there is not an easy way to do that without having to tearing into the drywall and I was trying to avoid doing that in the entire house.\n\nNow, regarding other options of no-neutral switches and relays, I am only familiar with the Lutron Caseta line, but it quite expensive. I will look into the Shelly Dimmer, was not aware that you could use it without a neutral.  \n\n\nAgain, thanks for the help!', 'ww_boxer: Understand.   I have seen other posts on the forum regarding this neutral missing issue.  I’m sure there is a solution but I haven’t dealt with it personally.  Maybe if you repost the question with the missing neutral at the switch others will reply.  Hope it works out for you.', 'Ninja128: >Regarding pulling a neutral to the switch boxes I have been told that there is not an easy way to do that without having to tearing into the drywall\n\nDepends on the house. For a single story house with an attic, it\'s incredibly easy. For the lower floors of a multi-story house, it\'s will often require some drywall work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Now, regarding other options of no-neutral switches and relays, I am only familiar with the Lutron Caseta line, but it quite expensive.\n\nThere are several cheaper options. Just search Amazon for ""no neutral smart switch"" (or smart relay) to give you an idea. Off the top of my head, Lutron, GE, Leviton, Aqara, Sonoff, MOES, and Martin Jerry should all have no-netural options.', ""andrelmartinsf2: Thanks! I'll look into it!""]"

Looking for advice on the optimal automated home setup. Here’s what I currently have:

Alarm.com SEM (SuretyHome monitoring my old Vista 20P panel, wired and wireless 345hz Honeywell sensors) which acts as my Z-Wave Hub (limited to approved devices). I have a series of dumb fire detectors linked into the panel through a listener device too.

It monitors a lot of zones (14?) many of which are monitoring windows & doors which may well get switched for new double glazed units in the next year or two.

Through Alarm.com app I have a Schlage Z-Wave lock, Garage Door (MyQ), Sonos System, Z-Wave Thermostats, Rachio Irrigation System and I am slowly getting through the install of various z-wave (Enbrighten) dimmers and switches throughout my house.

Additionally I have Remootio on a gate, a Wi-Fi Schlage Lock as well as Ring Cameras and Ring Doorbell.

Appliances: I have GE appliances, ECOVACS robot vacuum. Google TV’s with Kodi too.

Future plans: I’d like to add some new multiuse z-wave switches to control fans and lights, and potentially have some remotes too.

This is all a bit disjointed right now and I’d like them all harmonised. Ring is great but proprietary. Alarm.com allows for limited Z-wave devices and not sensors. I’m thinking a dedicated z-wave hub should be added, but unsure which one. Home Assistant looks great but I don’t want to spend my spare time coding it all.

Ideally I’d have a single, attractive, user friendly app that contains all this and is expandable as I get more connected technology.

Not many, but some.   My experience with HS3 & HS4 is that my uptime is based on my UPS\' ability to outlast power outages and/or my desire for a new feature.  \n\nHomeseer runs at scales other controllers dislike discussing. It can have multiple zwave controllers, each able to have 232 nodes.  They designed an ethernet-connected-zwave radio (ZNet) so people could have one HS controller manage very large houses or places with outbuildings. \n\nHomeseer got a lot of grief about their early Pi models because they limited the number of plug-ins you could install, but they did that to make sure you could run a full 232 devices on the zwave network.  The limit is gone on HS4 given how powerful the Pi3 and Pi4 are, yet the perceived ""flaw"" lingers. \n\nWith HAss you could add support for dozens of different tech on a single Pi-zero, letting people easily get franken-networks of disparate devices . And it could definitely do it using community-generated code that was all free. But could it handle 30 devices? 50 devices? 100 devices? \n\nI use those numbers intentionally because I had a Vera3 that became unstable at around 30 devices. Lots of people have Hue hubs, which are limited to 50 zigbee bulbs (technically 63 but instability happens above 50), but few hit that limit.  Today I have 90 zwave devices and I know with absolute certainty I could double that or quadruple it with a second zwave radio and HS would still be stable.  \n\nThe truth is that scale and reliability are currently edge cases in the consumer HA space. Price is the primary driver.  Cloud dependent devices with uncertain response times and lifespans are acceptable if they cost under $20. At least until someone buys 30 of them and has their whole house go down when a software update on a cloud server goes bad.\n\nI am willing to pay for stability and reliability.

However what about focussing on someone approaching sliders on my deck?  A video doorbell would be perfect, but I’d need to get power to it (not a fan of replacing batteries everywhere).

I am moving into my new house in Durham, NC and am looking to start my home automation / smart home project. From all I read I sould start optimizing my wifi strenght and distribution throuh the house. The house is about 2400 sq feet with 2 stories. From what I undestand a well placed good router should be enough for the house without necessarily needing mesh wifi or repeaters. Am I correct on this assumption?  


If so, I am looking for router recommendations. Doesnt need to be something state of the art, me and the wife are not gamers but we do stream a lot and both work from home so it has to be reliable and reach the entire house adequately. The house does have a big yard and would be nice to be able to reach at least a part of it but I can do without.   


If I'm not and a mesh system is recommended regardless, can someone suggest a combo of router + mesh system?

Thank you!!"	9	"[""Drew707: I don't want to overcomplicate this, but that really depends on where the router will be located, your floorplan, what types of materials/barriers will be between it and where you are using it, and what the spectrum situation is in your neighborhood.

I have not experienced these issues, but I also have older stuff.  At a minimum, you should use their design tool to map out your house and see where dead spots will be.

I am not sure If either of the led stripes will work, that is why I am writing here.

I am aware that I am missing a power source adapter, which one should it be? Is there a universal for each led stripe or should i look for specific? Recommendation?

How would I make the power reach the every led stripe for each staircase?(I have attached some photos of my stairs). 

Could some leds from Aliexpress or some type of cheaper leds work too?

Am I missing something more? Any advice is welcome. Thanks!

I'd like to make it remotely controllable and integrate it into my z-wave network by replacing the wall switch with a z-wave switch, but for safety reasons I'd like it to have an auto-off timer that I can program into the switch itself in case my Home Assistant raspberry pi bugs out or a network issue prevents the controller from being able to turn off the fireplace. I normally buy GE/Jasco/Enbrighten z-wave switches but I don't see a programmable timer field on these. Is there a different brand that has this?	7	"[""PersistentPizza: I suspect it's not a normal switch (not 120v) and putting in a smart switch won't just work. You probably need a dry contact relay. Zooz makes some Zwave ones. No idea on the auto off functionality of them."", ""Ninja128: If this is a gas fireplace, it's probably using a millivolt switch circuit: There is probably a pilot light that heats a thermocouple or thermopile. When heated, this generates a small amount of voltage (under 1V DC) that is fed to the main gas valve through a wall switch. When you close the switch, it energizes the gas valve, letting gas flow, and 'starting' the fire. When you open the switch, power is cut to the valve, the flow of gas stops, and the fire goes out. As a safety feature, if the pilot light is out, the thermocouple doesn't generate any voltage, so the gas valve won't be able to open, even if you close the switch.\n\nIf that's the case, you can't use a standard switch, and need to use a dry contact relay. Within the Zwave ecosystem, the Zooz ZEN16/17 relay modules would work, and both have an auto off timer setting. You probably won't have mains power in the switch box, so it will most likely be easier to install it in the fireplace access panel space, and leave the existing dumb switch in place.

I also found in the manual that there is a 9-hour safety timer that shuts off the fireplace, so I think the auto-shutoff concern has been addressed. But I'd still like to make this remotely controllable somehow. Given this, does your answer still apply?"", 'Sorry_Sorry_Everyone: It sounds like their concern is if something happens to their home assistant raspberry pi. They want a way for the switch to turn itself off rather than relying on Home Assistant to do it.', ""Ninja128: Yes, same logic still applies.

GhxxxstCat	58	13cmde5	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/13cmde5/need_a_doorbell_cam_that_sees_well_at_night_and/	"I wont bore you with the story, but if anyone is curious it is at the very end of this post! I'd also love advice on it as well if anyone cares- about a vindictive neighbor and their abused and uncontrolled dogs. 

I have a restraining order on a neighbor who keeps coming onto my yard and letting her dogs loose on my lawn but police won't do anything as I have no proof sometimes and i meber catch it on phone video in time/enough.
 I need a ring cam or ANYTHING affordable that mounts and detects at night well too; I was going to get a dashcam but it's too complicated for me figuring out the parking surveillance power source you have to adapt- I'm bad at electronic tech stuff. 
My car and the property line Is at least 50 feet from the house I believe. 
I just need something really affordable to record either all the time or motion sensing that detects at least 50 feet away. 


THE STORY: my direct neighbor has gone through 5 dogs in the last 3 years I've lived here, two were taken away, one ran away, and two just disappeared I'm pretty sure they died. Biggest issue for me was that they would not keep their dogs controlled or train them at all which resulted in one of their dogs biting and attacking me and my dog, resulting in him needing to retire from service work due to trauma. We got a golden retriever a few months after, she is 10 months old and still training and I have epilepsy so this has been extremely hard To do, especially without my first dog being able to work and show my golden retriever how it's done. 

Since the bite from the first dog about a year ago, they have gotten a large pit bull (love the breed, I only specify the breed because the other dog who attacked me and my dog was a BEAGLE. so when I saw a pit bull, I knew it would be untrained. not the dogs fault, but untrained guard and working breeds are so much more dangerous and reactive.) Sure enough, within a week, he had RIPPED his chain out of the ground, gotten into our yard and on our porch, ran half a mile down the road chasing another neughbor and her one legged dog, and this has now continued for a little over 1.5 years, and i have called the police on them over 37 times in the last 14 months alone. I have also used my boyfriends phone to call, so that 37 number is just from my phone records alone. That's at least 37 times their dogs were out and terrorizing people and it her animals, NOT JUST CALMLY WALKING AROUND LIKE A LOST DOG. 

Now, I just got a new car. I'm worried they are messing with it, it's a 2023 equinox, one day I got in and the cars acceleration was kind of off. Just shaky and hesitant sort of, like it wouldnt accelerate clean, it would make a pumping motions slightly like it was trying its hardest. 
This happened with my boyfriends car too, and at this point I'm sure I'm paranoid but I am almost 100% sure that the neighbors are messing with our cars for revenge. Boyfriends car needed 3k in repairs after something happened to the timing chains and brakes, out of nowhere. So yeah. I need the camera because dash cams won't actually show the car that well too I see, and unless it's something smashing the car they say things don't get picked up. 

No, the police won't do anything. And we only have ONE animal control officer who works 4 days a week in the town of Midland, Michigan. 

It would also be cool if anyone who reads this could go on the midland michigan police dpartment google page and keave reviews asking them to do their jobs and keep us safe. They don't even show up to most of the calls- do you want to know how many the police showed up to out of the 37 calls I have documented? 

Twice. Two times. The police responded TWO. TIMES. ONLY.

Battery powdered cameras are short range (often cap at 30’). They use different hardware that won’t drain batteries as quickly. Many of the common DIY cameras require a subscription. IMO, they’re not any easier to use either, most of what makes traditional CCTV style cameras harder to install is pulling wire, not the technical end of pairing, setting up wifi, etc. Tech wise, depending on the setup, my guess would be that the cheaper battery operated wifi cameras like ring, Wyze, etc are just as hard to use as the cctv types, just with slightly different lingo \n\nI have a Reolink nvr and security cameras and like them a lot better than my ring doorbell, which is nothing but problems. I actually have so many issues with connecting to the ring and the battery constantly dying that I’m considering replacing it with the Reolink doorbell camera, or even just a dumb doorbell and getting a Reolink for the front yard. In ring’s defence, I have an older doorbell camera that isn’t rated fit Canadian winters, and it’s hardwired on a vintage 12V mechanical chime box (neither is ideal). But I also couldn’t live-view all last week because of connectivity issues, despite having a great connection (RSSI of -49, it’s less than 10’ from a mesh router), it’s been 10-20C pretty much all week (around 50-70F), and the battery is at 55%. These cameras are really designed to be a glorified intercom, not a security camera. \n\nAlso worth noting: the ring is a lot more expensive than a decent Reolink security camera. The Ring Doorbell 4 is $200 CAD on Amazon, while the Reolink RCL-510 is only $80 CAD. The nvr added quite a bit more (2tb, 8 channels, $288 CAD on their site), but since it’s all locally hosted there’s no subscription fee. The ring doesn’t save any video unless you pay money and has no options at all for local hosting, meaning it’s completely useless as a security camera unless you pay that fee. Even then, the ring only saves the video for a month, while my nvr saves it for about 2-3 months (depending on the number of cameras, settings and size of hard-drive). The Ring is NOT the economic option here. \n\nThe other thing about a lot of cameras like Reolink is that many have the option to put a memory stick in the camera itself. That way you don’t need a subscription or a nvr. But they don’t hold a lot of video, so you’ll need to check it often and be very proactive about downloading important videos \n\nOh, and another problem with IP cameras: delay!! Any battery operated camera will go into sleep mode. It picks up movement, wakes up, connects, then records. That all takes a few seconds. My Ring usually misses the mailman because it takes too long to wake up from sleep mode. It barely picks up the Amazon delivery guy, and he’s walking straight up at it! The delay is significant and worth considering \n\nThe security system cameras are absolutely the way to go. You’ll get better image quality and better features for motion sensitivity as well. Lots of options for 24/7 recording. If you go with POE there’s no pairing or anything either (though you do need to run CAT 5/6 to get power to the camera). NVR systems are just more money upfront. Idk if the cheaper Reolinks will meet your needs, you might need a higher end camera (uniquiti maybe?). Ours don’t see clearly that far (our fence is 50’ from the house), though it’s a cheaper 410 from a few years ago. But I guarantee Ring, Wyze, etc., won’t even be close to good enough, and they won’t be all that cheap either. \n\nThere’s a few YouTube channels with some good information on these types of camera. The Hook Up has information and some side by side reviews comparing a wide range of products. His videos are great, he goes through all the pros and cons, the terminology, various options like Blue Iris (a free alternative to a traditional NVR, you’d install it on an old pc). Life Hackster also reviews a ton of security cameras. Both cover IP cameras as well (Ring is an IP camera) \n\nFor the neighbor problems: \n\nI don’t have much advice beyond keep reporting and keep saving those report numbers. We have a neighbor with a kid with a severe behavioural problem that’s being poorly managed. The “kid” is 20, non verbal, and has put his mom in the hospital twice while having an emotional fit/breakdown, but she insists that he’s “independent” and there’s no reason he can’t wander the neighborhood unsupervised and be left alone for extended periods (also unsupervised). We drew a line at him uprooting saplings and throwing them over the fence. All we can do is keep making reports. If we get enough, we can file them with child protective services. I’m just hoping my 8 yo doesn’t get hurt in the crossfire 🤞\n\nSorry people suck.

That\'s actually a fairly tall order, and I\'m gonna go out on a limb here and say none of these cheap options are gonna cut that.\n\n1. Night vision performance\'s BIGGEST issue is sensor size. Bigger sensor = captures more light = better image. You want a minimum of 1.2 for color night vision or 1.8 for IR, which you\'ll find virtually none of these cheap options will hit.\n2. Light - IR cameras will have an IR spotlight on them, but the distance those are effective isn\'t great. You can get a secondary IR spotlight and tie into decent cameras to turn on on motion with an IR camera, but ya wanna make sure your target area is well covered by that light. This is environmental so its hard to make a recommendation until you get a decent camera up and try it out...\n3. Distance is gonna be tricky at 50ft. You kind of have to choose between (a) distance (tight focus on a smaller area), (b) width (wide image, but less pixels/ft means much harder to identify at distance, ESPCIALLY to legal standards), or (c) price (a PTZ autozoom camera can give you a bit of both... but they are pricey).\n4. Resolution - 4k / 8MP sounds nice, but at distance it might actually not be as good as a decent 4MP / 1080P. More pixels = less light per pixel, which again, is gonna make images darker and harder to identify which is the whole point here.', ""what-the-puck: > With a fixed lens guessing maybe $100-200? PTZ/zoom could be as much as $1000-$2000.\n\nFixed lens at $100-200 is reasonable for a brand name Chinese manufacturer definitely.  Zoom (Varifocal) can be had under $200 as well, except maybe 4K variants that might push it over.  But 4K isn't ideal for night vision anyway."", ""crazytinker: This is the solution you are looking for OP, maybe $40 max gets you a large enough SD card to record for two weeks straight plus the capability of zooming in enough to catch your neighbor.

I'd like have some recommendations for Android app that would allow the members of my family to control our custom automation server (that I wrote) using a nice graphical interface (e.g. few buttons and simple widgets). What exactly am I looking for requires quite a bit of explanation first, so here goes my story:  


I am quite old. I began programming in early 1980s. I still program as a hobby I've tried dozens of programming languages and I hate most of the mainstream ones (e.g. Java, Javascript, C, Python). I like learning esoteric languages, I've used Lua and Erlang for many years and now I am enjoying programming in Janet language (a mutant child of Lua and LISP). I usually find that it's easier for me to program most stuff from scratch using scripts and simplest existing and well documented ""building blocks"" (e.g. cURL, MQTT client) than having to learn how to use another complex software library or application. It could be said that I am quite weird and stubborn in some ways. :) E.g. I wrote my own JSON parsing library in two days instead of trying to figure out how to make existing JSON libraries do exactly what I want.  


When buying our new house and remodeling it, I went wild and wanted to make my home automation dreams become reality. I now have over 20 Shelly smart devices (all using MQTT) and around 10 Zigbee devices (connected to Zigbee2MQTT) throughout our house. There is a dedicated Linux computer in the garage that handles our home automation (and media storage). We have a secured Wifi mesh dedicated solely to the home automation. There are loudspeakers throughout the house connected to the garage computer. On our lobby wall, there is a Launchpad mini MIDI controller (connected to the garage server using an USB cable) that controls the basic aspects of our smart home (e.g. alarm modes, window shutters etc). I found this to be easier to implement than using touchscreen display and I enjoyed coming up with user interfaceworking on 9x9 pixels ""display"" of Launchpad. :)  


All of this is controlled using Janet script ""servlets"" that I wrote completely from scratch that run on the Linux server on the garage. These scripts invoke existing Linux commands (e.g. ""aplay"" for sound, ""mosquitto\_sub"" for receiving MQTT, ""mosquitto\_pub"" for sending MQTT, ""amidi"" for interfacing with Launchpad). Everything works perfectly and does exactly what I want. For example, if I don't close the garage door for 10 minutes, the audio informs me that ""you forgot to close the garage door"" and closes them after another 60 seconds if I don't override it. The garage interior light is motion activated and automatically switches itself off after 5 minutes unless I use long-press on the switch. If something important happens at home, our whole family is informed about it using the Discord chat bot (which is simply a cURL script). The system detects whether we are at home by looking whether our mobile phones are connected to our home WiFi. Etc, etc...  


I enjoyed all of this tremendously and I can control all of this using SSH and Janet scripts.  


However, I would like to have a more user friendly control app on our phones (all of us use Android), mainly for other members of my family. For example, in this app, I would just like to push a button which would open garage door as I am approaching my house in our car. Or, I would like to see the status of all motion sensors in real time. Or enabling / disabling the home alarm and seeing its status.  


I have absolutely no problem with programming the backend for this myself. I own a publicly accessible internet domain and there is already a secure tunnel running from my public webserver to my home automation garage server.  


But I am no graphic designer, no web designer and no UI designer. I'd like to have some (rather dumb) Android app that I would configure with some input / output widgets and these would communicate with the triggers in my home system. This should be on MQTT basis or HTTP basis, it does not really matter.  


I thought about writing my own webapp and then simply opening the address ""[www.mypublicdomain.com/homeserver](http://www.mypublicdomain.com/homeserver)"" in my Android browser when neccessary but this seems like rather monumental task for me, as I haven't done any HTML design or dynamic webpages in the last 15 years and I am not quite ready to learn all the progress that happened in this field in the last 15 years just because of this relatively simple task.  


I also thought about using Home Assistant (or some similar mobile app) and create widgets in it that would work with custom signals sent from my garage server (not communicating directly with my home devices at all) but again, I am not sure if it's worth my time to learn how to install and configure Home Assistant if I only want to use a very small subset of its capabilities (I have never used Home Assistant or other similar system). Also, I am definitely unable / unwilling to develop and compile my own Android app - I have zero experience with that.  


Of course there are various security concerns tied to using such an app but there are ways to solve those. First, I'd just like to have some general suggestions whether such apps even exist...  


Thank you for your time!"	17	"['devodl: My approach would be:\n\n1. Install Home Assistant on Raspberry Pi (Home Assistant OS)\n2.

From there it's 'just' a matter of creating dashboards and adding cards for your device entities.

I curse JavaScript pretty much every time I have to deal with it but it is what it is. I use Kotlin transpiled to js because I hate it so much. The ecosystem will drive the sanest person mad though. There's other languages that can transpile to js like scala. You might find one more to your liking.\n\nIf you are willing to make your own bespoke automation server, you might as well build your own interface. I'm sure you can find at least some web framework in a language you enjoy. It can be as simple as having a hyperlink trigger mqtt. Mqtt.js is easy to use and you could rig something up pretty fast that was quick and dirty.\n\nIf your needs are that simple, you could probably build an Android app pretty fast. It's not hard for an experienced programmer. Kotlin is a much more fun language than Java especially if you are into functional and declarative programming (reading into your lisp experience). I personally would err towards the web as it's inherently cross platform. No issues if someone wants to switch to iOS or what have you.\n\nThis is a problem I want to solve one day. Home automation by API rather than a full stack application. Yaml is a terrible way to express logic. Make it easy to programmatically fit the pieces together. \n\nLet's get back to your actual question though. If I were under your constraints I might look into whether termux could be used for this. Termux can run bash scripts. It's a full Linux environment, you might even be able to get your lisp variants working in there.

Don't start with a solution and look for a problem but find a problem and see if an automated solution would help.\n\nMy first dip into smart home stuff was the desire to have dimmable bulbs, but I was in an apartment and didn't want to mess with switches.  Ended up getting some Hues.  My first automation was a simulated sunrise on my nightstand Hues.  It essentially replaced my alarm clock.\n\nSecond issue was the stupid thermostat.  I was living in the mountains and transitional weather was really annoying.  The thermostat that came with the place could only be on heat or cool and had to be manually switched between each mode.  But we would often have 80F days that suddenly turned into freak snowstorms or similar.  So, I got an EcoBee.\n\nThird was needing an easy way for house sitters to watch our cats while only having two physical keys.

I ended up settling on HA.  This allowed for some more complex automations that spanned ecosystems like, send the Roomba over to the Litter Robot after a cycle to collect any litter that the cats tracked out.\n\nLast year we bought a house and got solar installed, so, need to redo a lot of the HA stuff, but I am already planning out automations surrounding HVAC and solar production since we didn't get batteries.

I want to integrate a remote sensor (aka. one that's entirely in another network/WiFi) into Home Assistant so I'm able to control a relay and read solar data from it.

&#x200B;

I've searched around a bit and the only real solution for this would be MQTT, I've tried using HiveMQ with a Mosquitto Bridge but for whatever reason Mosquitto has a bug that's been unfixed for many months if not years by now where the bridge either randomly dis- and never reconnects and/or restarting Mosquitto results in the bridge never connecting yet also never retrying the connection. I also thought about opening my MQTT server to the internet, but I really want to avoid this option to not have a potential security risk that exposes my whole Smart Home...

After many many MANY countless hours of debugging, testing, trying things and frustration I simply want to drop MQTT as an option and try other possible things, but searching around is kind of fruitless so far...

My setup in this remote location is a router with 2 ESPs that aren't connected via VPN, they're entirely external and would have to connect to some kind of cloud or self-hosted project. VPN ""could"" be an option, but I couldn't properly figure out how to set up a secure L2TP without also potentially sending broadcast data over that connection so I dropped that idea again.  
I'm not entirely sure what to use, as example ESPHome has no API support for any kind of external connection either. I thought about Home Assistant Websockets, but packing and reading data manually is a bit above my understanding.

&#x200B;

Are there any other projects you guys could suggest which would work here? Self-Hosting something wouldn't be an issue, except MQTT due to the Mosquitto bridge function being seemingly broken. Thanks a ton already for your help! :)"	1	['peterxian: If I were setting up a remote mqtt client, I would look into using [client certificate authentication](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/creating-and-using-client-certificates-with-mqtt-and-mosquitto/) to allow incoming connections without a vpn — it’s very secure and supported by most clients and Mosquitto.']

I'm building my house from scratch, i.e. it is a new construction and I wanted to start thinking about ""Home Automation"" and I wanted to start with the lights and I thought I would use Shelly, because they are affordable, work well, have a lot of documentation and I have available in my country.

I wanted my lights to be all smart and controlled by a Home Assistant (Alexa, Google, etc.), I am new in this area and I have been reading about the topic but I am confused about one thing, I know there is Shelly Pro and Shelly Dimmers.

Shelly Pro can be put on the electrical panel and so it is used in new construction but that way I can control the lights separated by locations, for example turn off only the bedroom lights, turn off only the office lights, etc. Or for that I need a Shelly Dimmer on each switch (room, office, kitchen, ect.)?

This is what is making me quite confused...."	2	"[""Ninja128: Do you want on/off control of an entire branch circuit? Get a Shelly Pro.\n\nDo you want more granular control of a single lighting circuit, but still only on/off control? Get a standard Shelly.\n\nDo you want more granular control of a single lighting circuit, but with dimmer control? Get a Shelly Dimmer.\n\nThe Shelly Pro units are quite a bit more expensive than standard Shellys, but offer a few benefits (and limitations). They're a great option if you want hardwired Ethernet connections (vs WiFi), and all your IOT control devices in a centralized location, but do require separate runs for each circuit back to the electrical panel.\n\nFor example, look at a typical kitchen lighting setup: You'll probably have main overhead lighting, under-cabinet lighting, and some accent/area lighting. Usually, this is all run on a single circuit back to your panel, and will use individual switches to control each lighting circuit: one for overhead lighting, one for under-cabinet lighting, and possibly a few more for accent/spot lighting (dedicated light over the sink for instance.) In this scenario, a single Shelly Pro would only allow you to control ALL of the kitchen lighting together, and wouldn't give you granular control of each light group separately. You would either need to install standard Shellys behind each light switch, or have separate runs for each light circuit back to the panel for control through a Shelly Pro."", ""peixinho3: Thanks a lot for this excelent explanation!

What I have are 3 light fixtures, 2 inside 1 outside, that are controlled by the same light switch.  I would like to be able to turn on the 2 inside fixtures independently from the 1 outside.  I'm looking to repurpose the outside for a security camera so that one needs to have power going constantly (always on) while inside would need to have an on/off switch.  Unfortunately all lights share the same switch / line and there is no way to run new line at this point.  

Are there any light switches that come with light bulb adapters that I can use to independently turn on the inside lights while leaving the outside fixture on continuously?

To make things just a little more complicated these 3 lights are set up with a 2-way switch so there are two switches.

I am struggling with an issue I can just not solve. I used to have a Fibaro double switch 2 in my garden that was routed via a roller shutter node. It used to work flawlessly but then stopped for some reason I don’t know. I wanted to replace it with another one but did not manage to include it. No matter what I tried. Even tested 2 other switches. With no luck. I then tried to include the switches right next (in the same room) to the controller (Z-Wave.Me USB Stick) using the ZWave2MQTT application. Worked like a charm. I included all 3 to have them ready whenever I need them. The next day I installed the switch in the garden again but it appears dead on ZWave2MQTT. Tried another of the ones I included before. Same result…

I have no idea how to make the switches connect to the closest node. Before the first switch stopped working, it has been 100% reliable and nothing else changed.

Also tried healing the network, re-interviewing the nodes…

Both switches (one being a backup in case there really is a hardware defect) are powered and are just waiting for the controller to say “Hi”… I even have the Fibaro switches in the open right now to make sure that it is not a distance-related issue.

Any ideas?

At our house, we plan, in the distant future, to install under cabinet lighting. I think I’ve gotten down which lights we can use, but what about dimmer switches? From what I can see on Amazon, there’s only single gang dimmer switches and two gang dimmer switches. There’s no two gang switches where one gang is non-dimmable and the other gang is dimmable, this is important as drywall work is not our forte. The other option is to get a combination smart dimmer switch and dumb electrical outlet since one of the gangs in the box is taken up by a duplex electrical outlet, but Amazon doesn’t seem to sell these either, not even just a regular smart switch with a dumb outlet. Are there any options for either of these things? The two gang dimmer switch would be fine, the problem is that we have a fluorescent light fixture that we retrofitted LEDs into using those drop in replacement LED bulbs. Since our house is pretty old, getting behind there to yank out the ballast and properly retrofit LEDs is not recommended due to exposure to asbestos. Therefore, trying to dim that fixture would probably result in flickering and buzzing if the switch even survived. I am pretty sure that the fixture does use an electronic ballast because there’s no buzzing coming from it. I’m not sure if this would help or hurt the ability for the fixture to be dimmed. Also, while I’m here, I’ve got a secondary question: are there any three SpeedSmart ceiling fan controls other than the general electric offering? We’ve got a ring alarm which does use Z wave, but that General Electric ceiling fan control does not appear to be on the list of supportive devices. One: does anyone have any experience using this ceiling fan control with a ring alarm base station and being able to control all of the speeds using the Amazon Alexa voice assistant? Two: are there any Wi-Fi options? Three: we’ve got a Philips hue hub, would there be any options that connect to this?	20	"[""flaquito_: Are you in the US?

I'm making a heat recovery unit but I want to make the controls for it more or less automated, log the data and have the interface on an LCD display or tablet. I was thinking of using an Arduino or Raspberry Pi or the tablet itself as the brains. I also want 4 temp and relative humidity sensors in the HRU to be able to calculate the efficiency of the heat exchange. I have not made the unit yet and it is for a property that's still has tenants in it so not in much of a rush to get this done.

I was thinking of using I2C sensors as can be quite cheap however the max cable length is approx. 2M then I've also been thinking of using POE I2C or just normal POE sensors, devices and having it all networked. But I want the project somewhat low cost though that conflicts with adding more features.

So I would love for someone to tell me their experience or advice they can give.

# Constraints

* 4 Temp sensors in HRU (calculate the efficiency of the heat exchange)
* 2 Bypass Dampers in HRU (for free cooling night or day)
* 2 Speed Controllers for Fans in HRU (extract and intake boost 230V 50Hz)
* Interface on a touchscreen LCD/ Tablet

# Optional Extras

* Temp, RH, VOC, PM2.5, CO2, pressure sensors in rooms
* Manual Boost button for bathrooms
* Damper in each room for per room air control
* Presence detection for lighting

&#x200B;

I would like to renovate and add some smart pieces into the apartment, most notably:

&#x200B;

* Motion Sensors
* Temperature / Humidity Sensors
* Lighting System
* Power Switches
* ""In Bed Tracking"" (I know this can be done with a Withings Sleep tracker with some modifications)
* Electric Reader Monitoring (not necessarily on/off operations, just monitoring)
* Potentially other things/ideas 
* Curtains & Blinds

&#x200B;

In the past, the most I have ever done is Philips Hue Lights in older apartments. So, generally new to home automation when it comes to multitudes of devices, vs just lights.

I have already configured HomeAssistant (at least the basic aspects of it), and have a Zigbee controller, but not sure where else to expand on the items above. I have been trying to find items that fit into Swedish Style / Design ideas, so that when I do sell the apartment, it is easier to sell in the future.

While I know this might limit my choices, because I have a completely flat network (and can't run VLANs at the moment, or potentially every), I would prefer to not have chinese based devices, but, I can be pursuaded if they don't do any form of calling home (not overly paranoid of chinese stuff, but, the idea of having anything ""call home"" that isn't from more reputable or widely known industries (EG: Philips Hue) freaks me out a bit, so would rather have suggestions on what to get rather than guessing randomly and buying stuff.

I tried looking at Somfy for blinds, but, every installer I have reached out to in Sweden has stated they don't do residential installations. 

&#x200B;

Are there any suggestions for sensors or other pieces that I can accomplish this with?

As a secondary piece, for anyone in the north, how could one setup automated blinds operations to account for the varying hours of dawn and dusk when it comes to Sweden (Eg: 22 hours of sunlight in the summer)? I can't seem to figure out the best way to achieve this.

Would really appreciate any suggestions or assistance."	3	"[""catman5: The chinese stuff is fine as long as you're using it over zigbee and not wifi/their own hubs.

Do let me know if you find something interesting.\n\nRegarding motion sensors, you can get a hue one that will have temperature, motion and light sensors.

1683450705.0	07-May-2023 02:11:45	Is there a 3-way smart switch that will work for old motorized blinds?	Pilot_51	2	13aicxc	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/13aicxc/is_there_a_3way_smart_switch_that_will_work_for/	"I currently have a pair of old motorized blinds controlled by a 2-way switch for power and two 3-way switches for direction in a 3 gang. Each motor uses two ungrounded plugs (NEMA 1-15P) in grounded sockets (NEMA 5-15R). The motors are Somfy 502 B (120V 1.1A) and Somfy 522 E (120V 1.3A).

I would like to make them smart without spending a lot of time or money or making irreversible changes, which ideally means any changes are in the current switch box or outlets. If the replacement switches are on-off-on, I can eliminate the power switch and maybe use that space for a controller if needed. Speed control would be a nice bonus because the motors are pretty loud.

I would prefer Zigbee since that's what most of my devices use, though I could go with Z-Wave or Matter. I'm generally avoiding Wi-Fi because it's hard to be sure if they're 100% local and it just isn't a very good protocol for smart home devices, which I learned the hard way when I bought (and returned) rebranded Tuya bulbs as I was just starting out with Home Assistant last year.

I was looking at [this Enbrighten switch](https://amazon.com/dp/B08Q4F43HT) and the upcoming [Inovelli Smart Fan Switch](https://inovelli.com/products/blue-series-fan-switch-zigbee-3-0), but it looks like they aren't true 3-way and only behave like 3-way with add-on smart switches.

Any ideas or product suggestions?

Edit (x2): Added specific motor details in first paragraph. Here are some simplified schematics of the current design, ideal design, and a couple options using relays depending on availability of a smart SPDT relay that meets my size requirements. I know this isn't perfect, I'm not an electrical engineer, but it gets the idea across. For those curious, I used [DigiKey's online editor](https://www.digikey.com/schemeit/project/).

Since it\'s a safety stop, I wouldn\'t trust the ""stop if power exceeds this value"" to be implemented anywhere off of the relay device itself, not even in a fully local home assistant instance.

Either I use a regular switch and deal with it not matching the state of the relays when remotely controlled, or I use a smart switch which would depend on a hub to work properly (unless a true 3-way smart switch exists, defeating the purpose of the relay). I want the solution to allow normal operation without external dependencies so it can still be physically controlled if my HA server went down or I moved out.\n\nThat said, it appears the best solution so far would be the ZEN52 with a standard momentary SPDT center-off switch.
