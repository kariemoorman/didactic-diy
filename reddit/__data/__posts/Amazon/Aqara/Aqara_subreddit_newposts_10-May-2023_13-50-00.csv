My best effort at observing and understanding it is that it’s really got to be a server congestion issue. Sometimes it’s great. Most of the time I have to keep going back and forth between app screens or restart the App. I have also seen it “replay” a solid 30 min of movement (looks spastic on the screen) as it seemingly “catches up” with a stream of data. Hopefully they will add more capacity. \n\nRegardless of app issues, the actual sensor always reports real data locally to other services (like HomeKit or in my case Home Assistant). That’s why I’m confident it’s a sever issue not a device issue.', 'spamoom: I have the same problem. I’ve painfully set my 3 sensors up by moving and restarting the entire app each time as my position is static', 'windark776: the live data from FP2 only work when you open the FP2 page in aqara home.\n\nEach time you enter FP2 page,  app will send the livedata request to the sensor, then sensor statrt to report the live data.\n\nsometimes the request is lost, so the icon can not be shown. just leave the page and enter it, the request will be sent again to the sensor.', 'BreezyChill: I use the app on android and iOS. On iOS this happens frequently. I think it’s just an app bug.', 'ProfessionalGold2641: Same here.. \n\nTo me it seems to be related to the latest firmware update..

It's recommended to do that as it improves accuracy greatly.\n\nTo your specific concern, I find sometimes the app will reflect movement in real time, sometimes it doesn't.

At that point I don’t think the Aqara app would work but other connected systems will get data - locally.\n\nAfter you create zones, they each become individual sensors in HomeKit. Quite clever. You can then see their status change in real-time without delay or drop-outs of “signal”. Meanwhile the Aqara app might show no movement. That’s been my experience. \n\nIt’s rock solid as a Home Assistant set of sensors. I love it. Best solution for my living room where we can sit surprisingly still (and have older motion sensors lose us and shut off lights). With this new setup… the lights stay on. And they come on quicker too. \n\nBut it also now controls many more lights (hallway, kitchen, stairs, office) which are all connected by hallways. The hallway zones trigger lights in adjoining rooms, meaning rooms are now lit BEFORE entering instead of being halfway in. It’s nice. 7 sensors in one for me (so far). I also have seating areas set to turn on reading lamps for individual seats. Literally works with one seat on the couch and not the other. Oh… and had 13 family members in this weekend. Tracked all 13 individually. Wild. \n\nGotta figure Aqara simply has more work to do on their app and server… and definitely better English instructions. Hope this helps.', 'Rangandi: But it cant be reliant on a server if its homekit compatible? Or is the zones functionality extra?', 'vctgomes: Yeah. It’s local, but the set up needs cloud', 'vctgomes: FP2 is faster than that, but it needs set up, which needs cloud', 'Oo0o8o0oO: I assumed that to be the case too but I’ll be honest I’m not an expert in this stuff.', 'Mysterious-Bowler15: Not at all just use the app local']"

I have encountered a strange glitch. I have an Aqara H1 EU, double rocker, with neutral wall switch. Because of the neutral, it works as zigbee router. So, when my Sonoff SNZB-01 battery powered zigbee button connects to it instead of the concentrator (for example because I power down the concentrator), every push on the Sonoff button toggles the left relay of the Aqara wall switch. Allways the left, and directly the relay, even if I put it in decoupled mode, the relay toggles, and the led stays the same.

Is this a known problem? Do we have some workaround of this?

did anyone get the FP2 to work reliably when there are multiple persons in the room? And can you share any tips?

For me it’s working fine without issues when I’m alone however when we are multiple persons in the room it sometimes “forgets” a person.
It then turns off the lights for a zone even though someone is still sitting at the table or lying on the sofa for example.
I can verify by presence status and on the map that the person is not shown anymore.

When I’m doing the same things while alone in the room this didn’t happen so far so I suppose it’s related to multiple persons being in the room.

For now I changed the mode to simply presence detection without zones as I feel the zone feature is not ready for usage yet but maybe there’s something wrong with my installation?

When I manually reset the presence status, it works correctly in detecting motion. For instance, using left/right monitoring mode, if I wave my hand in front of the sensor, it detects `presence_event=left_enter` and `presence=true`, and then moves to `presence_event=approach`. At that point, the sensor seems to stop. No amount of motion impacts the sensor status until I reset it manually again.

I've tried:

* Updating the firmware for my Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 Plus and repairing
* Removing and re-pairing the device to Z2M
* Hard resetting (holding for 10 seconds) and then repairing.

Is the device just... defective? This seems to happen to a fair amount of people based on my searches, but most of the times it seems to be a problem that ultimately comes down to ""repairing fixes it"".

Android OS

Using main aqara app

Hub 2m from doorbell, “very good” signal strength 

Close to Wi-Fi router, strong connection 

Sensitivity settings set to high 

Latest 3.2.0 android app

Up to date firmware 

----------------------------

Doorbell works fine, chime works, triggers all Alexa and google speakers, really cool. 

First day or so it was great but then:

1) lots of events (people coming right up to camera etc) just not recording on app

2) notifications on phone hit and miss

So I got top bran sandisk sad card 512gb but 

3) the timeline in the app is a mess. It comes up with event colour lines but when you try to scroll back it goes nuts for ages then says network connection failure. 

It’s just a horrible buggy mess but when it works everything about it is great - nice quality, quick response on chime and notifications etc.  really want to keep it but it’s just a mess. I’m guessing issues are with the server. 

Can anyone advise please?  Have read a bunch of threads and made changes accordingly but perhaps I’m missing something.  I even thought it could be because wife uses same login on her app so she got her own aqara login and I invited her to my home but stil no improvement.

We rent and are trying to do an install without a lot of hole drilling. I know the G4 has a sticky back and we’re installing on a finished wooden door.
  
I’ve not used a sticky back for installing this type of device before and I have no frame of reference for 1) how well it sticks and 2) how well it will remove when we eventually move. The other option is to use two small screws and try to fill with wood filler when we leave.
  
Has anyone used the sticky back option? Is it secure? Would it likely remove OK if we use something like a hairdryer to help heat it when we need to leave someday? Any opinions on sticky back vs screws?

With an FP2 that means that information about when someone is present in your home and when your house is unoccupied can potentially be exposed. I figured that this information alone is not very useful unless it can be combined with your exact address. 

So, imagine my surprise when attempting to setup the FP2 in the Aqara app that it insists that I grant it access to my location and refuses to allow me to setup the device unless I give them my exact real world location. 

Not sure I'm comfortable with that.

Any thoughts?"	16	"['Witty_Music_9101: Are you using Android or iOS?', 'Dashbastrd: Return it then? 🤷🏼\u200d♂️', 'theloneranger08: Have you tried blocking the outgoing traffic from the sensor in your router?', 'wks-rddt: The FP2 device itself does not need location to setup but the application on Android does - this is because of the feature on the Aqara app to detect for home/away status of the user (for automation triggers) that makes use of the navigation/location API. \n\nI believe you can just allow and then configure it in settings for location accuracy and/or disable it entirely ... especially if you are not using the automation trigger function in the Aqara app.', ""theloneranger08: No offense but that doesn't matter.

I just bought a G2 camera, which I’m very happy with, but having a bit of trouble with the recording settings. 

I have a Homekit environment and the camera connected without issue in my Apple apps.

I set the camera up to only Stream when we are Home and then switch to Away / Stream + Record when we are out.

I also created an Automation to switch to ‘Away’ mode when / if the camera detected movement between 0000 and 0700, just in case Raffles the Gentleman Thief decided to pay an impromptu visit.

The Homekit settings say that in Stream mode, the camera will still respond to Automations. So my reading of that is should Raffles appear, the camera ought to start recording regardless of the fact we are also in the building. IOW, the Automation overrides the Stream-If-Home setting.

But right now, I can only get it to record when Home is also set to Stream + Record and while not a showstoppper, we don’t really want it recording *** our *** every move as well.

Is this just the way it is or am I missing something obvious? If I used the Aqara app as the console, would I have more options?

Thanks!"	0	[]

I’d like a homekit alert, pref via iMessage, when the dishwasher finishes its cycle. 

I think there are a few potential digital tells.

1. Power is used, then stops
2. Vibration starts, then stops
3. Temp inside machine increases, then cools
4. Inside is wet, then dry

I think the vibration is the simplest to detect via a vibration sensor on the outside of the machine, but I’m concerned that there won’t be much vibration (its a quiet dishwasher)

What do you think? How would you solve this challenge?"	11	"[""ElGuano: I tried using an Aqara vib sensor for an AC unit. Didn't really work.

I had tried a vibration sensor on my washer and dryer but it didn’t work well. So now I use the button. When I start a load, I press the button. It will then notify me in an hour with a chime and notification on my phone that it is finished. Works perfectly. \n\nI also use that same button with a different press to turn off the lights in 30 seconds so that I can see while carrying the folded laundry out of the basement without having to juggle it in my hands to turn off the light switch (and then not be able to see!).

It arrived quicker than I expected, too.

I finally got it working after a few wasted hours. Here's what I learned, and hopefully this helps others who get stuck like I did.

After installing and updating the firmware, it worked for a little while but was constantly showing 2-3 (sometimes 4) people in my office when it was just me. Then after relocating the sensor, it just stopped working entirely. The only way to get it to update my position was to tap the ""..."" menu (top right) and wait for the blue banner to flash ""Updated"", then exit back to see where I was.

I tried everything, including resetting it, re-adding it, and just when I was about to give up I tried restarting my iPhone. Then it started working again. Even toggling on/off WiFi, Bluetooth, airplane mode didn't help. Not even force-quitting the Aqara app helped. It required a phone reboot (is this Windows or iOS lol).

Like I said, I burned a few hours trying to get this thing to work out of the box. Even now, the app is incredibly buggy (feels like I'm a beta tester) and sometimes updates presence on the grid, sometimes doesn't. What I found to be more consistently working is the Apple Home app, visiting the zones I defined. The Aqara app maybe would update my location, but the Home app was more responsive.

I really hope they improve their app... it's rather horrible and makes the experience rather dismal for such a pricey sensor. I'm happy to say that I've dialed it in so that the Apple Home app knows when:

\- Anyone is in my office to turn on the lights

\- Nobody is in my office to turn them off

\- I'm sitting on my sofa (in either of the usual 2 spots) to change lights; turn on TV

\- I'm on my exercise bike to turn off a few lights

\- I leave my desk, triggers a [Homebridge Mac Screensaver](https://github.com/stewartsnow/homebridge-mac-screensaver#readme) to lock my Mac and turn on my screensaver. When I return to my desk, my Apple Watch automagically unlocks it for me.

Anyway, I hope this helps someone else who gets their hands on one of these. A few other troubleshooting steps to try if you're having issues:

\- Restart your phone/device (this is what solved my issue)

\- Make sure you have the latest FP2 firmware

\- Make sure you have the latest OS for your phone

\- Try toggling off WiFi and using just cellular to see if your router is blocking you for some reason

\- Try resetting the FP2 (hold side button for 10+ seconds until its LED goes crazy)

\- Try removing the FP2 from the Aqara app and re-adding it

\- If you see multiple ghost people, exit the room and using the Aqara app go to ""..."" top/right menu > More Settings > Reset Absence State

\- If the sensor isn't detecting you sitting down (like on a sofa), try lowering the sensor. My sensor is on the wall which my sofa butts up to and when I sat on the left of the sofa (wall side) the sensor missed me. I lowered it 2 feet and now it knows when I'm sitting there.

\- Add your own below to help others..."	2	['Derek573: A full hard reset requires 10 quick presses of the button the 10 second hold is only a network reset according to Aqara.

For my experience, I've installed one in my living room and the other one in bathroom, and have been testing for a few days.

My thought on the FP2 is kind of neutral at the time being, it works as expected, but there's still a lot to be improved as I tested in my place. It sometimes takes too long to detect absence, just like it sees a person stuck in the room.

They are all stupid devices, the outlet is like a fuse in case I forget to turn something off, after leaving and if the consumption is above the set value - it turns off the outlet.

Last weekend I stayed up late and in the morning I saw the LED on the TV start flashing and via HDMI CEC the TV also turned on the sound bar, then everything turned off. The screen didn't even light up. According to the socket consumption graph, every day at 2:59 in the morning, the consumption increases to approx. 20W for a moment, the LED on the TV + sound bar turns on and it's quiet again.

Setobox does not cause this, I tried unplugging it for the night. The sound bar is too stupid to do anything by itself. I suspect TV activity. I don't expect the socket itself to draw 20W for some upgrade.

Has anyone encountered a similar situation? Do you think only TV updates regularly at 2:59 in the morning? I looked in the settings, the firmware has been updated for a long time, the timers are not set. I don't know how to explain it.

SmartHomeNerd	0	1304564	Aqara	https://www.reddit.com/r/Aqara/comments/1304564/why_arent_non_aqara_homekit_devices_exposed_in/	Just curious why only Aqara devices versus all HomeKit devices are exposed in the Aqara app for use in automations?  I have many third party apps which can control all HomeKit devices directly from within  their respective app (Eve, Nanoleaf, etc.).  Is this simply an Apple limitation regarding how device automations are handled?	6	['HomeKit-News: Aqara Home is not a third-party HomeKit app like ‘Eve for HomeKit’, ‘Controller’, ‘Home 4’ etc. so it doesn’t have access to the same type of data that these apps have. It’s the same with the Eufy Security app, Xiaomi Home, Yeelight, Abode, Philips Hue etc.', 'SmartHomeNerd: Thanks for the explanation.  It’s a shame, as this would make Aqara automations much more powerful and allow us to use Aqara only actions in our HomeKit automations…', 'HomeKit-News: I agree, as I like the power of Aqara automations. The one glimmer of hope is with the forthcoming Aqara hub M3, which will be a full Matter controller, with a Zigbee 3.0 hub, and a Thread border router baked in. This should mean that the Aqara app will then allow third-party devices to be added to the app, as long as they are Matter compatible. This would still exclude legacy HomeKit/Google/Alexa compatible devices of course, but it’s a start in the right direction.', 'SmartHomeNerd: I wonder why a Aqara would choose not to allow third-party devices as it seems counterintuitive to offering such a powerful Automation system, but limiting it to Aqara only devices.  For example, I just added an FP2 presence sensor, which allows for some very intricate automations that are not available to HomeKit, however, there’s no way for me to utilize these automations for non Aqara devices essentially making them useless…', 'HomeKit-News: I don’t think it’s down to simply choosing not to, I think it’s probably more a case of the way that HomeKit restricts what’s possible within its framework, which would likely impact what the Aqara app is capable of with its own ecosystem. If you looks at the Hue app for example, you can do things with their buttons, lights and sensors that just aren’t possible within the HomeKit framework. I think HomeKit makes it largely impossible for both to exist side by side.', 'SmartHomeNerd: That’s kind of what I was thinking.  Thank you for your comments. 😀']

I have a M2 Hub with a P1 motion sensor and in the Aqura app I have 2 automations setup.  Both are for the same thing, one being for the weekend starting at 2330 and the weekday one starting at 2200 both of them turn off at 0600.  They have not worked until this morning around 7 am when someone left to go to work the P1 detected motion and kicked off the automation that I want to run when motion is detected overnight before 0600.

The automations are a little confusing as I am not sure if I need to include the time on each step/action of the automation and if maybe somewhere the time zone is not set correctly but I don't see anywhere to set that, I see the region which is set to the US but nothing on time zone.

I am not sure what I am doing wrong or have not set correctly.  Any help would be great.

Thank you,

I use an Eero Pro 6 that comes with a HomeKit firewall built in. It is currently not activiated. I also use G2H Pro and G3 cameras as well as an FP2, and Doorbell.  
Do these Aqara accessories break or have limited fuction if we firewall them?

In the Home app, go to Settings -> Home Settings -> Wi-Fi Network & Routers -> HomeKit Accessory Security, then toggle this to off. Go set up your FP2 in the Aqara app, and ensure that it appears in Home app. Then go turn your security back on. \n\nThere seems to be something in the setup process that requires a call home (at least for now).\n\nEdit 2: I made [a few info-graphics](https://imgur.com/a/He9hdpJ) to help""]"

I have sensibo to connect the aircon 
I use ifttt to connect all

When a door is opened when aircon is on, everything works because the air switches off accordingly. 

But when a door is opened and left open with the air off, and then I switch the air on while the door is already open, it doesn’t switch the air off. 

Anyone know how to fix this? 

I tried in the Aqara app to add “if” the door  “is open” or “open” then push notification to Ifttt but it doesn’t work. 

In ifttt I can only choose “open” not “is open” 

Does ifttt check for the command periodically? Can it be pushed?

[What the blind spots look like on the grid](https://i.imgur.com/mwJB7Ok.jpg)

I was getting some flakiness at my sitting spot close to where I mounted the sensor and figured looked into what the detection range should be. The Amazon product page shows a 120 degree FOV with coverage of 8m deep by 6m wide. This implies that the blind spots to the sides are roughly 1.73m by 3m (5.67ft by 9.84ft). Given the app’s grid is 20x16, each “square” works out to be 0.4m by 0.375m (1.31ft by 1.23ft) and means the sensor loses 8 squares to the sides (essentially the whole first row) and roughly 4 squares out front at the farthest edges. Drawing a diagonal line back to the sensor will then give you an idea of what’s impossible (or flaky at best) to sense.

Aqara should indicate this on the grid during setup so that people don’t expect the impossible from this otherwise awesome product."	7	"['Logikoma: so for a midsize room would you recommend a corner mount? also any tips for good mounting height.. thanks for the above info', 'RonSpawnsonTP: Also worth noting, the further away you get from the device, the less ""degrees of coverage"" you get.

Look at the bottom row and you can easily tell it\'s not 120 degrees.', 'ElGuano: Are these ""blind spots"" or are just just the effective lateral range? The FP2 is advertised as supporting a 120 degree FOV, and the blue area in your picture looks like it might just be along the edge of this field?', 'ThanksUncleTimCook: The main issues I see would be placing the puck at an angle (standoff mount perhaps? Rotating the puck isn’t recommended I believe) and aligning with the grid on a bias. The stickers allow diagonal placement but that’s probably more to accommodate people’s placements rather than forcing the sensor into a corner.. \n\nI have mine on a top corner of a window frame ~8ft off the ground to keep the puck and wire more out of sight and it detects all to way to the last row of the grid with my zones (room is long)', 'RonSpawnsonTP: Also curious what the most effective height is', 'Island_Three: Yep. Don’t have one, but my first thought is that this issue should be lessened with a corner mount.', 'Master-Quit-5469: Just seen on the Aqara website “map rotation feature will be available after the launch of the product” which I assume will help in corner placement and then configuration.']"

1) During setup Zone Detection is recommended however the summary below it says ‘Fixed mode that is NOT capable of detecting zone presence’ (see screenshot) - isn’t that the opposite of what it’s for??

2) When drawing out a floor plan the sensor is alway located at the top centre of the canvas (see screenshot). So if you have mounted the sensor in the corner of a room it’s very hard to draw the room diagonally within the squares so that the sensor image is in the correct place. Am I missing something? Can I move the sensor placement on the canvas?

3) With the Aqara app open I walk around the room and watch my location on the canvas in real time. However the tracking movement is not smooth an the image of me jumps about, stutters, and disappears in and out. I thought with mmWave it would track me very precisely?

The latter is especially important and it needs to be accurately marked. You need to look at the map where your marker is when you\'re exactly at your door, and then label that with the exit/entrance attribute. When you leave the room the marker needs to be on the exact block(s) that\'s set to be the exit/entrance. After that the FP2 will start counting down when it detects you\'re already past the door and then change the occupancy state to unoccupied in a few seconds. \n\nIf this isn\'t done accurately then the FP2 will think you\'re still inside, and since the door isn\'t marked it will also think it\'s a wall and since people can\'t pass through walls it will assume you\'re still there.

My own marker jumping all over the interference area (when I’m there) is annoying though as it still messes up my automations based on zones. \n\nHave you already tried manually marking the interference? Though this would involve a lot more work, but might be worth pursuing. The automatic tool never worked well for me. Other than that all I could think of is finding a different area to mount the FP2. One wall might be more beneficial over the other in terms of marking the ceiling fan as interference. \n\nAnd I think Aqara mostly recommend that the FP2 is mounted high up on walls.

Or ad another device/hub with greater range in extension to the M2 hub?

Asking because the signal of the M2 is too weak.

I need at least 15 meters connection from hub to sensor.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Both the Temperature sensor, Door and window sensor and the Smartplug now shows 53 (Poor) in signal strength, just below acceptable so guess the SmartPlug did help!

Shadician	1	12t8cvt	Aqara	https://www.reddit.com/r/Aqara/comments/12t8cvt/how_sensitive_is_g4_doorbell_camera/	"I live on a residential street where my door is essentially directly on the pavement. Any doorbell cam is going to catch not only people walking by, but also the front doors of houses on the other side of the road. Data protection is important to me and I also don't want to annoy the neighbours. Sticking a camera on our door will definitely freak out the ones living across from us. So recording continuously is not something I want to do!

Does the Aqara G4 have a mode where you only capture recordings of people who have stayed directly in front of the door for more than a few seconds, or who actually push the doorbell? Is there any option to 'zone' the camera so it doesn't pick up on people walking past the other side of the street, or blurs out the background?

I'm hoping it does, as the plan then would be to then drop a note in my neighbours letterboxes before installing it, letting them know it isn't recording anyone who doesn't actually come up and linger outside our door."	7	"['RevolutionaryWait982: Hi.

I am considering buying the Aqara M1S Hub.

It has the following feature: ""RGB Light and Illumination Sensor. M1S has a built-in RGB light made of 18 powerful LEDs and a diffuser. It can be used as an alarm, accent, or night light and has configurable brightness and color. Moreover, compared to our previous hub, it has a fully functional illumination sensor that can be used in automations via the Aqara Home app.""

My Questions:  
**1) Can I create the following scene inside the Aqara android app:**  
IF: Aqara M1S Hub brightness is above or below 100 lux for example  
THEN: Send me notification

**2) Can I create the following Applet inside IFTTT:**  
IF: Aqara M1S Hub brightness is above or below 100 lux for example  
THEN: Do XYZ (such as send me an email, post to twitter, or anything that ifttt can do)

If the answer to both questions above is negative, would it be possible then to create the above scene and IFTTT applet if I buy the Aqara Light Sensor separately and pair it with the M1S hub?

P.S. I am aware that Aqara sells a separate smart light sensor. However, I am interested to know if the M1S Hub alone can do the above since it has a fully functional illumination sensor as mentioned in the description on top.

1681958656.0	19-Apr-2023 19:44:16	To folks with the Aqara FP2 and FP1, what is your experience like?	kenpoh	14	12sjahy	Aqara	https://www.reddit.com/r/Aqara/comments/12sjahy/to_folks_with_the_aqara_fp2_and_fp1_what_is_your/	"Having been oversold by the FP1's promises, I'm really skeptical of the FP2 capabilities and promises. I would like to know whats your experience like for people who have the FP2 on hand, especially if you have experiences with the FP1. In particular...

1. how accurate is the fall detection? I can't imagine that to be a very reliable indicator. A lot of people will be looking at this but I suspect an apple watch will still be far more reliable in this regard.
2. I heard the detection is fast - did they finally use the 'zone entry' detection mechanism as opposed to the 'presence detection' mechanism which takes a few seconds to trigger? Is this mechanism used in homekit. FP1 had this capability in the aqara app but for homekit it uses presence detection which is really slow, limiting the functionality to quickly toggle switches for native aqara devices but not homekit devices.
3. how good is the multi people detection, their advertisement shows a very unrealistic 'realtime' like detection, I am a bit doubtful that is the case even after seeing a gif of the real time detection - is it accurate even? FP1 took \*forever\* and is inaccurate to the point of totally not being usable. Its like taking 10-30 seconds to update a position. Also how does this translate to homekit? Can you make a presence detection per zone and each individual zone shows up in homekit ?
4. does it support Matter?? does it play well with matter devices? (For future proofing, still very sceptical about matter)

I'm not really interested in how well this device perform with just aqara devices as my main intention is to have it interact with homekit(or matter?) devices. So I'm just wondering, how well does this device integrate into the homekit ecosystem?

In the end my FP1 ""presence detection"" had so many false positives and the terrible delays, it ended up being my 'no-presence detector' - as in I use it to turn off lights only, relying on PIR detectors to turn on lights. Looking forward to hear from those who had FP1, as this FP2 looks like it costs way more. Firmware updates for FP1 also have been terribly lacking and the product looks like it was already been abandoned so fast after it hit the market. I was sooooooooo excited when this product was released that I got like 5 of them. I ended up only using 3 of them (after tons of experimentation and probably not in the way it was intended to be used). 2 of them are collecting dust, awaiting for actual \*reliable\* use cases or at least updates."	7	"['Iambashir: You’re asking the right questions.

Aqara is winning me over as it's one of the few smart switch companies with black light switches available, and it has Matter support via the hub...but only thing holding me back is I'd love to be able to use light switches as thread devices to strengthen my smarthome set up. Needing to buy another dedicated hub is also putting me off slightly."	5	"['sulylunat: I don’t think anything has been publicly announced yet for thread switches. However, they do currently have thread based motion sensors and window and door sensors (edit:only announced so far, not released), so I imagine they will be slowly revamping all their current products to Thread devices. They probably do have plans behind closed doors but unfortunately I don’t think there’s any public knowledge on whether it will happen or when we could see it.', 'mtn-mx: MATTER ist Not the same thing like Thread, and no, no plans to update all, the list was published and are Zigbee devices. there will be new devices but not sure for that.', 'moiety_actual: They do NOT currently have Thread-based anything! They’ve *announced* that their P1 motion sensor will at some point get a Thread-based edition, as well as one of their many contact sensors, but when these products will actually ship is anyone’s guess. Could easily be a whole year away.', ""Shadician: Fair, it's not the same, I am aware. \n\nMy understanding is works with Matter means it will be compatible with Matter hubs and systems (e.g. Google Home, Apple HomeKit etc). \n\nWhile Thread is a low-power mesh-networking protocol to connect your devices together that many newer 'Matter' devices will use. Means you don't need to use bluetooth, Zigbee, WiFi or anything else and is supposedly more effective and reliable.\n\nI was asking if Aqara had plans beyond just bringing out Matter compatibility (which it is bringing to some of its hubs, to bridge other Aqara devices into a Matter network, and to some of it's newer devices): whether it plans to add the Thread protocol as well? Sound like nothing announced.\n\nIt's great we can now 'bridge' an Aqara-powered home into our Matter-networks and have everything come up on Google Home for example, but it would be even cooler if we could get all devices using Thread to connect.  \n\nSeems to me many manufacturers supporting Matter are intending on building Thread into their newer devices. I was just wondering if anything like this was on the horizon for Aqara.

I have 67 accessories and all the improvements are good to take

&#x200B;

Here are some important new ideas: (explanation photo below)

**A)** Have half temperatures, the one degree range is far too large for some tasks.

Example: Turn on the heater when the temperature drops below 18.5°C (we are currently stuck at 18 or 19°C).

&#x200B;

**B)** Smooth out the temperature curves rather than displaying peaks and troughs to reflect reality.

&#x200B;

**C)** Create a link between the alarm system and the smoke or gas detector

These devices have very strong alarms.

Example: If the alarm is triggered then make the detector ring for 30 seconds.

&#x200B;

**D)** Be able to put colours on the cards

Example: I have a door sensor, if it is closed, that it is displayed in green in the zone where it is written ""closed"" and in red when it is open

Same for the TVOC, colour levels in the level area ""Excellent = Green"" Bad = Red etc..

&#x200B;

**E)** Make half cards for everything

Half cards for lamps are great.

It should be possible to have it for all accessories

Example: Thermometer, on a half card, the logo on the left and the info on the right.

**E) Ipad :** This size reduction would be very useful on the ipad

Put for example smaller cards, currently all is much too large

3 or 4 lines instead and half cards would be great

&#x200B;

**F)** On the Android application, the alarm system is at the top next to ""my home"", would it be possible to do the same thing on Ios?

If somebody would hit the “main room” zone first and trigger those lights before triggering the accent lighting, those lights would turn on before the accent lighting and just stay\non when you move into the accent lighting zone by default, since you won’t have configured it to turn off the lights again.

Looks nice, it’s relatively inexpensive for a native HomeKit doorbell and performs well!', '212nycguy: I’ve never had a camera doorbell, so the truth is my review comes without much personal experience to compare against. However, after about a month of use, I will say that all the features and settings the camera claims to have — all of them work for me. The biggest “issue”, which for me has turned out to not be bothersome, is that the camera does tend to record a handful of “empty” clips where the motion has already passed because of the delay. Supposedly this is a greater issue when run off battery (as I use mine) versus hardwire. \n\nHowever, because I live in an apartment building and there are a couple more doors beyond mine in my hallway, this is actually preferable for me as it means that it’s not picking up my two neighbors’ activity as they come and go, passing my door each time. Although they may not know it, at least I’m not recording them every day. I’m not sure what their feeling are about seeing this doorbell camera as they walk by it, but it makes my conscious slightly clearer. As a result, any recording that does have a person’s activity in it is because someone has stopped in front of my door for a few seconds and therefore is related to my doorbell needs. I’ve got alerts coming from both Aqara and HK and they seem to waver back and for between which comes first, but they’re usually both within a matter of seconds from one another. \n\nFor a first time user of such a product, for the ease of a wireless and non-permanent setup and also the lower price point than the existing HK alternatives, I’m generally pleased with the product and hopeful that if there are any beneficial updates to the product that it could exist within a software update and not necessarily the hardware’s second version.', 'DestroyErase_Improve: I’ve found the device is really good so far.

It really annoyed me that Eufy didn’t offer HKSV, even though it is a battery doorbell.  But then again….so is this one, so I’m guessing Eufy ticked off someone at Apple.  Regardless, here I go!\n\nThe size doesn’t bother me, but how to replace the batteries does.  You certainly need to keep this in mind when it comes to placement if you are not hardwiring it in.  That being said, the screw is a lot easier to deal with than the paper clip hole with Eufy.  But Eufy has a rechargeable battery.  That being said, the camera has been working a lot during the install process, and it was at 100% when I finally attached it to the house.  \n\nThe alarm that sounds when the device is tampered with is real!  I installed the batteries to help me with placement and when I removed the back to install it…holy cow!  The app doesn’t easily tell you how to disable the alert until you are satisfied where it is, but it’s nice to know the product and the door bell alerts you when it has been removed.  \n\nThe whole reason I bought this was not to see packages delivered, it was to see who was approaching my door.  If I sene someone arriving with a package, I know it’s there.  I really don’t need another point of view to stare at the package.  If someone comes up and takes the package, I will have proof.  The sole reasons i bought this camera is because it offers HKSV and I can see it on my AppleTV.  Finally…one freaking app!  Yeah, changing the ring tones require the Aqara app and is really fun.  The Home App lets you adjust the zones for you to see movement…yes, I said zones.  I don’t want the bushes to alert me when there is movement but I want to see if there is movement near my car.\n\nIt will take a bit of time for the face recognition to store enough faces for me to assign names, but the Home App is staying on top of it.  When I bought the Eufy doorbell cam, I had to buy an additional “wedge” to help with the angle of the camera, and this one comes with it!  And placement of the inside doorbell speaker wasn’t a problem.  I have an outlet that is less than 10 feet away, and you will want to keep it handy to turn off the doorbell when someone rings it.  I think the recommendation is less than 15 feet.  \n\nThe only issues I have had so far:  The firmware update wasn’t working on my iPhone, I had to do it on my iPhone.  I should have figured out the placement in the dark since the internal light shines brightly…on my bush.  And lastly, the app.  it was really a PITA to find the setting to turn off the tamper alarm while I installed the camera.  Once the back of the door bell is off, the alarm starts sounding….and does NOT stop.  I wish that was an easy disable option in the app.  \n\nOverall, I LOVE IT!  i love that I can block out zones, and tweak them as I go.  I love that I can make a custom ringtone.  I love that I can cue up the video on my AppleTV.

While Aqara G4’s motion detection is a mess on itself I’d say it works mostly OK, the issue is in the way they handle HKSV video - it starts almost 5 second late after motion event registered

A simple example that replicates very consistently in my environment:

HKSV video - someone leaving a package at my porch, they are already there, video stares at 11:20:**10**. Same video stored on the SD card. You might think that it was the motion detected late or sensitivity needs to be set to High but in fact the motion was detected in time

https://i.imgur.com/ipvJpSX.jpg

Aqara Cloud clip - it starts at 11:20:**05** and captured the person walking up the steps. It’s consistent with the distance when motion detection sensitivity is set to Low

https://i.imgur.com/z2bK88d.jpg

This is one of several major bugs in this doorbell and until Aqara fixes it I wouldn’t recommend buying it


P.S. I am a big fan of Aqara brand and own many of their devices including a HKSV camera G2H that I used on my porch for long time. G4 is the first Aqara device that truly disappointed me with multiple major issues. This is only one of them

I don’t claim to know exactly how G4/HKSV works, my assumptions are based on thorough observation

I've been using my iPad (I don't have an iPhone) and connected the G2H Pro with some hickups, but it worked in the end. I connected my P3 Smartplug, but it would never show me a page to allow me to connect my AC to it.

I removed the accessory and reconnected a few times in a different ways in hopes that it would work, but no dice. Until it finally just stopped connecting and only showed errors. 

I thought maybe it was the G2H Pro's issue and decided to remove that as well. Then I couldn't connect to that anymore either.

By the way, this is all through Aqara Home app and Homekit mode. 

I've tried factory resetting by pressing 10x, soft resetting by holding the button. No dice, unplugging it for a bit and plugging it back in, turning off and on my router, removing my homepod mini, and just a bunch of things. Unfortunately, all I get are variations of different errors. Sometimes it just says error, sometimes device already connected to a hub, and so on. 

My wifi has only letters, my password are only letters and numbers. 

I'm all out of ideas. If anyone has any advice, much appreciated.

Edit: I somehow got it all working again. I have no clue if this is the reason, but I changed my wifi and used a dual band 2.4 Ghz -5 Ghz rather than my 2.4 Ghz guest wifi. I was also messing around with my cheapo smartplug that got screwed up when I removed my Homekit. I reset it and just straight unplugged it, scanned it (said it was still connected to a Home), I got pissed and unplugged it while it was scanning and plugged it back in. Then it connected to My Home. 

After that everything worked, well except my Aqara P3 still won't connect my AC to my Home App, the unhappy workaround was that I had to connect it to Mi Home instead and my Home App still can't control my AC. 

TL;DR - Broke my smart home stuff, then I maybe fixed it by changing the wifi Aqara P3 still can't control my AC through Aqara Homekit Mode, but it will connect it. Aqara P3 does work in Mi Home (can control the AC), but it doesn't give Homekit authority even though it says it is bound.

Solved: Followed the instructions of /u/mtn-mx"	4	"['mtn-mx: ACC P3 comes by default to be added into Xiaomi Home App, if you are going to add it into Aqara Home App follow next steps:\n\n1. If Air Conditioning Controller P3 has been added into HomeKit (Apple Home App) first: Remove it from Apple’s Home App, and then remove it from Xiaomi Home App; done these last steps let’s begin:\n1. Before adding the device (ACC-P3), be sure that your mobile device (phone, iPhone, iPad, tablet) has been connected to your 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network, and keep the mobile device as close to the product as possible.\n2. Now, we are going to make a -Reset factory- and to change the server’s connections to ‘Aqara Home’: A) Press the device P3’s button 10 times, after this, the led indicator light flashes, and then, after hearing the voice prompt ""waiting to connect, please open the Mijia App""; B) Press the button 2 times, now voice promp will say ""waiting to connect, please open Aqara Home App"", this will be on Chinese but you will hear something different from first time and sounds like aqaaaaaaaara LOL.\n3. Open the Aqara Home App, and Add the device P3, follow the steps, first it will ask to scan the HomeKit QR code, and device will be added into Home App, once it has been added, it will return into Aqara Home App and be bound it. \n4. Here, complete the steps and consider that there will be a firmware update, check it and install it, go to: Profile/Firmware update.\n5. As we made a factory reset, all previous data of the P3 has gone, as information of added sub-devices, if you got the P3 version with -Temperature-Humidity and Atmospheric’s pressure version- you have to add the sensor to the P3, same if you have other sensors and P3 will be their hub.\n6. If you add a Temperature sensor, P3 will take it as own, it means that P3 will show temperature as sensor and into HomeKit you will see only the Humidity sensor, I don’t remember if after adder the sensor P3 takes it or ask to bind it. This is nice beachside into Home App you will see his card showing the Temperature info (If you add another or others Temperature’s sensor these will appear as child devices).\n7. Finally, check if P3 is bounded, go to Profile/HomeKit/HomeKit devices and here you will see the Aqara P3 with the legend bound if not there will be a blue button to bind it.\nInto HomeKit you could get a message like “this device need permission for…..” if you see this you have to add your Air Conditioner into Aqara Home App, after that you can control and to use it in HomeKit.', 'Dirus: Edit: Nevermind, I factory reset it (pressed 10x) and then unplugged it for a few hours. Came back plugged it in and I forgot if I soft reset (hold for 10s) or factory. Anyways, the prompt for Mi Home came up and I followed your instructions. It worked out perfectly. Thanks again for taking the time to write the advice! Much appreciated!\n\nThanks for writing such an in-depth advice! I removed it from my Home App, unfortunately it is having the same issue it had the day before and won’t pair with anything. I’m hoping it’ll work again if I give it some time.\n\nI did press the P3’s button 10x and it said factory reset message, but when I waited for the connector to Mi home it never came, unless I hold the button for 10 seconds. After I held it for 10 seconds and it said connect to Mi Home, I double tapped the button, but no prompt that says Aqara Home app.\n\nIs it pretty common for you to get the message or am I not waiting long enough for the message to appear?', 'mtn-mx: 10 clicks, after that wait some five seconds and then do 2 clicks to change to Aqara with that you can add it into Aqara home app.\nIf you can use a translator to be sure Aqara mode as changed.\nHave you updated the firmware?', ""Dirus: Yep, I've updated the firmware.

I have a problem or question about the motion detection of the G4 Doorbell. The detection works very good, when I turn down the duration of stay to 0s.

I also have an other questions.
1. On my pixel 5 the video Stream doesn't work. The buffering symbol comes very few seconds. And on the clock in the video Stream I see that the time is not rising up. Does someone have the same issue?

Still figuring out best settings for notifications like a lot of people. For context:-new 4.0 firmware-Batteries-0 duration-Motion sensitivity high-Using through HomeKit, but did bind to Aqara app for some extra settings.

&#x200B;

i know post is long. There is a video down below, incase you don’t get all the way through.

\*\*Problem 1- Motion caught differently for motion alerts vs videos:\*\*I have alerts set for any motion, and recordings set for any motion. The motion alert seems to catch the action much earlier. When i get the screenshot on my phone, i see myself walking out the door. But then when I go look at the recording, it only catches closer to the end when i am walking back into the house. Shouldn’t these be aligned?

\*\*Problem 2 - Double notifications:\*\*It seems as though i am getting double notifications. I am getting one for the motion, then one for the recording. I don’t believe it is just a second notification for motion because: a) it is set to 30 seconds cooldown b)they come too close together to be separate events. The motion comes quicker than the recording by a few seconds. c) The motion screenshot just shows me the screenshot. The “video recording” shows me a screenshot plus plays sound from the event (not live). The screenshot is not the same, it is one from the tail end of the video.

I am still testing things, but i believe at one point (not sure what i had it set at) the notification would actually show me the full clip if i long pressed on it. For some reason I think “Notifications“ were off or set to something slightly different, and recordings were set to record. Unsure if this is even possible. So i guess the question is, is there any way to disable “recording” notifications? I just need the motion notification with the quick preview to Get an idea of what is going on. Double notification are an extreme pain, and with Ring doorbell, this would always happen and they didn’t have a fix for it.

\*\*\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*\* I was getting too many car notifications and random ""nothing"" notifications with 0 duration and High/low sensitivity. So I put it back to send a notification only when a person is seen. The notification for this type of setting shows the whole video when I long press to see the big version of the preview. So that solves that. What is weird is that it actually backtracked the recording by a second or two before I even came into Frame so you could see everything. But the thumbnail was good and showed me in it. Problem is I tried to recreate it and next time the recording was what I would consider a little bit late. Missed a third of me walking out. So hit and miss but will keep tweaking. 

Here is a video of what i mean. You see what ring doorbell records. Starts much earlier. Then you what the g4 recorded. Then i show you that the motion alert actually caught it way faster, and lastly that there was a double notification:

[https://www.loom.com/share/1940aeb40bd54e1d98623a7a3288db7b](https://www.loom.com/share/1940aeb40bd54e1d98623a7a3288db7b)

&#x200B;

Problem 3 - Get motion alerts, but no video records.I’m still trying to figure out what the best settings for motion sensitivity are. 0 duration and high sensitivity is picking up too many cars. But low sensitivity isn’t sending me notifications soon enough for people walking to the door. I thought i nailed it by turning on “people only” on high sensitivity, but looks like that slows it down. The issue is, when i have it on “record everything” and motion alerts for “everything”, whenever something like a car driving by and triggers the motion, there is no recording. This reinforces my point in my first post that the motion and the recordings are run on different motion “settings“ (not sure what to call it). This will be very confusing if i keep getting motion alerts that don’t catch anything on the preview screenshot, and then i have no video to go and check to see what really happened. Shouldn’t  they be consistent?"	5	"['CleanestNdaC1ty: I’m having issues with it detecting motion late.

So I made my own, which is actually very loud and like an actual alarm, even on the G3 it’s still impressive.
A sweep from 2.6kHz to 8kHz @ 2Hz.
I have this setup in the custom ringtones for both hubs.

I’m not able to select the custom ringtones from the alarm modes settings where you choose the alarm sound.

So I tried making an automation to play my custom ringtone on both hubs whenever either the away or night alarm sounds. Unfortunately it doesn’t overrule the original alarm, I checked to see if the automation was working by adding a light relay to turn on. Which it does. So I’m sure the automation works, the custom ringtones just don’t take over the alarm sounds.

Does anyone know of a workaround? Because the original alarm sounds and volumes are basically meme’s.

You won’t be able to add the Pro to any other server, and it won’t work with Google. Remote locking should be possible if you have a hub on the same server as the lock. The main difference between the two models is that you don’t get remote access to passcode management with the Pro model. Remote access is still possible via HomeKit if you use it (but you need a Home Hub - Apple TV, HomePod/Mini).']

HomeKit enabled - HKSV to stream/record 
Chime is 1 metre from the doorbell
No Apple TV, HomePods as hub

Disconnect all Apple TV, HomePods, and Hubs from the electrical power, then wait for 10 seconds and connect one by one, first one Apple TV or HomePod wait to get device online and then connect the next one, after that connect your M2 or M1S, and then when it is online connect the second. \nYesterday I noticed some HomeKit issues after update all devices to 16.4, so one of my hubs (Tuya-ZemiSmart) was online but all my Tuya Zigbee child devices “no response” was annoying, tried lots of thing until I removed the hub and I could not add it back LOL all day was angry finally about 2 am just tried to make the last test and added in a few seconds… that was only that hub, in the morning HomePods could not play music from Apple Music App, other devices were disconnected from the wifi network because loos the password… can you believe this? Well weird thing after iOS 16.4 update LOL\n\nBe patient and breath!', 'evoneselse: Oh no!!! Hope that all stabilizes for you!\n\nThe M1S is in the same room as the m2, about 8 feet apart. I use it for the siren and light. Both are connected and fine in Aqara, everything always is. It’s always HK for any issues.\n\nI have an Apple TV, hardwired. 4 minis used singularly and one HP2. Sometimes one of the minis takes over as the hub (wish we could choose…) but lately the ATV has stayed put, luckily.\n\nI will do the rebooting. Thank you!']

If neither of those work call your service provider to get access. You should be able to change router name, password and assign static addresses to devices. DNS servers typically default to dynamic, meaning they will reassign the IP address to different devices as needed. Some devices do fine with that, others (like my Hegel amp) do not adapt well so it’s best to assign a static (doesn’t change) IP address in the router. I  once paid my landlord $20/mo to use his wireless from downstairs. Signal was weak in some parts of my apartment so I added a bridge. Problem came in when his router would assign a new address to my amp - the amp wouldn’t adapt seamlessly and ended up with a hassle getting it to reconnect at times. I wasn’t comfortable asking landlord if I could configure his router to assign static addresses for some of my devices, so I ended up getting my own Xfinity account. Not all devices are as finicky as my amp was, maybe your doorbell will be fine in a dynamic IP situation.

Do the Aqara settings play a part in what HKSV chooses to see and record in the Home app?

How do you guys have things set in order to actually see and record people? And are any of you having this issue with HKSV?

The weird thing is that before the upgrade to 16.4, it spent most of the time offline but in the few minutes it was online it did record people, was shown in the timeline and able to be played back.

The recording does take place in Aqara and on the SD card, but the frame rate is very choppy, almost like freeze frames one after another. My G3 camera playback has a normal flow, not choppy and jerky.

Now since I upgraded to 16.4 new architecture, the good news is that it is now online in HomeKit!! But now doesn’t record anything there. The timeline is just gray with little dots.

I had tried everything to fix this. \n\nSo yesterday we upgraded the Apple system  (iPhones, Apple TV, HomePods) and updated to the new HomeKit architecture. Woohoo it is now perfect. This morning I opened the Home app and everything is still responsive…the doorbell stayed connected all night and is going strong today. So for me it was a HomeKit issue. \n\nI don’t know if this is the root of your issue, but I can say Aqara was a brand I hadn’t ever had trouble with, and the doorbell issue had to do with HomeKit, because the doorbell in the Aqara app had always been fine. YMMV.', 'Academic_Strike85: I had a similar problem due to the distance to the wifi router. My router has a setting to disconnect devices with to weaker signal (less than -80dB) because they are too far away. That is now un-checked and had no problems since.', 'Wesinator2000: I’m actually one of the lucky few that had no issues when updating to new architecture on the first offering. \n\nMy issue isn’t with connectivity at all though. Aqara devices have remarkable uptime, and their response is always ultra fast. My issue is with the hubs actual connection to my wifi network. I don’t know if it’s an issue with Aqara and it’s connection to eero, but for whatever reason, I’ve found that occasionally, when my Aqara hub disconnects from the network, it refuses to reconnect as the “same” device. \n\nBiggest issue with this, is I have to reset the hub to get it to reconnect, and given my hub has 20+ devices on it, when I reconnect it, it imports into homekit as a new Aqara hub and all its devices have to be re-added as well. Of course there’s no simple way in homekit to “replace” an existing device with a new one, so I have to go through the painstaking process of re-rooming renaming and re-automating 20+ devices and their numerous automations for each. It takes days… simply because the Aqara hub won’t reconnect.']

Hello everyone,

I recently set up single, double, and long press automations in HomeKit, and everything works as expected. However, I have purchased over 20 Aqara buttons, and the automations for each are nearly identical. Manually configuring and maintaining each button would be extremely time-consuming and cumbersome.

Does anyone know of a method to copy automations from one button and transfer them to another? Alternatively, is there a way to duplicate the device configuration, so the same settings can be applied to multiple buttons?

Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Here’s what you need to know:

The doorbell can use either AC or DC power. Sounds like gibberish if you’re not familiar with electrical work so ignore it for now.

Purchase a power supply, I used a 3pin UK power supply I already had at home, if you don’t have one you can buy from Amazon or eBay with round terminals which makes it even easier, I have a link to one if you want to look it up.

Your doorbell can operate at any voltage between 8-24v with amperage of 0.5amps (500ma). 

As long as your power supply is rated at a voltage anywhere between 8-24v AND it has an amperage of 0.5amp (500ma) or higher, you’re good to go. 

Just make sure the amps of the power supply is not lower than 0.5amps (500ma), anything equal to 0.5amps or greater is fine to use. 

Polarity isn’t something we need to worry about with the doorbell, it will sort this out itself as either terminal can accept the current. 

It’s fairly simple and straightforward, use a power supply that can be plugged in with a voltage between 8-25 with a minimum of 0.5amps or higher NEVER LOWER and you’re sorted!

I just received my G4 doorbell and was setting it up. With battery everything works fine but I wanted to test the wired connection as that is my target picture. I spun up a small power adapter (230V to 12V; both AC in Germany) and only can hear a silent ""click clack"" sound looping every 1-2 seconds but the camera itself stays off and does not send any video signal.

(I wanted to give it a spin first before laying the wire resp. poaching the entrance where I want to install it where there should be a 12 V connection coming from the basement but I’m not 100% sure. And before doing all of that, I wanted to give it an ""independent"" test spin first.)

Does anyone have any idea why it would not work? The data reads fine to me as amateur. Do I have to do/enable something to use the wired power connection instead of batteries?

For anyone having this problem, I will leave this post in case this fix helps you.

Original post below:
Our new G4 has an issue staying connected in HomeKit for any longer than 5-10 minutes. Aqara is fine. It’s hardwired, not battery. HK hub is hardwired Apple TV.

I’ve tried the chime repeater in all sorts of places and although the signal strength may vary, the result is the same. Currently I am at 64% Wi-Fi and 5 bars ‘Strong’ signal strength. I’ve also rebooted everything, used restart from the Aqara app, cut power to the doorbell circuit breaker, but the doorbell only stays connected in HK for a short time, the goes no response. I’ve even moved the chime to where it was 95% Wi-Fi but same issue. 

I also found this to be reproducible. If I power cycle or restart the doorbell, it will reconnect to HomeKit and HK will notify me that it’s back online. It will stay online ONLY until something happens, 1) like if I go into settings, 2) like it seeing someone / something, 3) where HK has to send any notification, 4) or anything that requires HK doing something. Then boom, offline it goes immediately. I even tried HomeKit mode only, but no difference.

Doorbell signal is 5 bars, strong. Network says 64%. I’ve tried the chime repeater in many different places, same outcome."	5	"['supernitin: How are you are you power cycling it?

The device is not syncing the inputs from the actual physical AC remote. So when I use the remote, the app and the AC are not in sync.

- I have already bound the device to my Aqara app and HomeKit. Moved also from Mi Home to Aqara mode. No issues.

- I can control the AC through Aqara app and Home app. No issues.

- When I use the physical remote, the app does not update. When I tap the physical remote, the P3 device blinks blue (which means the IR signal received by the device?). However, the status on my app does not update.

- My AC is Daikin. I can match the AC with many remote ID in the app. I have tried all the Daikin IDs in the app already. 

Anyone experienced this? I’ve been tinkering this all day to no success."	4	"['wks-rddt: That is expected operation.

The AC will change its state, and the Aqara P3 will parse the signal to properly reflect the state. This works for me on two different brands, however I did notice some delay at times.""]"

I previously had a battery powered Ring Doorbell 2 so this will be my comparison to that in terms of alerts and video capture.

Since I don't have a wired connection I was waiting for the G4 to be available since I knew I wanted to integrate a battery powered video doorbell with HomeKit.

***Setup in HomeKit***

Installation was a breeze. I configured it directly with HomeKit first without installing the Aqara app. Literally takes 1 minute. Open homekit, add accessory, then take a picture of the QR code. As easy as that.

***Motion Alerts compared to Ring***

I installed the G4 and then sat the Ring doorbell on top of it. I then did 3 tests.

1. walking out my door and down my walkway
2. walking home and going through the front door
3. walking to my door, pretending to leave a package, and walking away

The alerts were basically on par with the Ring. If the homekit alert happened first then the ring alert happened a split second after and vice versa. Leaving my house the alert was near instantaneous (since I'm close to the doorbell). When I was walking up the walkway to my door there seemed to be a bit of a lag and the alert wouldn't happen until I was basically at my door for 1-2 seconds. Again this is on par with my Ring doorbell.

***Saved video in Home app compared to Ring (with the Aqara app installed)***

In my 3 tests above, the video in HomeKit is slightly worse than Ring. In tests 1 and 2 the video started to capture about 1-2 seconds after the Ring video would begin the capture. In test 3 I got the alert but the video never captured for some reason. This was actually the same with Ring. I played around with all the settings in the Home app. I turned off face detection since I thought the additional processing would delay the video capture, but that didn't seem to improve things. I also played with the record ""any motion is detected"" and ""specific motion is detected"" to ""people"" setting, but again that didn't seem to have any effect on when video capture started.

***Aqara app (UPDATED after third day of testing)***

I installed the Aqara app to see if it had settings that would improve video capture speed. After installing the app and linking it to homekit, it auto detected the doorball and ""binded"" it right away. Again, very easy. The aqara app has a signal notification on how strong the signal is to the chime repeater. I noticed I had a ""weaker"" signal so I moved the chime repeater closer and now get a ""strong"" signal.  After reading some posts on Reddit I discovered there are Motion Detection settings that are hidden in the app due to a terrible UI.  I set the ""Stay Duration"" to 0 seconds.  Now the alerts and video capture is happening sooner.  I would say it's on par or better than the Ring doorbell.

***Final thoughts after 3 days of testing***

Using the Aqara app to fine tune the motion detection is a must.  I have all the motion alerts enabled in the Home app and turned off the motion alerts in the Aqara app.  Plus you'll want to have the Aqara app installed so you can get future firmware updates.  All in all I am very pleased with the doorbell.  Just getting out of the Ring ecosystem and not paying the yearly subscription fee is worth it."	15	"[""Numerous_Roof_9408: I just updated my review after discovering the Motion Detection setting within the Aqara app (it's not easy to find and easily missed).

I thought it might be to notify if Aqara hub goes down, but Aqara app does that. Or more sophisticated camera event identification, but it seems HomeKit only ‘filters’ motion first identified and sent by Aqara and I’m fine with what Aqara does (was hoping to expand/enhance, not filter). No problems with Aqara saved video not being secure or encrypted as I’ll only turn on for away from home security. Am I missing something?

Another reason is to write automations incorporating non-Aqara devices with Aqara devices.

Stuff like that. You can write some complex automations, some only via the Aqara app and some only via the Home app. Both useful.

recently I discovered Aqara and I'm really happy with Aqara products.

Next month I'll move to my new home, and it's more bigger than my current home. I know that the max distance between a device and hub is 10m, how can I connect the Aqara devices from top level with my hub. The distance is easily 30m with two floors!

I live in the EU and own a Mi water leak sensor.  
Installation requires a Aqara hub, for what the Mi Home app tells me. It saya ""Aqara Hub"" or ""Aqara M1S Hub"". Can I use the Aqara E1 hub with the Mi water leak sensor in the Mi Home app?  
I don't need a hub with integrated speaker and LED light, so the E1 looks the best and smallest hub.  


If that is not possible, can I use the Mi water leak sensor with the E1 in the Aqara app?  
Would that mean any sacrifices?  


Or do I need that big Aqara M1S hub?  


My Mi water leak sensor is this:

This differs from the way a normal camera works, and may be intentional.\n\nI decided to connect a 24V transformer to see if it made a difference to event detection, but it didn’t.

I contacted support anyway to enquire about it.\n\nTheir advice for Aqara app recording was to turn “Recording On” (under More settings -> Alert settings). I had this off as I didn’t want recordings going to the Aqara cloud. Amazingly, they also advised that if you insert an SD card and connect power, you can choose to record continuously (under More settings -> Doorbell settings -> SD card storage -> Record mode). \n\nTurned it on, and it works.

You could disable recording for face recognition if you’re worried about faces being stored in the Aqara cloud, as I have, while leaving recording on for motion detection.

The options in the app imply that it’s the recording that gets sent to the cloud when a face is recognised, which you can turn off. Same for motion detection. The safest option is probably to turn face recognition AND recording off, and let HomeKit do that work. The only thing I know for sure right now is that the software does not provide an option for a local sd card and HKSV recording combination.', 'evoneselse: Yes I’m unsure of it too. I thought it was said that Aqara has to store the faces, but I don’t know if that’s true. I don’t know if it has to be set up and stored on the Aqara side, or  if HK will store the faces and do the face matches when it sees someone.

Based on google and deepl translate and my limited chinese vocabulary, here's some of the takeaways:

&#x200B;

1. FP2 oval disc shape is larger in width but thinner than the FP1 convex shape

2. Detachable USB C for FP2

3. Claims FP2's Wi-Fi implementation provides faster response time than FP1's ZigBee protocol

4. Larger detection area

5. With more zone detections requires longer initial setup 

6. It comes with fall detection for the model that the blogger received, although they also mentioned that false positive can be triggered by ""shaking clothes""

7. For fall detection mode the device has to be mounted top down,  for spatial tracking mode the device has to be mounted to the side of the room. Therefore only one of the modes can be used at any time.

8. Exposable to HomeKit (and possibly home assistant via HomeKit controller) for both light and zone detection. No mentioned whether fall detection or upcoming posture detection is exposable.

9. Presence detection trigger almost immediately, ""The FP2 is so fast that I even had to add a two-second delay to automations to make it intuitive""

10. Spatial position tracking much faster and more accurate than fp1. Able to detect when they walk into a predefined office zone 

11. Susceptible to reflections from smooth object. In the 1.1.3 firmware update Aqara added a edge setting guidance page to address the issue

10. Product manager of FP2 says that they will add in the future the ability ""to automatically learn to find and block misidentified targets"" to reduce false positives

11. Can be operated as a human presence detection sensor without spatial awareness if its not required

12. Presence of pets may trigger sensor

&#x200B;

All around, seems like a huge step up from FP1 based on this article. Have a look at the review for some photos and additional information."	7	"['choice_sg: Wow, the GIF in the artifact is showing accuracy and speed that is scary good.

I use one Mini for my doorbell, but I have additional doorbell button in the entrance of the building that I cannot change, so this was a solution for me to trigger the doorbell button from another source as well.

There is probably a more elegant way of doing this, but I had a spare mini switch and I needed those dumb doorbell buttons to rang the Aqara speaker so it is what it is. :)"	0	[]

The M1S has a loud alarm that gives you several different types of sounds to choose from, but not a docile-sounding chime.\n\nFirst you would need to create an automation in the Aqara app for what you want to do. If it is daytime and you are at home, you might only want to have a notification on your phone that the door was opened. Or if you also want a sound, you could use one of the Aqara sounds at a lower volume so it’s less siren-like. That said though, if a door is opened, your iPhone will have a little bell type alert that you can choose which will be delivered along with its banner notification of the door being opened.\n\nIf at night or if you are away, then you would want it to not only notify you but also trigger the siren.\n\nFor HomeKit, you do need a hub such as an Apple TV or a HomePod.

Jayzedman	24	11w24w6	Aqara	https://www.reddit.com/r/Aqara/comments/11w24w6/aqara_g4_doorbell_ongoing_connection_issues/	"Have had my G4 Doorbell (worldwide version) in Australia for a few weeks now. However reliability isn't great compared to my previous Eufy doorbell. Despite it being 1 wall away (2.5m) from the chime, almost every 1-2 days the doorbell stops communicating with the Chime so you can no longer access the video feed and no recordings take place. The only solution is to pull the power on the chime to force it to reconnect.

Have to say that while the feature set on the G4 is great, reliability and software isn't great. The stream can't be changed to 1080P (auto defaults to ""smooth"" which is very low resolution), has no way to temporarily silence the doorbell (it's either on or off, you have to remember to turn it back on) and bizarrely you can't change the ringtone sound notification on your phone. 

I can live with software shortcomings (and I really hope the firmware improves now that it will roll out everywhere) but if it doesn't stay permanently connected then for a doorbell that's a big issue."	119	"['TimofeyK: I have exact same issue and was going to post a new discussion when I saw yours 😀\n\n-\tUsing External power, no batteries\n-\tChime is about 5m away and reports 4-5 bars signal\n-\tAround once a day the chime loses the doorbell and can’t reconnect back.

Hi everyone,

So I'm quite new to the smart home scene and I've been reading a lot before buying every smart gadget, because I don't want to buy something without knowing if it will do I expect it to.

So the question I've been google for days now is:  
If I have a yeelight SMART FILAMENT bulb on a lamp and have a Aqara Smart Wall Switch H1 EU (With Neutral, Double Rocker) with one of the rockers free. Will I be able to make the free rocker turn on the smart light on the lamp through mi home app?

I've acknowledge that I will need an aqara hub for the wall switch and that the yeelight is compatible device with mi home. What I haven't found out is if I can program the second rocket to turn on the smart bulb in the lamp.

If not, what would you guys suggest for the same effect? What I essentially want is to have a physicals switch to turn on the lamp next to the switch that turns on the ceiling lamp(not smart)

Thanks in advance."	3	['mtn-mx: First you will need an Aqara’s Hub to add the H1, I don’t know if H1 is available to add it into Xiaomi Mi Home App i don’t see it on the list, - I know … only D1 series are shown and these series can be add it-, and H1 series works into Aqara Home App.\nAnd well about Yeelight I could not see it into Mi Home-EU server, it only appears into China server but I saw the product box and works with Mijia, Google, and HomeKit, maybe is not listed but as the box show is supported.\nAs I understand, you can add it to the free socket but it will works like a normal lightbulb controlled by your H1 but only that, to turn it on and off. If you want to change the intensity you’ll need the Mi Home App or Yeelight App (you can have both apps for example add it into Mi Home and it will appears in Yeelight App) and another choice but not sure if this lightbulb can support it is to…\nGet a Yeelight switch, there are two really nice switches:\n1) Yeelight knob wireless switch (dimmer), and wired version, in these case, wireless (Bluetooth) need a Bluetooth hub I think will be a nice option if your lightbulb supports it,\n2) Yeelight Slisaon Switch, this is a “traditional”-smart wall switch and can be configured for smart lightbulbs sending a special “signal”. you only have to rotate a screw and that’s all. Another similar product is\n3) Yeelight control remote, this can be linked to a lightbulb or lightstrip. I have this linked to Yeelight lightstrip and is very cool to control it in manually way.\n\nIf you are using HomeKit just make an automation when second rocker is press to turn on the lightbulb\n. \nSo check for these options, you can get those in AliExpress and very cheap.', 'PDuart: Will the aqara hub e1 usb dongle do the same job as the hub you mentioned?', 'mtn-mx: Mmm E1 Hub… yes and no, can be added \ninto Xiaomi china region server, but it is not listed into global servers (Europe, Americas…), for global only works into Aqara App; for Mi home App you can add the Aqara M1S (first generation) in global version.

I suppose many of you use the Aqara security system and I am willing to start a big discussion regarding how you guys use it !

What are your tips, additional automations, etc… to make it as close as possible to a professional system ?


Hopefully this discussion will become a must read for all of those who hesitate before buying an Aqara product for their security system !"	10	"['evoneselse: It’s a very good system and flexible enough with automations that can be even more customized than an installed system. Aqara stuff responds instantly and is very reliable. When Apple releases the HK update, that will enable using the HomePod intercom in shortcuts which can be used further to let’s say announce what part of the house an intrusion occurred, particularly useful in a large home. You could also use a colored light changing to signify the location.\n\nDevices are always stable and working in the manufacturer’s apps, but since iOS 16 has been a little flaky in HomeKit for some people, including me, so hopefully that will get straightened out. Aqara has been the one HK product that has been simple to set up and pair, never any issues. I do not have the system in HK mode because right now the Aqara app is always reliable whereas stuff not always responsive in the Home app, but as I said hopefully that will regain stability with the update. I never used to have issues prior.\n\nWe use the button to physically arm/disarm, or our phones. We have an automation in the Aqara app that arms automatically at night and disarms in the morning. Works like clockwork! I even have an indoor Aqara G3 camera pointing out into the back yard on a window sill (viewing through a window screen!!) and it works fantastically, detects a person and rotates to follow them. Even the pic is great! (We do have dedicated electrical outdoor cameras but just not available in the area covering that one part of our large backyard, hence this window setup). \n\nShane Whatley, Adam’s Tech Life, and Silverhammer Surveillance have given good info on YT regarding Aqara products, the first two guys with lots of automation ideas. Recommend checking them out. Aqara doesn’t have a keypad controller so it makes it a little harder for multiple family members to keep track of the arm/disarm for a family with kids coming and going at all hours, which is a reason why a family might feel another more dedicated system might better suit them after having first used Aqara. But I think for one or two people it works great and with planning could work for a larger family if they synchronize their whereabouts or maybe wall mount an iPad or some other idea.\n\nI will add, Andrew Camm on YT also has good HomeKit and Aqara videos as well.

It may be a silly question, but here it goes:

Let’s assume that the Aqara security system is armed and someone enters by a door or a window (on which there is a door/window sensor)…

And let’s assume that there is a 15 second delay before alarm goes off.

What if the burglar just closes the door within the 15 second timespan ? Does it stay armed or does it go off unless the person disarms the alarm ?

Also, I was wondering if the following would work:

If I want to have a sound played during those 15 seconds (it would be kind a very short beep sounds to remind that we are in the “entry delay” and that alarm is about to go off if I don’t disarm it, could this work:

New automation:

If door sensor opens
AND (condition): alarm mode is set on away or night 
Then play a sound for 15 seconds


Hopefully it makes sense… and if you have a better idea or suggestion, I am happy to hear it ! :-)

Thanks!



Thanks"	3	['evoneselse: Hi! It won’t disarm by itself when the door is shut. It will need to be deactivated manually.\n\nI used to have a 15 second delay upon entering but changed my mind, because if a criminal enters the house, I want the alarm to hit him immediately before he gets further inside roaming around. So if I am away, I just remember to disarm it from my phone before entering the house, or else it will sound. The Aqara button is a great way to arm and disarm your system.\n\nI never tried a sound but it will blink the light (M1S) until it is disarmed.

I'm looking for some advice for an automation. 

So here's the situation... I have a aqara door sensor on the door of my house, two aqara bulbs and the M2 hub in my living room. I've paired my TV remote to the hub, so it can turn it on and some more stuff.

What I want to do is when I open my house door (between 7.15pm and 8.30pm), the lights and tv turn on. Doing this automation is easy and it works, but the problem is..... every time I open the door during that period of time, the TV either turns off or on depending on it's current status.  


I hope I explained it well"	8	"['jamoche_2: Sounds like your TV remote command is just an on/off toggle, and I\'m assuming there\'s no way to tell if the TV is on, so you can\'t make the command conditional on that.\n\nWhat you can do instead is make it conditional on some other device whose state can be tested - so if there\'s a light that\'s only on as a result of this command, put in an ""if light is off, run command"" condition.\n\nAnother option is to use a dummy switch if your automation system supports them, or a real switch that has nothing plugged into it: include the switch in the automation and use its state in the ""if device is off, run command"" conditional.', 'This-Researcher3390: You could try an automation that when an accessory turns on that another Scene turns the first scene off?

However, I have a little issue. How can I add this device to Home Assistant? Yes, I can add it using HomeKit Controller integration. However, it exposes a camera entity that is extremely laggy and unresponsive, with poor camera quality. There is no other usable sensors that are exposed too. I do not have any Aqara hub.

&#x200B;

I would like to use the M2 alarm at night.

But I would like to see near my office (front door) a light indicator that shows a red colour when it is on (To think of taking it off when I wake up)

&#x200B;

I have thought of 5 solutions:

1. I had thought of a homekit bulb but impossible to activate the homekit hub on the iPad since 16.3.1 (Yet Apple had announced not to remove it from the iPad but not to include Matter (I don't have an Apple TV nor a homepod)  ❌

Others have this problem?

&#x200B;

2) Buy the M1S for colour but I already have 3 M2 Hubs (Infrared heating management), I'm not going to add one more. ❌

&#x200B;

3) Buy a 5/12v hexagonal light pad and put it on an Aqara plug socket ✅

(If night alarm on = Socket on) (Can also be used as a warning light when opening a sensor)

&#x200B;

4) Found a RGB Zigbee lamp that I could add to the M2 HUB but I don't know if I could control it via Aqara. ❓

&#x200B;

5) Found a lamp with an infrared remote control that the HUB could handle ❓

&#x200B;

Do you have an idea?

Thank you"	2	['Academic_Strike85: I use 2 pool lights on batteries, that can be controlled by the M2 via IR.', 'Icy-Preference1216: Thx']

2. After setting schedules and coming back to the screen listing 3 available schedules switches activating schedules are always in ""off"" position. There's also no summary of schedule displayed on this screen. It seems like schedules are reset or ignored after leaving the screen.

It can\'t end on e.g. ""6AM next day"" as it used to. It\'s worth noting, that last temperature setting is kept and can be carried over to the next day. So, for example, if your schedule ends at 22:00 with a temp of 20°C and the schedule starts at 6AM with 22°C then from 22:00 to 6:00 of the next day the temperature would be set to 20°C. Second thing: Same days can\'t be selected in any of the three available schedules even if they are deactivated. So if you set one schedule for ""every day"" you just can\'t use other schedules. If you set a schedule from Monday to Saturday then you can only use Sunday in the other schedule. Etc... I had the same problem as you. I could not figure out why I can\'t set one schedule for weekdays (mo-fri) and a second one for weekend (sat-sun). That was because there were some days selected in the third , inactive, schedule.

I’ve only tried this with thr G2H, so I can’t guarantee this 100% for all hubs, but I see no reason why it shouldn’t be the case.

If you want to keep the cameras on the US server you could just buy a separate hub solely for the Chinese server. Hubs on separate servers can’t see each other, so you can’t use automations on one server to control or trigger devices on another server, but that’s the beauty of HomeKit in that it sees everyone equally.']

To say it's been a frustrating experience is an understatement.  I am unable to pair either of my two wall switches with the hub.   I've had the hub right beside the switch as well as a medium distance and also a far distance.  I have reset the hub numerous times, powered off the switches multiple times and I just can't get them to pair.  I've tried both an account and in HomeKit mode and with an Aqara account.  I am on the US servers.

Does anyone have any ideas on how I can get these bloody switches joined?  I have a ton of computer and electrical experience and this is the most frustrating thing I've dealt with for a very long time.

Does the lightbulb get the Line wire from the switch?\nIs the neutral wire a neutral wire?\nMmm… Also last week I had problems adding my D1 switch, one afternoon I was trying to add it from the App and “error” was always showing on the screen, so I just turned off my iPhone and turn it on after few minutes, I disconnected the M1S for a minute next day  I tried to add the D1 neutral switch from the Aqara Home App and was possible, also added another and two D1 no neutral, same happens with 3 E1 switches one neutral and two no neutral; I really don’t know what was that problem, by the way, I could connect the switches in manually way (pressing 3 times the hub’s button) except for the E1 that is not listed but has I had nothing interesting to do LOL I selected into the app as H1 and worked LOL then added as E1. Maybe was a network connection problem or something in the Aqara’s servers. So I found your walls are made of plaster so signal must be strong than brick walls, try to turn off-on disconnect and re-connect after a while your phone and hub and try later maybe works. I forgot to mention I’m in USA server but I opened ‘Others server’ is the same server but in Others appears more devices.', 'wks-rddt: You have option to either switch out your wall boxes which are blocking the radio antenna signal or hacking into the switch (not easy) to extend the onboard antenna into an external one.

It's not joined to the network, not visible in the app.  You press the  button on the hub and it just changes colour and eventually turns a solid red.

I need a little help with the IR blaster on the M2 Hub...

The Tv Box doesn't have a brand (it's just from Vodafone Portugal) so I have to make a custom remote for it. And that's when I can't add any button from the remote.

(or any other non EU switch for that matter)	EnzoEsc	1	11n2pz9	Aqara	https://www.reddit.com/r/Aqara/comments/11n2pz9/220v_wsusc02_or_any_other_non_eu_switch_for_that/	"Hi, for context, I'm from Chile. Here we use 220v just like in Europe, but our switch boxes look nothing like that. In Europe they seem to be very square, while here they're rectangular, kinda similar to the ones in the US, but not quite the same. I'm not very sure if the EU ones would be supported. This is what a switch would typically look like in Chile: [https://sodimac.scene7.com/is/image/SodimacCL/6226981\_12?wid=1500&hei=1500&qlt=70](https://sodimac.scene7.com/is/image/SodimacCL/6226981_12?wid=1500&hei=1500&qlt=70) (they tend to be vertical rather than horizontal, but you get the idea).

The thing is I was looking for a smart switch and a store here in Chile sells the WS-USC02 claiming that it is 220v. It states that they have sold over 25 units and I don't think they would work if they were 110v, they would probably be fried or something. So I wanted to ask if this does in fact exist, an American style switch that works at 220v, if it is a different version or if the same one always worked at both voltages. Since I'm not 100% sure the European ones would work (or fit), this is my next best option.

Is Smartthings platform the best?	spvn	4	11lynxq	Aqara	https://www.reddit.com/r/Aqara/comments/11lynxq/using_many_aqara_devices_with_samsung_tv_and/	"I'm thinking of using mostly Aqara devices (e.g. H1 switches, curtain motor, motion sensor, smart light bulb), but also want to use other manufacturer products like a Samsung TV and Google Nest doorbell and a few Yeelights. Would smartthings be the best option for the centralised platform? Alongside google home for voice recognition and some automations?

I know there're issues with Smartthings discontinuing Groovy and Edge drivers being hit or miss. But it still seems like the most ""open"" platform in terms of device compatibility + usability. I might move to HA in the future but want something easier to set up first...

Is anybody else running devices from so many manufacturers as well? How do you deal with integrating them and automations?"	1	['arafhunter: HomeKit with Homebridge.']

&#x200B;

I have an Aqara door/window sensor that I'd like to repurpose for a specific security use-case.

I do not have an Aqara Hub or any kind of ZigBee hub.

I have an AppleTV 4K (my main hub for my home automation devices) - and I use HomeKit quite a lot.

I also have a Samsung TV which has a built in SmartThings Hub that I've set up quite a while ago. I mostly make use of HomeKit, but SmartThings seems to work good as well.

Now Samsung gives you a notice on the TV that if you want to communicate with ZigBee devices you'll need the dongle.  My Meross Garage door controller picks up and works just fine with my Samsung TV SmartThings hub. So I figured what the heck I don't need a ZigBee dongle or whatever.

Anyways, it turns out maybe I do if I want to make use of this Aqara Door Sensor. Or do I? Any way to use this door sensor with either HomeKit or the SamrtThings hub built into my Samsung Q70B TV or will I need an Aqara or Zigbee Hub?

I have the the aqara app on android + hub m1s + mini switch button + door sensor and I'm trying to make a simple disarming function.  


I enter my flat and it triggers the ""*alarm scene*"": if door sensor switch to open, then the hub on volume 10, delay for 10 sec (this serves as a queue to remind me that I have to disarm), then hub on volume 100.  
Now I want to use manually the mini switch in the 10 sec delay that I have hidden somewhere in my flat, to prevent the hub to go to the 100 volume but I can't seem to make the idea work.  
I tried:

1. if switch press long > disable ""*alarm scene*"". Doesn't work. It appears that once a scene is triggered, it has to run until it's end.
2. I changed a bit the ""*alarm scene*"" as following: if door sensor to open, then hub volume 10 then delay sec then enable scene ""*2nd alarm scene*"". The ""*2nd alarm scene*"" is: if ""*alarm scene*"" is enabled then alarm volume 100. And I used the long press as a disabler of ""*2nd alarm scene*"". Doesn't work also. The issue this time is that I see that the ""*2nd alarm scene* "" status changed to emabled in the app, but it never leads to volume 100 (I also tried to replace volume 100 with a push alarm notification, doesn't work also).

Does anyone ever tried to do something like that or has any idea to try?

I took the first one back as I thought there was something wrong with it as audio in and out of the doorbell would stop working via both HomeKit and the Aqara App after a few hours. Thought it was a hardware issue. 

The brand new replacement also exhibits the same issue. Another issue I’ve noticed is that while this happens the doorbell also fails to detect any movement.  The only way to fix both is to unplug and plug back in the chime. Given the chime is where all the processing happens I suspect rebooting it fixes the issues  

Having to restart the chime so frequently is a deal breaker. I hope this is fixed in firmware ASAP or I’ll be taking it back.

M2 and M1S hub. It’s all in HomeKit too but not HomeKit mode. Today when I was away I pulled up the Aqara app and it said the network was abnormal. Nothing showed in it at all. When I got home, everything was back and shown normally, making it seem as though it went back online when I got home. 

Which leads me to ask: Does this system not function when we are out of the home’s Wi-Fi range? I can’t imagine unless it is not being able to access the internet or what would have caused this. I want to be able to access or view things when not at home, and of course be notified if there were any trouble going on at home.

I have a large house so these are split over 2 Hubs (G3Pro and E1 Hubs) which for starters dont communicate in that you can’t have split rooms, radiators sensors across hubs. Then there is the manual vs scheduled vs Group settings. When does one override the other, if you make a manual adjustment does the schedule then overrule at the next scheduled event etc etc.  The answer by my testing is that is inconsistent hence why I ask them questions. The answers either dont tally with my experience or aren’t adequately answered.  Its good when it works but having no group schedule seems lacking to me as I want room control not just each radiator. 5 of my rooms have 2 radiators in. Often after a manual override (using group) one radiator in the group (of 2) will revert back to schedule that other doesn’t!  I kind of have it working with Apple Home Automations controlling a Nest Thermostat but as thats in one room I have to manually manage other rooms or override with the Nest to heat other rooms…. Still a work in progress, just wish the E1s were more consistent. Mine is further complicated by having installed their Temperature sensors in each room rather than relying on the built in E1 temperature sensor.  Main reason is that most Radiators are in cupboards so I need independent room temperature not whats in the cabinet.   As per screen shots I now end up after last update with some on 0930 and  a few on 1030 and show errors when trying to edit schedules so its now pretty useless.  I have mailed them and await a response. Hope this helps.']"

I'm not concerned about the shipping time but I am concerned that these ""global versions"" are not the same as the ones available on my more commonly used e-commerce sites (and will result in negative effect on my setup).  This is especially the case as there are some items on Ali Express (labeled ""global version"") that aren't even available on my usual sites.

From what I read while googling I think that the setup I have should work even when away from home..

Since I didn't really notice *when* the behavior started to occur I haven't gotten a good gauge for battery life and the Aqara app just reports 100% all the time.

With that in mind, has Aqara published any guidelines on battery life?

a friend of mine asked me to help him build a simple alarm system based on some kind of IoT, and I have been thinking about using Aqara sensors for that.

The idea is that the house they live in has three floors. They want to get an alert on their smartphones (all of them use iPhones, if that is important) if someone will be detected moving near the entrance or the stairs. I thought about buying Aqara Camera Hub G3 to monitor everyone coming by the main entrance and 2 P1 Motion sensors to detect intruders near the stairs.

They also wanted to have some kind of Siren to wake them up from sleep if someone will be detected. I know Aqara doesn't make Sirens, but I thought about plugging a simple plug connected siren to Aqara Smart Plug.

Is it possible to make something like that and arm/disarm the alarm system from an app on their smartphones? As much as I work in IT myself, IoT is completely not my cup of tea and I have absolutely no idea if this is going to work. Any piece of advice would be greatly appreciated! :)

Better but also limited approach is to use window/door sensor. Then you can trigger alarm with M1S hub, it has speaker.\nAlso you can stop/start the alarm from AqaraHome.\n\nThe big problem of this configuration is the power and the net access for the hub. You will need a UPS like device and have to connect the hub and the router in it. It will be great to have router with option for two Internet sources. For example normal lan cable and in case of problem with the lan, some wireless, cellular access.\n\nThis is how I see it. May be I miss something, so let someone else confirm.\n\nRegards!', 'Fookes74: Firstly imho, Aqara products are superb and super responsive - excellent of course for a security system. Assuming that the devices you’re looking at are fully HomeKit compatible you could setup some automations in the Home app to trigger playing an audible alarm (or whatever chosen sound) through a HomePod. This solution would obv require a HomePod and an active Apple Music subscription. \n\nAlternatively, you could use door/window sensors in conjunction with a camera (all from Aqara) to trigger the Aqara hub alarm system (programmable through the Aqara app). It’s pretty easy to setup something like that but I’d be happy to offer some further guidance if needed.\n\nYou can also (if they use something like Homebridge) automate the arming and disarming of the security system based on location. This would require the open source Homebridge program running on a pc or SBC like a raspberry pi along with a dummy switch plugin to circumnavigate the requirement to have to manually ‘okay’ the automation running. \n\nMy Aqara Hubs all arm when the last person leaves home and disarm when the first person comes back. Nothing needs to be pressed - it just does it automatically. \n\nHope some of this makes sense and helps a bit.', 'evoneselse: We use an M2 hub connected to its Ethernet port, and an M1S hub for the siren. Door sensors, the Aqara button to arm and disarm , but can also do that with the iPhones. Very simple and responsive, works every time. Along with HomeKit you can also get creative with automations to fine tune the way you want it to work. We have night mode set to arm and disarm automatically at certain hours so we never would forget. Everything necessary here including the router is plugged into UPS battery backups with barely any draw, so a power outage would keep them running for hours. One camera is facing a back door as a trigger at night and when away (along with the door sensor), and another facing the yard and windows; both set to monitor humans at night. When the doorbell is available we will get that too. Our house isn’t huge but has basement and two floors above and works fine, good signal throughout. YMMV though.', 'mtn-mx: Hi, first a 3 floors sounds like my home, the basic problem you will have is the Zigbee’s signal, so to have a great signal, you could add some: Single Switch model T1 with Neutral, to extend the signal and you can connect these T1 into the light switches to make smart too, also with T1 you can connect the Siren, siren works with DC but you can make a connection for the outlet where the AC-DC converter is plugged and to make an Automation to turn the outlet on when Alarm system will detects intrusions.\nAbout sensors well there are a lot, Door and window sensor, Motion sensor, Motion sensor P1, Vibration sensor…\nAs the other comment describe consider to get a UPS for the camera hub and the siren, and don’t activate the camera movement sensor because if a light reflects into the Home (example a car passing in the night, shadows from people from the street) it is going to be interpreting like  movement, it happens in all cameras.\nYour diagram is nice and just consider how signal will be in the 3rd floor, only -Neutral- devices acts like Zigbee signal repeaters (switches, outlets).', 'Academic_Strike85: In addition to what everybody already suggested, I have an ASUS 4G-AC86U router (it has integrated 4G SIM internet backup), powered by a 2000VA UPS with 2 deep cycle 12V 35Ah external batteries. The M1S hub (AKA ""the siren"") is also powered by the UPS. With such a low load, the UPS can stay off grid for days. For comparison, each camera has a 650VA UPS, but the batteries are not deep cycle (7Ah small batteries). This kind of UPS only lasts for 2 hours with the wifi router connected to it.', ""Kreativ2121: Of course I will use some door sensors, mainly for the main glass door entrance from the garden and the main entrance.

On it you can insert mini sim cart router, I own such device. It is an old Huawei router, similar to a pen drive.

After much research i have decided to use apple homekit and Aqara ecosystem in my new bto home. But i am stuck between choosing to go with everything from Taobao (Cn Region) or purchase everything locally in singapore (Global region) i also do understand that if i mix and match from both region then i will have to do alot of manual pairing and alot won't show up in my homekit.  


Reason for considering buying from Taobao (Cn Region) Global version does not have/support Smart magic switch and dimmer switch and some other child devices so for my home ambience lighting i cannot dim it and have to look at other smart lighting (eg. Yeelight) that supports homekit also for smart lighting i have to get a normal switch which i don want to mixed my switch for aesthetic reason.

Need some advices from all the tech guru here before making a decision.   
1. If i use china region I'm worried that one day apple will just ban china region in my country and the whole ecosystem in my house will be a problem.  


2. What other issues do i need to consider if i use china region.  


3. If i buy the dimmer switch from Aqara (Cn region) will i be able to dim normal lighting or i have to also purchase Aqara lighting in order to dim it? How about if i install the Aqara magic panel what issues will it have?  


Thank you guys"	13	"[""wks-rddt: Choose the hub you are (1) comfortable with using and (2) supports the devices you need by default instead of finding some hacky way to do it .... not to say you can't but its just easier especially for one starting out with a smart home.\n\nHighly unlikely apple will ever ban CN (unless they can source their manufacturing elsewhere) but even if they do, the devices will still run on homekit albeit with possible features not accessible - this is not aqara's fault but homekit because the current API library does not provide advanced configurations. For other home systems is a different case (ie alexa, google, ifttt) because they are cloud based and run via the aqara API - if the aqara side is blocked then say goodbye to those services too. Matter for smarthomes is a different animal altogether but is currently not worth mentioning as the rollout is basically a near disaster. This may (hopefully) change in the future so I'll leave it at that\n\nLast note, AFAIK aqara does not have any dimmer switches - only a smart knob that you can assign functions to.

Reached out to Aqara’s support which send back a baffling reply: “So it is normal the G2H pro was triggered by its own sound” :)) They say everything above 85dB will turn on the “abnormal sound detected” condition. As a workaround, I lowered the camera volume to 25%, so it doesn’t get picked up.

But I think I prefer the variety of China devices and I have yet to buy any hub.

My question is, if I want to use China Server with China Devices and the EU switches that I have already bought, what should I do?

1. Do I buy China Hub and select China Server to pair with all my EU switches? Does it work?
2. Do I buy EU Hub and pair with EU switches but select China Server? I am afraid this doesn't allow me to add China Devices, can anyone help to clarify?
3. It doesn't work, since I have EU switches, I must be using EU Hub and no option to use China Server and China Devices

Due to many possible combinations, I'm simplifying to just CN and non-CN hubs working with CN and non-CN child devices. Non-CN devices would be those listed as international/global/US/EU all lumped together for now. As for servers, I only categorise for linking to CN or non-CN region - varying success may apply if using different servers aside from CN.\n\n1) Most child devices will pair with any CN hub. Select (i.e. recent and upcoming) child devices meant for CN region will not pair with non-CN hubs ... but with an exception, see below\n\n2) CN hubs will only work with CN server in aqara app. CN hubs will not usually work with other servers in  the aqara app\n\n3) Non-CN hubs will usually work with CN server in aqara app. When paired it will work as if it were a CN hub - have yet to test this with a non-CN hub, attached to CN server, to try pairing with non-CN child devices though ... so YMMV here 🤔\n\n4) Child devices that do not pair with a hub via the app (resulting in a region error) could possibly be paired using manual pairing mode BUT devices won't appear in the app. This process is not foolproof and certain devices will also fail with manual pairing. If successful, binding to Homekit usually still works as that goes through your aqara hub and local home hub but anything involving cloud services (i.e. IFTTT, Alexa, GoogleHome etc) will fail as the devices are not listed in the aqara app. This also means any advanced configuration and/or settings will not be available in the aqara app for any of the platforms."", 'diskobbbox: You don’t have to buy another hub.

If it’s a one way switch there would normally one be one and it should be marked with some tape (it isn’t always) isn’t always one wire though if the switch feeds multiple light fittings. Com is the common I.e the live coming in from your consumer unit. There may be multiple looping in and out to feed other lights.\n\nThere’s a lot of copper exposed there. The insulation should go right up to the plastic, to avoid the risk of a short.\n\nThe earth or CPC should be wired to Backbox lug if it’s a plastic switch like in the picture. if it had a metal faceplate you would need to wire the CPC to the lug on the faceplate.\n\nMake sure you have isolated the circuit and tested it once whilst live to check your test kit is working and it’s showing it’s live and then again when dead to ensure the circuit is dead before you touch it.\n\nWhen you have isolated the switch and Live to Neutral is showing as dead also test between live and earth and neutral and earth. Sometimes you can find you have a ‘borrowed’ neutral so while the circuit for downstairs lighting is dead someone used the neutral from the downstairs lighting circuit along with the live from say the upstairs circuit to feed a light. This would mean it would show as dead between live and neutral but there would actually be 240v on the neutral due to it being fed from another circuit. \n\nBest thing to do if you aren’t sure is just turn everything off at the consumer unit whilst you are working on it rather than just that single circuit. Still test it’s dead though.\n\nIf you really aren’t sure though,  it’s best to get an electrician in, 240v hurts and might cost you your life.\n\nThere is a nice diagram at the link below \n\nhttps://www.diynot.com/diy/threads/switched-live-sleeving-when-looping-at-switch.526823/?utm_content=cmp-true', 'mtn-mx: Be very very careful, to the left: what are those 2 wires?

It seems Matter updates have been met with differing experiences—some good, some not—but realize it’s still in its infancy. I just don’t want to bog down my already good system with Matter when I don’t need Matter (i.e. if it actually would get bogged down), but I don’t want to freeze my system and miss out on bug fix/firmware updates either.

So, will the Matter part of these updates ONLY take effect if you click that switch in the app to update all things to Matter, meaning it is OK to install updates but just never convert to Matter? Or does having them update to Matter not slow things or introduce problems? Thanks!"	1	['wks-rddt: So far the Matter update is independent of the regular updates. When done hubs appear as a separate device. As to whether it will affect performance of the hub is hard to say but there was always more than enough cpu power on the hub to handle the load - it was mostly just a network capacity issue.']

I have set up the Aqara Hub M1S and the new Cube to use it as a toggle for the Sonos  system: if side 3 is up one certain Playlist is supposed to be played. If flipped to another side of the cube, the Playlists switches to another. 

Here is the problem: when the cube is moved, another track is played but the Playlist doesn't change. Instead, Sonos/Spotify adds the whole new Playlist to the play queue. Each time the cube is moved, more and more songs are added to the queue. I tested with a movement sensor as well. When I replace the Cube with another sensor the same issue accures.

Is that a known issue? Do you think it's a setting I can change either in Sonos or Spotify or Aqara? 
It's kind of the only reason I bought the Cube and I hope it can be fixed. Thank you in advance!

Edit: It's the Cube T1 Pro of course"	1	['Capable-Brick-5791: Never used a cube but could it be possible you have to select something like “stop playing” or “clear queue” then change playlist. I’m currently having some fun with the “delay” on the Aqara switches']

Aqara hubs are really great, i can’t compare Aqara hub with Hue or IKEA hubs because into Aqara you can add sensors, lights, switches, outlets and more; hue only works with light products, maybe IKEA has some products but I think real difference could be the price of the hub and devices, Aqara has great quality products and great prices.\n2.

Soon M3 hub will be released and this will be the first 100% MATTER device to add any matter devices from any brands but could be available in march or in the middle of the year. Then, M1S 2nd gen. It is only  Zigbee 3.0 hub, with a light and nice speaker, you can add to this personal sounds.\nAnother choice is the G3 camera also is a hub, has IR control too and personal sounds.\nAbout connection M2 can be connected by Ethernet to have a more stable connection, M1S and G3 are only wireless, M2 and M1S 2.4 GHz but G3 supports 5GHz Wi-Fi\n3. Very nice quality and cheap products, I have global devices and Chinese devices all very very nice; my experience is really great and my favorite brand for smart home.\nGlobal devices are compatible with HomeKit, Google Home and Alexa.

I want to turn my house smart as I am not and after searching long and wide for the best options, Aqara will most likely be my choice but I still have some questions. In general my idea is to control lights, blinds and door lock. Everything based on apple's homekit app.

For lights, correct me if I am wrong, I'll be done with Aqara T1 Relay, correct? I want to keep my switches as they are black. My only question regarding lights, is that I would like to have 2 hallways lights (indoor) light up with sensors. The only Aqara motion sensor that I can find is a bit bulky and not so smart looking. Is that the only one or are there more options?

For the doorlock, I think Aqara N100 Zigbee Edition will do everything I want to.

For blinds I have no solution. I'm not talking about regular blinds (inside blinds like curtains). I want those also but Aqara has the Roller Shade Controller that would fit just fine. I'm talking about the house blinds itself (I cannot find the write word in English for it, so here is a picture of what I'm talking about: [https://www.janelasdiafanas.pt/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/banner-mobile-estores.jpg](https://www.janelasdiafanas.pt/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/banner-mobile-estores.jpg) ). Well those are electric and I can't find anywhere if Aqara T1 Relay can deal with it. I know that Shelly 2.5 can, but I was hoping to have everything Aqara. Are they capable? If not, is there a solution within the Aqara range that you guys suggest or any other option?

Finally, Aqara Hub M2: Do I need an Aqara Hub for everything to work? Or is this and add on? I'm asking this because, since I want everything to be connected within Apple homekit, I plan to get both an Apple TV and a Home POD. Is the Aqara Hub M2 an overkill? Or is it better than the Home POD?

Well, I think thats it. Thank you so much for anyone that can help me and guide me, because after weeks of looking at every options I'm more confused than ever. Cheers from Portugal!"	14	"['mtn-mx: Hello, yes you need an Aqara hub to control many of Aqara’s products as they work with Zigbee protocol, and your Apple TV will work as Home’s hub to let you control devices when you are away home using the Home App from iPhone iPad or Mac.\nBy now M2 is available and soon there will be available the new hub M3 that will support MATTER protocol, this is available now for M2 too but M3 will have more functionalities.\nThere are many products from Aqara also for Curtains but for global market just a few, in China there are lots of curtains motors but you have to have a Chinese hub to get support (these are available in AliExpress).\nAbout sensors are nice check description in Aqara website.', 'jugestylz: the aqara motion sensor is the smallest one on the market. it’s a tiny little sensor for a tiny little price. i think the aqara hub e1 should be enough. the m2 has ethernet and can transmit ir signals, the m1s has a good alarm system build in, the e1 is only a hub. if you consider to use cameras in your home you go best with an aqara camera hub (g2h, g2h pro or g3), yes, a camera with build in hub functionality. so you don’t need an extra hub. so every aqara hub has its own benefit. i got the e1 and m1s, two because i got more than the 32 child devices one hub can handle and i needed an alarm system. for lightning i’m a fan of philips hue, a bit expensive, i know, but it works and doesn’t fill up your wifi like other wifi bulbs do. and it’s totally homekit compatible (spoiler alarm: you will get addicted to hue). for roller shades i’m in with meross. i needed some with up/down/stop functionalities and the meross ones are the only ones with homekit compatibility. i got a boiler/water heated  underfloor heating system. and meross has the solution for this too. so my homekit is a combination of aqara, hue and meross. and it’s fine. no issues. by the way i’m a lucky one who never had any issues with homekit or homepods or siri. i tried to make a simple smart home with homekit and for me this combination of the three (aqara, hue, meross) was the best and simplest solution. sensors, cameras, buttons and stuff: aqara. lightning: hue. shades and heating: meross.

 I'm looking for a good homekit compatible alarm and I've heard great things about aqara. I’m evaluating Ring too but it’s not so flexible and there’s no way to put it in silent mode (this is RIDICOLOUS!).
 I have a few questions for you:
 - I have a 3kg cat, can this be a problem?  I don't read any specifics about pets. This thing is essential for the motion sensors to work properly
 - how can I let a guest in without me disabling the alarm remotely?
 - how can I connect a siren to the system?
 - with a UPS connected to the router should it work correctly in the event of a blackout?
 Which hub do you recommend?  there are too many alternatives and I don't understand the advantages.  Since I also need a camera, but I can’t connect it to my ups for location issues.

Thank you!"	2	['mtn-mx: Well all motions sensors will detect pets movements LOL I have 2 cats and when they hide that’s the way to know where they are in the house LOL but when I use movements sensors into the Alarm system mode that’s a problem so I configured and put other devices to set control. \n2. There are alarms modes: Away home, in Home, night mode. off. You can set how they work and to select devices do every one mode. \n3. You can connect a siren 🚨 using a relay there are 2 models the “old” 2 channels relays that is like a switch or the new one the T1 only for one channel but these works with AC 110-230V I think sirens works with DC but a connection to the power converter can be made to make it “smart”. (Also you can use these relays to make any traditional switch and lights, fans even outlet to go  smart.\n4. Yes also to power the hub with UPS, but any non wireless’s devices -wired- will lose power. All sensors will work as they have their own battery.', 'evoneselse: If you buy the M1S hub it has an alarm built in. You only need to configure what you want to trigger it (night mode, away mode).\n\nYou would have to disable it remotely for a guest, or let him/her know where your disarm switch / button is to disarm / arm it manually. \n\nAqara is native HomeKit whereas Ring is not, so would need a bridge.\n\nYes pets will trigger a motion detector unless you try it high up and test it for a while (to see if your cat sets it off) before letting it be an alarm trigger.']

I believe you will not have them, which automatically means that you need to buy the switch without neutral.\n\nI did the same mistake after buying my apartment a few months ago - I unscrew one switch, noticed neutral and I decided to buy many devices from China with neutral. Guess who has now switches with neutral in his cupboard which are never going to be used and noone want to buy them...\n\nAs far as I read, the good thing about the switches / relays versions without the neutral is that you can use it even if your home have the neutral cable. So no neutral switches are more universal.', 'mtn-mx: A picture can’t describe if it is wrong or right. Looks like blue y neutral and brown for power but colors could be “right” but electrical power on these in a wrong way.\nFirst you need to be sure if Blue wire is Neutral and to identify witch one of the Browns is the Hot-Line wire. You need a voltage tester to identify how every wire is working. \nThere are another wires, (L1, L2, L3) are these wires going directly to the light? each one must HAVE NOT any load, every wire of these will send the power to the light.\nCheck if your light originally were controlled by single way switch.', ""nichewidgets: Test that is actually a neutral -it's likely to be. Just put a lamp in a bulbholder if you don't have a tester and see it if lights across a Live and the neutral. Returning tracked to Aliexpress will likely cost a stupid amount, so best to list it on ebay. if it is a neutral - then connect the switch to a basic fuxed plug and make sure it actually works - prob do that anyway."", 'HuJohner: Need help troubleshooting why this triple rocker (with neutral) doesn’t work. It is flashing red quickly so according to manual is a overload / overheat warning. Not sure what is wrong.\n\nTop has three cables coming down A,B,C and bottom one cable with the live wire coming up.\nConnected it like this: brown B, brown A, brown C, brown bottom, all blue\n\n\nGot the triple rocker from AliExpress as EU/UK doesn’t have triple rocker.', 'HuJohner: UPDATE:\n\nAs it turns out the switch was faulty. They sent me a new one for free and it is working perfectly. Thanks everyone for the help!', 'mtn-mx: With a Voltage tester, it will show you 0V or a very very small voltage (is any electrical device is working). Wiring color’s code seems to be right, so, a brown wire will be the power line (L) the other 3 browns must have not load ( 0 ).', 'Rookie_42: Does the switch itself specify that it should work with 240v systems?  This is UK, right?\n\nWhile it’s not common to have a neutral in light switch boxes in the UK, it is starting to appear. I’m guessing this is a relatively recent build home or at least wiring. \n\nIf the blue wires were carrying current (live), they should have a brown sleeve over them. But… never trust that the electrician has done it correctly, always test.  That said, it certainly looks like you do have neutral here. Especially since you have 4 cables for three switches. \n\nDid you take a photo of what it looked like before you started?  Were all the blue wires connected together at that point?  If so, that is further evidence they are neutral (but not proof). \n\nThe most likely I can think is that the switch doesn’t support 240v.  If a US model, it might only allow 110/120v.\n\nEDIT:  the other possibility is that the lights you have it connected to are a greater total wattage than the switch will support. You’ll need to check all the specifications and the ratings of all your bulbs.', 'Academic_Strike85: Being a switch that needs a neutral, the switch LEDs would not light up if the neutral wire would not be connected. So, from the OP picture, blue seems to be neutral. However, the second picture is proof that the circuit does not need a neutral, as the neutral already comes down through the light bulbs (think of the L1-3 wires that come from the bulbs as being blue with some resistance).', 'HuJohner: How do I identify the blue is neutral? I mean it looks like it is and it is code but how can I verify?\n\nI have identified hot (bottom brown) with a mains tester. The L1-3 don’t carry load and go to the light.\n\nThe original light switch was a single way switch (well three single way switches)', 'misiek735: Also, which brown cable has 220v and which one does not have it? Only the cable which gives 220v should be connected to L, all the other cables should not have 220v, if they do they should not be connected to L1 / L2 / L3', 'misiek735: Because from what I see, the yellow/green cable should be the neutral, but without checking the cables myself I am not sure.', ""misiek735: Did you do the photo how the cables were connected to the normal switch before changing to aqara? I don't think the connection you did is correct."", 'HuJohner: Right I don’t have one on hand but with my simple mains tester the light doesn’t turn on so can I assume it is neutral?', 'HuJohner: This is a good point I am not sure. The switch is from China so likely 220v… could this be the issue?\n\nIt’s not a new build but the kitchen was redone recently and I am fairly sure it is neutral. Yes the blues were connected together\n\nRegarding the bulbs being too much wattage: I tried just connecting one of the lights so I doubt it’s that?', 'HuJohner: Hm… then what do you reckon is the blue wire coming out of the same cable? Like cable A has a brown, blue and yellow/green (and so do B, C and the bottom cable)', 'HuJohner: Brown coming from bottom so the second from right', 'HuJohner: Yellow/green is ground', 'Aggressive-Matter-25: Yellow/green is earth ground, the breaker will trip if it is connected to any terminal of the switch (it will be connected to life)!', 'HuJohner: [Here](https://i.imgur.com/RfcsZt2.jpg)\n\nIt had the bottom brown connected to the top of one of the switches and then chained them to the top of the other two switches.

I’d only be concerned if it was 110/120 ish.  However, it’s best to check the rating on the unit itself. This should be written on the unit somewhere, as a regulatory requirement (depending on the market it was intended for)… and just because China use 220 themselves, doesn’t mean it’s rated at their voltage if, for example, it was destined for the US market. \n\nI was going to say about the load, but you appear to have already done what I would have suggested. \n\nFailing the above, it could simply be a faulty unit.', ""Academic_Strike85: The blue is neutral, for sure (as long as the switch only works with blue cable connected). But the circuit of the bulbs doesn't need it (per your second picture)."", ""wks-rddt: Might be mistaken, but looking at your picture it seems your original fixtures could possibly be wired without neutrals so you can't connect them this way - unless the original blue wire was also connected to the switch somehow but cannot be seen in this pic."", ""misiek735: Well, looking at this photo I don't see the blue (neutral) wire connected.

So it is all working apart from the actual switching. I don’t think the device would turn on if the blue wires weren’t neutral… so is this a defective unit?', 'HuJohner: I see. So because the circuit of the bulbs doesn’t need the neutral the switch won’t work? I would need a no neutral version?', 'HuJohner: Yeah the original switch didn’t require neutral but I saw the neutral cables in there so I (mistakenly) assumed that I could use the neutral version. Is there anything I can do with this switch now or should I try and return it?', 'HuJohner: Right so the problem is that neutral shouldn’t be connected? If that is the case is there anything I can do or will the switch only work if I have a neutral connected?', 'Rookie_42: I agree… I think you’re right. So yeah, it seems to me it’s faulty.', ""Academic_Strike85: I have no experience with no-neutral switches, as I built my home electrical system WITH neutral wires for every switch I have. So, I can't say how the no-neutral switch would behave, because I can't guess where the returning wire from the light bulbs goes to. In theory, the returning wire should be connected to neutral (it should be blue) - but, also, you should be able to see it right beside the brown wires. In that case, the switch should work just fine..."", ""wks-rddt: Possible reasons is that (1) you don't actually have neutrals hence thats why originally the devices are wired without them or (2) the neutral line(s) are not wired up correctly in the switch box.

Feels somehow more like the conversation was useful. :)', 'Academic_Strike85: Yes, there should be a blue wire coming down from every light bulb BUT should be un-interrupted.', ""wks-rddt: Possibly you have both your brown and blue lines are actually live connections but intended for different areas of the house - lazy (and possibly dangerous) way to quickly wire up multiple areas of the house with just a single cable and then using the wire where necessary to connect to the fixtures which then all lead back to a common neutral. Thus when you wire up both the brown and blue lines you are actually feeding two live connections into the switch, overloading it ..... but I'm guessing here, you'd need to test on your side to confirm this."", 'HuJohner: It most definitely was! Because of this I was confident enough to insist on a resend/refund rather than accepting it may have been my fault', 'HuJohner: Uninterrupted meaning?

It seems to me that the switch interrupts the blues. Can't see very well..."", ""wks-rddt: Ok then it might be they aren't connected to begin with ...

1) As far as I know it’s using HKSV but don’t know how to check that other than seeing events on the timeline in the Home app and assuming they are from the Apple server.

2) I have read where it’s good to also have a microSD card for playback and extra features but was vague beyond that statement. Is a micro SD really needed and for what purpose? 

b) if a card is inserted, does the camera now  default to using the card instead of HKSV?

c) if this card is beneficial, can it be used in addition to HKSV, and not replace HKSV?

3) The manual says the red ring will light red when it’s recording. Mine is always red! 

By looking at the timeline feed in the Home app it doesn’t show continuous recorded events, and although I see the time moving, it is not recording.

4) Every time I click on its device card in Aqara or the Home app, it records and I have to hit pause. I only want it to record when it is triggered by seeing a human which is what I have set up as options.

Any other tips are welcome!

Thank you!"	3	['Round_Blacksmith_369: If SD inserted it will simultaneously record HKSV and locally.', 'evoneselse: Then SD (locally) playback would be retrieved via the Aqara app not home app, right?', 'Round_Blacksmith_369: Yes. Unfortunately SD is not supported by HomeKit yet.']

Sound is good and in testing my partner had no issue hearing me and I could hear her very clearly. Video quality is good however I noticed that night vision doesn’t light up the area as much as my Eufy did so this might be a downgrade. Can still easily make out people so might be a bit more focussed IR Led array rather than a more spread out array in the Eufy. One gripe I had is that I couldn’t update the firmware through Apple Home I’m still stuck using the Aqara app, further Apple Home won’t give you anything like connection quality so you’re reliant on the Aqara app for that a as well if you need to troubleshoot where to place the indoor unit (which I had to).

If you wanted to use Google Home, basically all of their nest hubs are Matter Controllers, which is also the case with Alexa devices (apart from maybe the oldest Echo Dots). The Matter update for the M2 doesn’t make it a Matter controller, just a hub that is Matter compatible. This is the same as the (beta) Matter update for the Hue Bridge, which still uses Zigbee to talk to its child devices, but then uses Matter to communicate with the Matter standard. If you don’t already have a Thread Border Router for Thread devices, including the forthcoming Thread sensors from Aqara, then I think it’s a good idea to get a HomePod Mini, the new HomePod, or the 2021 Apple TV or 2022 Apple TV 128gb. Going back to Aqara, they do plan on releasing their own Matter controller, which will also serve as a Zigbee hub. This (in theory) should allow other Matter devices to work with it, either directly (via Thread) or indirectly, via the Aqara app. Hopefully I’ve gotten that right, but if anyone wants to chip in in case I missed something or got something wrong, please go ahead.', 'Dangerous_Welcome392: ""but that they do plan to enable it"" .

Connects to Homekit via wifi. Requires Neutral connection. Connects to 3 physical switches. Exposes 6 homekit buttons to control other homekit devices or scenes. You can set multiple pages to the switch, and add widgets to control other aqara devices, or show weather/time. There are themes that you can set as well to your preference. I saw theres a github page that can expose this to HA as well, and you can add other themes and tinker with the settings. \n\n86x86mm UK switch size, only available in China at the moment. All menus are in chinese, and i had to use google translate to connect it to Apple Home. Connection was quick and simple. Construction is pretty solid. No flex when pressing the screen. Didnt manage to get a white one, but the gray one seems to blend the bezels better. Touch response is quick. The resolution of the panel is abit low (480x480) but acceptable for a switch. \n\nInitially I was looking at the Sonoff NSPanel Pro switch, but when I found this switch whilst browsing, i opted for it because it works with Homekit out of the box. \n\nAll in all, pretty satisfied with this product. The price was pretty cheap, around USD42 shipped. Cost slightly more than my Aqara D1 switches, and it comes with a screen with 6 homekit buttons, so pretty good deal if you ask me. I got it from Shopee (an asian online store/market). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvpgh5lpywfa1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9382772836bf3aa3b81d7551aa44444c3782c942', 'mmendozaf: Amazing! thanks for tour info. \nIs somewhat dimmable?

Is a great product, but some things to consider: is only wifi, and it integrates with a limited range of other devices if you want to control them. Anyway, you can bind any device via scenes (i don’t know why i cant bind some relays, mainly the no neutral ones). You can fully automate screen brightness, even you can mute (it beeps when you press something) and turn off the screen by automation. I just couldnt sync my timezone’ summer time with it, even if i change it manually on Aqara app’s settings. \n\nAnyway, still a recomended product. Also, it has 3 wired ports to connect it.

I’m now rethinking which hub I should have assigned the child devices to (such as door and window, etc)., now that my collection is growing, even though everything works. 

Does assigning them to the M2 have more stability because of the Ethernet wired connection, or would you want to assign them to the louder (non-Ethernet) alarm M1S, or does it really matter as long as the M1S louder alarm gets triggered?

I am adding a camera on another floor so should devices be assigned to that camera hub since it’s on that level?

A few things to precise.

Also worth to note, I don’t know if it’s normal but when the drivers are self-tightening, the drivers wheel are really really tight…

As I was saying, regardless of what I press on the app, they don’t move whether in pairs or in solo.
However, I can make them move by pressing the back button on the drivers and they seem to move fine (although i find the wheel to be really really tight to the point where the driver can’t even “balance” sideways even if I push them to lean.

Topic : Help needed for 2 way (3 way) smart switch installation

I'm looking to install at 2 way (3 way for Americans) smart switch to control my stairwell lights. Currently they're wired up using dumb switches. Top switch has live wire, with 2 switch wires (travelers?) going to the bottom second switch. ***By the way, I can only use no neutral switches, that’s how wiring is here in Asia.** *

Lutron and etc are not an option here in Asia. I read on other threads that there are ready made 3 way light switches that allow only 1 smart switch to be installed. However my ecosystem at my house is predominantly Tuya or Aqara, and I'm leaning more towards the Tuya route at the moment. 

For this setup, do I just need 1 smart switch ? And the other dumb switch can be retained ? Or do I need 2 smart switches, and the second one does not have any switch wire (common/traveler) wires connected to it, just live (hot wire) and programmed via automation ? If so, does the second switch work locally in the Tuya (and or homekit ) ecosystem ? 

Lastly, how does this translate into Homekit? My Tuya (zemismart) hub allows for my Tuya devices to be incorporated into Homekit.

To enhance Zigbee’s signal, I’ve installed Zigbee 3.0 Neutral devices:

–from T1, about 3m (9’) there’s an E1 Double switch, 
-next, to other 3m (9’) there is the S1 Panel with signal value: 90-Acceptable .

a) waited to see if devices connect or the signal “jumps” to the neutral devices;
b) connected and disconnected devices,
c) disconnected the M1S,
d) waited hours to see if signal values go better…
e) deleted and re-added the sensors to try to get the signal jump from Neutral devices

Geofencing seems to trigger my automations well when I come home. (camera switches off)
However, this does not work when I leave my house. My ""leaving"" scene only triggers sometimes and the camera doesn't seem to notice that I have left my house. Other apps that also use a geofence always notice that I am out of the house.
I use homepods as a hub and all my devices are on lOS 16.3. I might have to say that since OS 16 all my geofence automations have suddenly had problems or stopped working at all."	0	[]

I have the Aqara temperature and humidity sensor.

The temperature measurement is correct (comparing to others like the homepod mini).

The problem is that the humidity measurement gives me wrong data, for example, when the humidity is 40%, the sensor shows 80-85%.

Do you know any trick to ""calibrate"" the humidity sensor?

I had thought about putting it temporarily in rice to absorb all the moisture but I don't know if it would work...

I'm thinking of completing my home automation equipment with Aqara devices.

Today, I mainly use Apple Home and Google Home to control my home automation. I am in France.

1. I would like to install an Aqara Hub + temperature sensors + a FP1 human presence sensor. This last product is not sold in Europe, but I can buy it on Aliexpress.So do I have to take a Chinese Hub too? And to connect my Aqara app on Chinese servers to run these products?
2. If I'm connected on Chinese Aqara servers, does it mean I won't be able to connect my devices in Google Home? And in Apple Home, will it work?If it doesn't work with Google Home, is there an alternative to bring up at least the temperature sensors in Google Home?

I am thinking of getting this: [https://www.aqara.com/eu/wireless\_remote\_switch.html](https://www.aqara.com/eu/wireless_remote_switch.html) . On the page Aqara claims that it supports single click, double click, long press, and click on both buttons actions. And on Aqara app I am sure thats the case. However, what is the situation with Homekit? The reason I am asking is because I have multiple H1 switches, and on Aqara app they support turn on/off actions, and also single click actions (you can disable on/off functionality and use them to control anything). However, on Homekit I can only see the on/off actions.

So these are my questions:

1. Maybe there is some way to enable single click action from H1 switch to Homekit? Maybe this can be done with Homebridge/Home assistant somehow?
2. What actions from Wireless switch ([https://www.aqara.com/eu/wireless\_remote\_switch.html](https://www.aqara.com/eu/wireless_remote_switch.html)) and also from wireless mini switch ([https://www.aqara.com/eu/wireless\_mini\_switch.html](https://www.aqara.com/eu/wireless_mini_switch.html)) are exposed to Homekit?

If anyone has those devices and would share their experience, I would really appreciate!"	12	"['hope_still_flies: I don’t have the H1 but I have minis and several of the Aqara Opple wireless buttons. They all support single, double and long press for all buttons in HomeKit', 'systemwizard: Here the Homekit view of Opple https://i.imgur.com/C5dyEBd.png', 'Round_Blacksmith_369: 1. Yes, you can.

Assigning an action/scene/HomeKit shortcut (not Siri Shortcuts) to every button and it’s press type of the wireless switch.\n\n-Single click\n-Double click\n-Long press', ""x2lt: I think I made a mistake by asking quite vague questions, instead of fully explaining my setup/situation. So here it goes.\n\nI have Aqara H1 (with neutral) switches. Then there are smart bulbs (nanoleaf) or LED strips with Tuya controller. Both Nanoleaf and Tuya (via homebridge) bulbs can be added to Homekit. The problem is, when I turn of the switch, light bulbs disconnect from the network, and next time, when the switch is turned on, it takes some time for bulbs to reconnect. And I don't want that. I want everything to work smoothly, no matter how I turn on/off the lights (homekit tiles, Siri, or pressing a switch, everything should sync smoothly).\n\nWhen I got Aqara H1 switches, before I tried them out in Homekit, I saw that they have 3 triggers for automations on Aqara app: turns on, turns off and click. Click would be triggered any time, the button is clicked, obviously:) And, you can disable the turn on/off feature of the specific button, making the switch act as a programable wireless button. In such case, you can only turn the switch on/off via Aqara map.\n\nBased on that, my plan was the following: I was assuming, that all those 3 actions would be available on Homekit. So I was planning to keep the switch turned on all the time (so the smart bulbs do not disconnect), then, turn the switch into a programable button. Then, when somebody clicks it, it would just turn on or off some smart bulb via Homekit.\n\nHowever, turned out there are only turns on/off actions available on Homekit. I was able to still create such behavior in couple rooms, because in those rooms there were 2 switches, dedicated for controlling same lights. So clicking a button (with disabled turn on/off feature) on one of the switch, turns on/off a button on another switch (this is done via Aqara app). Then, since the button on another switch in turned on, the action is triggered in Homekit, and then Homekit turns on the Nanoleaf smart bulb.\n\nNow I am lost and not sure, how to achieve what I want in the rooms, where I only have one switch. I am thinking the following scenarios:\n\n1. I install somewhere a hidden switch (with neutral, so it doesn't need to be connected to light bulb to work), and then use it to trigger automations on Homekit. Least elegant solution.\n2. Instead of having a H1 switch, I install Aqara's remote relay in the socket, and then cover it with Aqara's wireless switch (which looks the same, as H1 switches). Then I can probably use events from wireless switch to trigger on off on relay and light bulbs, if needed.\n3. Anyone has some better solutions?\n\nThanks once again all!\n\nP.S.

Seems a bit weird, but somehow I cannot find any info about such a seemingly simple topic. I have 23 H1 smart switches at home and a M2 hub.. Recently one of them got deleted from Aqara and same time from Home app. Not sure how that happened, since I didn't do it on purpose, but there is a chance it got deleted when deleting some automations. I re-added the switch to Aqara app, but it didn't appear in Home app. Tried reloading the Home app, tried finding some solution, but nothing. So for some reason I decided to remove Aqara M2 hub from Home app and then re-add it. And of course, all the configurations, all the automations, all the names, assigned rooms disappeared from Home app. I had to configure everything from scratch.

So the question is, how do I add new devices to Homekit? No way that the only way to do it is to re-add the hub and do all the configs all over again. Maybe I should have done a factory reset on the switch, before I re-added it? Should I hard restart my iPhone or Homepod, so that they would pick up new accessories from Aqara hub?

I would really like to know the right way to do this, before I add more accessories and mess up again and have to spend a few hours configuring everything again...

I've been tinkering a lot lately with Aqara's S1 product line-up. In my previous review of the [S1E](https://smarthomescene.com/reviews/aqara-s1e-magic-switch-review/) I noted  these are only made for Asian markets. However, you can use them globally if you are aware of some drawbacks, such as the built-in menu of the S1E being only in Chinese. 

This review is about the Aqara S1 Air Monitoring panel, which is a new Zigbee-based, air quality monitor device with dedicated sensors for PM and CO2. It relies on a **Sensirion SCD40** for CO2 and a **Plantower PMST003** for particulate matter measurements. 

It displays air data on a pretty good looking LCD screen with a minimalistic UI design. I benchmarked it's measurements in Home Assistant and included my thoughts in the article. I currently do not have a reliable PM2.5 sensor to be able to test the Plantower sensor, but will add it in the near future.

Using HomeKit too.	chanpion13	1	10aeoxh	Aqara	https://www.reddit.com/r/Aqara/comments/10aeoxh/anyone_using_the_cube_t1_pro_with_the_mi_home_app/	"Hi! I have a bunch of aqara sensors and a couple hubs but I'm using the Mi Home App. I tried adding it in the app, but cannot even see the device in the list. I assumed that all Aqara products and Mi Home were interchangeable but apparently I'm wrong.

Is there a way to still use this cube with my current set up? I cannot use both Aqara and Mi Home app at the same time right since the hub can only be connected to one right?"	19	"['HomeKit-News: Yes, the hubs can only connect to one ecosystem at a time, so if the Cube T1 Pro isn’t supported in Mi Home (even though the M1S is), I’m not sure you can add it, even manually.', 'ApprehensiveArcher73: I find Cube to be such an unpractical gimmick', 'chanpion13: Hi u/HomeKit-News! I frequent your site. Great to meet you.\n\nWould this work? I have TWO Aqara hubs. One has all my devices on it. The other is just a daisy chain alarm.\n\nI could just use the 2nd hub and use it with the Aqara app instead and bind the cube to that and expose that to HomeKit.\n\nHow does that sound?', 'Martinelli99: Any news on that? Seems that still is not supported, at least in EU', ""chanpion13: So now that I've had this for over two weeks... I am leaning towards your statement. I think it's a cool idea, but I have used it maybe twice the entire time, and those were just for demonstration."", 'HomeKit-News: Hi, yes you could do that. What hub is the 2nd one? Either way I’d suggest thr Aqara app if you plan on using the Cube T1 Pro in HomeKit too, as only the Aqara app has access to all the features and settings.', 'HomeKit-News: Are you referring to the Cube T1 Pro?', 'ApprehensiveArcher73: Right, if can’t use something on autopilot what’s the point - supposed to make life simpler...', 'chanpion13: Oh boy. You just helped me discover a bigger issue. The entire time I thought I had the M1S, but I have two \u200e1LMs. I got confused as they look pretty similar. I will go purchase two M1Ss now so I can use the cube with zigbee 3.\n\nIs there an easy way to move all my devices from the old hub to a new one? It was a PITA to do it the first time!', 'Martinelli99: Yes, sorry for confusion.   \n\n\nI am only using Mihome. I have a hub + the old cube. It works like a charm.

They won’t work with the Cube T1 Pro unfortunately, but they will with all the other Aqara hubs. If the speaker and light are useful then go with the M1S, although I prefer the M2 because of the wired connection option.\n\nAs regards moving stuff over, there’s no quick way. The easiest way would be to long press on the devices when pairing to a new hub, which also unpairs them from the old hub simultaneously. That said, it might be different when it comes to Mi Home, so it’s probably safer to remove them from the hub first, then pair them to a new hub.\n\nAdditionally, if you’re planning on totally moving from Mi Home to Aqara, it might be safer to remove the hub from HomeKit first (it’ll still be visible in Mi Home). This ensures that potential ghost versions of sensors connected to the older hub won’t still be lingering in your HomeKit home.', 'HomeKit-News: There’s probably no chance of it being an option to add to Mi Home. Usually if Aqara is going to make a device available on both platforms, they tend to do so from the start.', ""Martinelli99: Thanks. But if it's only for aqara app, then you probably cannot use it with eg. yeelight strips or lamps, right?"", 'HomeKit-News: In HomeKit you would be able to, as long as the Yeelight products in question are HomeKit compatible, which many are.', 'Martinelli99: Thanks again. So android users do not have any option in this case?', 'HomeKit-News: The only other possible option is with SmartThings, but I’m not so familiar with it and whether both Aqara and Yeelight work with the SmartThings platform.', 'Martinelli99: Tried it, but experienced mighty difficulties in joining stuff from different vendors.', 'HomeKit-News: I’m just wondering, if you don’t use HomeKit, then you can just use the original Aqara cube. The T1 Pro is just the same as the original, but with HomeKit support.', 'Martinelli99: That is exactly what I will do. Already returned the T1 Pro to the seller and buying the old one instead.']"

I moved into a house with the Hive smart thermostat but don’t really want to tie myself further into this architecture by buying Hive valves. I’ve already bought into the Aqara line of products so ideally would rather go this route.

I appreciate that smart valves from third party manufactures won’t talk to the Hive thermostat directly so does anyone know if by using Home Assistant or some shortcuts in HomeKit or similar, I can get the smart valves (Zigbee) to request the Hive to simply turn the boiler on/off?

I've already done a simple test using the Aqara Temperature Sensor however the main problem I have is when, for example, a request to heat a bedroom currently at 19˚c to say 20˚c and the living room where the Hive thermostat is located is already at 21˚c the valve/sensor is unable to override the Hive

I imagine I would need to be able to turn off the Hive's thermostat functionality and simply use it as a switch to turn the boiler on/off but don't think I'm able to do this - unless someone knows otherwise, thanks."	3	['Retr0Dad: I have this setup. If you go into HomeKit you can ‘add automation’ to the hive receiver, tell it to switch off if a specific smart valve reaches a set temperature. I guess you could select more than one valve if you wish. Probably worth noting that it might be better to get the hive receiver to turn off via a Aqara temp/hum sensor placed in the target room as this provides a more accurate ambient temperature', 'The_Manoeuvre: As u/Retr0Dad said, HomeKit can do this via automations. If you decide to go down this route it may be worth getting a 3rd party app like the apps Ive linked below. I say this as i think youd need to map a fair few automations.\n\n[Home+](https://apps.apple.com/app/id995994352)\n\n[Eve for HomeKit](https://apps.apple.com/app/id917695792)\n\nFor home assistant, yes, and I’m sure I’ve seen integrations that support it acting like one system. However HA is quite involved and something I’d say you’d need to see as a hobby to tinker with.', 'sulylunat: You absolutely can do this through home assistant. If you truly want to have every single room on a call for heat type system, then really the hive thermostat temperature does not even matter at all. You could set it to 30 degrees if you wanted to make sure that the heat definitely comes on when requested. As long as you have an automation to say to reset the target heat temp to lower than the ambient temperature where your hive is installed when all valves are at their required temperature, you don’t need to worry about the specific temperature. Just automate it to set the max temp on hive when a valve starts heating and to go to the lowest possible temp once all valves are satisfied. That will turn your heating on and off as required. \n\nA couple of things to be aware of when doing a setup like this. First of all don’t put a valve on every single radiator, leave at least one radiator permanently on without a TRV. I can’t remember the exact reason for this but it was strongly advised to do this when I last looked into it, I believe it’s something to do with keeping your system at the correct pressure as having all radiator valves closed can cause some issues, it’s important to have one open at all times. \n\nAlso, are you planning on connecting them to the hub through the aqara integration? I am assuming you will be using an aqara hub rather than connecting the devices directly to a 3rd party zigbee dongle connected to home assistant. That is how I have mine set up and it has one annoyance which makes it more work than it should be to automate. With my Nest thermostat, when the heating is on the thermostat changes to the status heating in homeassistant. When the ambient temp is already above my target temp and my heating is off, home assistant sees the status as idle. This makes it easy for automations as I can just tell home assistant to do things when the status changes, so when the ststus changes from idle to heating, set the TRV valve to 22 degrees for example. The TRV does not show like this, at least not when connected via an aqara hub and the aqara integration. It shows it is in the heating status all of the time, regardless of it is in a state where it would be trying to heat or not. That means for automating, you can’t rely on status changes as the status doesn’t change. Instead, you will have to rely on the temp values for automation triggers. So for your use you would set an automation to say, when bedroom radiator valve temp target changes to 22 degrees, set hive temp to 30 degrees. And then a second automation to say, when bedroom radiator valve temp target changes to 10 degrees, set hive to 10 degrees. You would obviously have to match those temp target values with whatever you have set the valves to be at in your schedule for your heating, but that would do it. The issue with this is, you have less flexibility as it’s only going to trigger the automation when your value is exactly as specified, so if you set your radiator valve to 23 degrees target temperature, it wouldn’t trigger the automation to call for heat as it is expecting 22 degrees, not 23 degrees. \n\nOne last drawback with running the aqara valve via aqara hub to HA, you don’t seem to be able to to turn on the valve from HA. You can turn it off which will stop it from doing any automations or anything, but you can’t reactivate it from HA. You need to go into the aqara app to turn it back on again.']

I've been using the G2H Pro as a camera to monitor our living room and have it running in homekit mode. I set it up so that the camera should be Off when we're home and set to Steam & Record when we're away. This worked for about 3 months and now it no longer functions.

I have to manually set it to Stream & Record as its behavior for when it should be off. It then turns on and I can then switch it back to Off with it staying in Stream & Record, like its supposed to be.

When I come home, I need to now go into the Home app to switch it into Off for when we're away and then can switch that setting back without any issue.

I´ve built my alarm system using aqara and homekit and I´m having a problem. I´ve got a few door sensors, a motion sensor and the G2H Pro. One of the things that I´ve configured to trigger the alarm is the motion sensor associated with the camera, and I´m frequently getting false alarms during the mornings.

I´ve seen the shorts recorded after it is triggered and noticed that is due to the light of the room changing suddenly, similar to when you change the focus on a phone camera and the global brightness is modified. I supposed it is the camera auto adjusting it focus or something similar, and wanted to know if there is any way to prevent this.

In addition, I would like to ask if there is any way I can get another kind of warning when the alarm is triggered and not just a notification that can be easily missed.

I just started with making some things smarter with Aqara around the home. One thing that I specifically want to keep an eye on is a pump that is triggered by a certain level of rainwater in the basement.

My idea was to detect anomalous long sustained usage. However the automation if ... Else ... Structure does not seem to allow the creation of such a conditional.
