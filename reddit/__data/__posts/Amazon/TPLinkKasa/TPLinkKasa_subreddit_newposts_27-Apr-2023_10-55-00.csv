1682637766.0	27-Apr-2023 16:22:46	Kasa Dimmer goes from any % to 0% in 10 seconds after turning it on -- but just 1 switch in my house	Bing10	2	131awrh	TPLinkKasa	https://www.reddit.com/r/TPLinkKasa/comments/131awrh/kasa_dimmer_goes_from_any_to_0_in_10_seconds/	"So my house is full of Kasa switches and cameras etc.  One bedroom has a dimmer switch tied to a fixture with multiple lights on it.

When I use the app to go to 50% or 100% or anything, or if I press and hold the physical button for more than 2 seconds to go to max brightness, it immediately starts dimming 10% every ~half second until the light is down to the minimum brightness.  This is impacting every bulb on the fixture, so I'm pretty sure it's not a bulb issue itself.

It is only happening on this one switch in my whole house, and it only started in the past week.

Any ideas on what could be wrong?"	1	['NewOrder1969: Check the dimmer speed settings under the device settings > Smart Dimmer Configuration > Fade On / Off Speed to Instant and see if that helps.']

I have 4 of the KS220M motion dimmer switches. These were running flawlessly with a few tweeks and routines in Alexa. Recently I saw that there was firmware update for a few of my Kasa switches. After download my Alexa routine to keep the shower light on, stopped working  and would shut off according to the time set for no motion in the tpsmart app. Also, when I would previously turn off, then turn back on the switch manually the light would stay on until shut off manually. This, does not work either reverting to the time-out set for ""no motion""  st in the app.

1681484167.0	14-Apr-2023 07:56:07	Can I replace these 3-way switches with a Kasa smart switches?	watashiwajoedesu	4	12lzyti	TPLinkKasa	https://www.reddit.com/r/TPLinkKasa/comments/12lzyti/can_i_replace_these_3way_switches_with_a_kasa/	"I have two 3-way switches in the box pictured below. One terminates in a box with another switch that I have already successfully traded out for a Kasa single pole. The other pairs at the end of the hall in a single box.

I bought two Kasa HS210 kits to replace the 3-way switches and wired them both up. When I turned on the power, I could connect to one switch by wifi, but none of the other three would light up.

Both switches seem to have the same load wire. The wire loops through the first switch, where the wire is stripped, but not cut, then to the second switch. I suspect that this is the problem. The first switch in the series is the one that worked, but none of the rest did.

Can I use the switches for these here or am I out of luck?

You need to understand how 3 way switches work, then draw out your particular version (there are multiple) to figure out what can go where.

That is how people kill themselves and/or burn down houses.  \n\nA 3-way switch is just a one-pole-two-throw switch.  It connects the black screw to one of the other two.  Which one of the other two depends on the switch position.\n\nOn a traditional 3-way switch in the US, one of the two 3-way switches gets the ""hot"" from the circuit.

So in the switches you mention, one side of the switch is black line in and the other is black load out.  Doesn't matter which screw terminal.  White would have been bundled separately.  And, like natoochtoniket said, you can't assume - sometimes line in is white and should be marked with a black line or tape...\n\nIn a newer home you should find line and neutral in one of the switches.

Though you\'re right, it\'s important to be wary in case of amateur wiring...\n\nThe OP said that there was a load wire daisy chained to other switches in the same box.  That doesn\'t make sense, it would essentially mean turning off that switch would turn off the other switches.  So he was mixing load and line - a dangerous thing to get wrong.

And you said one switch works, the others do not - so don't have power (line/neutral).

Electricity is no place for amateurs.   You really can kill yourself or burn down your house, since you don't know what you are doing.\n\nI suggest you either:   Hire a knowledgeable electrician;  Or, spend the several hundred hours that it takes to learn the basics, at least enough to avoid killing yourself.

Unless there are multiple circuits running to this box, all the neutrals from all devices need to be tied together in one bundle.  In your before picture it looks like they were all under one wire nut. If that\'s too many wires to safely fit in one wire nut, you can create a pigtail to link two smaller bundles together using two wire nuts, or get some Wago style connectors.  \n\nThe wiring looks pretty straightforward here to me and should be compatible with Kasa switches.  In most cases you don\'t need to install them in both switch boxes, just one (ideally the line-side box) will do.', ""watashiwajoedesu: The wire nut I had didn't seem large enough to accommodate six wires (four neutrals and two coming off the switches), so I put the neutrals for each switch into a separate nut. That may not have been the right choice, but I put them back into one nut when I removed the Kasa switches."", ""Paradox52525: That's your issue then.  One of those six neutrals is the run back to the electrical panel, and all of the others are runs to your light fixtures or other switches/boxes.  They \\*all\\* need a connection back to that single panel-run neutral in order to complete their respective circuits or else electricity won't flow.\n\nThis will all likely work fine if you connect all the neutrals correctly.  6 is a lot of wires, so you'll probably have to make a pigtail to connect them all safely.  In case you don't know, that's where you take a small piece (3-4 inches should be enough) of wire (use white coated wire and try to match the gauge of the wire you have in the wall already, 12 or 14 gauge) and then strip a little casing off of both sides.  You then make two wire nut bundles just like you did before, but link the two by placing one end of the pigtail wire in each bundle.  This way all the wires from both bundles have a pathway back to whichever white wire is the run back to the panel.  \n\nYou could also get some Wago lever nuts instead of standard wire nuts.  People really like these because they're easy to use without twisting and worrying about things coming apart, but I believe they max out at 5 wires so you might still need to pigtail two together."", ""watashiwajoedesu: >That's your issue then.

My previous house did not have neutral wires, so that part is new to me. I think I am still going to wait and check with someone more in the know than me, but it's good to know that the wiring will likely work.""]"

Handily it came with a TPLink smarbulb (LB110). I can remote control it via Kasa, but remote control is not available as it‚Äôs bound to another account. 

I suddenly realised that since it was second hand this made perfect sense. Got in touch with the vendor and they declared that they‚Äôd just moved into the house and so had no control themselves. 

Before I replace it,  I wondered if there was anyway to gain (full) control of it. I imagine any number of factory resets won‚Äôt help (tried already) since unless the MAC address changes, it will always look the same to TPlink‚Äôs servers, I.e. bound to someone else‚Äôs account.

Anyone come across this before and solved it?

I have since a few days a few smart bulb KL110, and have a few questions. Some of them are on another house that i can't reach easily, and i use them on a schedule.

It seem that in the kasa app, there is 2 ways to schedule them:

\- In the smart action tab, you can schedule light on/off

\- in the devices tab, select the bulb, and schedule tab where you schedule light on/off

I used the first one until now.

&#x200B;

So the thing is, i have seen one of the bulb of the distant house go offline and never come back. It's scheduled with smart action. If the bulb is powered on, but can't reach the wifi/internet of the house, does this mean that the schedule is now out of service?

And iwhen i will go to the house, if i now remove the smart actions, and use instead the second way to schedule it in the devices tab, is it in that case, not dependant of the wifi/internet? Does it keep the schedule, even offline?

&#x200B;

Just some questions i can't find a clear answer.

Thanks,j"	0	[]

I had moved to Kasa as they were reliable, and I never had any issues with setup, connectivity, or firmware updates.

I recently upgraded to an iPhone 14 Pro Max, and the Kasa app continues to work to control all of my previously installed devices. However, I just purchased a 4-pack of EP10 plugs and cannot set them up. When I try to add them via the app, I get to the point where I switch to the TPLINK\* wifi network. The app sees the switch and tries to start setting up the device. Normally, this is where it would ask for my home wifi info and connect the device to my home network. Now, it just sits there for a while and then displays a basic info screen with no real help with a ""Try Again"" button, and the option to ""Exit Setup"".

In addition to the setup errors, the EP10 devices already on my network (hardware version 1.0, firmware version 1.0.2) are being offered a firmware upgrade to 1.0.5. I try to update the firmware, and it gets about 60-80% on the progress bar and then fails with ""Failed to update 10 devices"" and no further information. None of the existing, functional EP10 devices will update.

My wife has an identical iPhone 14 Pro Max (same iOS version, same app version, etc.). Using her phone, I was able to successfully add 2 of the 4 new EP10 plugs. However, the firmware updates are still failing for all connected EP10s.

I spent about an hour on chat with TP-Link support this morning, and they basically said to use my wife's phone to add the other two plugs, and they'd ""look into the firmware"" situation. Their support rep was really nice on the chat, but we didn't really get anywhere.

Use case: I have all my recessed lights at 5% overnight for a night light effect. I want them to power off at sunrise, but if we go to manually turn them on again, they'll come back on at 5%. It's not only annoying to have to manually readjust the brightness, but my partner refuses to learn how to do this, and instead just bitches to me about it. I'd love to be able to turn them on after this shutoff and have them go right to 100. I did try creating two different automations - a sunrise one to turn lights to 100% and then a minute later a second one to turn them all off. Problem is, I can't set an automation to run ""30 seconds"" or ""1 minute after the previous one"", so I can't use sunrise as my trigger, which makes a continually adapting automation not possible. I'd have to manually keep adjusting the time on both automations. This also seems like a highly inefficient and inelegant solution to my issue. 

Anyone have a better idea of how to achieve this?

It turns out it was actually just a weird 3-way switch that had two push-in terminals connected to the same screw, presumably to make it easier to connect multiple loads."", 'MikeP001: If you don\'t have neutral that suggests an older home.

That power comes from the circuit breaker.   The white should be re-identified as hot, since there is no neutral.\n\nFor the second 3-way switch, two travelers come from the middle box, and the switched-hot returns.  That switched-hot connect to the load. That white should be re-identified as hot, also.    \n\nThere is no neutral in either of those 3-way switch boxes.\n\nThe middle box is often a ceiling box, to hang a fixture.  The two travelers from the first 3-way just connect to the two travelers that go to the second 3-way.\n\nIf the middle box is a wall-box with a 4-way switch, that switch just connects between the two pairs of travelers.    The 'line' from the circuit goes to the first 3-way switch, and the 'load' to the fixture is from the second 3-way switch.\n\nThat's illegal to install (new) now, in most jurisdictions, because neutrals are required in all switch boxes.

The fact that there aren\'t neutrals in the other two boxes does *not* mean that the 4-way box has your line wire.  It was common in older houses for none of the boxes to have neutrals at all.  Having only three switches in a four-way setup is also normal (three switches and the ""fourth way"" is the light fixture itself).  Have you tested any of your wiring with a multimeter or non-contact tester?  I think what\'s more likely is you have a typical 4-way setup with no neutrals, and would need a smart switch brand that doesn\'t require a neutral wire.\n\nIf you\'re right and power really does go to the 4-way first, you\'re unfortunately still going to have to find another product because Kasa doesn\'t currently make any smart 4-way switches and the other two boxes don\'t have neutrals.']"

Can I just enter a command to simply change the smin, and that will implement the schedule change? What would be the command?

The beginning of the documentation has a section about controlling the devices from the command line (I‚Äôm using a VM in Ubuntu). Again, I can return info and turn on/off, but that‚Äôs about as far as I can get. So should I be trying to change the schedule here or in Python?

* when light was turned off by no motion, turn on blower for 5 minutes

Just replace one of the 3 way switches with a Kasa switch and you should be good to go.', 'Rodlofton53: You could technically dummy switch some of your 4 way switches, and just leave the 3 ways on the ends of the circuits loads?', ""Paradox52525: This. The first (line side) and last (load side) switches in the circuit will always be 3-ways.  Usually replacing the line-side 3-way is all you need to do for everything to work and the rest can be dumb switches.  In some rare cases (lots of lights on the circuit or really long wire runs) you might have replace both the line and load side switches with Kasa switches and pair them during setup so they can correctly detect their on/off state.  Even in that case though, you'd leave the 4-way switch(es) alone. \n\nIf you want your switches to visually match (or at least be close), you can get a regular/dumb white 4-way rocker switch for the location with the 4-way switch.""]"

They work fine for me, but will not work at all for my wife. From my research, it seems this is because the scenes aren't added to a room. I can see the scenes when I am setting up a routine, but I do not see a way to add those scenes to a room. Is there a way to add Kasa Scenes to a room? Is there another work around to get scenes working for other members of the home?	0	[]
