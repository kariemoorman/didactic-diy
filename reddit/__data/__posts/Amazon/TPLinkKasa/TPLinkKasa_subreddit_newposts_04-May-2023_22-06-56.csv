I've now tried to install two different switches in two different 3-way runs and am getting the same behavior where they are flicking off and on when power is turned back on. It's gotten dark out so I've reverted to my dumb switches at this point with hopes of being able to try things out again in the morning if I can get some answers here. I'll provide some pictures below. 
 
Here's the location I tried to install the HS210 at. This side has a neutral, where the other doesn't, so this is where I installed. It might be a bit difficult to make out, but you should be able to see that the 3-wire run to the other switch is red, black, and white. Where red and white are my runners and black is actually hooked up to the neutral from the 2-wire run from the light fixture. Black from the 2-wire run is hooked up to common. 
 

https://i.imgur.com/1qsI74F.jpg 

https://i.imgur.com/hx0gRyO.jpg 
 
Here is the other end where only the 3-wire run is coming in, no neutral. Runners are still red and white, black is my common from the neutral on the other end. 
 

https://i.imgur.com/Xq4HVQt.jpg 
 
This configuration with the dumb switches works as expected for a 3 way switch setup. However if I hook up the HS210 on the side with the neutral and have everything hooked up the same, and add the neutral wire into the wire nut with the others, it will flick on and off repeatedly similar to this video.

I was not able to find a resolution in this thread unfortunately and the few other threads I'd found mentioning the same issue didn't really seem to offer any resolution either. 
 
To help describe my wiring a bit better, here's an image that is almost identical, with the exception of the with and black wires in the 3-wire cable are swapped.

I am having a hard time trying to figure out why my smart switch ''Crash and reboot'' in infinite loop  when I set lights to 100%. It can only go to 85% (although the 85% feels weak, it feels like 40ish%). Less than that it's absolutely fine, I can do anything except if I exceed 85%.

I tried with less bulbs, in case it was too much power requirement, and it's still doing it.

I wonder if it's

A : Incompatible bulbs, I am using Phlips dimmable leds.

B: Incorrect installation. This would surprise me as it works just fine bellow the ''breaking Point''.

C: Faulty Switch

D: Wrong Variant of switch used. (Perhaps I need this kit instead : [https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/dp/B09CX9G1WT/ref=dp\_iou\_view\_product?ie=UTF8&th=1](https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/dp/B09CX9G1WT/ref=dp_iou_view_product?ie=UTF8&th=1)) (Currently using this one [https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/dp/B0BC2MWTR9/ref=dp\_iou\_view\_product?ie=UTF8&th=1](https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/dp/B0BC2MWTR9/ref=dp_iou_view_product?ie=UTF8&th=1) but the satilite Line is different, mine it's a wire that goes out from the switch, whereas in the one I'm thinking to replace with does not - you plug the line in with the top traveller)

On a side note : If I do a volunteer wrong wiring with my main switch, I am able to have it at 100% brightness, but the switch itself wont be functional, it won't even turn on, none of the buttons will work, though the lights are full on. I thought that could help the troubleshooting. It does make me believe the switch itself is defective.

Again, it works great (But weak) until beyond 85%.

I appreciate any help !"	1	"[""MikeP001: Sounds like you might have used a traveler white as neutral at the switch.  Might be a good idea to confirm you've wired it correctly - if so, maybe it's broken.""]"

If that\'s too many wires to safely fit in one wire nut, you can create a pigtail to link two smaller bundles together using two wire nuts, or get some Wago style connectors.  \n\nThe wiring looks pretty straightforward here to me and should be compatible with Kasa switches.  In most cases you don\'t need to install them in both switch boxes, just one (ideally the line-side box) will do.', ""watashiwajoedesu: The wire nut I had didn't seem large enough to accommodate six wires (four neutrals and two coming off the switches), so I put the neutrals for each switch into a separate nut. That may not have been the right choice, but I put them back into one nut when I removed the Kasa switches."", ""Paradox52525: That's your issue then.  One of those six neutrals is the run back to the electrical panel, and all of the others are runs to your light fixtures or other switches/boxes.  They \\*all\\* need a connection back to that single panel-run neutral in order to complete their respective circuits or else electricity won't flow.\n\nThis will all likely work fine if you connect all the neutrals correctly.  6 is a lot of wires, so you'll probably have to make a pigtail to connect them all safely.  In case you don't know, that's where you take a small piece (3-4 inches should be enough) of wire (use white coated wire and try to match the gauge of the wire you have in the wall already, 12 or 14 gauge) and then strip a little casing off of both sides.  You then make two wire nut bundles just like you did before, but link the two by placing one end of the pigtail wire in each bundle.  This way all the wires from both bundles have a pathway back to whichever white wire is the run back to the panel.  \n\nYou could also get some Wago lever nuts instead of standard wire nuts.  People really like these because they're easy to use without twisting and worrying about things coming apart, but I believe they max out at 5 wires so you might still need to pigtail two together."", ""watashiwajoedesu: >That's your issue then.

My previous house did not have neutral wires, so that part is new to me. I think I am still going to wait and check with someone more in the know than me, but it's good to know that the wiring will likely work.""]"

I figured that it supported having a traveler to allow whichever switch was in a certain position to either close or open the circuit as necessary. The normal 3-way would still act as a 'dumb' 3-way.\n\nNow, when I ask to turn on the stair light, the Kasa switch responds and toggles to whatever it needs to close the 3-way circuit. It responds correctly no matter which position the other normal 3-way switch is in.\n\nOf course, it depends if you have echo devices that are both within range of your voice. I put the 3-way in at the bottom of the stairs where we spend the most time.

I replaced the remaining 32 of the BR30s today. Tomorrow I will be swapping out another 18 A19 60Ws. The only thing left is to pick up 26 60W B11 Candelabra bulbs and I will be completely LED based lighting.   It surprised me how many incandescent lights remained even though the most frequently used lights have been LEDs for years.  Even if I don't use those lights much, I suspect I will save some money overall.    I at least won't need to climb the ladder as much. Why builders put light bulbs two stories up without thinking about what is required to replace them still confounds me? 

 With the update, I need to replace a couple of dimmers and decided to try the Kasa dimmers.   I have been looking at the Kasa stuff for a while as I have really wanted to ditch my Wemo plugs because they have security issues which need to be fixed.  Bitdefender has been complaining about the known vulnerabilities of the older Wemo Switches for a while now, but Wemo will not update the firmware to fix them.  Wemo expects you to buy new hardware to fix security issues and throw out the old stuff.  

From what I have seen, the Kasa app is more feature rich than Wemo's and it plays well with SmartThings, so I decided to try a Kasa Dimmer and experiment.  I am looking forward to trying this out as it seems Kasa offers a lot more bang for your buck, especially if you have decent Wifi."	6	"[""MikeP001: Do you have a reference for the wemo security issues?

I have since a few days a few smart bulb KL110, and have a few questions. Some of them are on another house that i can't reach easily, and i use them on a schedule.

It seem that in the kasa app, there is 2 ways to schedule them:

\- In the smart action tab, you can schedule light on/off

\- in the devices tab, select the bulb, and schedule tab where you schedule light on/off

I used the first one until now.

&#x200B;

So the thing is, i have seen one of the bulb of the distant house go offline and never come back. It's scheduled with smart action. If the bulb is powered on, but can't reach the wifi/internet of the house, does this mean that the schedule is now out of service?

And iwhen i will go to the house, if i now remove the smart actions, and use instead the second way to schedule it in the devices tab, is it in that case, not dependant of the wifi/internet? Does it keep the schedule, even offline?

&#x200B;

Just some questions i can't find a clear answer.

Thanks,j"	0	[]

JaxC7	2	11lx6xz	TPLinkKasa	https://www.reddit.com/r/TPLinkKasa/comments/11lx6xz/cant_setup_ep10_plugs_or_do_firmware_updates/	"I have numerous Kasa plugs, switches, bulbs, and a power strip in my home all of which were set up with my phone (originally iPhone 12 Pro Max). I had moved to Kasa as they were reliable, and I never had any issues with setup, connectivity, or firmware updates.

I recently upgraded to an iPhone 14 Pro Max, and the Kasa app continues to work to control all of my previously installed devices. However, I just purchased a 4-pack of EP10 plugs and cannot set them up. When I try to add them via the app, I get to the point where I switch to the TPLINK\* wifi network. The app sees the switch and tries to start setting up the device. Normally, this is where it would ask for my home wifi info and connect the device to my home network. Now, it just sits there for a while and then displays a basic info screen with no real help with a ""Try Again"" button, and the option to ""Exit Setup"".

In addition to the setup errors, the EP10 devices already on my network (hardware version 1.0, firmware version 1.0.2) are being offered a firmware upgrade to 1.0.5. I try to update the firmware, and it gets about 60-80% on the progress bar and then fails with ""Failed to update 10 devices"" and no further information. None of the existing, functional EP10 devices will update.

My wife has an identical iPhone 14 Pro Max (same iOS version, same app version, etc.). Using her phone, I was able to successfully add 2 of the 4 new EP10 plugs. However, the firmware updates are still failing for all connected EP10s.

I spent about an hour on chat with TP-Link support this morning, and they basically said to use my wife's phone to add the other two plugs, and they'd ""look into the firmware"" situation. Their support rep was really nice on the chat, but we didn't really get anywhere.

So, I figured I'd reach out here as well to see if anyone else has any suggestions. Any help will be greatly appreciated!"	4	"['lspeth: I have a pack of 4 EP10s and am trying to use them just to turn on and off lights.

Just installed a pile of HS220s around my place, and discovered one thing I dislike about them - if the lights are dimmed and then powered off, they turn back on at the same dimmed level. I asked TP-Link if there's any way to force them to 100% every time they're powered on, but was told there is no support for that yet. So I want to see if anyone has found a way to do this? I'm comfortable utilizing external resources such as [Tray.io](https://Tray.io), IFTTT, etc. if there's a way to do it through any of those resources, etc. 

Use case: I have all my recessed lights at 5% overnight for a night light effect. I want them to power off at sunrise, but if we go to manually turn them on again, they'll come back on at 5%. It's not only annoying to have to manually readjust the brightness, but my partner refuses to learn how to do this, and instead just bitches to me about it. I'd love to be able to turn them on after this shutoff and have them go right to 100. I did try creating two different automations - a sunrise one to turn lights to 100% and then a minute later a second one to turn them all off. Problem is, I can't set an automation to run ""30 seconds"" or ""1 minute after the previous one"", so I can't use sunrise as my trigger, which makes a continually adapting automation not possible. I'd have to manually keep adjusting the time on both automations. This also seems like a highly inefficient and inelegant solution to my issue. 

Anyone have a better idea of how to achieve this?

The scheduled turn OFF actions still work, and controlling the plug wirelessly via the Kasa App or Google Home app presents no issues. 

I've deleted and reinstalled the Kasa app and also deleted / recreated the turn ON action, but to no avail. Any ideas?

I was finally able to get that working with the Kasa app but am still unable to add it to HomeKit.  No big deal since I just want it scheduled and the Kasa app works fine with that.

I like the system so I ended getting a couple of the KP125 smart plugs.  I wanted to get these working with the Kasa app for the energy monitoring and Homekit for ease of switching.  Well I am back to setup hell and can't figure out what is wrong.

So far I have not been able to get it to connect to the Kasa App but can (sometimes) get it to connect with HomeKit one of two ways.

If I use the Kasa app to add the plug, it's hit or miss on if it finds it.  The best I can do is that it finds it, asks for the location and name, then goes back to [this screen](https://imgur.com/P5FdREH) but with the spinning circle over the house.  After that screen I get [this failure screen](https://imgur.com/547KrEo).  If I go back into the Kasa app there is nothing there, but if I go into HomeKit [it is installed there](https://imgur.com/hBLXkld) and I can control it.  I have tried this over and over with either a failure of ""Unknown Failure"" or what I showed above.  My process is:  Reset the switch and remove it from HomeKit, if installed there.  Open the Kasa App and hit the ""+"" in the top right corner.  Select ""Device"" and then choose ""Smart Plugs"" and ""HomeKit Smart Plug (KP125, EP25).  It prompts me to plug it in, then asks if the Orange & Blue lights are flashing.  Once I click through those,   I get the prompt ""Add to Home"" (the first screen shown above) and then one of the two errors.  There seems to be no way to add to Kasa App without adding to Home first. :(

The other way I have gotten it to connect to Homekit (very reliably) is to connect to the plug's Wifi directly and then it prompts if I want to Add to Home.  Following the prompts works great to add it to HomeKit, however it's still not in the Kasa app and there doesn't seem to be a way to add it afterwards.

I think the issues are somehow related to my network but I can't figure out what & why.  I have tried every network I have (normal, kids and guest) and just about every configuration change I can think of including switching the networks to 2.4GHz, 20MHz wide, turning on/off mDNS, disabling my pihole, etc.

My main network is a 192.168.\*.\* network and even with it at 2.4GHz 20MHz only on channel 1, 6, or 11, with/without mDNS and with/without my piHole.  I get the same results.

What really kills me is that I can't get to work in the Kasa app at all.  Any hints or specific network settings to try other than those above?  Thanks"	4	"['OkPhotojournalist480: Did you try this [HomeKit setup troubleshooting | TP-Link](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/3390/)\n\nI think you can ask for help from their support  [TP-Link support](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/contact-technical-support/#E-mail-Support)', 'mr_milo: Finally got the smart plugs into the Kasa App.  Not sure if it was a network wide mDNS setting on my router or allowing the Kasa App local network access.\n\nI got the same thing as before, failure after entering the location info but again it was added to HomeKit.  Then once it was added to HomeKit, I went back in to the Kasa App and pulled down to refresh and was then prompted to add the plugs to  my account.\n\nThey work fine in the Kasa App but are still very flaky in the Home (HomeKit) app.  I clearly still have more settings to adjust.', 'mr_milo: Hate to say it but the problems are back! :(  A couple of days ago I noticed my KS200 switch showing a red circle.  When I checked the Kasa app, it and one of my KP125 outlets were unreachable.  For the KS200, I pressed the restart button and it fired right back up.  However I wasn\'t sure how to restart the outlet.  I tried to unplug it and plug it back in but that didn\'t help.  I then tried to reset it and that\'s when the problems started.\n\nI had to try multiple times to reset it and finally got it to connect to Homekit, but no matter what I did, it wouldn\'t connect to the Kasa app.  After a few more resets, it now won\'t connect to anything.  It goes as far as blinking blue (connecting to wireless), then solid blue (connected to wireless), but then goes back to orange and blue and fails.\n\nI then opened a new double pack of KP125 outlets and they are only connecting to Homekit.  They will not connect to the Kasa app.  Anyone else have this issue?\n\nEDIT:  OK, I feel really stupid right now.  I found and fixed my issue.  The issue turns out to be that somehow the ""local network"" access to the Kasa App was disabled on my phone.  So it seems the devices I was controlling were being controlled over the cloud and anything I tried to connect, wouldn\'t because the app had no local network access.  Hope this helps someone else.', 'mr_milo: Thanks!  Yes, I have gone through all of those checks.  Gotten a few of those errors as well with all the switching.  I find it interesting that they don\'t show the ""Unknown Error"" which shows in the same style box.\n\nFound a few things on the Ubiquiti forum to try late tonight when everyone is off the network.  Also, read that they will ""magically"" appear in the Kasa App after a bit of time (sometimes up to a day) if get them configured in Homekit.  So, I\'ll try that with one of them too.  If I can\'t get it going, I\'ll try their support but I normally don\'t have much luck with support unless I can somehow get it elevated to higher level support.']"

These were previously controlled by a timer switch that I always needed to adjust with the changes of sunset / sunrise.

I installed the KS200 and at first tried to get it working with the HomeKit but that was a pain, so I reset it and connected it to the Kasa App.  Everything worked perfectly and I was excited to find the sunrise and sunset offsets.  So I programmed my schedule to turn on the switch 30 minutes before sunset and turn off the switch 30 after sunrise.

The first night I had to manually turn on the lights since it was already after sunset.  Then about 3am I woke up and realized that the lights were off.   I again manually turned them on but then in the morning (hours after sunrise) they were still on.

The next day I watched them and found that they turned on appropriately but then turned off at midnight.  I then manually turned them back on, but again in the morning they stayed on.

I checked the switch to make sure it is synced with the proper location and time which all seems correct.  I’m stumped at this point and don’t really know what to try.  I have now reversed the logic, ie. Off at sunset / On at sunrise, but I don’t think this will work either since it was turning on correctly.

Any thoughts?  Things to try?  Thanks"	4	"['mr_milo: UPDATE:  So reversing the logic of the schedule didn’t work much as I expected.

I then went back into the app and added the switch using the + button (not sure how I did it the first time) but this seemed to give me more options and the ability to chose the network which I don’t remember doing the first time.\n\nAfter everything was setup again I added in the same schedule and turned on the switch.  It’s now well after midnight and the switch / lights are still on so that’s progress!\n\nI will update again tomorrow to confirm that they turn off correctly too. But I have faith they will since the app is already telling me that the next action will be turning them off around 7:35am.\n\nLooks like I just messed up the install somehow.

NewOrder1969	3	1067zgd	TPLinkKasa	https://www.reddit.com/r/TPLinkKasa/comments/1067zgd/hs230v2_in_a_4way_switch_configuration/	"For posterity sake, I’m coming back to report on my experience with the HS230v2.   While they fixed the dedicated traveler wire issue compared to the HS230v1, it still does not function properly if there’s a 4-way (DPDT) switch in the middle.  It works just fine until you flip the 4-way.  The HS230’s flash once and then you get the red-ring-of-death, where the master HS230v2 flashes the red ring indicating a wiring issue.  So major bummer that these do NOT work like the HS210s.

I did, however, figure out a workaround to let the HS230v2 work in a 4-way setup.   I basically turned my 4-way circuit into a 3-way as far as the electrical wiring goes, by removing the 4-way DPDT switch and hardwiring the traveler wires together, removing the 4-way switch entirely from the circuit.   I called the HS230v2 pair “Family Room” since that’s where it is.

I then placed an HS200 in the box where the 4-way DPDT switch was and named it “Family Room - Dummy.”  I wired it to hot (line), neutral and ground.  The load (fixture) wire I just put a wire nut on, terminated to nothing.  The HS200 is now a switch that doesn’t actually turn anything on physically, it’s just used as a remote trigger switch.

I created four Smart Action rules.  

The first is Dummy-Family-ON.  If the Dummy switch is turned on then turn on the Family Room switch.   
Second Dummy-Family-OFF - Dummy off then turn off Family.   

The third and fourth are to sync the state of the Family Room lights back to the Family Room - Dummy, so that switch matches the other switches.  

Third - Family-Dummy-ON - If Family is turned on, then turn on the Dummy.   
Fourth Family-Dummy-OFF - If Family is turned off, then turn off Dummy.  

If you turn on either of the HS230v2’s the lights come on immediately (as you would expect).   The Dummy takes about 1 second to relay the on/off command over to the main HS230v2 switches.   Luckily, the dummy switch happens to be in the least used location so it’s not really annoying.   If it was one of the high traffic switches it could take some getting used to, or even be rather annoying waiting for the 1 second delay.  (That said, you could use one of your now unused traveler wires to take hot to whichever box you want, allowing you to have more flexibility in placing the dummy switch.

So in any event, bummer the HS230v2 won’t work with a 4-way DPDT switch, but there is a bit of a creative workaround you can do to make it work."	5	['Aggravating-Junket67: Nice workaround.

Switch with dimmer: It has two travelers, line, ground. There are neutral wires but not connected to the current switch.

Switch without dimmer: This one stumped me a bit. It has two travelers, ground, and what is labeled on the switch as “common” (Marked as “Load” in the pic below). I know this one needs to be Load but when I test it using a voltage detector it lights up, making it seem that this is Line? The Kasa app installation instruction says I should expect a Load wire here. However, a Load wire shouldn’t light up, right?

The current setup with Lutron switches works. But when I replace them with kasa switches, the lights don’t work from either switches. The main switch blinks red light. I checked connections multiple times, reset the switch a few times but it didn’t change the outcome.

I have a basic understanding of electrical work, so sorry if my lingo is off. Hopefully you can still help. 

 Long story short….
The original wires connected to the switch I’m replacing are 1. Load wire (black) 2. Two traveller wires 3. Ground wire 

I have marked this as the main box though because it contains the neutral wires to the circuit, but for Kasa dimmer 3 way switch the main switch needs the LINE WIRE.

However, the switch I’m replacing is in a multi gang box and the other switch doesn’t control anything (figured it was there to have the option of adding additional lighting 🤷🏻‍♀️, but maybe you guys can answer that). The other switch has the LINE wire I need and another red wire tht appears to be going up into the light but who knows. Here is a photo. 

The other side is a 3 gang box (w/ another circuit in it too) but the other 3 way switch is just these components coming from the top of the box: 1. Two traveler wires, 2. The line wire (which is really just a connection from the main box making it a LINE) 3. Ground 

Is there anyway to still maintain the 3 way functionality? or should I just buy a single pole dimmer smart switch and give up the other switch and call it a day. 

I hope this even made sense. If it didn’t thanks anyway 😬😬😬. Sorry."	13	['None: There are reasons dummy switches.\n\n1. On the standard light/fan fixtures, one for light and one for fan.

I’m trying to figure out how to connect my new switch & I just can’t crack it, I’m hoping someone can give me some insight. So here’s the issue:

I have a dining room light that had 2 switches wired in parallel, one hard switch & one dimmer switch. The dimmer switch could power on the light on its own but if the hard switch was on, the dimmer couldn’t dim it. I wanted to replace them both with one single Kasa HS220.

I pulled the hard switch & all the bypass wires connected to it, so all I was left with was the coming out of the wall. I hooked up the black common wire to the neutral wire on the bottom of the HS220, the green to the grounded gang box and the two other wires to line & load. When I turned the breaker back on the lights flickered on & off at approx 1-2x per second & the buttons on the switch didn’t control anything. I tried a few other configurations & in some of them I was able to get the wifi working on the switch but the lights wouldn’t come on no matter what I did.

Any insight would be very much appreciated!"	11	['Frosty_Doughnut_27: First issue, why are you connecting a black wire to neutral- stop that. \nSecond issue, who ever wired up this light didn’t know what they were doing.

Marky1983ca	4	zxtxot	TPLinkKasa	https://www.reddit.com/r/TPLinkKasa/comments/zxtxot/which_smart_plug/	I'm looking at replacing my 8 smart plugs and 2 wall switches from Wemo with ones from TP Link, as many reviews say they are the best, but I'm not sure which one to get. Are the EP25 and EP10 the same other than size and energy monitoring? Is the Tapo P125 the better option? Is TP Link going to phase out Kasa for Tapo? I'm in the US if that matters. Any help would be appreciated.	8	"['NewOrder1969: I have several of both the EP10 and EP25 as well as a few HS103s.  \n\nThe EP25 does energy usage monitoring and is Apple HomeKit compatible.  The EP10 and HS103 is a simple on/off plug.  They are nearly identical in size.   The EP10 has been the best in terms of stability and ease of adding to the Kasa app.   \n\nIf you don’t care about energy monitoring then the EP10 is the better choice in terms of simplicity.  \n\nI bought a four pack of the EP25 recently because I had a few things around the house I wanted to get a better idea of the energy usage.  The EP25 adds to Kasa through HomeKit style (scan a QR code) and with iOS 16.2 it is absolutely broken.  (Apple is rolling out Matter (new home automation standard) support and recently paused it because of all the problems. )  \n\nIf you let the EP25 sit plugged in for about 10 minutes it will stop trying HomeKit mode and revert to Kasa mode where it’s easy to add it to the Kasa app. \n\nThe EP10 and any of the other Kasa smart devices can be integrated with HomeKit through third-party systems like Home Assistant (HA).  It also does Alexa natively with the Kasa skill. \n\nI had about 8 Wemo devices and basically ripped it all out since it was a never ending fight to keep it working with my setup (HA, old Z-Wave and a few random other integrations.)\n\nI currently have about 60 Kasa switches and about 15 Kasa plugs.  If you’re evaluating Kasa as a whole, I’d say it’s 85% decent, but not 100% polished.  \n\nI had significant WiFi issues with the switches enough so that I built a separate 2.4GHz WiFi network and put all of tge Kasa on that.   (I put in a separate WiFi AP running 2.4 GHz only on a 20MHz wide channel.   It is rock solid now.) \n\nKasa has challenges on mixed 5/2.4GHz SSIDs (wifi networks).   I’ve seen it work great at a relatives house (about 30 devices) but it was a disaster at mine.  (We even have the same TP-Link Deco Wifi 6E setups.). The symptom is the Kasa devices won’t join the WiFi network properly.  You’ll see many posts suggesting separating out the 2.4 SSID from the 5GHz (and 6GHz for WiFi 6E and newer) SSID.   This will fix it, but then you make your WiFi network worse for modern devices (from the last 6-7 years or so) that handle dual band WiFi properly and create a much better experience when roaming between bands.   (e.g. wandering around your house/patio/yard with a tablet or mobile device.). I refused to separate my bands hence my choice to build a totally separate WiFi network for my smart/IoT devices.  \n\nThe iOS app is also buggy when you get more than about 15-20 devices added; it becomes non-responsive for 5+ seconds at a time.   The workaround (when you’re not actively adding devices to your setup) is to disable Local Network access in iOS Settings > Kasa.   The app works great when it’s forced to relay through their cloud.  \n\nI’m quite happy with my setup at this point.  Primarily using the Kasa App, iOS Home app and iOS Control Center buttons for commonly used switches, Siri (all via HA) and Alexa for voice control. \n\nI don’t have any info on Tapo other than it does have an option to not use WiFi and communicate in the 900MHz band.   Benefits would be not conflicting with WiFi bands as well as greater range (useful if you don’t have solid 2.4GHz coverage in places where you want to place devices.)  \n\nUsing 900MHz would mean you’d need the Tapo hub to get it talking to your network.

I’ve wired a couple of Kasa switches and outlets but I’m having an issue with my current switch replacement. I am replacing two standard dimmer switches with the HS220 models. Each switch controls only one light and they are the only switch for each. 

I took the wires directly from the previous switches and used that as a guide to connect load and line (they are both black in my house. Not sure if that is standard or not.) the neutrals were previously unused and just secured altogether with a wire nut. I did get both switches powered by switching the neutrals around but neither one was then able to control the lights, even after pairing through the app. 

It’s hard to photograph but there are two wires coming up from the bottom and three from the top of the box. I know I have the order of these wires mixed up in some way. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

After reading several folks getting this to work, I’ve just attempted it and cannot get it to work.  On the main unit I have red as traveler one, and black as traveler two.  Same on the load/satellite side.  On the 4-way in the middle, im attempting to install the second satellite.  If I wirenut the two blacks together and the two reds together everything works perfect.  If I place both reds on the top/traveler 1, and both blacks on the bottom/traveler two, the switch no longer works and a reset on the main unit makes it click 2 times then flash an amber circle.  The posts I read about it working were with older v1.0 kits.  Do y’all think maybe this newer revision no longer has this capability?  I’m an electrician and I’m fairly certain all the wiring should be correct according to what I’ve read….	23	"['the1maximus: So was in the same boat yesterday as well.  I have a 4 way setup in my living room and needed a middle switch.  I knew ahead of time that the middle switch was going to be a lost cause, so I did something different.

To make this work you need a HS200 as well as the KS230 v2.x.\n\nAt switch one, I abandoned the red traveler to switch two, connected the line and neutral for the feed to switch two and the HS200. I capped the load from the HS200, and as an extra precaution I also taped it.  At switch two, I capped the abandoned red traveler from switch one, and used the black and white as my new line and neutral.  Effectively I relocated my line feed to switch two.  From here install as normal, the main KS230 switch at the line side, and the satellite switch at the load side.\n\nYou now have a traditional 3 way and an extra switch that does nothing at the moment.  Add both devices to the Kasa app, after all is working, go to the smart actions tab, and create these 4 smart actions...\n\n\\#1 When HS200 Turns on, Turn on KS230\n\n\\#2 When HS200 Turns off, Turn off KS230\n\n\\#3 When KS230 Turns on, Turn on HS200\n\n\\#4 When KS230 Turns off, Turn off HS200\n\nYou\'ll get dimming controls from the KS230 obviously and you\'ll now have an always connected ""smart button"" that will act as your 4 way.

With version 2.39.0.1073 of the app (the last of the old version), I could set up each individual Kasa bulb to the color and brightness I wanted, then save it as a scene and it would save all of my colors.

That is impossible now.  It seems that if I want to set up a scene now, I am 1) limited to only five preset colors that I need to set ahead of time, 2) those presets can never be changed, and 3) I'd have to poke around each individual setting on each bulb to get what I want (which, of course, is impossible since I can apparently only set a color temperature vs. a specific color).  That's way more work.  There are scenes where some of the bulbs are different hues and brightnesses.

All the app needs is a way to save *your current hue and brightness settings* to a scene. That's it.  They took that away from us. Unless I'm missing something obvious.

I tried installing version 2.39.0.1073 from APK Mirror in a BlueStacks instance, but the app will not continue, forcing me to update.

They made something that was simple to use, now impossible to set the way we like it.

I'm glad my previously created scenes are still available, but I'm stuck with them and can no longer add any others.

Is 24/7 recording required in order to access clips generated when motion is detected? It's presented as if there are 2 options: you can either record only when motion is detected or you can record constantly and motion detection will highlight that moment on the 24/7 timeline.

But after setting everything up the only way it will record anything is through 24/7. With 24/7 turned off I receive notifications when motion is detected but it doesn't note the event in the Activity tab (the one with the bell icon) or in the activity history  on the device page (says I need the subscription service but doesn't explain how it would be different from Activity tab so no way of knowing if I want it?) and I don't see any clips or recordings anywhere. 

If I turn 24/7 on, events and clips are still absent from the activity sections but I can at least see clips in the 24/7 timeline.

I would much rather only be recording after detection is triggered rather than continuously. I can't tell though if something is broken or if I have the wrong expectations.

Can anyone confirm?"	2	"[""seedless0: My understanding is motion-only clips are only availiable if you subsrcibe to their service.\n\nI use 24/7 recording so I don't miss events leading up to the motion trigger anyway.

I have the line in one box with a neutral going to a different circuit, while the box where the lights (load) are have the neutral going to the correct breaker.

As the obvious issue with the neutral in the line box is that it crosses circuits, but in my case its on an AFCI circuit which therefore trips the AFCI breaker as a result. 

Is there a way to wire it so that I can have the satellite switch on the line side rather than the load side to pass the power to the main for the V2 kit?

I know the V1.0 kit that i briefly installed had the satellite on the line side and the main switch on the load side which the main switch functioned however the satellite was non-functional. I believe the reason the main switch got power was because the satellite has the traveller + load (which ended up having line) bundled which was able to power the main switch.

The V2 satellite switch was redesigned and separates the load and traveler instead, therefore unable to pass the power over."	2	"['Paradox52525: AFAIK you can\'t use the KS230 in this scenario.

If a box has both line and neutral they usually come into the box as part of the same 14/2 bundle or similar.  How is it you have a line and neutral in the box but from different circuits?

1671215227.0	16-Dec-2022 10:27:07	Help with wiring 4 gang outlets HS200	v27v	1	znlghu	TPLinkKasa	https://www.reddit.com/r/TPLinkKasa/comments/znlghu/help_with_wiring_4_gang_outlets_hs200/	"So I have a 4 gang outlet box that is wired as below.  Each outlet is labeled A-D, with wire identifiers for easier nomenclature.

For background, I am planning on putting smart switches in for A (hall light), B (fan light), and D (stairs light). C, the celing fan, will be replaced with a general switch to fit the same astetic.

[ex. Existing switches](https://preview.redd.it/btibvgb5xa6a1.png?width=2867&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=27d13f0361c2e679c2eaa5e312ff0590c1f3230e)

So, I have the required neutral wires that the app is calling for, and I know what the grounds are labeled as G.

I have only gotten so far as switch A. where I have an existing 4 wires. Once I add the neutral in I have 5. I assume the two switches black wires would be matched with A1 & A2. The ground is an easy match with G. However, A3 (which I assume is positive) I don't know where I am supposed to connect it to the smart plug.

So overall, I have two questions:

1) Where does the red wire A3, connect to the smart plug?

2) Will Switch C, which will not be smart, need to have a neutral added to it?

&#x200B;

Any help is greatly appreciated."	5	"['Paradox52525: Switch A and switch D appear to be 3-way switches.  You cannot use an HS200 for these, you\'ll need 3-way switches (HS210).  The red and black wires at the top of each of these switches are ""travelers"" that run to another switch in the house somewhere that controls those same lights.  \n\nIf you go with HS210s for these switches, you should only need to replace the switches in this 4-gang box and should be able to leave the existing switches on the other side alone.  Wire ""1"" is your hot wire chaining between all the switches.  This would get connected to the common/black screw on an HS210, and then the red/black pair would each get connected to one of the traveler screws (doesn\'t matter which traveler wire goes to which traveler screw).\n\nSwitch B should work just fine with an HS200 though (as would C if you want to do that rather than a dumb switch).  If you go with a standard switch for C, it typically would not connect into the neutral bundle.', ""MikeP001: Paradox has given you good information, but in the gentlest possible way if you  don't know a 2 way from a 3 way you should hire an electrician.

The ""line"" screw is painted black and in a different side of the switch.  You would connect your black line wire here (wire ""1"" from your image). \n\nThere are then two traveler terminals at the bottom with identical colored screws.  Your traveler black wire (""2"") would connect to one of these and the traveler red (""3"") would connect to the other.  On the HS210 it does not matter which traveler is connected to which traveler screw, just that the two travelers are connected to opposite traveler screws.', 'Paradox52525: The easiest way is to just check how many switches a light can be controlled from.  If you have lights that can be operated from two switches in your house, then both of those switches are three ways (HS210).  This is common for hallway and stairwell lights so you can control them from both ends.  If a light is only operated by a single switch, it\'s a standard single-pole (HS200). There are also 4-way switches that you might find if you have any lights that are controlled from 3+ locations.  \n\nIf you are looking at the switch/wiring, the wire count and color can also clue you in.  I\'m listing the most common/standard colors here, but be aware people don\'t always use standard colors:  \n\nA single-pole switch will only be connected to two wires + ground. Usually both are black (line and load) and they\'ll usually be on the ""top"" and ""bottom"" of the switch. In your picture one of them is red though, which is common for ceiling fans with a light (black will be for either the fan or the light, and red will be for the other).  Regardless, there is one input for power in, and one output for power out.    \n\n3-way switches will be connected to two wires + ground.  One will be the line or load wire (usually black) and the other two will be travelers (usually black and red).  The travelers should belong to the same wire sleeve/bundle and will sometimes be twisted around each other to make it clear they are a traveler pair.  The line/load wire should be connected to a screw terminal on the switch that is a different color (usually that ""common"" screw will be painted black).  The travelers will usually be connected to a pair of screws that are the same color (usually brass/unpainted).  On a two-switch circuit, both switches will be 3-ways, but you usually only need to replace one of the pair to make the entire circuit smart.  Ideally you replace the one on the ""line"" side of the circuit (where power comes in directly from the electrical panel).  Your 4-gang box looks like the line side - I can tell because of the way your 4 existing switches are daisy-chained together - so this would be the correct location to put your HS210s.    \n\n4-way switches are more rare / only used if a light is controlled from 3+ locations.  They will be connected to four wires + ground, and these are usually two sets of travelers, so one ""half"" would have a red and a black connected, and the other ""half"" would have a different red and black connected. Usually 4-way switches are only used in-between 3-way switches, and they don\'t need to be replaced to make a light smart.  Instead, you\'d want to identify the the 3-way switch that is the first in that series of circuits and replace that one instead.   \n\nFYI the HS220 is a single-pole dimmer, so it will only work on lights controlled from a single switch.  If you are planning to replace switches on any lights that are both 3-way \\*and\\* need dimming, you\'d need to pick up a KS230 kit for those (make sure you get the v2 version if possible as it is easier to wire).']"

Any smart switches or other devices added then also get tied together with the rest of the neutrals. \n\nThe only exception would be if you have a switch box that has devices/switches connected to more than one circuit/breaker.  In this case you will have multiple separate neutral bundles (one for each circuit).  In these cases you have to be careful to connect each device to the correct neutral bundle for its circuit without mixing anything up - you should never connect a device that's receiving power from one circuit to the neutral from a different circuit.

I forgot to take a picture of the wiring configuration, but if memory serves me, the red wire was capped to one of the black wires, the ground wires were twisted together and uncapped, and I can’t remember what was happening with the white wires. I assume the hot wire was connected to the dimmer switch. Nothing was grounded. Sigh.

Using a non-contact voltage tester, I found out the white wire is hot. I put some electrical tape as sort of a warning to the next person, but that’s going to be the line.

I’m unsure what to do about the red wire, but I’m certain it’s not a 3 way switch and it’s not a switched outlet. There have been other configurations in the house where I assume the electrician just ran out of 14/2 Romex and finished the job with 14/3.

Can I get some input on which wire I should try as the neutral? I’ve used a few configurations, but I either ran into the issue of the light not turning on while the wifi dimmer switch worked, or the lights would not turn off and the switch didn’t work, or the switch and lights would turn on and immediately off, over and over again."	18	"['Paradox52525: Are these all coming from a single Romex bundle, or two bundles?

A white hot wire often means the circuit is wired with power to the light fixture first (like this: [https://i.stack.imgur.com/qc5cr.gif](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qc5cr.gif)).\n\nHowever that does not appear to be the case for you since you have two Romex bundles coming in to the switch box. It looks more like standard switch-first wiring, but with all of the colors mixed up.\n\nThe house neutral should be part of the same bundle as the always hot (your 14/2).  If you have a neutral, my guess is that it\'s the black wire on the left-hand side / the same sleeve as the white hot.\n\nYou should be able to confirm this pretty easily by connecting the Kasa switch to \\*just\\* the wires from the 14/2.  Connect that white hot wire to the line terminal and the Kasa neutral to the black wire from the same bundle (and ground as normal).  Don\'t connect anything from the 14/3 bundle yet, and turn the power back on.  If the Kasa switch powers up like this and maintains power regardless whether it is ""on"" or ""off"", then we\'ve figured out the house line and house neutral.\n\nDon\'t try anything below here unless all of the above works as expected.\n\nIf the above goes well,  you\'ll then just need to identify which of the two wires from the 14/3 bundle are actually connected to the light fixture.  ""Direction"" doesn\'t matter for most light fixtures, you just need a hot line/load connected to one side of the fixture from the switch, and a neutral from the other side of the fixture tied back to your bundle of neutrals.  Most likely two of the wires from the 14/3 are connected to separate terminals on the light switch, and the third is unused.\n\nSince you think the red was previously tied to a black wire, my theory is the red was used as the neutral from the light fixture, and was tied to the black wire from the 14/2 (which we think is your house neutral).  Assuming this is correct, you\'d tie the red wire from the 14/3, the black wire from the 14/2, and the neutral lead from the Kasa switch all together and this would be your completed neutral bundle.\n\nThe last step would then be identifying whether the remaining white wire or the black wire from the 14/3 is your load wire and connecting it to the Kasa switch\'s load terminal.  There are two ways I can think of to do this:\n\n1. With the circuit breaker off, open up the light fixture and look at which wires are connected. This is really the safest thing to do.\n2. Trial and Error.  Black would normally be the ""correct"" color here so you could try that first and see if the lights come on.  Connecting the ""wrong"" wire and switching the power on should be safe \\*if\\* the other end is disconnected and taped or capped off. If the unused wire is \\*not\\* properly capped off, connecting it to a power source could be dangerous if it\'s close enough to the ground, other wires, or anything metal.  Please use caution and consider just opening up the light fixture if you\'re not sure which is which.\n\nAs always, please be cautious and stop/call an electrician if you encounter anything unexpected or which makes you uncomfortable.', 'redsourpatchkidz: Thanks so much for such thorough help, I have to work soon but I’ll be sure to try this out once I’m home later today.', 'redsourpatchkidz: Once again, thank you for this detailed response.\n\nI connected the white wire on the 14/2 to the line terminal and the black wire on the 14/2 to the neutral, which powered on the dimmer switch with no issue.

This house was built in the mid-1970s, so it’s before a neural wire was a requirement.

That means that either there is a neutral in the light switch box and one of the 14/3 wires needs to be tied to it, or else there is a separate neutral in the light fixture's junction box that runs separately all the way back to the panel.  If the latter is the case you might still be able to get the Kasa switch working since you have extra wires in the 14/3 and could you one to connect the Kasa's neutral to the neutral in the light fixture.\n\nI'd suggest opening up the light fixture next to see what is physically connected to it.  If only wires from the 14/3 are connected then the fixture must be using one of them to run a neutral back to the switch box.  If there is a second Romex bundle running to the light fixture box then that is either a line that brings power to the fixture first, or it's a separate neutral run back to the panel.

As mentioned if the third switch light is turned off the other switches lose power altogether and show offline in the kasa app and manually pressing the switches do nothing. The 3rd switch itself does not lose power only the lights are turned off and the switch is still available to control via the kasa app. When the other switches are on it does not affect any switches when I turn off 1 or 2. Any ideas on how to fix?

And the only way to mitigate that is with a monthly subscription fee. 

We also have Kasa switches and plugs, so we were considering ditching Blink for a Kasa camera, especially as we are about to add a second outdoor camera. 

But we have a few questions and I’m hoping you can help us make a decision:

1. Are there battery powered outdoor Kasa cameras or a battery powered Kasa doorbell?  Are they any good?  The only wiring we have at our front door is the porch light. 

2. How responsive are the Kasa cameras when using local storage?  The Blinks are painfully slow on local storage and we really don’t want to be paying $60+/year for two cameras. 

3.  Are interactions between the cameras and switches possible in the Kasa app or would that require IFTTT?

I am from the Philippines and I have been a TP-Link Kasa user for more than 5 years already. 

Amazon recently began shipping to the Philippines to my excitement, so I ordered several Kasa products. As a careful customer who likes keeping up with technology, I made sure that the voltage ratings are compatible before plugging them in. 

However, the products I ordered (EP10 and KP303) are apparently rated 125V - 60Hz 15A. So I did not plug them in just yet and decided to check my other Kasa items. Wall outlet voltage here in the Philippines is at 220V.

To my surprise, the HS103 smart plug that I have been using for years is rated 100-120V \~60Hz 12A. It has been working perfectly since day 1. 

Now I am just wondering if my newer products are also built to work with 220V but are not printed on the label to comply with US standards?

Based on my research, KP303 works with 220V even if it's rated at 125V. I haven't found anything on the EP10 just yet. My theory is that all the products were manufactured identically, but labelled to the country where they will be delivered and used - especially as most modern gadgets can work with 100-220V.

Maybe anyone can enlighten me on this? 

Thanks!

My sister is debating whether to go with kasa or yolink brand light switches and dimmer.

The kasa brand are dirt cheap at the moment so shes leaning toward that.  Im concerned about wifi usage though.  Shell need 18 of these switches.  I play vr with 3 headsets sometimes over there which is heavy internet usage.  She also may get amazon outdoor cameras too since kasa doesnt have a wireless outdoor version.  That works straight off wifi too.

1.  Are all these switches going to slow the wifi down?  

2.  Do they work well with alexa?

3.  Are they reliable?

The yolink switches work off a hub so they wouldnt hog up the wifi.  Based on their other devicee that i have, they are super reliable and have very fast response times.  But kasa is way cheqper than yolink at the moment so if tbe work well, sister will go with kasa."	7	"['djjustin12: Kasa switches, like other IoT devices for the most part use very low bandwidth.

The separate bands will not interfere with each other at all.  \n\nAdditionally, if you have a newer WiFi 6 router, multi-device support is much better than the previous generations and it's unlikely ~30 devices would be a problem even if they were all sharing a band.  \n\nI would only be concerned if you have an older router."", 'teenbean12: I have 9 light switches, 10 wall plugs, 1 light bulb and 4 Kasa cameras.

I have about 20+ devices, switches, plugs and such in the home.  However I keep getting an email every ten minutes that a device is attempting to login to my account.  It has no information, device id, ip address or anything.

I'm trying to figure out what is trying to access my account or if its maybe an old cell phone or something but I can't figure it out.  I also use Hubitat/Alexa to control some of the devices but they seem unaffected by the login as they are locally controlled in general .

&#x200B;

I'm getting this email every ten minutes for the past 3 days (over 200 emails in the past few days)

Any idea how to narrow down what device is trying to login?  I tried to contact chat support but they were not helpful and told me to redownload the app on my phone (which is already logged in and working fine)

Is it likely that the top wire is the load, the wire directly below it is the line, and the wire that is attached to the screw an outgoing line?

If this is correct, should I be joining the incoming and outgoing lines together with KASA's line wire?

Or am completely off and I should probably just hire an electrician?

He also bought a TP-Link Deco AXE5400 Mesh system which I installed in the house and outbuildings.  His system is very snappy and the Alexa and HomeAssistant (HomeKit bridge) integrations are snappy and work 98% of the time properly.  


I was so impressed with his setup and simplicity of the solution that I decided to swap out all of my old ZWave switches.    


I installed about Sixty (60) Kasa HS200/210/220/230 switches and a couple EP10 smart plugs.

The system is an absolute catastrophe.   

The Kasa app is literally unusable.  When I open it on my phone or tablet, it takes at least 10-15 seconds to even start responding with switch status.  It's completely frozen at first.  Once it becomes responsive, it freezes whenever you do anything.  Even scrolling around causes it to freeze.  Sometimes once it settles it will start to work somewhat normally, but it's nothing like the responsiveness of my dad's system.

 I was using commercial Cisco wireless (3800/9100 series), so knowing that was a few years old, I thought I'd get the same Deco AXE5400s (knowing it was working well for my dad) to ensure it wasn't some compatibility issue.

As I migrated switches to the new Deco WiFi (we're talking an experience which takes hours to do having to go to each switch and use the app to re-pair it) it was working like a champ until I got to about 20 devices, when it started to get a bit laggy.   I started to experience random switches losing WiFi signal so I dug in and see that having 5Ghz and 2.4GHz bands on the same SSID causes the switches issues.  I then moved the switches to a 2.4 GHz only network and they all stay connected reliably.

That said, the app is still completely unusable.  Same random pauses.

So I installed the iPad Kasa App on my M1 Macbook to see how that does.  Same freezing and lag.  Grrr!

 I decided to sniff the network traffic to see exactly what the app is doing.   It's a complete dumpster fire in terms of communication.  It's constantly setting up and tearing down TCP sessions to the various switches to ask for status.  It appears to be asking for every switch on the system which is a blocking behavior in the app, causing the freezes.  I see it reusing TCP ports which it had already used causing connection failures.  It's literally mindblowing that such a poorly engineered piece of software is considered viable in a product that they sell!

I'm so far sunk into this thing I need to figure it out.  With my same exact wifi setup I moved 10 switches to a different account.  They all respond at full speed like you'd expect.  When I move them back... so... laggy....

So beyond my rant, I've got a legitimate question.  Does anyone here have a large scale (50+ devices) Kasa setup that actually works??  

I'd love ANY insight to making my investment in these switches return some value!

Edit: for future generations that hit this issue — the fix was suggested below.  Disabling local network access in iOS settings (thus forcing the Kasa app to use the cloud relay) fixed the issue completely.

The more interesting (to me) API is local over TCP.   My app tries to use the UDP multicast poll interface (kasa uses a non-standard port that some routers block).  It will only make direct TCP connections to devices that fail to respond to UDP.  The connections are short term so there\'s no problem with reusing ports.\n\nYour issues sound a bit like too many concurrent \\*wifi\\* clients - routers drop clients and kasa\'s can take a while to notice.  Odd though that it works for your father.  The other could be  AP placement, with the kasa\'s trying to join to the wrong or all of the same APs and getting a weak signal.  One thing to try might be using your old router as an AP with a different SSID, move problematic kasa devices to it one at a time to see how it goes.\n\nBTW, and easier (but not the most secure) way to change routers is to re-use the old SSID and password, at most you need to restart or power cycle the kasas.', 'WhoaDudeHuh: I have 20+ devices and I haven’t fully converted everything waiting for confirmation of reliability.

I really only know when I catch the dreaded red Wi-Fi symbol. Here is my setup:

Modem -> pfsense router -> switch -> Wi-Fi 

My Wi-Fi is an Orbi router and two satellites. The router is in AP mode and the satellites are hardwired. All three go back to the switch. 

I’ve also set the channels for 2.4ghz to a manual channel of 3, no auto. I’m using the main Wi-Fi not the IoT.

The Kasa app will show switches offline when they are really on. As my hombridge can easily control them.

I’m trying to figure out why all of the sudden things are disconnecting or is it because I’m just catching it at the right time. I’ve noticed the ones that seem to be the problem are the farthest away. And none of my plugs or bulbs seem to have an issue.

I’m wondering if maybe three Wi-Fi mesh nodes is two much. I have two upstairs and one downstairs. Upstairs as less problems. Maybe I should do just one up and one down. My square footage is 3,499.

Overall Kasa is great. I’ve never had any real problems. And switches reconnect on their own just fine. Haven’t yet tried a full reset and re add. Wanted to see what other people thought first. Maybe just live with it for now? Reach out to TP Link? I don’t want to switch Wi-Fi.

Recently (last month or so) more and more of the plugs are moving to 'local only' control, and not moving out of it.

Not sure why.

There is a mix of KP115's, KP105's, HS110's and various bulbs. About 15 are local control only now.

They have automatic firmware updates disabled as (being in the UK) newer firmware removes local control in some cases. There is no correlation by model number (e.g. it's not all the KP115's) and the devices are all on the same firmware by model.

I have full control of the network and access points, including routing. There are no firmware changes on any part of the network internally.

I can't see any networking 'barriers' between the local only plugs and the gateway. Power cycling doesn't change anything. I'm loathe to try removing and re-adding just now as some of these devices will require a cherry picker hiring to reach them again.

Any thoughts?"	3	"[""amy33amy33: It's probably the lack of updates, the updating is happening to make the lightbulbs still work with the servers over time.

I have a double pole switch that was already had a dimmer switch in it. I replaced it with the smart wiring and it is getting power (I know bc there’s a small light on the switch itself and I was able to setup the WiFi on it) but the lights won’t turn on. I thought maybe I got a lemon so I exchanged it and it’s still not working. 

Weird things: 1) There are three black wires in the main box, but I think one of them is a pass through to power the intercom by the front door. 2)  The wires in the satellite box are black, red, and white. I believe the white one is the load wire (because switch gets power when connected) but am not 100% sure?

Is it possible that this is a 240v circuit? The switch is rated for 120v so maybe it’s just not working? The switch is Kasa KS230 V2 Smart Wi-Fi Dimmer Switch 3-Way Kit Version 2.8 (I had and exchanged a 1.0 before).\\

I got overconfident after the first two (single pole) switches were so easy. \n\nWith the Kasa switch, where would the load wire go? Alongside the black traveler wire?"", 'Paradox52525: Unfortunately the KS230 works a little differently than a regular 3-way switch and only officially supports a configuration where you have two connected light switches ""before"" the light fixture itself.  Basically from what I understand, Traveler 1 is actually used for the primary and satellite to communicate with each other, and Traveler 2 is used to transmit the actual power.  Because of this, you can\'t combine either of the KS230 kit switches with ""normal"" 3-way switches and the kit itself doesn\'t support every possible wiring scenario.\n\nThere is an unofficial way I thought of that *might* work, but please proceed at your own risk as I am not an electrician or any kind of real expert.  Please call a real electrician if you\'re at all uncomfortable.\n\nIf you want to continue:\n\nFirst refer to this diagram, which shows a common method of wiring a 3-way light switch with the light in the middle.  This *might* be the way your switches were wired (the colors and wire counts seem to match, but there\'s never any guarantee your installer followed this exact example).\n\n[http://www.howtowirealightswitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/single-light-between-3-way-switches-power-via-switch.jpg](http://www.howtowirealightswitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/single-light-between-3-way-switches-power-via-switch.jpg)\n\nThe key thing to notice here in the above is that at the light switch, the black traveler wire from the first switch actually gets spliced to the \\*white\\* traveler going to the second switch, and the black traveler going to the second switch gets spliced to a white neutral.  This means that for the traveler wires coming in to the second box, the white is actually one of your toggled hot travelers, and the black is actually a neutral.  There technically isn\'t a ""load"" wire anymore because these wires have already passed through the load (the light fixture). It\'s actually the neutral that gets connected to the common terminal on the switch because then the circuit will be completed via either Traveler 1 or Traveler 2 carrying your power. In this example, the red traveler is just tied to red and is effectively bypasses the light fixture as a straight pass-through functioning as your other toggled hot travler.\n\nThe problem is we can\'t guarantee your lights are actually wired like this example (I\'m particularly worried about the black/white color swap that is shown in the example and whether or not your installer did the same thing).  If you have a voltage tester or multimeter you can put your original dumb 3-way switch back in box 1, turn on the power, and then \\*carefully\\* test which of the 3 travelers in switch box 2 are hot when switch 1 is on or off.  What you should see if you do this is that one wire will be hot when switch 1 is off, a different wire will be hot when switch 1 is on, and the third wire will never be hot.  The one that is never hot is the neutral.\n\nAlternatively you could open up your light fixture while the breaker is off and visually check how the travelers sets are spliced together.\n\nThe way you\'d wire things is below - this assumes the wire/colors are the same as the example diagram.  If you find that your lights are wired differently you will need to make adjustments:\n\nPrimary Switch:\n\n1. Connect the black Line / Always hot wire to the Common terminal (black screw). I think the Line is the black wire coming in from the bottom of the box. If one of the black wires is for your intercom, tie this together with the hot wire as well.\n2. Connect the Red traveler to the Traveler 1 (specifically) terminal. Traveler 1 is the wire used for communication so you need to use whichever traveler wire ""bypasses"" the light fixture and connect that same wire to Traveler 1 terminal on the satellite switch.\n3. Connect the Black traveler to the Traveler 2 terminal\n4. Connect all of the white neutrals together\n5. Connect the ground/green as usual\n\nSatellite Switch\n\n1. Connect the black traveler wire (or whichever you find out is the ""neutral traveler"") to the common terminal / black screw.\n2. Connect the Red traveler (or whichever one color you figure out is the ""bypass"" traveler) to the Traveler 1 terminal\n3. Connect the white traveler (or whichever color you figure out is the other hot traveler) to the Traveler 2 terminal\n4. Ground as usual\n\nGood luck!']"

Hello All,

I'm trying to install n HS210 in my dining room, and I don't think I can, but looking for the wisdom of the group.

In the dining room I have a light/fan.  The light is controlled by two switches, one of which is a dimmer.   In the same box as the 2nd switch there is a switch that controls the fan as well.

Above is the wiring as I can see it.  The white circles are wire nuts.  Pink lines are white wires.  I've not drawn the ground wires for simplicity, but every switch has a ground wire attached to it.

I'm semi-guessing, but I think 1 is the line in, which then goes over 2 to make the rotary the ""1st switch"".   Then they used the white and red wire as travelers back to the 2nd switch, which is then has the load as a red wire.

Now here is my dilemma, if the above is correct, then I believe I need to put the HS210 where the dimmer is currently since that's where the always hot wire is.  However, there is no neutral in that box, so I can't

If I use the always hot 2 in the 2-gang box, then I can have power and a neutral, but no load wire in the single gang box.

Actually, as I'm typing this... could I:

1.  Put the HS210 in the 2-gang box, hooked up to the always hot line (#1), and the neutral
2. Leave the dimmer in the 1 gang box as is.
3. Take the black wire labeled 2, and wire nut it to the red wire currently attached to the black screw of the light switch in the 2-gang box, which I believe is going to the light.

Thanks, and sorry for the convoluted description here.  Appreciate any help I can get."	4	"[""Slugmatic: Yes, what you described at the end of your post should work, provided you have a neutral in that 2-gang box. If I were you, I'd break out the multimeter to make sure all your assumptions are correct prior to changing anything, though."", ""Paradox52525: Is there an actual neutral in the 2-gang box?  In your diagram it looks like the white(pink) wire is just part of a traveler bundle going to the rotary dimmer.  As long as there is a real separate neutral available then yes,I believe your plan would work.  Make sure to label things well and thoroughly test since you have a lot of like-colored wires.\n\nAssuming you have a real neutral in the 2-gang box you could also use a ks230 kit instead of an hs210 so you'd have dimming at both locations.  With the ks230 only the primary switch needs a neutral, so you'd put that in the 2-gang box and replace the rotary dimmer with the satellite switch."", 'relkin314: Thanks.  Good call on the multimeter, just need some longer leads...', ""relkin314: Thanks! \n\nI think the two whites tied together at the top of the diagram are true neutrals.  I have neutrals everywhere else in the house. I'll probably disconnect everything and check that the wire I believe is the wire from the panel is hot and everything else cold.  If that is the case then that white is neutral, and I'll tie the switch into that.\n\nI'll look up the ks230 kit.\n\nI'm also considering replacing with the dimmer with a regular 3 way switch, don't really need the dimming, but do want to keep the additional switch for convinience.""]"

In the last version of the app, I was able to use groups to conveniently control multiple sets of lights’ brightness and color all at once, then set a scene based off the current light configuration in the house that I just visually created. Does anyone know if this is still possible?

Now in the new app, it appears I have to program them one by one - and with no visual feedback as to what’s happening while I’m doing it. This is terrible UX. 

When I first started looking at smart lights I tried a bunch and CHOSE Kasa based off how the old Kasa app worked. It was so convenient for creating lighting schemes. Now pulling this feature after I’ve gone all-in feels like a bait and switch and I want my money back or the old app back - It wasn’t broken and didn’t need to be fixed… now I’m broke and do need to be fixed."	3	['runrvs: Agree.

&#x200B;

I currently own a few KP105 plugs that I use to control floor and table lamps where I live.

&#x200B;

These plugs, and the light switches on the individual lamps, are in hard to reach places so I was wondering whether anyone had a recommendation for a battery powered toggle switch I could use (almost similar to a remote control) as I am becoming frustrated by having to retrieve my phone to activate the plugs. I am unable to connect these KP105 plugs to plug sockets that are controlled by a wall mounted switch.

&#x200B;

Ideally, this switch would be able control multiple plugs at once.

&#x200B;

Thanks"	5	['rgnet5: Do you have an Amazon Echo?  Or a Google Home.

My main issue with the current KASA bulbs is that they could be brighter, lumens wise. I was looking at smart bulbs that are in the same price range as KASA bulbs, however they have more lumens.

I am just disappointed in the communication by KASA, and wish that there was more info so that I could make a better purchase. As well, I have seen that Matter Protocol might be implemented soon; is that something that I should look out for?

TL;DR - Want 8 bulbs total; currently have 4 KASA ones. I do not mind making the switch to a different ecosystem, if better ones are out there.

The main location where I wanted to put the main has a neutral tap, but no line going into the existing dimmer. The place that I want to place the satellite switch at has no neutral, however, I think the problem is that the load is on that satellite side.  I am not sure what to do since, I can't re-locate the main at the satellite location since I have no neutral tap there.

The box where the primary switch will go needs to have: line (from the power box), neutral, two travelers, and ground.  The satellite switch does not need a neutral and should just have: load (to the light fixture), two travelers, and ground.  \n\nThe picture you posted does look a bit odd - I\'m not an expert but that doesn\'t actually look like a three-way switch to me (it looks like it has only two screw terminals + the one for ground).  It looks more like a single switch where the load and one of the travelers are sharing the bottom terminal. Can the two existing switches actually both operate the light independently?  Is there a separate screw terminal on the lefthand side that\'s hidden in this picture? \n\nIn any case it sounds to me like you have the wires you need in the right places, unless I\'m misunderstanding something.  A picture of the ""primary"" box and wiring might help clarify things if you still have questions.', ""Natoochtoniket: The first step is to identify the existing wires, with certainty.   Use a non-contact voltage tester, or an AC volt meter, to absolutely identify which wire is the 'hot' wire.   Then identify the travelers, and which wire goes to the load at the second 3-way switch.  \n\nIf the existing switches work, and the light turns on, there must be a 'hot' wire connected, somewhere.   Knowing which one it is, is essential.  No guessing allowed."", ""LThanda: I actually have exactly the same issue.  For people who are having trouble understanding:  \n\nThe Kasa satellite switch is designed to only work on the load side of the pair.  /u/Monkeypet and I both have a situation where the netural wire is only on the load side, no neutral on the line side. \n\nSince the neutral is on the load side, but not on the line, we can't put the Main switch on the line side. But the switches themselves don't seem to have an available configuration for that setup :("", ""Monkeypet: Thanks. I think the issue is that the hot wire as identified using a volt meter is located at the satellite side, and at that location, there is no neutral, so I can't relocate the main there."", 'diearzte2: Did you find a solution for this?

The other side, let\'s call it ""main"" has BLACK (common not hot/line), RED, WHITE. However the ""main"" junction has neutral also, but the existing dimmer 3-way switch doesn\'t use it.

There are two switches that control them, one at the top of the stairs and one at the bottom.  Both locations do have neutral wires.  I've wired several other Kasa switches including 3 way upstairs with no issues and went into putting these in without realizing they were wired with power to the fixture first.

How many wire strands are in the bundle that's coming from the light fixture to the first switch? I believe two (plus ground) would be the minimum possible, but if there are un-used extras that could give you some options. \n2. How many wire strands are in the traveler bundle that goes from box 1 to box 2?  I think minimum three are required in light-first wiring, but again if there happen to be unused extras that gives us some options. \n3.

To me it looks like:\n\nBottom of Stairs Box: Seems straightforward - Two Romex, both yellow sleeved.  One appears to be Black, White, Ground - the other appears to be the traveler bundle with Black, White, Red, Ground.  The Whites from each bundle are wire-nutted together and the rest is wired as I\'d expect for a three-way switch.  \n\nTop of Stairs Box: It\'s harder to tell what\'s going on here.  I can only see one Romex in the picture, but you\'ve said there are three? It looks to me like there\'s a white/grey sleeved bundle in the upper left with Black, White, and Ground?  I can\'t make out any other Romex bundles in the picture, but since I can see black and red travelers connected to the switch I\'m guessing the yellow-sleeved traveler bundle from the bottom of stairs box comes into this box somewhere (lower right?) and that\'s where the red and black wires connected to the switch traveler terminals are coming from.  Again, there are two white tied together.  I think I see the extra unconnected wire you were talking about, but can\'t make out which Romex bundle it belongs to.  Which bundle is this coming from?  Is there actually a third romex bundle in there somewhere I can\'t see?\n\nSorry to ask more questions, I\'m just confused because this doesn\'t look like any of the examples of light-first wiring I was able to find (I would expect the ""second"" light switch box to only have a single Romex with the travelers).  It looks a lot more like typical switch-switch-light from what I can tell with the pictures.  Do you have a non-contact voltage tester to double check if any either of those black common wires is always hot?', 'None: Ok I finally carved out some time to look at this again. So sorry it’s taken me so long to get back to you.

The other has the white into the neutral bundle and the black connected to the right side of the switch on the top. \n\nI have one romex coming in on the right. It has black connected to the left side of the switch, red connected to the right and white into the neutral bundle. \n\nI also tested the voltage and I have constant 120v to both of the right screws on the switch even with the switch off.

When I tried before I used a Kasa 3-way switch HS210.  I've tried one at the top of the stairs, one at the bottom, and one in each location simultaneously.

At this point it might be time to throw in the towel and call an electrician.  I still think there's probably a way this can be wired to an HS210, but figuring out how could be tricky.  \n\nIf you want to continue trying to figure this out on our own, the only next step I can think of would be to do a very detailed wire audit scanning the circuit in multiple states to see if we can figure out which wire(s) aren't what they appear to be. \n\nTo do this, what I'd recommend is that you turn off the power first, then unscrew both switches from their boxes and pull them out of the wall a bit with all of the wires still hooked up.  Then bend all of the wires connected to both switches away from each other a bit - the idea here is just to spread them out to make them easy to scan and make sure they aren't close enough to each other to trigger a false positive on a non-contact voltage tester.  \n\nOnce this is done, turn the power back on and then carefully scan whether each of the wires is energized or not in each combination of switch states.  I'm hoping if we can see which wires are energized in various states, it will become more clear how this circuit is wired.  I made a quick Google doc to help document this here - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NgbK8ir0241jlmaHgik6Y1XcKuJ0KPxvLWkae4pmbYY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NgbK8ir0241jlmaHgik6Y1XcKuJ0KPxvLWkae4pmbYY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nNOTE: If this is getting to be too much work, or you're uncomfortable doing any of this please just call an electrician as it's always better to be safe.

And do we still think they’re wired power to the fixture or was my friend wrong?', 'Paradox52525: The flickering behavior that the top switch gets when the bottom switch is ""up"" is what Kasa switches tend to do when they don\'t have a neutral connected.  So based on that I\'d guess a smart switch brand that doesn\'t need a neutral would probably work. \n\nAs to the wiring - it\'s hard to say.  All of the wiring diagrams I found online for lights-first and lights-middle had fewer total wire bundles coming in to one of both of the switch boxes, but it can\'t be totally standard switch-first wiring either or your install should have worked.

Serious about the beer. Send me your Venmo. \n\nI just filled out the google doc. I don’t have a non contact voltage detector but I have a voltmeter. So anywhere I said Y I was getting 120.

Unfortunately I can't make any sense out of what's happening and I'm gonna have to recommend calling in an electrician at this point :/.  Something is off here and I can't seem to figure out what. \n\nThere are just too many weird things going on:\n\n1. The black common in the upstairs box is acting like a standard line (always hot), but if that were the case the Kasa switch shouldn't be losing power regardless of the state of the other switch.  When the bottom switch is up, something is somehow interrupting either the black common going to the top box, or the neutral end of the circuit.  \n2. In the second state (bottom off, top on), both travelers are hot, and AFAIK this should never happen.  The top switch (assuming it is actually on the line side) should be toggling a connection between common <-> traveler 1, and common <-> traveler 2 so you should never get a state where both travelers are hot at the same time.    \n3. The neutrals being always hot *might* be normal because right now the Kasa switch is installed and will always be drawing power for its wifi radio.  \n\nThe wire count vs behavior just doesn't make sense.  This circuit seems to be either wired in a very creative way, or something is actually wrong (like incorrectly crossed wires, or possibly even a short from a nail, ect) and having a professional in to figure it out is probably the best and safest move.  \n\nAs for me - I do this because I'm an obsessive problem solver and it's an interesting learning opportunity, so don't worry about that!

The best way to go about that is probably to start out with everything disconnected (IE remove both switches) and just see what you can detect off of the loose disconnected wires first.  If you can positively map the wires in box #1 to the wires in box #2 that might help, as well as identifying any wires that are still hot without any switches connected (particularly if there is more than one). \n\nAfter that, probably re-install the top-of-stairs switch only and do some more testing to make sure it's functioning as expected without a switch downstairs (IE, power coming in, switch receiving power+neutral/wifi, switch toggling power between one traveler and the other but not both).   \n\nIf you want, you can use the same Google sheets view to document what you find and I'll take a look to try to help make sense of things.  \n\nIf that still doesn't help, the last thing I can think of to do would be to start taking apart your light fixtures and examining the wiring connected to each one.

Re-install the Kasa top switch, but connect only the always-hot black (to common), neutral (into the neutral bundle), and ground.  Leave the travelers disconnected at both ends.  In this state, the Kasa switch will control nothing, but should still get power and be able to join the WiFi.  Since there is no load connected, the switch might always think it is off / light ring might always be visible (but I'm not sure).  I'd try toggling it in this state to see if it does the weird pulsing thing, which you should be able to tell because the switch will click repeatedly. If the switch appears to be able to retain power to itself, move on to stage 2. \n\nStage 2: Connect the travelers to the Kasa switch only, leaving them loose in the bottom box.  Turn the power back on and scan your traveler wires for voltage.  If possible do this in both boxes.  What we *should* see is that only the red \\*or\\* black traveler wire is hot at one time, and the Kasa switch will toggle between them.  If this is the case for the travelers in both boxes, move to Stage 3.  If both travelers are hot at the same time in any switch state, it can only mean that they are being bridged somehow/somewhere upstream and we'd have to figure out how and where. \n\nStage 3: Connect the travelers to the downstairs switch but do not connect the common black (load).  AFAIK it should not matter which terminal gets the black traveler and which gets red, but you could try both permutations just to be see.  The lights still aren't connected, but you should again be able to see only one traveler at a time energized.  Only the top switch should change which traveler is energized - the bottom switch should only be toggling which traveler is being connected into the common terminal.  Try out all states for both switches and make sure the Kasa doesn't start pulsing.  If we get failures here with no load connected, I would suspect a physically defective bottom switch.  If this happens, I'd try replacing the bottom switch with a new dumb 3-way switch first just to keep things simple and then retest.  In fact that might not be a terrible idea regardless.  \n\nStage 4: Finally add the load wire to the common terminal on the bottom switch.  Test everything again, verifying only one traveler is hot at a time.  See if the pulsing behavior comes back on the Kasa switch.  If it only comes back at this point, that would make me think that the load wire is somehow crossed with one of the travelers.  \n\nI think if we figure out at which stage the anomaly starts to happen it will point us at where to look next."", 'None: I was hoping for something weird too. Honestly this entire time I’ve kind of been hoping I just did something dumb that would be an easy fix for you! Lol\n\nOk so here we go:\n\nSo I started to go through your list tonight and both with stage 1 and stage 2 the Kasa switch doesn’t appear to get power at all. No lights on the front whatsoever and pressing the switch does nothing. I did confirm I was getting 120 on the common screw. \n\nAt that point I kind of went rogue so I’m really hoping that somewhere along the way I give you some information they may be useful. \n\nI left everything connected at the top of the stairs and at the bottom I wire nutted the black traveler. This gave me the same flashing/clicking behavior as before. \n\nI then switched and wire nutted the red traveler and common wire downstairs which gave me the result of lights on. I finally thought to check some voltages at this point and was getting 120 on the common and both travelers upstairs. \n\nI then decided to take the spare romex I was using for continuity testing to bypass the traveler cables just to see if I could eliminate one thing as the issue. \n\nWhen I did this it behaves exactly the same as when I use the in wall travelers. \n\nAt this point, with the kasa upstsirs and dumb 3 way downstairs I stepped through the different phases and tried to take some notes and voltages to see if anything would be of help. \n\nThat went as follows:\n\nTurn on breaker\n\nLights off\n\nKasa has status lights, 120 on common and one traveler\n\nToggle Kasa\n\nLights flash, kasa clicks\n\nToggle downstairs\n\nLights go off\n\nKasa still has power\n\nToggle downstairs\n\nLights flash\n\nToggle downstairs\n\nLights go off\n\nToggle Kasa\n\nLights go on \n\nKasa loses status lights, 120 on common and both travelers\n\nToggling Kasa does nothing\n\nToggle bottom\n\nLights go off\n\nKasa gets status lights back \n\nSo in summary, sorry for going off script but when things didn’t go as expected right off the bat with stage 1 I wasn’t sure if continuing down that path would be helpful or not. \n\nThanks as always for any advice you can offer!', ""Paradox52525: That was some thorough testing, and bypassing the travelers with your own romex was a clever idea - that lets us rule out that the travelers are being interrupted or spliced somewhere. \n\nI'm still completely confused as to how power is getting to both travelers at once, even when you bypassed the in-wall travelers with your own. And also why the Kasa switch didn't get power when connected to just the line and neutral upstairs (which should work AFAIK).  \n\nLet's try this if you're still willing:\n\n1. Install a dumb 3-way upstairs in the typical manner.  Hot black to common and travelers to travelers.  Disconnect everything downstairs.  Verify we're getting power only on one traveler at a time. \n2. Hook the Kasa switch up downstairs.  Connect only the two travelers, the ground, and the neutral (no common).  See if the switch will power on this way.  If it does, see if it stays powered on in the various states for both switches.  Check to see if we're getting power to one or both travelers at a time. \n3. If everything is sane up to this point, you can try hooking up the downstairs common to see what happens.  \n\nSorry for continuously asking for more tests :S nothing about this circuit is making sense to me."", 'None: I swear these lights will be the death of me. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)\n\nPlease don\'t apologize for asking me to do more tests!  I really appreciate all the help you\'ve given me thus far and I\'m actually learning a lot more about wiring along the way, plus this will make ""normal"" smart switch installs a breeze now!  I\'m getting much faster. :-)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk so here\'s what happened:\n\n1. Voltage does switch back and forth between the travelers when I flip the switch.  I get 120 on one and then 20-30 on the other and then when I flip the switch, they swap.  Not sure if the 20-30 on the opposite traveler is normal?\n2. With no common, I once again get no status lights on the kasa switch.  I do however start getting 120 on both travelers and the common screw.\n3. Hooked up the common wire for just the hell of it and we\'re back to the same flashing pattern with the dumb 3 way pattern we had when it was installed upstairs.\n\nAnd then last but not least, I happened across a cheap leviton smart switch at our local bin store and thought I could try it just for the hell of it.  It does require a neutral as well.  I left the traveler/common jumpered downstairs and hooked it upstairs and it just gives me nothing at all as far as status lights.  No flashing and power only on the line side.\n\nI then decieded to jumper one of the travelrrs and the common at the bottom of the stairs and try using a HS200 single pole switch I bought just to see if it would work.  Striaght to the flashing when I hook it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then last but not least, I happened across a cheap leviton smart switch at our local bin store and thought I could try it just for the hell of it.

No flashing and power only on the line side.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did test it in another room just to make sure it worked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo this almost has to be an issue with my neutrals right?  I feel like there might be some wire tracing in my dropped ceiling in the near future.  At this point, I\'ve put in too much work to give up! :-)', ""Paradox52525: It's definitely sounding like an issue with the neutrals to me.  The white wires in the boxes either aren't neutrals at all (which seems unlikely) or something is wrong with them. Some wire tracing is probably going to be necessary :)\n\nIn theory, the neutral wire that comes in via the same Romex as the always hot black should be the neutral run back to your box.  You could try separating the neutral bundle in the top box and hooking up a Kasa switch (the HS200 might be easiest for simplicity) to just line, that single neutral strand, and ground to see if that powers the unit consistently.  Be careful not to ever bridge the line and neutral directly without a load/device in between them (but having just a Kasa switch should be fine).\n\nIf that works, I'd suspect an issue with the neutral wiring downstream within the switches or lights.  \n\nIf that doesn't work, I'd try to trace upstream and see if you can identify what junction or other device that first wire run is coming from, and then see if there are weird splices or loose connections along the way."", ""None: ![gif](giphy|YEL7FJP6ed008)\n\nIt's working!\n\nNeutral issues like you said.  I spent all day yesterday in the ceiling tracing lines out between all of the fluorescent lights in my basement.  Several neutrals just weren't connected at all.  Some junction boxes had wires run in that weren't stripped at all like the ones we saw in the upstairs box, but some of those were the neutrals that needed to be connected.  It's like when they wired them they just started randomly connecting cables until the lights came on without actually looking where everything came from.  Feels really good to know that everything is wired properly now.\n\nWhen we moved in, we put up a wall downstairs to make two rooms, and the lights in both rooms were still on one switch. So, this also gave me the perfect excuse to put those on separate switches which I've been meaning to do forever.\n\nSo now, two rooms, both with Kasa switches, working flawlessly!\n\nSeriously, thanks so much for all of your guidance through the process.  It was a pain in the ass to re-wire everything, but I learned a lot through the process and I really appreciate you pushing me to not just give up and find a product that worked without neutrals."", ""Paradox52525: That's fantastic! It's a great feeling when you finally manage to work out an issue with a project like this.  You should be proud for sticking with it and finally managing to get it working!\n\nI was glad to be able to help.

I wanted to make people aware of this program because its free to use and its an easy way to start your process of converting your appliances and your home overall into a smart home plus it also helps you to reduce your energy bill by turning off your smart plugs during their OhmHours which typically occur during peak hours when energy can be more expensive.

I have 3 KASA KL130 bulbs. 

Everything works fine when I control them manually - setting colour and brightness etc. I gave the app local network permissions too.

This would *probably* work using the primary switch from the KS230, but doing this wouldn\'t save you money because I don\'t believe Kasa sells a 3-way dimmer that\'s not part of primary/satellite pair.\n\nIf you don\'t care about the dimming feature, you can definitely pair Kasa\'s regular 3-way smart switch (HS210) with a dumb 3-way on the other side.

How many traveller wires are going between the two boxes?  Usually there's just two, but sometimes people will use a 3 or 4 strand cable to run the travellers and you can splice one of them to the neutral to make it available in the other box.  If not I think you're out of luck :S"", 'Paradox52525: I\'m not an electrician so bear with me...\n\n4-ways (AFAIK) are usually used in configurations where you have 3+ light switches, and the circuit they are part of should start and end with a 3-way switch, like:\n\nPower/Line --> 3-way switch --> 4-way switch --> 3-way switch --> Light Fixture/Load\n\nYou \\*cannot\\* use the KS230 (3-way dimmer) on a circuit like that.  The KS230 does some signaling between the primary/satellite using the traveler wires, and having a 4-way switch sitting between them will break that communication (a 4-way essentially flips the connections between the two travelers back and forth, so the traveler connections between the KS230 primary and satellite would not always be as expected). \n\nYou \\*can\\* use a Kasa non-dimmer 3-way switches (HS210) on a circuit like this.  You would need to identify and replace the ""first"" (line side) 3-way switch and replace that one with an HS210.  Usually replacing just this one switch is enough to make the circuit smart with all functionality.  Sometimes in cases where you have a long wire run or many switches though the single HS210 will not be able to accurately determine its on/off state.  In that case, you can install a pair of HS210\'s on that circuit replacing both the ""first"" and ""last"" 3-way switches and then pair them in the Kasa app during setup.  In all cases though you\'d leave the 4-way switches alone.  Kasa doesn\'t even make a smart 4-way switch, and generally you don\'t need to replace these to get smart functionality for the lights.  \n\nAs an example, in my house I have a pair of ceiling light fixtures that are controlled by 4 switches total.  The way this is wire is:\n\nLine/Power --> 3-way --> 4-way --> 4-way --> 3-way --> Lights\n\nIn my case I had to replace both of the 3-way switches in this circuit with HS210s, but left the dumb 4-way switches alone and everything works.', 'UI_Design21: Yeah only the 2 travelers 😕 stinks because I wanted to dim my bathroom lights but I’m probably gonna have to check out a switch that doesn’t require a neutral.', 'UI_Design21: I’m assuming no matter what I do if I want to use a smart switch I’d have to put the main switch in that box w the line wire (that doesn’t have a neutral)? I can’t keep a dumb switch there and then put the smart one in the box with neutral wire.', 'Paradox52525: If you use a non-dimmer 3-way like an HS210 it *might* work fine to put it on the load side with the neutral and keep a dumb 3-way on the line side.  Sometimes if you do this the switch will be unable to detect its own on/off state which limits functionality, but sometimes it will work 100%. \n\nBut the KS230 3-way dimmer AFAIK only works if you can properly install the full pair.  \n\nThe other alternative would be to talk to an electrician about pulling a neutral to the line-side box.  They have some clever ways to run wires and can sometimes do this without having to cut holes in the walls.']"

Is there any way to deal with this, using the smart switches and still  keeping it a three way?  I.e., could I connect the incoming power  directly to the switch on the left, and connect the load headed out to  the light via the black wire on the same romex as the two travelers,  reversing which switch has the line and which has the load?

One  alternative that works is to connect the black hot and one of the  travelers at the switch on the right, and then just use a normal two-way  smart switch at the box on the left, but I'd prefer to keep the  three-way function if possible.

It appears that when I set a schedule on a smart bulb the change will not occur unless power is applied to the bulb. For example, if the light is set to dim at sunset but the light bulb is off then when I switch the light on after sunset it will be in whatever setting it was in previously instead of being dimmed as I would like.

These bulbs are useless without phone/voice control :("", ""brucebay: Unfortunately  I don't think there is a work around.

I have a single HS103 smart plug I got during Prime Day in 2021. It connected perfectly in the room above where my router is. It’s worked flawlessly ever since with my Echo and scheduling in the Kasa app. Love it. So I bought a 3-pack of the same model during Prime Day this year. I am trying to connect one of the new ones to run a fan in my bedroom, which is the same room where my router is. I got it successfully connected only once, but then my Echo kept saying it wasn’t responding when I tried to turn it on by voice. So I reset the smart plug and tried to get it back online. It keeps getting stuck on the step where it connects to my wifi, despite several hard resets. Issue persists with all 3 plugs, not just the one I connected once. TP-Link support told me to follow Case 4 at this link https://www.tp-link.com/support/faq/2229/ but I had already tried following those steps and nothing changed. 

Judging from this sub there was a recent outage for this equipment but that seemed to be 4 days ago. Most recent attempts I made were just yesterday, after which point I contacted support and they got back to me with no good advice on how to fix it. So I don’t think my issue is related to the recent outage. 

Any ideas? I’ve asked support if a warranty replacement is possible. It doesn’t seem to me like my router is the issue, otherwise wouldn’t the same plug in another room fail as well? It still works fine and has a floor/ceiling between it and the router. I’ve even been able to uninstall and reinstall the old one without an issue (just as a test to see if it was all smart plugs or just the new ones). The 3 new ones I’ve been trying in the same room as my router, like 10 feet away.

Before I go any further I wanted to know others thoughts on continuing down this road vs Hue.  I get the argument that it's nice that there's just 1 device on your network vs Kasa but I have a Wi-Fi 6 router so I can't imagine congestion is a concern right?  I just saw all the prices of hue bulbs and don't really feel like it's worth jumping to.... Curious on others thoughts.	10	"['kmcalc15: I have 22 devices and still growing.  Not a single problem.', ""Kyvalmaezar: You're better off asking this on general automation sub since you'll get answers biased in favor of Kasa here. I use both ecosystems but only Hue bulbs and mostly Kasa plugs.  \n   \nThat being said, I'd still go Hue if I had to choose one or the other.    \n    \nNot only is router congestion a possible issue but coverage is usually a much bigger issue. Most people have terrible wifi coverage. The wifi chip in the bulbs usually is fairly low power so it while it may be able to hear the command signal, it may not be able to send the return signal acknowledging it's done its thing. This can lead to some frustrating troubleshooting when the wifi checked using a phone with a much stronger wifi chip. Zigbee on the other hand, is a mesh network that can make strong coverage easier to manage because each bulb is a repeater. \n   \nHue also has an advange on integrations. There are more Hue integrations in other ecosystems than Kasa by a wide margin. This is great if you're not using something like r/homeassistant or Alexa as a hub.   \n   \nHue has brighter bulbs. Hue's new ones go up to 1600 lumens where has Kasa is still at 800 lumens last time I looked. Yes, the difference is noticeable even with multiple 800 ln lamps vs 1 1600 ln lamp.   \n     \nControlling the bulbs from the wall is easier with Hue. It can be done with Kasa but Hue's dimmer switches are so much easier to setup. It took about a month for me to he fed up with only being able to turn on/off my lights with my phone to get some Hue dimmers for my wall. There are light switch replacements that can work with wifi bulbs but they tend to be expensive and usually require a hub anyway. The majority of them are designed with Hue and Zigbee in mind.    \n   \nIf none of those bother you, then it doesn't really matter which system you choose. If you do choose Hue, to make the prices more palatable, it's better to buy them over time as the go on sale or used bulbs. It took ~6 years for me to switch out ~50 bulbs for Hues on my limited budge.   \n   \nThat all being said, I still like my Kasa smart plugs over the Hue ones, mostly because of energy monitoring options from Kasa. I run Home Assistant so crossing ecosystems isn't a big deal for me."", 'LazyThunder-TX: Having both ecosystems in my house, I’ve leaned toward Kasa simply for cost. Their wall switches can usually be found on sale for $11. Plugs can be found in 4 packs on sale for $7 each. Their color bulbs can be found on sale for $9 at times. Hue is way more expensive.  Integration with homekit is native with Hue, but covered by homebridge for Kasa, so that’s a non-issue for me. Wifi vs single hub matters not to me - I have solid wifi coverage throughout my home.  Both brands have expansive Python libraries available on GitHub, although I do find the Kasa library easier to use.  Both systems have local APIs that don’t require an internet connection. Both systems integrate with Alexa the same. For me, it ultimately comes down to cost.', 'oleypic: I have been running Kasa switches ,plugs,bulbs for several years now and never had any lag. They work great, can’t see spending crazy money for hue to get the same results.', ""MikeP001: Right, congestion is a misleading myth popular on the home automation forum, it's silly.\n\nBulbs don't always add to the mesh, many bulbs don't as they can expect to be powered off.  Same with battery devices.  So you need to add extra plugs etc to properly extend the mesh.\n\nIf you're technical you can choose by cost and wifi is cheaper.  If you're less technical, zigbee can be easier so go with hue (there's less you can tune).  It's easier to debug wifi network issues if you know what you're doing, hue usually just works but can be difficult to sort when there's a problem.\n\nWhat I like best about hue is the open API, I hate that kasa's API is available but not open/supported/published by TP Link and they keep threatening to take it away.  What I hate most about hue is the expense."", 'None: KASA smart switches are the way to go. Paying electrician or not.', 'reezick: Wow thank you for such a detailed response.

These rooms are very dark, and I want to add 3+ lamps to each room.

I want to be able to turn on all of the lights from a wall switch at the doorway.

I'm happy to replace that switch (or install a new one next to it) with maybe a 3-switch panel that could control 3 lamps wirelessly.

What do you recommend?

Would I be buying 1 Kasa outlet per lamp, and then is there some kind of wall-mountable switch that can easily remotely control a Kasa outlet?

And yes, I'll be able to control Kasa products with my Android app, but I like the convenience of being able to touch a switch on the wall at the doorway, too. Thanks.

UPDATE: I guess what I'm hoping would be the case would be for me to buy 2 smart outlets per room and plug them into sockets that are on different walls from the one controlled by the existing light switch, and then buy 2 battery-powered wall-mountable switches that could remotely control those smart outlets.

So if you wanted to control two plugs with one switch, it should be possible. I just tested mine and works like a charm.\n\nMy question to you is if you can control two lamps with one switch, then you don’t need two switches per room. Both lamps can be plugged into the Kasa smart plug and controlled by one case switch. Keep in mind, if you want to keep it simple, buy one smart plug since your smart switch already controls the dumb outlet for the first lamp. \n\nThere are other ways outside of the Kasa environment but anytime you introduce two different ecosystems, you typically need to interface them with a “hub” to have them communicate. Hub Apples’s HomeKit or Samsung SmartThings, etc. If you want to take this route, there are lots of more options, but one specific one to you would be using a wall mounted, battery operated switch that controls others devices without having to be hard wired into your home. Although it’s a bit more labor intensive to have them all communicate, I found Kasa couldn’t give me all that I wanted and had to look elsewhere for ancillary needs.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions as I have some experience with this and would love to help you avoid any missteps.', ""rwhal06: That's a really helpful answer.

I'll configure the Kasa switch to turn on all 3 lamps (because it will directly be wired to the outlet of Wall A and then it will also be configured to wireless control the smart outlets at Walls B and C).\n\nIs that what you're saying? \n\nThanks!\n\nP.S.

And if your internet goes out, say goodbye to having any app access with them, although all switches and plugs should still operate as is. \n\nI just started my journey into Zigbee with Aqara products and so far it seems good!

I thought I read somewhere that you are looking to control them in a 2+1 set up. The other shortcoming is  Kasa only allows 3 active smart actions. ~~You will be using 1 to turn them on and another 1 to turn them off so the two smart plugs/bulbs will have to be grouped first.~~ That will leave you with only one smart action for something else.\n\nEdit - One smart action can control both on and off.

Unplugging from power is the only way to reconnect. The firmware says up to date. The forums are full of people with the same problem with other Kasa devices. FW updates seem to have helped some folks. I have 2 APs and good coverage. Signal strength at the device is very good, my 2.4GHz band is not overloaded with client devices. Any advice for me? New firmware out there? Question #2: I've read that TP-Link is abandoning Kasa in favor of another series of devices for home automation. Any truth to this? Have I wasted over $200? Question #3: Do you think anyone at TP-Link reads or cares about this sub?	6	"[""MikeP001: If you can, give your APs different SSIDs to force the HS103's to the one best/closest for it.  Double check your wifi client limits for your APs - it's often 20-50 and it sounds like you might be reaching the limit (it's much less than the 254 client count supported by your router for a subnet).  Could even be one AP is overloaded and the other is not loaded at all.\n\nAnother option is to add a low end AP (ideally just use an old router if you have one) to take some of of the tplink load (about $20 new) give it a separate SSID to split some of the load clients.\n\nTP Link claims to be continuing to support Kasa and Tapo together.  I'm a bit skeptical but time will tell.  My guess, having no particular insight but judging from some actions they've taken, is they'll move to Tapo with it's cloud tethered API and eventually deprecate kasa devices.  The good thing about kasa is they will work without a cloud connection so your investment should be preserved even if kasa is deprecated.\n\nI don't think TP Link looks at this particular reddit topic.

MY DHCP server shows that I have about 10 2.4 GHz clients of all types (not just Kasa) on each AP. From the Kasa app, I checked the connections, and they all show signal strengths between -30 and -50 dBm. I\'m pretty sure my network is not the source of the problem. I see on the TP-Link forums that other Kasa devices with disconnect problems have been helped by firmware upgrades. There\'s no upgrades for either my HS103 or EP10 devices, which have both suffered from the occasional disconnect/fail to reconnect problem. Thus my question about firmware, TP-Link\'s support of this platform etc. I just posted a question on the general home automation forum - ""Have other wifi based automation devices suffered from a similar disconnect/failure to reconnect problem?"" If everyone else (Amazon for example) says ""we\'ve had no such problem"" then I may have to wait and see what the future holds for Kasa, and maybe ditch them is Kasa is deprecated/abandoned. If other non Kasa users have similar problems, then I guess I\'m just one of many who suffer from this.', 'davidreaton: Based on comments I\'ve seen here and on the forums, I went to the DHCP server on my router and changed all the IOT devices addresses from dynamic to static. This seems to have helped a lot. However, I\'ve got a commercial grade router and have some familiarity with the configuration. I don\'t know how easy this would be with a consumer router. Bottom line is still ""TP-Link needs to fix this"".', 'MikeP001: Well, I\'ll start by saying I don\'t have  a dozen HS103\'s, and mine are older so it\'s not an exact match.  However I do have 50ish IoT devices and have run into this sort of problem before, it\'s been easily solved each time by adding a new AP with a unique SSID - I have 3 now.  Also, I haven\'t seen anyone else jump in :).\n\nSo the answer to your general automation question is ""yes"", and not only with TP Link.  \n\nBecause the general skill with wifi configuration is quite varied you won\'t get a consistent answer, though often when you probe you do find it\'s those with less technical skill that struggle with disconnects (I would push those folks toward zigbee/zwave since while they cost more they\'re much less of a technical challenge).\n\nMost APs are constrained by their chipset and force disconnect the oldest clients when the limit is hit.  This is what causes the most issues with low end IoT devices - they often don\'t recover.  If you set the limit yourself this may likely be creating your issue - the IoT devices won\'t understand/respect the limit and will keep retrying.\n\nI\'d suggest you have very little to lose by pushing a few problematic device to a separate AP/SSID, but sure, you could certainly hope for a firmware update or simply throw them out.  In general after the first few for a new release not many firmware updates are necessary.  Should TP Link abandon kasa the worst you\'ll see is their cloud/app being dropped, but more likely (and they\'ve hinted at this) they\'ll update everything to use the Tapo API and service.', ""RagingITguy: My Kasa devices were always static leases through DHCP.

If you hold the button down, once the blue / orange(?) light starts to flash, that's not a reset. If you keep holding it, it will stay orange and then your plug will turn on.

This is for a Kasa HS220, where the two are differentiated. The neutral was pigtailed to the other bundle, as you said (they are both indeed on the same breaker circuit). That\'s what I did first while attempting to install this switch, since it just makes sense. In this configuration, turning on the breaker results in nothing.

The white acts as a common between the two 3-way switches, the travelers provide the toggling action. There is no neutral at all pulled into this box for these circuits, maybe because they\'re both ""end of the line"" for this breaker (every other lighting circuit I saw on this breaker, closer to the box, had neutrals).\n\nA bit of more unfortunate news, after a quick inspection, the only other 3-way light I have in the house seems to ALSO be wired in an old-school non-neutral fashion.

Hardware Version: V1

Firmware Version: 1.0.8

I bought a pack of 2 smartplugs on best Buy the other day and I was just wondering if I could use these smart plugs to connect my washing/dryer machines for energy monitoring/notifications only. I do not intend to turn on or off the appliances. 

Washing machine uses 120V plug

Dryer machine uses gas and 120V plug

The washing machine is a Whirlpool HE

There are no specific specs presented on the machine, unfortunately.

Dryer is a General Electric HE

The bulbs are forward phase & TRIAC dimming compatible and work perfectly asides from when at 100% brightness.

**Also, to be clear. Once the lights do their single flash on, off and back on at 100% brightness, the lights remain on and work as intended until I shut them off & turn them back on at full brightness, or dim them lower and then dim them back up to full brightness.**

When the power bumps, the switch tries to connect to wifi, which doesn't have internet connectivity yet. The connection to the cloud fails and the switch never tries again. Its internal clock is not synced and schedules do not work. This leaves the switch on until it is manually reset. This makes it useless if I am out of the house for a period of days.

I have 1 HS200 v3 that reconnects without issue.

I've followed all of TPLink's support advice - setting the channel, restricting to 2.4gz etc. and nothing works for the v5 switches.

There don't seem to be any firmware updates available.

I believe this issue is a firmware problem where the switch does not retry to connect to the cloud if the initial connection fails. I suspect the older version does retry, and thus I have no problem with it.

Can anyone recommend a solution, or recommend a replacement alternative that is more robust?"	15	"['BigReddit411: Update on this - I purchased 4 of the Meross MSS51 smart switches for about $40 - good Prime Day deal.\n\nInstalled one today.\n\nInstallation and configuration was quick and straightforward.

Fortunately, in my case, this did not cause a space issue.\n\nI repeated the tests that the TP-Link switch fails and the Meross reconnected to wifi and the cloud with no issues at all. Test 1: reboot the router that the switch connects to - the Meross reconnected on its own inside of 2 minutes. Test 2: cut the power to all the internet modem and routers and the switch itself to simulate what happens in a power outtage, the situation from which the TP-Link does not recover. It becomes unreachable and the schedule no longer functions. The Meross passed that test no problem.\n\nI plan to leave the Meross in for a day or two to test the schedule programming and see if it hangs in there. After that, all the rest of the TP-Link version 5 switches go bye-bye. I will try to get a refund from TP-Link, because these switches go offline when the power bumps and never recover short of physical manual intervention.

If so, something is wrong with your network configuration.

The HS200 timers won't work because they need NTP.  The app may or many not work locally to the devices depending on his network.\n\nIf they're blinking, they don't like the wifi signal.  A reserved IP won't help either.  Other things like interference, or a weak signal (sometimes they connect to the wrong/further AP), noisy power, or just a bad router or router placement may cause it.\n\nMaybe it's a V5 bug or just differences in timing from the V3, but they do tend to reuse common stuff in the firmware like NTP handling so personally I'd look elsewhere first.

I know this stuff is undocumented and not really supported but if anyone has an answer that would be helpful.

I'm using an HS105. I can access the API to get a token and to get a device list but when I try to change the state of the plug it just gives me:

{""error_code"":-10100,""msg"":""JSON format error""}

The actual format of the JSON is correct so I think that means the paramaters are incorrect. I'm just going off references I've found of other peoples implementations of the API so maybe the stuff I'm looking at is old and has changed? Maybe I'm just dumb and missing something obvious?
Code:

	function kasaState($id,$state) {
		$token = getKasaToken();
		$content = '{

I owned several KL130s (V1) for a few years, and I was very happy with them. They were stable, had only a barely noticeable flicker, and overall I was very happy with them.

I decided to buy a 4 pack due to a sale on Amazon, since my son loves the colors. I received hardware V3 bulbs and I can no longer recommend these lights to anyone, unless you can get your hands on V1. The flicker is as bad as a room lit by an old CRT, and they constantly loose connection, despite showing 3 out of 4 bars Wi-Fi on the info page.

1. Pry open the face. The seam is where the black (face) and white (body) meet. A small screwdriver should do it. It's best to open from the right side when looking at the front of the camera.
2. Unplug the mic cable. The mic itself is glued to back of the black face, and the cable is the only one running from the face to the board on the camera body -- just gently pull the plug out of the board. Tuck it out of the way so you can reattach later, or pull the mic completely off and discard it.

Original, 6/4: Making this post to share my learnings with the Kasa EP25. I've previously used a KP115 successfully with a 'local only' approach (2.4ghz 'IoT' wifi: does not have internet access, blocked by firewall rules/Unifi USG); and I made it work with both the iOS app (v2.37.2) and [python-kasa](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). I haven't managed to find any info for the EP25, which is much cheaper and available in a 4 pack ($50).

I was not able to add the EP25 using only the iOS Kasa app. Using my IoT wifi with cell service toggled either on or off, you'll get the error(s): ""No Internet, Make sure that your router is functioning properly and that you have a strong Wi-Fi signal"" or a ""Unable to Add Accessory, Cloud data sync is in progress.""


For the iOS Home app: Home must have permission to access your iCloud. You can switch to your IoT network in your wifi settings (which in my case, does not have internet access), then enable cell so your phone can connect to iCloud. Using the Home app, you can add the device pretty straight forward without any issue. The EP25 will be accessible when on your IoT network, but will not work when using cell/normal wifi (this is the desired outcome).
*Edit: After, in the kasa app you can try to add the device. In the UI where you pick between a Device and a Group, sometimes there will be a small ""+"" button to add ""discovered devices."" You can add your device(s) from there - this will also configure the device with various settings. (from python-kasa, configures the following modules: schedule, anti-theft, time.*

The python-kasa repo does work. However it does not seem to be possible to discover/provision using only the library - pressing the power button on the EP25 for 10 seconds causes it to flash *faster*, but does not make the device's wifi appear. The Home app from above is needed to add the wifi network. (there might be a way to add the wifi network from a computer, but idk. maybe [python homekit](https://pypi.org/project/homekit/)??)

Edit, 6/17: It seems that the EP25 does not correctly gather energy info without internet access and the kasa app configuration. Connecting an EP25 to the kasa app w/ a wifi with internet will result in energy info similar to the KP115. I'm still testing if the persistent internet is needed, or if it was just the initial setup with the kasa app that was necessary. **Edit: Persistent internet works. Initial setup without persistent internet fails.**

Edit 2, 6/24: It appears that the non-internet EP25 energy monitoring will gather data for 2-6 days, then stop gathering data. It seems that after those few days, the plug loses the ability to correctly tell time somehow. The schedule, timer, and away modes will fail in the Kasa app. A hard reset on the plug (hold power ~30 seconds) and reconfiguring it will have the same effect. 

Edit 3, 7/1: **I have a hunch that disconnecting the EP25 from electricity causes a time desync. This causes a number of things to malfunction on the device, and probably requires either a re-connect with the kasa app (with internet enabled?), or a device reset. Seven (7) days is the longest I've managed to maintain a consecutive energy reading, though in my testing I have killed power to the device(s) several times.** I'm returning it to Amazon. It seems like a good device, but not good for my use case."	10	"['None: What’s the user case for you to explore python kasa?

The hardware design is nice, but the firmware seems rather limiting, especially because it requires some internet and lacks a local API.

Inside are two mcus, a Realtek 8710CF and a CMSemicon CMS8S5880. My guess is the Realtek is the primary, and the CMSemicon is a secondary used to control the LED strip at the top of the switch. It'd be great if there were custom firmware to enable local control!

I have an HS105 plug and an HS200 light switch.

I have three smart actions setup in the kaza app:

1) Control with a switch - trigger device is HS200, corresponding device is HS105.  When the switch is turned on or off, it turns the plug on or off.  This works perfectly.

2) Auto-Off Timer - HS200, turn off after 15 minutes.  This works perfectly.

3) Auto-Off Timer - HS105, turn off after 15 minutes.  This does not work unless I turn ON the HS105 from the kaza app.

Is the HS105 not following the auto-off timer unless the HS105 is turned on via the app is by design and unchangeable?

Is there any way around this, such as using the smartthings app or home assistant?  Is there any other 3rd party app that would work or be easier to setup than home assistant?

I recently swapped out an underperforming Nest Doorbell for a Kasa - very happy.  I have so many other Nest cameras I\'m stuck with 2 apps for video.  But Kasa doesn\'t make everything.

I use google home integration for everything else. \n\nThere is unfortunately no 1 smart home company that makes everything you ever want. \n\nPhilips Hue systems have DOMINATED the market on lights like wash and flood lights, ambient lights but I never bought into them because of cost and the fact that they relied on a single hub for communication.

TP-Link has always been direct wifi connection. \n\nNever used TP-links cameras as I bought into google for displays and cameras. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe big thing for me is, does it integrate with google or do I HAVE to use their app? At some point in my life, I will get off my lazy ass and build a nodered or home assistant server and integrate everything there as well but it will be more for funsies. \n\nIf you signup for Kasa's email, they will shoot you over promotions and stuff like that.

Whitegemgames	3	uir6v9	TPLinkKasa	https://i.redd.it/qp2k2a1cqlx81.jpg		12	"[""enchantedspring: Technically yes, but probably not. \n\nI say probably not as the start-up load of an A/C (or any major compressor / motor etc.) is quite high and 'unclean'. TPLink's products (as with many of the smart plug manufacturers too) aren't really manufactured to tolerate repeated 'rough use' like that and will fail early.\n\nI'd suggest not on this, or replace it frequently if there's no option."", ""profmuggs: I've used wemo plugs on 5k and 8k btu window units with no problems. The units I have done have even saved the last temperature and power on when the wemo turns back on."", 'Whitegemgames: This is all the information from the side of the AC, I would really like to be able to turn it off before bed without getting up but have heard you shouldn’t use smart plugs for high powered things as it can be a fire hazard or break the plug, from my understanding the plug should be fine since the box says “100-120V~ 60Hz. 15A Max” but I could be misunderstanding and would rather get a second opinion before I try it', ""Speculawyer: Yes.\n\nThere's a longshot problem of the surge when starting the motor causing a problem but according to those specs, it's fine.\n\nBTW, that refrigerator is the walking dead, R22 is now banned."", 'None: Yes.', 'TerafloppinDatP: 15 amps is the most your regular 2 or 3 prong wall outlet can deliver without tripping the breaker, which means TP-Link designed the Smart Plugs to handle anything you would normally plug into a standard outlet. Your Smart Plus could theoretically handle an AC unit 3x that size. Stay cool, friend!', 'Whitegemgames: Damn, I was worried about something like that but was hopeful after everyone else said it was fine. Would it be a fire hazard to use it like this or would it just potentially break the plug? And how likely is failure? I have set it up at this point and it’s been working as I hoped so I am slightly hesitant to go back unless it’s dangerous or very likely to break quickly. Also is there a good plug made for stuff like this? The kasa app had an AC icon selectable for the plug so I assume one of their product is fine to use like this.', ""Desoto61: Shouldn't be a problem as that's a rather small unit. I have two units I've been using on smart plugs for years. \n\nIssue with motorized devices is they have a spike in power use when a motor starts. So a larger AC will likely exceed the 15A limit of the smart plug for a short period when the compressor kicks on. A cheap smart switch could fail over time due to these spikes."", 'Whitegemgames: Why is it banned? Are there any health risk to using this or would that only matter if I opened it up?', 'MikeP001: Probably not a fire hazard as the power is provided through the mechanical relay contacts.  What tends to happen is the contacts eventually pit and fuse together from to the surge current.  The switch (relay) will click off but the power will stay on.\n\nIf the circuit is really (electrically) noisy it can cause the switch to crash and restart - not a big problem but it can be annoying.\n\nYou may get a year or two or more before needing to replace it.', 'Speculawyer: It destroys the Ozone layer and I think it is a bad greenhouse gas too.  It is being replaced with new mixtures like r410a and R32.', ""enchantedspring: I don't think I can add any more to this answer by Mike.\n\nI agree, unlikely to be a greater fire risk, but the plug just won't last as long and the relay contacts will eventually 'get stuck' as described above.\n\nYou could point a Flir at it to be sure it's not overheating if you had easy access to one though.""]"

Pros:
Very solid image quality.
Compact size, and looks similar to the Nest doorbell (aside from the 'smooshed' bottom)

Cons:
Not impressed with the chime. A doorbell press results in a very brief two rings...easily missed if I'm upstairs. 
Lag in notifications, particularly doorbell rings. There's a several minute wait to get notified about a second doorbell ring. 
Need to unmount the doorbell to pull the SD card.


Anyone else experiencing the lag in ring notifications?  My suspicion is that it could be related to the SD card.  I have a Samsung Pro Endurance card on the way...we'll see if that makes a difference.

I was able to convert almost all of my switches to smart ones (around 25). I have been using Kasa Smart. One of my switches though, I have not been able to convert despite my best efforts. Hoping someone here can help!

Details:
3 way Switch, both ends currently setup up with Lutron Maestro. One end does not have a neutral, so that one is out. The other end has what appears to be a neutral (bundle of 2 wires capped off in the back). However, when I get it all connected and turn the circuit breaker back on, the switch flickers on and off rapidly. I’ve tried to cut the ends of the neutral and going deeper into the wire thinking maybe the ends went bad, but that didn’t work. 

Any suggestions? I should mention that I did NOT get a smart 3 way DIMMER. Just using a smart 3 way switch. I don’t think that’s the issue. 

The only alternative I have is to draw a neutral to the other end of the switch that doesn’t currently have one, from the light switch on the other side of the wall that does have one. However that light switch is on another circuit and I rather avoid that if I can.

For Alexa, this worked well. Response time was instant.

Mesh can cause problems with low end wifi devices like these too - they're not always good at picking the closest/loudest AP and can lock onto a marginal signal.\n\nInterference from neighbors is a lot less common that reddit users (esp zwave and zigbee proponents) would have you think.  Your own APs are much louder in your home than APs broadcasting through external walls.   More often it's distance/walls from your AP or attenuation by the fixture as you've noted.  Sometimes noisy power lines.  Sometimes it's exceeding the router's max wifi client limit (which is much less than LAN client limits, esp in ISP provided routers).  The bulbs aren't good at reconnecting if they get dropped.  Fix is the same, a $20 AP dedicated to automation devices.""]"

1647199950.0	13-Mar-2022 12:32:30	KL 430 light strip not able to connect and not able to reset	javar21	1	tdeh0u	TPLinkKasa	https://www.reddit.com/r/TPLinkKasa/comments/tdeh0u/kl_430_light_strip_not_able_to_connect_and_not/	"I'm having problems to install and connect the KL 430 light strip (version 2).  The process is very time consuming and frustrating... I tried before the Kasa Light Bulb and Plugs, and they connected super fast without any issue.  But the KL430 is very problematic, I tried with 4 different KL430 purchased in different stores, returned the previous 3.

Out of the box, I follow the Kasa app install steps  and about 50% of the times the process completes, and I can see the Light Strip listed as a Kasa app device. However, the  entry is disabled most of the time (the strip is on with lights, and my WIFI 2Ghz is working fine).  Randomly, I can get the strip entry to enable. Either after a lot of times powering off/on, or moving through different app options.  Only 2 or 3 times, I was able to get the light color changed.  But usually, I click on the color circle to change to a different color and Kasa tells me that the strip is inaccessible.

I press the device button 10 seconds, but nothing seems to happen..  Rarely, once in a while, I'm able to reset the device by pushing the button more than 10 seconds, and then I try to unplug/plug several times or after some hours, and eventually the device resets.

After installing the light strip, Kasa app tells me that a firmware upgrade is available. I hit on next, but it always fails to install sitting an ' unknown error' (quite 'useful' TPLink developers!!).  When I try to upgrade the firmware later, in Settings > Firmware, Kasa app does never show the light strip as an upgrade option.

I opened a tech support ticket, but it wasn't of much help. They ask to send the item back for warranty replacement, but it may be simpler for me to just return it to the local store where I bought it.

&#x200B;

The current status of the KL430 now is that I plug it on, it turns on, I see a white light first, then purple color light and it stays there for probably 10-30 seconds, then those light colors cycle again.

&#x200B;

Any ideas on what I can do, besides returning or trashing this device?    In particular, is there a way of resetting the KL430 that works every time?

&#x200B;

I'll update the post if  I find out other useful info.."	12	"[""MikeP001: I haven't used this device so it may not help, but the first thing I would try is to get it known to  kasa.  Once it's there I wouldn't reset it anymore - that causes too many other problems.\n\nThen if it shows offline check your router's wifi client status to see if it's still connected.  Try a ping to that IP.  If it's working the problem is with the device and kasa, if not, it's a wifi problem of some kind.  If it's wifi I'd power cycle my router, then the device, and try again.  Then move it to a different location (closer to the router) to see if that'll help.  If not maybe try with a guest network or somewhere else, it could be a product defect or an incompatibility with your wifi.  Good luck!"", ""javar21: The issue I observed occurs when I connect the KL430 to my WIFI Router.  I tried connecting to my Mobile HotSpot, and it worked without any problem and very fast. I was even able to upgrade the KL430 firmware, which I couldn't before.   I'm not sure what can be the reason, because every other device works well through the router."", ""FireFoxRevolution: I also had this problem, I ended up combining the two solutions.

Since upgrading, im getting a lot of disconnects from my Kasa devices, at seemingly random, that i did not experience with the Nighthawk.    


Stuff would occasionally disconnect from the AX4, but it was usually the same devices (which are in the basement and had poorer signal), and usually powering the device off and turning them back on would reconnect them.    


With the new AX89X, devices drop off the network and will not reconnect.  If i totally reset the router, they will usually come back, but then sometimes OTHER devices wont reconnect.    


Its extremely frustrating.   


Im trying to figure out what about the new router could be causing this issue, as the signal is much stronger, it has far more simultaneous streams (12 vs 4 on the AX4), and a much more powerful CPU and WiFi chipset (i get decent 2.4ghz signal nearly 150ft from my house - enough to stream 1080p YouTube on my phone, at least)  


Ive tried both using ASUS Smart Connect (combined SSID for the 2.4ghz and 5ghz band) and separating the SSIDs - no appreciable difference (left it for several days to a week on each type).    


The only devices connecting to the 2.4ghz band when they are separated are the Kasa devices, 3 Google Home Mini's (the first gen ones, the 2nd gen ones support a limited 5Ghz spectrum), and 2 Lenovo Smart Clocks (basically a Google Home Mini + clock) because they dont connect to 5ghz.    


Everything that can be connected to 5Ghz (two Home Hubs, and two newer Nest Mini's which support 5Ghz, phones, tablets, chromebooks, and two of the newer Android TV Google Chromecast devices) is connected to the 5ghz, and desktop/in-place computers, my NAS, TV, and nVidia Shield are wired up to a Gigabit switch which is plugged into the Router, so they should have zero impact on the WiFi.    


Is there some router setting(s) that might cause devices not to be able to reconnect/connect in the first place?  I should also note that when adding new devices, i had to reboot the router to get them to connect \*at all\*.  (I recently added two new lights, after the router upgrade, to my kitchen's overhead lighting).  When i went through setup, before i rebooted the router, the bulbs would NOT connect at the end of setup, and it would just hang.  After a reboot, they connected immediately.    


I also replaced an older smart plug with a newer one in the basement (old one got damaged while we were doing some work in the basement), and it was exactly the same.  I had to reboot the router to get it to connect at all during setup.    


Im trying to figure out why its suddenly a major issue, especially since the devices that seem to not connect change at random and are not at all consistent, and a reboot of the router sometimes doesnt even work tog et all of them back up - and it will randomly switch which ones dont come back.    


For instance, two of three lights in my office just did not want to connect (after working fine for over two years).  I did a reboot, and they came back up... but the two brand-new lights i just put in the kitchen (which were previously connected) did not.  Another reboot got all the lights back.... and two of our switches didn't come back.  Another reboot, the switches were back, and one of the older kitchen lights over the sink (but only one of the two - its a two socket fixture) didnt come back.  No rhym or reason.  The kitchen lights espcially have an entirely unobstructed signal - the Router sits on top of an Ikea shelf unit in the living room, and there's a ""window"" throught he wall into the kitchen (i hate it, but its there, i havent drywalled over it yet) so its has zero obstructions to the lights in the kitchen.    


What kind of settings in the router should i be looking for to clear this up?  I seriously doubt its too many devices (its a 12 stream router that supposedly supports over 100 devices), or poor signal (as i said, signal is massively better than my old Nighthawk)...   


But ive sorta reached the end of my rope with this, to the point of considering using some other smart bulb/switch ecosystem, despite not wanting to spend the hundreds that would cost because this just isn't working right.    


Thanks ahead of time."	6	"['akballow: Its actually a firmware problem. Reported bt many across many different asus routers.

That's ok, there was a time I knew nothing too.  Everybody starts at nothing. But the thing is, you will need to learn. Learn a lot.  If all you want to do is install a switch and be done, hire an electrician and be done with it.  \nIf you want to learn more, look it up online and basic how to's on YouTube (man I wish I had YouTube when I learned all this stuff).    \n\nTo answer your questions, you really need to test the wires to see what they are.  \nYou said they are 2 separate switches, so on one the black wire is probably your load (where your power is coming from) and your blue goes to the light. On the other switch you see that red wire connecting them? That's bringing power from the black wire to the second switch.  The white wire probably runs out to your second light.  BUT white wires aren't supposed to be used that way, so either I'm wrong (again, you need to test them) or somebody wired it non standard which is dangerous.   \n\nThe ground wire mentioned is missing.

From my understanding reading the other comments you have a single gang box with two separate switches controlling two separate lights. The black wire is usually the line/hot wire and that seems to be the case here because of the red jumper connecting the hot between the switches. The white and blue wires on the opposite side of the switch appear to be going to the two separate lights. If that's the case then you have no neutral wire which means the kasa switches won't work and you will need to get a different switch that doesn't require a neutral (these are a little more expensive). An alternative solution is to leave the switch as you found it and get smart bulbs instead. If you have your heart set on going the no switch route with a no neutral switch (get an electricians help with this because I could be completely wrong) it looks like you would just need to remove the red wire completely and pigtail the white and blue with a wire nut and connect them to the new switch on the opposite side from the black."", ""Jeabers: That white wire seems to be neutral no?

Now I have two extra ""ghost devices"" that I do not know how to get rid of - one of the duplicate fans and that unknown 2. Google sees them but TP-Link doesn't (but they must be inside TP-Link Kasa, no?)

Problem being - when I tell google to turn on Fans it says ""turning on 3 fans"" or if I say ""turn off Kaylas fan"" it will say ""turning off 2 fans"".

Any suggestions?

Second I have connected a bunch of Kasa energy monitoring plugs and three strips, specifically KP303 models.  I also have a Sense power meter, which  these plugs and strips speak to. 

Only one of my strips gives me what are clearly bad power readings.   There's a laptop and a monitor attached to it.  On the Kasa monitor (and therefore on Sense's device) the power consumption of JUST my 27"" monitor is currently 1900+ watts.   

However, the power consumption of my entire home at the moment is merely 1700 watts-- and my Dishwasher is currently running 1000 of those watts.  

Clearly the Kasa strip is giving me bad readings.  It's also not just that one plug on the strip-- sometimes my printer, which is only turned on when it's necessary, appears to draw 3000 watts-- in idle status.  

I have been able to temporarily ""fix"" this issue a few times by shutting off the toggle switch entirely, waiting a few minutes for it to (maybe?) Reset itself,  and turning it on again but then it's back a few hours later 

Any ideas?

I have 3 EC70 and 3 KC105 cameras that all worked flawlessly until recently. Suddenly, they all stopped recording to SD cards. I realized that they had stopped recording when I tried to play back what should have been recorded. Then I noticed that local recording was switched off, so I tried to turn it back on again, and received a message saying ""No SD card detected...""

I pulled the SD cards and reinserted them several times as instructed by the very lame diagnostics support KB. Nothing changed. The cameras would no longer see the SD cards.

I plugged the SD cards into a PC and can read the recordings, but they of course all had stopped several weeks earlier. All of the SD cards were full.  


I tried reformatting the cards but was unable to do so, even after installing specific SD card formatting software from the SD SIG. The existing recordings cannot be erased from any of the SD cards.

I inserted a new SD card into one camera and it started recording normally, and I was initially able to record and play back normally. Now the app shows no recordings, even though it is set for 24/7 recording.

Since this has happened across several cameras, using different SD cards (Samsung & SanDisk) I suspect that a firmware change was pushed to the cameras, disabling the local recording function. I'm, starting to suspect that this may be intentional, as an attempt to force users to switch to paid Cloud recording. 

Has anyone here experienced this issue? Any resolution? What does TP-Link have to say? Either this gets fixed or I will report it to Amazon and return all of the cameras.

There is still no good open source solution, no perfect (or even halfway decent) off the shelf ecosystems.  Just a few players with buggy and poorly supported lines, all with proprietary apps. If Kasa stopped support, your smart switches become dumb switches with unpatched security issues.  Sure you can dive into some of the Linux based open source hubs, but who has time and money for all that?  Even if you did, you need to be an engineer to implement it. Even then, trying to find something as simple as a UL rated switch that works with (true) open source zwave or zigbee isn\'t easy, and when you do, you\'ll find the prices are quite high.

I'm not a big-time user, but I have half a dozen bulbs and was planning on buying more, and I'd just bought 5 smart switches to install. Will this stuff work indefinitely or is it going to lose a lot of functionality once the line is officially discontinued or when they shut off the servers?

Considering just replacing everything with Philips Hue. Only problem with that is that their bulbs are just slightly (like literally 1mm) too large to fit in my ceiling fan so I'd need to replace that too, and coupled with the price of their bulbs it'd be like $1000 to swap everything over.

They currently only get \'paid\' a one-time revenue on purchase of the device. The devices either need to be regularly replaced (to generate more of those one-time revenues), or a weekly / monthly cloud-subscription is introduced (similar to the Tapo brand plans). Otherwise the company is stuck with supporting them on a Cloud, with an App (needing updates for iOS / Android versions as they come out) and with security updates for basically nothing.\n\nI wouldn\'t not buy the remaining Kasa items, but be aware they have a lifespan limited not only by the electronics but also the cloud and App.', 'ind3pend0nt: They use a local api so I connect via home assistant.', ""DynaMike_: I wouldn't worry too much about Kasa devices becoming unusable in the near future.

I had a similar size issue with the only remaining original light fixture in my house (late 1920's) where a Hue color bulb just couldn't quite fit right to draw power, and ended up getting an AduroSmart ERIA bulb which fit correctly. The screw part was ever-so-slighly longer and the base didn't have that weird flat flare that the Hue color bulbs have. It's also significantly cheaper at $27.99.

Jeabers	2	s8x9eq	TPLinkKasa	https://www.reddit.com/r/TPLinkKasa/comments/s8x9eq/3way_motion_detector/	I have a three way switch that functions as entry/exit in two separate locations. I would like to put the new motion activated switch in both switch locations. Since it is wired as a three way can I just connect the travel wire with line/load and use the app to turn it I to a three way switch?	6	"['ThreeHits: Yes, but with stipulations. You will need to basically convert your three way switch into a ""regular"" style switch. You would need to run line to all switches, and the final switch before the light would have load connected. Finally, you will need to set the smart actions/routines necessary for the switches to mimic each other\'s states. I haven\'t done this in the Kasa app, but I\'ve done it in SmartThings with my foyer and hallway lights. \n\nSo electrically, your first switch should have line, ground, and neutral connected, and nothing on load. You will then connect one of the traveler wires to line at the first switch, and, if you DO NOT have a neutral available at the second switch, connect the other traveler wire to neutral. At the second switch, your traveler wires are now line and neutral. Connect ground, line, neutral, and load at the final switch.\n\nSoftware wise, SmartThings used to have a ""Mimic State"" or still does and does not support it for Kasa products. So to emulate this, you will need to create multiple routines. If switch 1 is on, turn switch 2 on.   \nIf Switch 1 is off, turn switch 2 off.  \nIf switch 2 is on, turn switch 1 on.  \nIf switch 2 is off, turn switch 1 off.', 'Scary_Habit974: Would it be easier to just install 3 way motion sensing switches from Lutron or the likes?

I fixed it!!! 

So hard to explain... but ended up taking off all the wires on my two switches, capped it, turned on the power and checked each wire with the voltage sensor.

In the box with the dumb switch: red and black travellers, and what was supposedly a white common wire. No power whatsoever.
In the box with the smart switch, red and black travellers with black common wire. No power also. Figured that ""common"" black wire was going to the fixture so that meant the box is the load side and I had to install the switch in the other box.

In the box with the ""common"" white wire, I installed the smart switch there and attached my neutral to that wire. For the common port of the smart switch, I pigtailed a black wire over from the hot line.

Probably wrong to experiment with only a voltage sensor but it did the job. Ended up telling my friend with a multimeter to not come over. Now if there was a problem with the wiring, would I notice it as soon as the power is on or can something still happen down the line? It's been two hours since the power is back on and I've just been seeing up my automations...

It not only sucks that  they will (most likely) retire the entire Kasa line, but then not to say anything, and continue to sell? Even during the Christmas season and while CES is going on now. That's unethical in my book. It's even bad business PR for all home automation. I mean, how can I trust that any product is going to be supported a reasonable amount of time after purchase and installation? This isn't right.\n\nI should have known better to purchase additional switches when I suspected something was up when I saw no new product introductions, no news, no promotions, except items going on sale, which should have been clearance sales.

Save your reputation.  \n\nAs for me, I've had some good luck with Philips' Hue.  It appears they're serious about staying in the home automation business.

Good luck playing a playstation II game on a Playstation V, or using any of the accessories, but Sony did make some efforts for backward compatibility between systems, or giving free software if you owned it on the previous system.  I don't think it's reasonable to ask that a new game system plays software written in the mid 1990s.  Got to give credit to Microsoft though, Windows will still run some very old software.\n\nThe difference here is Kasa has only been out for 3 years, and their switches are hardwired into my house.  One kind of expects wall switches to work for many years. There's an expectation of support for a reasonable amount of time for this type of product.

Honestly TP-Link\'s discontinuation of Kasa Smart is still rumor. In fact that\'s why I started this thread ""Is Tapo replacing Kasa"" From my research, yes it appears that Kasa is being retired (sunset as they call it in the tech world). No, there has not been an official statement from TP-Link stating that. They have a legal responsibility to support the warranty, but not clear if that includes software support. Without software, and cloud services, the devices are basically useless, worse yet, potential security risks if left on your wifi network and they are never patched again.  \n\nIn my opinion, a world class Hong Kong based company like TP-Link will keep full support for at least a year, maybe even two, then offer an upgrade discount to switch to Tapo.  After that, support period ends, the devices are e-waste.  However, they don\'t have to do anything. In fact if they shut it down today, then that\'s their prerogative, but it will damage their reputation. After all, I\'m guessing there\'s millions of devices connected right now.  \n\nWhile I didn\'t expect lifetime support for a 15 dollar switch, I do expect a reasonable usage time.

If the app is no longer updated, then the (unofficial) API can be used locally with a different app, and on the internet with other home automation hubs (most customers will not have the technical knowhow to make this work. This assumes TP-Link doesn’t remove the API from firmware which I think was planned. No API, then only TP-Link software can control Kasa, and if the app is removed from the App Store, then no, you can't control Kasa from the phone using other apps, or other automation hubs. \n\nI’m just guessing, but I think what will happen is TP-Link will drop some support for Kasa. They likely will stop updating the device firmware and will probably not bother to remove the API.  They will also likely discontinue updates for the Kasa app, but allow Kasa to work with the tapo app.  If Tapo supports Kasa to its full capability, that's great, but I doubt they will support it for more than 1 year because Kasa is deprecated, not bringing in new revenue because sales are retired, and is competition for Tapo.   \n\nWorse case, they remove the API, remove the app from the App Store, and shut down cloud support including Google/amazon Alexa. If that happens, then the wall switch will work like a regular wall (dumb) switch, plugs would be useless, and the bulbs will turn on like regular LED bulbs without control for color.

Their tightly controlled ecosystem will allow them to do many things like charge a subscription fee in the future.  They've talked about providing a local API but so far have not delivered; maybe it'll happen but I'm skeptical.\n\nCurrently kasa is provides a local API that you can use without the device needing any connection to the internet (though leaving it open for NTP can be helpful).  So you can run any aftermarket app that supports local access and if you need it, a local self managed server to provide remote access.\n\nUnfortunately tp link has not published their API nor agreed to support it, so once installed I would refuse any further firmware updates - they have threatened to remote it and have done so on the UK versions of the HS100/HS110."", 'Pancake_Nom: Home Assistant uses a local API in Kasa devices to control them.

Instead it sends a message to home assistant, then home assistant turns the lights on or off.

I recently picked up a bunch of the EP10P4 Smart Plugs to replace my old, crappy Wemo ones. So far, these have been great. Easy to set-up and right away connected to Google Home. I can and do control these from my Google Home Mini (Nest Mini). They're super snappy and responsive.

The only problem I have is that they go ""Local Only"" in the app after a power outage or they lose WiFi connection (such as when restarting my Unifi AP). The weird part is that they do appear to reconnect to WiFi afterwards. In my Unifi Controller, I can see that all the Smart Plugs are on the network. I can still control the devices from the Kasa App when my phone is on WiFi. However, they lose their connection to Google Home. And the sched 

So far, the only thing I've found is to power cycle each Smart Plug to get it back it fully online, and not just in ""Local Only"" mode. Plus the scheduled on/off times stop working. That's kinda annoying. 

We've had some bad weather lately, and heading into Winter, I expect more that leads to power outages. Plus, there are times I need to restart my AP to update the firmware or reconfiguring things. I don't want to have to keep going to each plug to power cycle it. Some of these are in harder to reach places.

The one weird thing I noticed after it goes ""Local Only"" is that if I go to the Device Info on a smart plug in the app, the Device Time reads something like, ""Jan 2 2000, at 4:02:34 AM."" That probably explains why the on/off schedule doesn't work; the time is wrong. Syncing the time and location via the app doesn't work either (though in the Device Info, the last sync time will be up-to-date).  After power cycling the device, the Device Time is properly updated.

I've checked firmware updates and none appeared to be available. 

Any ideas to fix this?"	6	"['enchantedspring: I use Ubi on one particular install too and the DHCP takes some time to ""correct"" after a restart - assume the plugs are on statics with a lease of 2 hours + which would hold them over?', ""MikeP001: That the timers stop working indicates that the devices can't reach any ntp servers, so either they're blocked or DNS isn't working at router startup.\nMight be worth flipping local/remote DNS, or trying Google's 8.8.8.8. Restarting just wifi might cause them to reassociate and retry, save running around to each.  I suspect router settings as it's not something everyone hits after power outages."", 'gioraffe32: No, I have pretty much all WiFi devices using DHCP. But I can certainly give these all statics and see if that fixes the issue. Appreciate the quick tip!', 'gioraffe32: Hmm, OK. So, I run a little homelab server here that functions as the DNS (which then forwards out to 8.8.8.8) since it\'s also acting as an AD DC (for testing/playing around).

So when power goes out, I obviously lose DNS for a bit longer than everything else since it takes several minutes for the server to boot up. \n\nNot sure why the plugs would still be DNS-less hours after everything else is working, and even while connected to WiFi, though. Guess the plugs only checks at boot or something? Just thinking out loud.\n\nSo two notes for myself:\n1) I really need to stop dragging my feet on a UPS\n2) Need to set up conditional forwarding on my router so that AD-related things know to go to the server, while everything else goes to 8.8.8.8.\n\nAnyway, as they say: ""It\'s always DNS.""\n\nThis is really helpful!

I've got about half dozen Kasa bulbs in my house and I've been happy with them, but if I turn them off through the app, then my roommate can't turn them back on with the wall switch. And conversely, if I turn them off through the wall switch, they're unresponsive from the app (because they're not getting power, obviously.)

So just to make sure, if I replace my regular wall switches with Kasa switches, I can turn my bulbs off from the app and my roommate will be able to turn them back on with the wall switch the next morning? Or vice versa, if I turn them off with the wall switch, I can then turn them back on with the app?

My other question: If I've got a Kasa switch on the wall, can I assign it to turn on ANY of my Kasa bulbs, even if they're not on that same physical circuit? For instance, my exercise room's wall switch currently turns on a single ceiling light, and I'd like to replace it with a Kasa switch and then tell it to ALSO turn on the bulb in the room's lamp as well. Or hell, set up a single smart switch that turns on every smart bulb in the house. Does that work?

I've attempted to install the switch as per the instructions but it seems my existing switch might be slightly unique. The wiring seems to impact multiple rooms on my main floor if I mess around with them.

I've added a picture of the current wiring of my switch. (Please ignore redacted labels, that was my attempt at labeling them). My initial assumption was that wire #3 was a ground and so I was connecting Kasa's green ground wire with #3.

I connected wire #1 to the Red screw and wire #2 to the Black screw and the white kasa wire to the neutral wires in the back of the switch.

When I turn the breaker switch back on, no power is going through the switch and it impacts the rest of the lights on the main floor as well. I've also attempted switching the wires for #1 and #2 with the same results.

I'm getting the feeling that wire #3 should not be connected to the ground and needs to be connected to elsewhere to provide power.

Any advice?

I have tried resetting them. Unlinking Kasa from my google home app. I tried deleting my Kasa app and restarting. I even created a new Kasa account and tried starting from scratch. They still dont work properly.

Basically what is happening is when I set them up un the Kasa app, 1st, they are difficult to connect. They take way longer and sometimes fail the install entirely. Eventually I am able to get them setup. 2nd, once they are in the app, the buttons will randomly disappear and sometimes reappear. When the buttons are gone, if I click on the device, it says its unreachable. But even when the button is there, the device doesnt reliably respond to turning them on. This problem also translates over to the google home app, where they are frequently unavailable; making them virtually unusable as smart devices.

We did recently get a new AT&T router, (going from the black model to the white one) so maybe that’s affecting this? But we kept the network name the same and everything, and all of my google devices, my laptop, my phone, basically every other Wi-Fi device works fine in my house. So I dont get it.

If you have conduit, you'll need a spool of white wire and a fish tape.  I recommend a fiberglass fish tape because it's easier to use in small stretches.

Just connect wires like any switch, but there's an extra white wire too.

Coray66	2	rcqlg0	TPLinkKasa	https://www.reddit.com/r/TPLinkKasa/comments/rcqlg0/ks220m_tp_link_smart_motion_dimmer_switch/	The problem I'm having with the ks220m dimmer switch, is when I walk into the bathroom at 2:00 in the morning and it automatically turns on to 35% brightness. Which I have it set up to do that in Smart control. But when I use the dimmer switch to turn up the brightness when I need more light, it will let me adjust the lights but as soon as it senses motion it goes right back to 35% brightness. It senses me just fine and turns on to my desired brightness which is great but it seems really stupid that I cannot turn the brightness higher without it going back to the level that is set when it senses motion. I tried setting it up so that it comes on at 100% brightness and lets me dim the lights but as soon as it senses motion it goes right back to 100% brightness, it seems silly. What's the point of being able to adjust the dimmer switch after it senses motion only to be overridden again once it senses your motion. It would be nice to have the switch turn on to your desired setting once it senses motion, and if you need to make an adjustment it stays on that setting until it is turned off or readjusted. No, whatever setting you have it set at as soon as it senses you that's what setting it's going to be at regardless if you used the manual dimmer switch to adjust the lighting.

Two circuits, each pulling about 750 watts of power (about 6 amps), run by two Kasa 15 amp smart switches. The switches would turn on, but not off. I looked into the fine print and they are rated at 15 amps for general use (whatever that means), but only 600 watts for incandescent lighting. Go figure.

I guess there's a reason the Leviton switches cost twice as much- they are actually rated at 15 amps for incandescent lighting.

Another solution, drive an industrial relay with the Kasa..  both solutions would not be to code, and take skill and money to implement. \n\nProbably, the easiest thing is to get a different switch.

Amazon echo is also like that but it is better at keeping a connection.', 'mmark27: Alright, if you\'ve got 40 smart switches.....I\'m assuming you are running into perhaps some of my same issues. Now I didn\'t have them all factory reset themselves, but I\'ve had occasional red-wifi-o-death on 4 or 5 of my 26 Kasa wall switches and I have had to factory reset them and reconfigure them back into the network. Very often, I will lose the remote control (local only) of a few switches and I have to flip the breakers to get them to fix themselves. Sometimes the ""restart"" button on the switch works, sometimes it doesn\'t. \n\nOn top of these little quirks, my Chromecasts (8) have a difficult time staying connected to the WiFi, they will turn off their WiFi and I have to re-enable it. My Nest/Google Home Speakers (20) have issues with playing music as requested on more than one speaker at a time. \n\nIn total, I have a steady 84 devices on my network and it usually can peak around 100 when everyone is home, etc. This, I thought, was over whelming my Nest WiFi system as it frequently would crash and so I went to a tri-band mesh in the TP-link Deco X90 (claims to be able to handle up to 200 devices). The Deco behaves like the Nest broadcasting the 2.4 and 5 with one SSID. This switch DID help quite a bit. The network doesn\'t crash, but I still get the above behaviors (Kasa flaking, Chromecasts wifi turning off, speakers not grouping well). I know that through WiFi-analyzer apps that I have a lot of interference on my network, I mean duh, I have 100 devices connected. \n\nNow I have quite a few other smart things outside of Google/Nest and TP-link.

I've also had occasional video streaming issues in the past week, during which my nest wifi couldn't complete a speed test, but I think maybe some of that was due to issues with my ISP, as the next day I had a 4 hour unplanned outage in my neighborhood.

&#x200B;

I have purchased a few Kasa smart switches, they all work except the motion detection on both the normal switch and the dimmer switch does not work. In the app, I can see the ambient sensor value and it reads differently when I block the sensor, so the ambient light sensor seems to be working. But the motion activation does not work at all.

I turned the ambient sensor off, restarted the device, shined a flashlight through the sensor, nothing seem to be triggering it. Since all the devices I got have the same problem, I'm thinking perhaps there's something I'm missing.

&#x200B;

Has anyone experienced the same issue?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok, update:

Apparently, the motion sensor can only be used as a trigger for smart action. You need to define a smart action that when it detects motion at certain times of the day it turns the lights on.

One of the switches is a 3-way and I have the 3-way Kasa smart dimmer set that I'm attempting to install with this.

What I've done thus far: I pulled the original 4 'dumb' switches (note: each had dimmers) (note: I stupidly did not take photos of the original set up and am kicking myself now). I then proceeded to hook up the switches and 3 of the 4 worked well. I then realized one was a 3-way switch (note, this one actually worked; however, the brother-sister switch (which I had not touched yet) stopped working). So I bought the 3-way set and attempted to install that. Further, I was running into spatial issues and began trying to use WAGOs (instead of wire nuts) and slimmed down on some of the wires. Somehow, in this process I took a step backwards and none of them worked. I called in a handyman with some electrical experience, but ultimately not enough. He gave up after an hour. I've been doing a lot of reading and trying various combinations, and I'm now coming here in hopes that someone might have an enlightening suggestion.

Status: Each of the Kasa smart dimmers turns on and I can get connected to my WiFi. They sent power through the load when in the 'on' position and not when in the 'off' position. So I think that part is all good. However, none of my lights are turning on and I've tested most/all of the unused wires.

Possible Issues:

1 - I'm using 5 slot WAGOs for each of the line, neutral, and ground. I'm not sure if this is ok for any or some of them.

2 - I'm not sure how to identify the neutral or load wires.

3 - ??

My house is from 1906 so I COMPLETELY feel your pain right now. I am not an electrician and I have made mistakes involving electricity; I have yet to burn my house down. I am saving  money to gut and completely redo my house including electrical. I have a mix of knob and tube, cloth covered wire and romex. I can tell you that some less than knowledgeable individuals did electrical work on my house before I owned. Its fucking scary.  \n\nFirst thing I am going to suggest is go buy a volt meter. If your going to own a home, I suggest you own one for projects like this. I have the Klein Tools CL120Kit from Home Depot. It is a bit expensive but it has several useful tools including a receptacle tester. If your not in the USA, get something moderately priced. Dont get $10 garbage. It may do the job but the quality is what you pay for. If you can get one with clips, it makes thing easier. \n\nWithout a volt meter, determining which wire is hot is difficult. Unless you like to test to see if electricity is there with your bare hands.  \n\nGreen should be ground.   \nWhite should be neutral.  \nBlack and red should be hot. \n\nIn your photo, I think\\* I see 4 switches total but there are still a bunch of bare wires. It also looks like there may have been a fire inside that junction box at one point in its life? If so... I honestly wouldn't continue \n\nEach gang should be one light in total but its hard to see just how many wires are coming out of each but with old wiring (even modern wiring / construction) that is not necessarily the case. \n\nOnce you have a volt meter, shut your circuit off, take everything out. Make sure no wires are touching anything else and turn the circuit back on. Touch/clip your black lead to the ground wire. Then touch your red wire to every other wire. In my experience, you can also (somewhat) find a hot wire by ONLY touching the red lead of your volt meter to every wire. You should get about 5-7 volts. Once you complete the circuit you should see the complete 120ish volts. You can also test based on previous experience and go with the colors of tape on the lines. \n\nDoesnt really identify which wire is neutral or ground though. It also doesnt really identify which lines are you hots to your lights either but, you have to start somewhere. Also, because you have several open neutrals, I am going to venture a guess and say that is why they are not lighting up. Circuit is not complete. I am going to take a wild ass guess and say that the red wire in your photo is your only hot. Again, test it. \n\nOnce you identity everything, do each switch, one at a time, check it to make sure the load is passing through to the lights and actually lighting them up. \n\nKeep in mind also that the dimmer switches have one terminal that is line and the other is load. They can be swapped like they can on the HS200. \n\nAs far as the 3 way goes, you will also have the job of identifying the traveler wire. I am going to venture a guess and say its that red wire on the far right. It also looks like you a mixing your neutral and black on the right side one. Done do that unless thats the traveler wire. \n\nOnce everything is complete, you are going to have a fun time shoving everything back into that 4 gang as the dimmers are bulky. \n\nSeriously though I hope you are planning on redoing the electrical in your house. Those cloth covered wires are a massive fire hazard. See my earlier comment on the fact that at some point in time, I think there has been an electrical fire in that box. Some of those wires look like they are covered in ash.\n\nEdit: Thank you kind stranger for the awards. I think they are my first ever!"", ""enchantedspring: This needs a little thought, but firstly, WAGOs are absolutely fine and are great when repositioning is needed - they are the default in Europe / UK for many years.\n\nHowever, the 5-way WAGOs common all the wires in them so this will not be appropriate for all the connections.\n\nWhat might be useful here is to draw out a line diagram of your cables coming in, and what you've ID'd each wire in those cables to be, which WAGO they lead to, and the same for the wires going out (to the lights or other switches etc.)\n\nWe could then 'see' what might be going wrong!\n\nDo you have any tagged lines in that age install?"", ""niceNotion: Those whites aren't neutral. You don't have a neutral in there. \n\nKasa \\[most smart switches\\] use hot⇨ neutral to power the switch technology and hot⇨ load to power the fixture.  You only have the wiring to complete one of those circuits."", 'Rhouliha: I’m not sure if I do or don’t.  It’s an old house so the wiring is different, but from what I’ve read most 3-4 gangs do, irrespective of age of system.', ""niceNotion: $10 non-contact voltage meter saved my life. Every electrician has like 4 of them. If it beeps it's hot, if it doesn't then not."", ""Rhouliha: I'm using voltage testers, which has helped me identify where power is traveling through.  I see that when the switches are in the 'on' position, power travels through what I'm using as the load wire.  I'm turning the breaker on/off to test and move things around.\n\nI don't think there's been a fire in there (though I've only lived here 6 months).  I think it's just an old box.  It looks like the gang box may have been modified at some point from a 3 gang to a 4 gang box, as the furthest right gang slot/wires appear newer.\n\nI think you're on to something with the not using all of the neutrals and not closing the circuit.  I'll explore that a bit.  You are correct that the red wire in slot two (left of center) is the only powered cable.  There is another wire in the third slot (right of center) that has power coming to it, but I'm pretty sure it's coming from the other 3-way switch - if I turn off the breaker for this box but leave the breaker for the other 3-way box, it still has power coming through it but doesn't when I flip the other breaker off.  There is a red wire in the far right slot that does not get any power to it.\n\nThanks for all of your comments - I can tell you put a lot of thought into them.  And yeah, I'm not looking forward to trying to get everything to fit back in.  I had them mostly working last week but then started fitzing with things to help make room and now they're not working the same.  Ope."", ""Rhouliha: Good idea.  I've created a diagram of the various wires that I'm seeing.  Most of the wires are cloth covered and not clearly identified; however, there is green electrical tape on several of the wires, so I believe these are grounds.  In the far right gang slot, there are more modern wires that are colored (1) Red (no power is coming through it though), (2) white, and (3) black.  I wonder if at some point this was modified from a 3 gang to a 4 gang (since the far right one looks relatively new).\n\nAny insights appreciated.  Thank you."", ""Rhouliha: How can you tell whether there are neutrals?  I updated my post above to include a link to a draw-up of what I'm seeing.  I'm not sure if that helps clarify.  Thank you."", 'niceNotion: Why do you think you have neutrals.

My new strip light KL430 (UN) V2 just will not complete setup.

I've followed all of the troubleshooting, retraced my steps, changed location, used different phones and even reconfigured my Wi-Fi setup. All to no avail!

It's incredibly frustrating because I am comfortable with everything it requires of me so I can't help thinking the unit is faulty?

The setup process is not complicated, but it seems like the strip controller is timing out at the point where it should be connecting to the network, because the LED's status signal changes from white and green back to orange and green (while the app is showing the “connecting to network” screen).

I've even completely switched off the 5GHZ WiFi radio and disabled all related features, rebooted everything multiple times, logged out of the app on both phones, and factory reset the light strip several times as well.

(Meanwhile, the rest of my devices haven't missed a beat, other than having to make do with being on the slower 2.4 GHz frequency.)

I've tried using the live chat support on the TP-Link site last night but I was in a queue of one and there was no answer for over half an hour so I gave up. I've searched the internet (and here) but not found anybody else having similar problems so far, so I'm not sure what to do next?

This is not my first TP-Link kit but it is my first Kasa product and I'm starting to regret it already after spending the best part of 8 hours messing around. (Purchased new from Amazon this week.) Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 2XL were the devices used.

Can you use this LED strip with a dimmer?

I've been watching its rollout and the firmware updates to see if they fixed the problems. The complete 52 page forum discussion can be found [here](https://community.tp-link.com/us/smart-home/forum/topic/157607?page=52).

This weekend I noticed the KS230 was back in stock at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CX9G1WT/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_2?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&th=1). Then over the past day or so it went from 3/5 stars with a smattering of reviews to then having no reviews to now being joined with the older non dimmable different style HS210KIT so it appears to have 8000+ reviews. 

While one can argue that the original reviews are now inaccurate, finding this knowledge is now intentionally hidden. Unless there is a convenient way to find solely the 230KIT reviews, this is intentionally grouping different products just as other shady companies selling on Amazon do.

I'm not saying don't buy - I still think it will end up being the best for my use, but this is unethical enough that I'll hold out longer to gather more info.

We have dozens of Tp/kasa products. Recently I wanted to relocate a Keurig coffee maker to a small section of countertop next to my refrigerator. The refrigerator is on its own dedicated 15A circuit. Plugging the coffee maker into the outlet could have started a fire or tripped the circuit breaker. I stumbled upon the TP link KP303 smart power strip. Rated for 15A or 1800W, i had an idea! Plug in both the coffee maker AND the refrigerator into the power strip, and create an Alexa voice routine that would power down the refrigerator and then give power to the coffee maker. The routine has a 10 minute pause after the coffee maker is turned on so you could easily make a few cups with the Keurig. The pause also allows the refrigerator to avoid short cycling the compressor (bad for longevity). Then the routine reverses, cutting power to the coffee maker and sending power back to the refrigerator. This way there's never a chance both devices are running at the same time. This solution might not work if you're the type of person that drinks coffee all day, or has an old school coffee maker that keeps a pot warm for several hours. But for us, we only have the Keurig for company so it won't be a concern. Before anyone jumps on me for using a power strip like this to supply power to kitchen appliances, the strip is rated (and certified) to handle 15A. The refrigerator uses around 6A when running, but does spike to 12 during compressor start up for about 1 second.	6	"['enchantedspring: All angles covered! :)', ""MikeP001: Right, that's why it's recommended to run the fridge on it's own circuit.  I \\*think\\* that's from the electrical code.  I doubt it's a fire hazard, but if the breaker tripped and you didn't notice it could be a problem...\n\nBe sure to add some backup in the case of the automation failing.  The old kasa plugs would always remain off after a power outage which made them somewhat unsuitable for fridges/freezers, does the KP303 allow you to configure it what happens in that case?"", ""AgonizingFury: While this is creative, it may not be necessary. 15A at 120 Volts is 1800 watts. The Keurig uses 1500 Watts at it's peak, and most refrigerators are 100 - 250 Watts, leaving you some leeway even if both happen to be at their peak usage. Note that the refrigerator will surge a bit when it first kicks on, but that shouldn't be a problem unless you are using knob and tube wiring with insulation in the walls."", 'mattbbb14: There may be a way to get creative and use IfTTT to monitor the status of the specific outlet that the refrigerator is on. I don\'t really see it being an issue. They will default to off in a power outage which would be the best case scenario with regard to safety. And while we rarely loose power, i can\'t see it being something that would go unnoticed for more than a handful of hours overnight (worse case). Otherwise, we\'re in and out of the fridge all day. So it would be obvious if it didn\'t have power. And since the smart plug is named ""refrigerator"", I would just need to ask Alexa to turn on the refrigerator.', ""mattbbb14: Refrigerator runs at 7.1A per the tag on the unit. That doesn't account for the surge during compressor start up. That's 850W. Add in the 1500W from the keurig and that's a recipe for disaster."", ""MikeP001: Yep, it should be fine if you're home.  The folks that I've heard complain most have been away when it happened.  Sometimes the wifi is messed up after an outage which prevents fixing it remotely or via a cloud like IFTTT. \n\nA daily schedule to reset things might work, but if your router doesn't come up or the plug doesn't reconnect after a restart the plug's timers won't work either (they need NTP to set the current time or the schedules fail).""]"

I have a TP-Link SG3452 L2+ and a Sophos UTM 220 in use.
I would like to introduce a separate management vlan as is common.
The plan is that all vlans including mgmt vlan on ETH3 of Sophos go to the switch. That is tagged traffic for to the switch. This in turn would mean in my understanding to configure a trunk port for the uplink on the switch. Also creating a vlan interface for the mgmt vlan on the switch, and giving it an IP from the mgmt network.
Unfortunately, the Switch is then not reachable under this address and the Switch cannot reach the Omada Controller.
A test has shown that it only works if management traffic from an untagged interface of the Sophos leads to an access port of the switch. Thus 2 ports would have to lead from the Sophos to the switch. One access port for the management untagged and one trunk for the remaining vlans.
Does anyone have an idea if it is somehow possible to route all traffic including management through the trunk port and the switch is reachable and in addition further to the next switch to trunk the management vlan?"	0	[]

Speculawyer	6	q4911e	TPLinkKasa	https://www.reddit.com/r/TPLinkKasa/comments/q4911e/how_much_vampire_watts_do_the_various_tplink_kasa/	"I've started installing a bunch of TP-Link Kasa Smart plugs and switches for home automation fun but also because I joined a local demand-response program (which you should do to if you can, see below). But I'm wondering to what degree I am doing more harm than good by connecting all these permanent vampire draining switches & plugs when the goal is to save energy.  Do we have a list of how many watts each type of TP-Link Kasa Smart plugs and switches drains while ""off""? They do have LED night-lights and are constantly listening to the WiFi.

&#x200B;

Editorial on demand-response programs: ""Demand-response"" is the clumsy term for programs where utilities call on customers to reduce their consumption because the current load is coming close to the maximum generation capacity. This used to be done by the utility phone-calling factories and asking if they can shut down some equipment. Now with the internet and the ""internet of things"" (like Kasa Smart plugs and switches) EVERYONE can participate in such programs. Participating in such programs is good for the health of the grid especially as we add more renewables because sometimes you can have some freak weather conditions that reduce generation like cloudy no-wind days.

I heard you could control this with just one HS 210 on the hot side.  That's not been my experience.  At least not reliably.

I used a voltage meter and found the HOT side of the circuit, installed one of the HS 210 pair and sure enough, it worked fine.  The app showed the correct condition, controlled the circuit, it worked with Alexa and all switches in the series worked as expected.

The problem came in when I used the dumb 4 way and the dumb 3 way under the HS 210 at the end of the circuit.  Flipping these switches back and forth would cause the HS 210 to become de-energized very briefly especially as the 4 way flips states.  With the HS 210 offline, it could not report the on/off condition back to the app.  As the HS 210 to drop it's connection to the router it would become unreachable until it rebooted.

If you walked back and forth between the dumb 3 way and dumb 4 way and did an on/off/on/off  you could reproduce the problem every time.  That said, if you were patient and didn't DO this sort of nonsense you could get by with just one switch and live with brief outages when they did occur.

I put the other HS 210 (they come 2 in a box) on the far end of the circuit and everything works perfectly all the time.  No more reboots or drop-outs at all.  As fast as you like you can run between any of the switches but no more drop-out or reboots.  I'm pretty sure this is because the far HS 210 is putting a bit of voltage on the travelers so the HS 210 on the hot side can draw power from any pair of wires and stay powered at all times.

Anyway if you have the time (an hour), this guy does a full rundown and my experience matches his conclusions exactly.

You can use a pigtail to provide power to the hot leads on your Kasa switches- just take the hot line that's coming from the breaker, and wire nut the hot leads from the switches to it. If you are still going to have one or more non-Kasa switches in this box, you may need to cut one or more short pieces of black wire to connect them up.\n\nSame goes for the neutral (white) wires. Your setup shows them daisy-chained together between the switches, but I would use a pigtail for simplicity. I'd probably add a new piece of wire coming out of your pre-existing pigtail, and attach all of your white wires from your Kasa switches to it.\n\nSame thing with the ground wires, which aren't pictured in your drawing. You'll want to use a pigtail for them probably, depending on how the stuff in this box is grounded.\n\nThen, each switch will have the other hot wire (the load) connected to the respective lights.\n\nObligatory: Make sure you use new, appropriately-sized wire nuts for everything, especially your pigtails.

any help is greatly appreciated :)"	10	"['IncapableOfLaughing: I saw this.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/TPLinkKasa/comments/p58050/_/hbedw2m/?context=1', ""nxtiak: I just got the KL400L5.

1632059201.0	19-Sep-2021 06:46:41	Overall, is Kasa a better choice than Wemo?	lmolter	4	pr88ke	TPLinkKasa	https://www.reddit.com/r/TPLinkKasa/comments/pr88ke/overall_is_kasa_a_better_choice_than_wemo/	I've got a bunch of Wemo switches that I can't access because the Wemo app won't connect to whatever cloud it connects to. I just changed my FiOS router because of an upgrade in service and did a hard-reset on the Ubiquiti WAP. All the dimmers refused to connect to WiFi after that. Worst part is that I can't use the app to configure any of the remaining switches that \*did\* reconnect. So... I have a Kasa dimmer coming today to replace the most finicky Wemo dimmer I have. In the collective experience, is going with Kasa a good choice?	18	"['MikeP001: Hardware wise I find them pretty close, and both have UL certification so make a much safer choice than cheap imported junk.\n\nCloud-wise by many reports TP Link is better but I don\'t and wouldn\'t want to use either cloud.\n\nSupport is probably similar, I suspect outsourced.  I\'ve had very little interaction with either.\n\nTP Link has kept their community with what looks like a real TP Link employee dropping by occasionally (weekly?) to ""refer the problem to the engineers"".  Belkin closed their community, before it did support appeared to be outsourced and was poor, usually ""is it on? is the app current? did you reset it?""\n\nThe key difference is in the local API which is needed to avoid interacting with either cloud.  \n\nFor now, beklin/wemo is using a published, standard and more or less supported local API that is fully functional.  Their app used to find wemos locally using that API but they recently stopped doing so - I suspect the boneheads writing the app couldn\'t make it work properly (there\'s a trivial fix I do in my own app but they never asked me...).\n\nTP Link / Kasa uses an unpublished, non-standard, unsupported interface and TP Link has started removing it from their devices.  The UK firmware version does not allow aftermarket apps to connect at all.  They haven\'t broken firmware from other parts of the world but they did say they plan to do so.  So for now they work locally for their own app (""local only mode"") and with aftermarket apps.  If they change that they\'ll lose a lot of supporters.  OTOH HS200\'s are very, very inexpensive on amazon right now which is pretty compelling...\n\nTapo is a separate TP Link product.  It\'s cloud only, no local API and has no integration with kasa.  It looks like a separate company acquisition.  Personally I wouldn\'t touch them.', 'None: [deleted]', ""nxtiak: I just replaced 11 wemo devices to Kasa, and it's 100% worth it.\nI had two of the original wemo dimmers, 2 different plugs plugs, a bunch of original light switches and a set of 3-ways.\n\nI like the wemo dimmers because of the look and style and it is a lot easier and faster to change brightness because of the touch panel.\n\nWhy did I switch? Wemo is just very unreliable. The rules and schedules don't work well and very limited. Mine had issues with timezones too I set it for 10pm and it does it at 7pm. My Google Assistant often thinks it's disconnected from Wemo too.\n\nAlso the set up, I have the latest Android phone with latest OS and Wemo's setup often fails and takes me 20-30 minutes to set up, I would have to resort using an old iphone 4 and doing weird hotspots with another phone. Back a few years ago it was fine before their major update.\n\nI also have Frontier FiOS and Ubiquiti router and  Wifi 6 APs.\n\nAnyways with kasa, setup is super easy and straight forward, one try and it's done. So much easier making rules and schedules. Switches react so much faster than wemo too.\n\nAlso Kasa is so much cheaper than Wemo.\n\nI'm trying to sell all my Wemo stuff and having a hard time. No one wants these."", ""lmolter: <update> I replaced one Wemo dimmer with a Kasa HS220. Only surprise was that I was expecting 4 leads coming from the switch body (similar to the Wemo), but only ground and neutral were there. The load and line were screw terminals such as a regular light switch would have. I see the reasoning because if I were replacing a stock dimmer with the Kasa, I would just reconnect the line and load wires to the Kasa. I, however, was replacing a Wemo, and I had to supply black 12GA wire to the switch screw terminals. No biggie.\n\nThe WiFi setup went well. The dimmer connected to my 2GHz network that the Wemo couldn't connect to (hence the replacement). The phone app seems ok, as does the scenes and schedules. So far, so good."", ""Smirkydarkdude: I just ripped out a pile of WeMo switches and plugs because they are simply unreliable.  The problem appears to be the WeMo servers become intermittently unavailable so the lights stop working with Alexa.  They still work manually and no, it's not my WiFi.  The Kasa products are an absolute dream in comparison.  Very snappy.  Zero problems so far."", 'vongdn: Wemo is the most unreliable and unstable smart switch and smart plug I have ever tried.  I stuck with them for a couple years but with random switches and plugs being shown as ""unresponsive"" and going through fits trying to reset them, I just gave up.

Bottom line though is to stay away from Wemo, their devices will become unresponsive randomly and for no good reason and it will take you forever to get them online again....and it happens ALL THE TIME.', ""lmolter: Ahhh... all very interesting. I just ordered one HS220 dimmer to replace a Wemo that is not cooperating. By 'aftermarket apps', would Homebridge be considered one?

If there was a real DHCP problem wemos wouldn't work for anyone.  99% or more of wemo customers would have no idea how to setup a hotspot, let alone how to configure the wemos using it.  Just those two problems would have their sales plummet to zero.  You're running custom DHCP server on a rPi, I would guess you have other things going on too...  DNS maybe?  TP Link might work better for you but it's probably not because of wemo bugs... hooves are usually horses not zebras."", ""nxtiak: LOL. I have zero DHCP problems. Not running a Pi.

Got the Kasa app installed, created Kasa account, setup switch and noticing HORRENDOUSLY slow response times (if at all) in the app turning it on and off. Let’s say 30 seconds. Secondly I can barely access any of the tabs for the switch to schedule or view power usage. Schedule may come up sometimes after 30 seconds or just time out. The Energy tab never works. It just spins then shows 0’s. 

I have a light connected that pulls 10w tested at the wall. 

Now here’s the KICKER: I tried the app on mobile data turning off my wifi and IT ALL WORKS. Perfectly. I have reinstalled the whole app, turned the phone on and off, tried a local only guest account and reset the plug in local mode. Made sure I’m using 2.4ghz and made sure 10 times that local network access is enabled in phone settings. Also got it on an iPad with exactly the same symptoms but can’t test mobile data on that easily. 

I’m one plaster wall room away from my router. I’ll make a new post actually as well. As I type this out it may not be the same issue. 

Sorry for the caps, I’m feeling frustrated at this point. It just doesn’t make sense and I’ve exhausted google. 

Thanks for any help

Update:
I have a few comments below with more info that I found out after a lot of effort with diagnosing where the issue lies. 
However, I installed Home Automation on a raspberry pi 3a+ and controlling this switch works perfectly. No delay, no time out. Reads all the energy info out of the box. It just works. Think I've found my go forward, and now I'm not tied into any single brand :D

My printer glass plate will make the face perfectly smooth/glossy, however lines will be visible so I'm considering a coat of primer and a coat of enamel paint.

IoT devices themselves are never confused because they can only see the 2.4GHz signal and can\'t be steered :).\n\nI\'d check the WAP thing first, it\'s a very common problem.  If you\'re able, rename the SSID for it and setup the kp125 to connect to the closer one.  Bulbs are a pain because they give no indication about connectivity except the app saying they\'re connected (or not).  So you really have no idea what\'s wrong when they\'re disconnected.  The band steering shouldn\'t matter once the bulb has been setup as the app and the bulb find each other in the TP Link cloud, not locally.

I'm trying to replace an illuminated light switch that turns on patio lights with a new HS200. The switch is part of a 3-gang box, shared with a 2-way switch and a 1-way switch. I've attached a simplified diagram of the wiring below, removing all of the neutral and ground wires because they have all been tied together with wire nuts.

The black and red color scheme corresponds to what I see in real life. The orange triangle is a pigtail wire nut.

https://preview.redd.it/n39tpxhb84n71.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=72ec8ad5eb8e16b7501f79b9762213b86c63256f

I tried just connecting the two black wires from the illuminated switch to the HS200 (along with one neutral and one ground), but that didn't result in the HS200 being able to turn on the patio lights, and furthermore caused the other two switches to be unresponsive.

My guess is that the problem is with the pigtail -- is there a way to rewire the other two switches so that they preserve their existing functionality, and allows the HS200 to work?

The other thought I had was, does it matter which ground/neutral wire I use?

Hopefully this is an appropriate question for this forum -- this seems too simple to call an electrician, but is way outside my comfort zone.

Thanks in advance!"	9	"[""enchantedspring: It looks like you're missing a wire to the outdoor light - could you map out exactly what each wire goes to just to be sure you have enough?\n\nWas the prior switch always illuminated?\nIf so, take the wires as they were in that - the HS200 needs a permanent supply to power the switching electronics and wifi chip etc. inside."", 'MikeP001: Hard to tell for sure from this picture, but I think the answer is ""no"".  The light appears to be controlled by 3-way switches, so the box labelled for the HS200 would have been a 3-way switch as well.    If you have a proper line-in on in the HS200 box you could wire the HS200 so that the light is always on if the HS200 is on.  It would only controllable by the other switches when the HS200 is off.  But you probably want a 3-way kasa switch for the light somewhere in there to work properly.\n\nWhat do the grey boxes represent?  There\'s too many to be the loads.  In a 3-way switch the whites matter so you need to add them back, and you really should draw in how the load is wired.', 'ClumsyPiano: Thanks for replying -- can you elaborate on ""missing a wire to the outdoor light""? The existing illuminated switch controls it. Do you mean that I\'d need a separate wire from a different source cable? In that case it would appear that I don\'t have enough existing wires, as all of them are currently tied down to the other two switches (hence my question about whether it\'s possible to rewire the other two).', ""ClumsyPiano: Thanks Mike, a few clarifications:  \n1) The existing illuminated switch is not a 3-way switch; it literally only has the two connections shown in the diagram.  \n2) The grey boxes are just where the wires are coming from the wall. I actually don't know what the terminology is here 😅\n\n3) None of the whites or grounds are currently wired up to any of the switches, which is why I didn't bother drawing them; they are all bundled together with their own wire nuts."", ""enchantedspring: Gotcha.\n\nIt's difficult to picture without being there and able to test. \n\nThe HS200 (and any switch like it) needs a permanently on black, white and ground to power its internals all the time.\n\nYou can pass the black through to the light and use the existing white leg (either installed at the switch or elsewhere), but most people experiencing this are missing the unswitched or unmarked white.\n\nIf you can map out where each wire goes to (and label them), it will help you work out what to connect where."", ""MikeP001: Oh, that's a drawing of 1 electrical box with multiple switches and incoming wires?  If so it's pretty easy - one kasa black goes into the orange bundle (that's line in / power shared everywhere), the other to the outgoing black to your load (light).  White from the kasa to the white bundle, green ground to a bare ground screw.  It literally should be preserving the original switch's connections and adding the kasa white.\n\nBe sure not to break up the white or black bundles, they need to stay together.

I don't like playing around with the wires behind the panel cover myself let alone recommending a neophyte do so...  only the master breaker for protection.  Running a wire that long from a live panel seems non-trivial...  To save the trouble disconnect the white from both ends, connect one end to ground.  Measure between the open end and ground and compare it to the value measured while disconnected.\n\nPersonally I'd short the lines - it's how I double, double confirm the power is off before starting work.   But checking a neutral line for continuity would be one of the last things I'd suspect - lots of more common and easier problems to eliminate first.\n\nIt won't be insufficient load - the HS200 is a simple relay, only the 3 ways measure load.  Agreed on the wiring, it's that more often than a bad switch.  Best is to invest in a meter - assuming/guessing is a bad practice and can be dangerous.  If suspect a switch can be tested in another known 2-way circuit with a neutral (esp after the circuit is verified with a meter!).""]"

It defaults everything as if I want a schedule where there's no way to create a one time event type thing with ease.

Amazon has a $10 coupon on top of the $53.99 price. Then I saw there was a 16.4ft option. I clicked on it and got another option. Ok, cool. This is a KL400L5 16.4 RGB strip for $25 plus an extra 15% off. Here is the link: [https://www.amazon.com/Kasa-Smart-SmartThings-Brightness-KL400L5/dp/B09BG9B2JQ](https://www.amazon.com/Kasa-Smart-SmartThings-Brightness-KL400L5/dp/B09BG9B2JQ) I cant find any reviews on the Kl400, only the KL430

It doesn't appear that this has white LEDs and it also doesn't look like it has more individual control like the KL430 does (scenes or patterns). It looks like it is 12v, bone stock RGB strip but with the KASA integration. Ok, this can do what I need for this project so that's fine.

I try and search TP-links website for the product and its not found.I search their press releases and nothing is found.I search google and only get a few results from FCC filings. I go to the first one here: [https://fccid.io/2AXJ4KL400](https://fccid.io/2AXJ4KL400) and am able to look through lab photos, dimensions, manual, declaration letter and other tech specs including the file date of June 28, 2021. From reviewing, it looks like there will be a 5m ({KL400L5} 5m strip w/ 12v1A adapter) and a 10m ({KL400L10} 10m strip w/ 12v1.5A adapter) models. Other links lead to actual FCC's website with the same filings.

Someone else posted the fcc.io link about 2 months ago as well with no context and no comment.

I looked at the KASA app itself and its already listed there as a product you can add to the account.

So I ask, has anyone actually bought this item from amazon? I am half tempted too to see if they have it in stock already.

&#x200B;

Edit: Kasa's website finally has this product under their lighting section.

The KL430 has 10 LEDS (5 white and 5 RGB) in 4 inches. IMO, More LEDS, the better. If I calculated correctly, the KL400 has  30 LEDs in a meter for a total of 150 LEDs for the 5m/16ft strip. I didnt calculate the KL430. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/jqNiH6L](https://imgur.com/a/jqNiH6L) KL430 RGBIC is on the left in all the photos, KL400 on the right. Ignore my dusty ass floors. \n\nThe white is at full 100% for both strips. You can see the KL430 is basically washed out but a hell of a lot brighter. I like strips with dedicated white LEDs instead of RGB trying to make up white.   \n\n\nThe other 3 colors, blue, green and red are at 10% for both strips otherwise it would be harder to photograph. \n\nThe KL430 is definitely more expensive but is a lot brighter (and more waterproof). However, the KL400 uses a standard RGB12V pinout so you can sub in your own strip that has more LEDs per in or meter depending on how your measuring on the condition that you dont overload the 12v 1A small power supply. \n\nI looked online and got some basic info on the wattage rating. Someone else feel free to correct me. \n\nTP-Links website says they consume 13.5 watts. Online calculator says that just shy over 1A which makes the power supply correctly sized. \n\nA generic, 150 LED RGB strip (same as what TP-Links ships with the KL400 kit) off of eBay in a 5M length supposedly consumes about 27W; more than the little power supply that it comes with can handle. \n\nA generic, 144 LED RGB strip off of eBay in a 1M length supposedly consumes 35W.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile its possible to upgrade the strip to a brighter, more densely packed with LEDs strip, you would also need to upgrade the power supply to a 3w or even 4w power supply. The barrel adapter on the PS is a common 2.1mm x 5.5mm it can be switched out with something else that has a higher amperage rating. What I don't know is how a higher wattage strip will affect the controller itself. I will eventually test it out and see. The KL400 strips come with the standard 2.54mm round male/female header pins. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, I am happy that TP link has come out with a controller (thats all I really wanted) that works with my existing architecture of Kasa/Google Home/IFTTT and I dont have to buy some crappy bluetooth enabled strip, with some crappy app or remote that will get lost, that I cant control it remotely or hook into IFTTT to do routines.

If I make changes through controller and then take the controller offline, will the settings still be in effect for the AP’s?

85% of the time, they work great, but we noticed that they would randomly drop the connection to wi-fi, and show the red wi-fi light, or might show a blinking green light. We wouldn't do anything and they would reconnect on their own and go back to normal.  Thinking it was wi-fi, as I only had an older router in the basement, I upgraded to a new Asus ZenWifi AX mesh, which has wifi6 and I have great coverage.  Other non-Kasa devices (IR blasters, vacuums, smart-plugs and echos) are further from the wifi nodes and never drop signal. 

I haven't seen any real consistency in the switches that lose connection either.  Sometimes it is one or two switches in a three gang in the basement, other times those are fine and a bathroom or bedroom switch goes. There is no consistency that would make me think I have just one or two (or a dozen) bad devices. Some of the switches seemingly have never disconnected, but I might just have missed them, as they disconnect for a time, then reconnect on their own.

I'm stumped. I've upgraded firmware. I've rebooted disconnected switches as I find them. I've hard reset a few and re-connected. Nothing seems to be a long-term fix.

Any ideas?"	8	"[""Sudden_Spender: Not really an idea but a very similar situation. I have four of the RGB bulbs in my ceiling fan. They all randomly lose connection occasionally. They'll be grayed out on the app."", ""None: It's not necessarily a matter of further but the path it takes, too. The number of factors that can impact wifi is huge, but here are some common ones.\n\n**Issue: The door is closed.** Wifi is light. It's better at penetration than the visible spectrum but is still susceptible to the same physical limitations. A closed door may be enough to disconnect wifi from a device, especially if the door is solid-core. The wifi either needs to get through 3/4 of an inch of gypsum or an inch+ of wood. That can be a tall order. Try going into the room with your laptop and closing the door. If you see a signal drop, it's probably enough to knock your switch offline. I'm assuming that the wifi adapters in these devices aren't top of the line.\n\n**Fix:** Run an ethernet drop into the room with an additional mesh access point.\n\n**IP Address Conflicts.** Many residential routers ship with a cap on the number of devices they can assign an IP Address to. The function of assigning devices an IP Address is called DHCP. Router manufacturers often cap DHCP at 50 devices. In a modern house, it is not hard to surpass 50 devices connected to a network.\n\n**Fix:** *Good*: Expand the number of allowable devices in DHCP.\n\n*Best:* Assign DHCP reservations outside the DHCP scope to static devices (switches, vaccuums, Echos, etc).\n\n**Issue: Concrete buildings**. Rebar in concrete buildings can make what is essentially a Faraday Cage.

Can I add a KL130b into his room for colour changing and dimmable light?


My concern is that the on/off commands with the switch and bulb will conflict. He doesn't have a phone so will only control these via Alexa on the Echo Dot or by hitting the Sonoff switch. I realise the smart bulb and smart switch seems like duplication, but not keen on a smart bulb and manual switch so both sounds good... Any reason why this wouldn't be a good set up?"	4	"[""MikeP001: If you mean the bulb power will be provided through the sonoff, it'll work but it might be a less than optimum experience.  The sonoff will need to be on before the bulb will connect to wifi and respond to commands.  Turning off either will work but it might not be clear which one is actually off if you're only using voice.  Some tp link bulbs were unhappy with being powered off for too long and would lose their configuration, not sure if that's fixed in the KL series.\n\nAnother option would be to remove the sonoff and control the bulb with voice.  Cycling a manual switch will get the bulb to light up when not using voice.  Bulbs typically will light when power is returned which can be a bit annoying at night if you have power outages."", 'justbiteme2k: Thank you, it\'s the voicing bit that concerns me. You say ""lights off"" and you\'re not really sure if the bulb or switch is losing power first. Is there a way to disable the on/off command from the bulb and just have the Sonoff controlling it as if it were a manual switch? Or a way to sequence so that a voice off first switches the bulb off, then the Sonoff switch do you think?', 'MikeP001: If you use distinct names to be sure they\'re distinguished by voice you should be ok, esp if you only turn off the switch.  But if you start mixing actions - sometimes off by the switch, sometimes turning the bulb off by command - it can be a little confusing.  And while the bulb should be ok with the power off at the switch they\'re not really designed to work like that so you might get some odd behavior - for example they can be reset if you turn the power on/off too quickly, and I\'ve heard of some TP Link bulbs losing their settings completely and disconnecting from wifi.  You\'ll also need to wait some time (10s or so) for the bulb to connect to wifi between commands like ""turn switch on"" and ""make bulb blue"".', ""justbiteme2k: Hmm, yes I can totally see why this could happen, thank you very much. It's just nice to talk it over with someone, working from home is quite isolating.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, maybe it's best to grab a colour changing led strip instead and not complicate matters with the Sonoff switch.

Was hoping someone might be able to provide some help here, as Kasa's Support wasn't able to find an answer and exited the chat on me.

The funny thing is, I have 5 other Kasa mini smart plugs that are working perfectly right now (models HS105 and KP100, if that's at all relevant). It's just the two HS103 V2 plugs that have malfunctioned on me.

I've been doing various shortcuts in IFTTT, with TP Link/Kasa and Pushcut or Webhook, very simple stuff.

Essentially, I'd like to set up a shortcut widget on my iPhone that I can tap and it increases the brightness of the Kasa smartbulb by a fixed amount, say 10%. Tap it again, and it increases another 10%.

I'd like to create a second shortcut to do the same, but decrease the brightness instead. I imagine these would have to be two different buttons, which is fine. I liken it to having a tappable dimmer switch on my iPhone screen.

Is this even doable? I've been toying around with it, and I can put the info in Pushcut, but that creates a drop down menu of the various levels to choose from. Not the worst solution, but I love the idea of just having 2 dedicated shortcut widgets on my iPhone that I can raise or lower the the brightness as needed.

Separately, I want to have dimmed lights from 10pm to 7am in my bathroom and normal brightness during other times.

Are either of these possible with my existing Kasa switches? Potentially by purchasing a motion sensor separately?  I also have everything connected to my Google Nest Hub Max.

Any thoughts on that?"", 'Schi11er: The Kasa 3-way dimmer will absolutely not work with a four way switch if you plan to use the four way switch. For your use case you will want a regular 3-way dimmer and a Kasa 3-way non-dimming switch.   \n\nIf you read the  \n([Kasa 3-way install instructions](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/3226/) it says to the mark the travlers as travler1 and travler2, and to not cross them.  If you have traveler1 as the first travler on one switch, and as the second travler on the other switch then the Kasa 3-way dimmer master switch will fast flash yellow as it detects incorrect wiring. \n\nThe 4-way switch is in the middle and connects the left travler1 to the right travler1 and the left travler2 to the right travler2. In this switch position, a Kasa 3-way dimmer master with a 3-way dimmer satellite will work. Then when you flip the switch on the 4-way, it will cross-connect left travler1 to right travler2, and left travler2 to right travler1. In this switch position, the Kasa 3-way master will detect wrong wiring and blink fast yellow.  So either always leave the 4-way switch in the correct position, or eliminate it by tying the top left and right travlers together; and tying the bottom left and right travlers together. \n\nIf you want to be able to turn the lights on and off from the four way switch, then you have two possibilities. \n\n1. If the switch is in a group of switches you will likely have ground, neutral and common hot. If you have common hot or even a line from another light, ground and neutral, then remove the 4-way switch by connecting left top and top right travlers; and connecting bottom left and bottom right travlers. Then install a Kasa smart switch using common hot, or line from another switch (ground and neutral). You can do this by either disconnecting the line from the other switch. Then twisting it with two wire pig tails and capping with a wire nut. Then connect one pig tail to the switch line and the other to the Kasa line. Alternatively, keep the switch wired as is, and add a pig tail to the Kasa. Most switches can be connecter by the screw lug, or by jamming a wire in a hole on the back of the switch. Connect you Kasa switch pig tail to which ever option is not in use. If you have only a screw, then you can remove the line, add a long pig tail with both ends stripped as well as a small piece stripped in the middle. Twist one end with the line, and cap with a wire nut.  Completely remove the line screw of one of the switches and wrap the center stripped wire around the screw and replace it. Then connect the other end to the other switch. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE CONNECT TWO WIRES TO ONE SCREW ON A SWITCH. \n\nYou now have a Kasa smart switch connected to nothing which you can program to control another switch when it is turned on or off.  \n\n2. Your second option is to use a Kasa 3-way switch, and a regular 3-way dimmer. Install the Kasa 3-way switch as the first switch in the circuit (line side, not the load side).  If you never set the dimmer below 50% it probably doesn’t matter if the Kasa switch is first. If you dim it all the way down, the Kasa switch will power down and go offline, if it is not the first switch on the circuit. To fix this simply swap the Kasa 3-way with the regular 3-way dimmer.']"

I purchased 2 of them for $69.99 each on Amazon, not cheap compared to others strips which are longer and half the price. I paid the price because i used other kasa products and i really like them.

I want to add the KL430 light strip under my kitchen cabinets. I will have to cut the strip a few times to make it go around my cabinets because i have the kitchen sink and and overhead microwave in the way.

I want to know, if i can connect the cut pieces through some connector or an extention? I saw plenty of video on youtube on how connectors and sodering wire fixed this issue. Will i be able to do this with the Kasa strip?

I've got a bunch of Kasa switches and plugs.  Whenever the power or internet comes back, there's almost always at least one (usually more) Kasa device that has ""lost its way.""  Today the internet was down for about 4 hours and when it returned, 4 switches and 2 plugs were fine, while 1 switch and 1 plug didn't reconnect.

I don't mind reconnecting the switch - it's just a simple 'press the reset button' and then it blinks green and we're good to go.  But the plug doesn't appear to have a simple reset button - rather, it has to be completely re-connected...or so it seems.  Am I missing something?  Is there an easier way to get the plug to try and reconnect on its own without deleting and re-adding it?

Thanks!"	2	"['bryanzs: First! 😁 And replying to my own post with a ""d\'oh!"".\n\nApparently power cycling the plug - as in pulling it out from the socket, NOT just pressing the switch on and off - is equivalent to a reset.

 For some reason, tp-link doesn't include a way to turn it off in settings, but it can be toggled through homekit or smth like that idk?.. anyways, I'd resorted to having electrical tape over the switch, but that's ugly, so I took apart a spare switch to fix it.

I can post pictures for all of the following if required, and I'll be making an ifixit guide to link to later. Just lmk in the comments.

This can all be done while the switch is powered and on the wall; if you're real cautious, you can take it/the electricity off first, but it's not necessary. Also the process is similar for my hs200 (bought 2020) and hs220 (bought 2021), but it's not identical, and YMMV. I'll highlight differences.

To get the switch cover off without damage, you need to pry with a somewhat thin tool(I used a knife, be smarter than me) from the top and then lift up, on the hs200, this can be done from the top edge, just don't poke too far (past the back lip of the cover) and pry gently until it pops out a bit, then pull up and a bit out, and it'll come off. On the hs220, this needs to be done from the side edge as close as possible to the top(under the dimmer ctrl), you can use either one or two tools, but you need to pop out the top on both sides, (again, not the dimmer, the paddle directly under the dimmer) then lift up and slightly out, and it'll come off. Be careful not to lose the spring here, it's not under tension, but could fall out.

[You could just stick something pointy in the right hole and break off the led here for a quick, permanent solution, but you probably shouldn't] Next you need to put something light blocking in the circular hole in the center of the piece of foam under the micro-switch. I used a piece of electrical tape, rolled up to be just the right diameter to fit, then cut down to only stick out a millimeter or so past the foam. For extra measure, I put two pieces of tape cut to size in the middle hole on the front plate(check that it's the right one with a light), I'd recommend this step if you want to totally block the light, but if you want a little bit, skip this.

Now just reassemble and you're done, it's a bit tricky to get the spring in right, it has to go in below the piece of foam. You need to lift the front plate up and over the bottom tab thingy(still while keeping the spring in the hole on the plate, but under the foam bit) to avoid breaking the tabs, but then just punch the top and it's back together.

I hope this helps, and sorry if it sounded condescending or drawn-out, I just don't want anyone to break their switch from my instructions."	7	['Nun-Taken: I just used an app called “Watt” - seems a lot easier although much less fun I’m sure!', 'jqmarkow: TL;DR: rip the front off, put tape in it, and put it back together', 'Mysterious-Flamingo: Or just use third party software to disable it...', 'RyanJWT: I used Watt too.

Lights randomly changing and outlets triggering unexpectedly.  It \\*seemed\\* like it was always the TP-Link products that did this, but I now think that's been a red herring.\n\nWhile looking for something completely unrelated tonight in the Alexa app, I noticed something new called 'Hunches'.  This is Amazon's attempt to have a 'hunch' that you wanted to do something.  For instance, if it determines you left the house, it has a 'hunch' you meant to turn off the light.  Same thing if it thinks you went to bed.  When I'm in bed reading at night, all of a sudden my dimmable lights would drop to 50%.\n\nWell, when I found the 'hunches' feature in Settings->Hunches, there was a log saying 'We determined you wanted to do 'x' and did it for you!' and sure enough, that log corresponded with all the 'random' stuff that was happening.  I immediately disabled hunches and ever since have not had a single issue with my devices.\n\nI'll come back and post more should this change, but this may have been something that Amazon broke, not TP-Link, which is why they never could fix it.\n\nSo... check your Alexa app, go to Settings, then Hunches and disable all of them.

I am using this to replace an old lutron CT-600P skylark dimmer since we switched all 4 can light bulbs to Feit LED BR30 dimmable flood lights. I currently have these setup with another manual dimmer in a different room and they work great. Now with the kasa dimmer setup and everything connected, including neutral, it won't dim. It only turns off and on the lights. I went through the app and did the calibration but nothing happened. I've searched all over but no luck. I called TP Link support but they couldn't help either so I have to service ticket opened. Anyone have this issue and hopefully a potential fix?

EDIT: I called the light bulb company and confirmed that the dimmers forward phase control is acceptable for the lights. Decided to pull the smart dimmer and place it in a similar switch box in a different room controlling the same type of lights. The kasa dimmer works perfectly. Turns out the issue is not with the dimmer but with the wiring in the bedroom. It has been renovated to add the can lights when there was originally only fan lights (that no longer work). Time to chase wires and potentially call an electrician.

The load wire to the fan is in a romex cable that has 4 cables (black, red, white, ground). The black connects to the fan. The red connects to the can lights in the ceiling. Makes sense that that wire should be for the fan light.\n3. When the dimmer (HS220 in question, connected to red wire controlling can lights) is turned on, all of the metal in the fan sets off my voltage tester pen.

If you can, move them to a fixture closer to the router to try in case the wifi signal is marginal (strong to the phone doesn't mean strong to a bulb).

I know I can group the lights together to work as one, but I have a question about installation.

Our light fitting is really tall so awkward to fiddle with. Is it possible to connect the bulbs to our network in a lamp, then move them to the light fitting? Do they retain the connection when moved, or do they reset?

I would like to avoid trying to install them directly and be up and down the ladders; ideally connecting them all in a lamp, then going up once to put them all in. Obviously if they reset once removed from a fitting this won't be possible.

I still have a Samsung SmartThings hub for some ZWave devices, so I connected Kasa to it, and then added those devices to Homebridge via the SmartThings Homebridge App. The idea of Homebridge -> SmartThings -> Kasa seems a little Rube Goldberg-like to me, but it’ll work until I can replace the Kasa stuff. \n\nIf anyone would like a ton of Kasa stuff, and you’re in the Atlanta, GA area, I’d be interested in reasonable offers.', 'myrtlebeachbums: Correct - right plugin. \n\nIt started happening within the past few months.

Maybe the smart switch is just on the wrong end, but in this case I think I am just going to put the pair of kasa switches, one on each end.  \n\nI will pass on your notes to my electrician for the 4 way group.', ""RegulusMagnus: That does sound like it's on the wrong end. No harm having smart switches on both ends, though!\n\nDo you have a multimeter, or some other method of determining which lines are hot?"", 'Hey19NYC: lets hope my electrician does, ha. Ill work closely with him on the 4 way to make sure we get that right. \n\nYeah my wife likes how it looks with the same switches everywhere, so I am ok doubling up sometimes just to keep it simple and consistent.', ""RegulusMagnus: You shouldn't have to touch the 4-way at all.\n\nUnfortunately the Kasa switch won't work there, so you can't have the same switch *everywhere*, but you can swap out whatever is there for a 4-way Decora-style switch (which is what I did)."", 'Hey19NYC: So wait, will a Kasa switch not control the 4 way group? Thats too bad, that is one of the main groups that I was hoping to control w a smart switch, since all the switches are downstairs.', ""RegulusMagnus: Yes the Kasa switches are compatible with a *circuit* containing 4-way switches (between two 3-way switches), but Kasa doesn't have hardware to replace the 4-way *switch*."", 'Hey19NYC: Im sorry, I dont understand the distinction here, can you dumb it down for me?', 'RegulusMagnus: Sure. [Here\'s an image of a circuit where three switches can control the same light](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/4-way_switches_position_2.svg/1920px-4-way_switches_position_2.svg.png).\n\nIn America, the convention is to call the first and third switches ""3-way"" switches, as there are three conductors/wires coming out of it (note 1. that most devices will also have a ground wire, which is a safety device and not typically part of the circuit, and 2. that smart switches typically also have a neutral/white wire, so that it can receive power when the light is off).\n\nThe 3-way switch on the hot side controls which ""traveler"" wire carries the current, and the 3-way switch on the load side controls which traveler is connected to the light bulb.\n\nThe 4-way switch in the middle swaps the two travelers (note 3. a circuit such as this can have multiple 4-way switches in the middle between the two 3-way switches).\n\nFor many smart switches on the market, circuits containing two 3-way switches require both of those 3-way switches to be swapped with smart switches, so that the switch on the load side can report when it is pressed. Kasa 3-way switches are *extra* smart, in that a single switch on the hot side can *sense* whether or not the light is on, so it is able to report when other switches are pressed, even if those switches are ""dumb"".\n\nSo, long story short: you only need to swap out the 3-way switch on the hot side (far left in the diagram), but you can also swap out the 3-way switch on the load/light side (far right in the diagram) if you want. Either way, the smart switch will be able to tell if the 4-way switch in the middle has been pressed/flipped.\n\nKasa does not produce a smart 4-way switch, so there is not an option for you to replace that switch with one that matches perfectly.\n\nMore details on circuits here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiway_switching#More_than_two_locations', 'Hey19NYC: Thanks so much for this, this is very educational for me.', 'RegulusMagnus: Absolutely! Feel free to ping me if you ever have more questions.', 'Mebunkeryou: Can also confirm the 3way switches work in a 4 way circuit. I have 2 smart 3 ways and a dumb 4 way rocker and it works as it should. \n\nI have 30 switches plus a dozen other wifi Iot devices on a sub par internet setup and its all good. I also have my switches integrated with Smartthings which make them even better.']"

Just setup my first DECO, I put it into AP mode and no longer have access to setup VLANS.

Does AP mode not allow vlans? What is the best way to use vlans and not have it running DHCP?

The standard AP device support this one of their smart devices do not? [https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/418/](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/418/)"	0	[]

I have quite a few kasa smart switches in my house. A lot of them I have no issue but I've noticed on the switches attached to LED can lights in my kitchen and living room. I will get random not necessarily flickering but the lights will dim in and out . I've checked the wiring multiple times to make sure nothing was loose. I'm supposed to have an electrician come out and run a new outlet for me and was asking him about it and he said he has heard certain LED lights have issues with smart switches. Just wondering if anyone else's experienced this issue and if I need to look for a different brand of switch where I don't have to replace all of my can lights.	8	"['randallw: So I replaced quite a few of my existing dimmers with the HS210, but found one in particular was exhibiting a flickering when at anything less than 100%. This happened semi-randomly when my wife was in the room having meetings. I figured out that it was because the switch also controlled an outlet (as well as the can light in the ceiling), and she plugged her computer charger into the outlet. I figure it\'s something where when the dimmer switch is at 50%, the computer charger is taking most of the charge at 50%, thus making it where the LED can light was flickering. \n\nI\'ll likely go through and change out the plug so it\'s no longer a ""switched"" outlet. Not sure if this is the same thing that you\'re experiencing or not, but thought I\'d post just in case it is.', 'OCR10: Have you tried the dimmer calibration feature?  You can set the range of dimming that the light bulb can handle.  Try narrowing the range to see if the flicker goes away.  Or try a different brand of bulb that is highly rated for dimming functionality.', 'I5FDPACHMED: My switch is causing my light to turn on and off. Any tips?', 'Sigmabond2: I am having the same issue across many different switches. Hs200, hs210, and hs220. \n\nThe bulbs will dim ever so slightly every few minutes.  Did you ever find a solution to this?', 'PoeB09:  I am having issues with the hs210 three way switch . That is good to know I will have to see if any outlets are on that circuit.', ""PoeB09: The switch hs210 is non dimming it's the the three way kasa switch. I have two of the dimmers the hs220s and had to calibrate them. The dimming/flicker Is happening mainly in the can lights in my living room and kitchen."", ""PoeB09: I would check the neutral and make sure it's not loose."", ""PoeB09: I think it ended up being dirty power. I bitched and moaned to the electric company and they came and upgraded our transformer. Now it happens every now and then but hardly noticeable. I would check neutrals . I don't know if the transformer upgraded actually fixed it or something else. I have a buddy who lives about a mile away, no smart switches we think it may just be poor infrastructure from our city's power. Hopefully you can figure it out I know its the most annoying thing ever. Once you notice it, it seems like its always flickering""]"
