It begins with 3, volume scaling microwave beeps and other noises that happen before the ad hits the screen. 

I'm not usually bothered by noises, but this shit gets me bad. Gets my girl even worse as she struggles with excessively loud noises. It plays the sounds before the video appears so there's no way to know ahead of time. We watch Little House on the Prarie that does not have the best mix for sound. We require a slightly higher volume for the show to sound proper, but that makes the beeps in the ad horrendous. Amazon says that they can't do anything. What can I do!? I want this ad gone from my life or at least replaced with one that doesn't have awful beeps that pierce your ears. 

&#x200B;

Is there anything that can be done? I know I sound like I'm bitching but if you've seen the ad it's really fucking insane that someone edited it and thought, ""yep, this is gonna be the one."""	4	['meditrina73: I agree. Three stupid beeps. Sounds like a microwave or fridge alarm when you leave the door open.  I hear it from my roommate’s tv with her door closed. I cannot hear the tv… just the damn beeps.

I live with someone who awakens a bit earlier than I do and puts on a very specific channel I hate which is itself especially loud.  So I have a specific low stress, pleasant accent show with many seasons and I keep it on all night at a low volume and it cancels the other tv noise when I wake up.  None of the other streaming services would just play and keep playing. 

But recently, maybe a week, it starts the usual interruption “are you still watching” box and stops the show.  Which means I get to have hellish awakenings again.
