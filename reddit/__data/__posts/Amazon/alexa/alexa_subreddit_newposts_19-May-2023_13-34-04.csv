I could ask Alexa to turn it on/off, mute it etc - which is all I really want to be able to do. The thing is now the connection seems to be gone, & I can't for the life of me remember how on earth I hooked it up in the first place. I've recently read a little about HEOS, but I'm pretty sure my unit is too old for that. Can anyone point me in the right direction?	1	"[""Important-Comfort: That shouldn't have changed just by hooking up a new TV.\n\nIs it possible Alexa was controlling the TV, and the TV was controlling the power and volume of the receiver through CEC?""]"

Right now, it seems I am able to only add 1 bulb to a routine. I can obviously tell it a commend and every light in the house shuts off, but I'd like to add a routine based on rooms. But I'd like to turn the bedroom off when I go to bed and the living room stays on for the wife/kids. Is there a way to select multiple devices to a routine, or is it all or 1?	2	['Separate-Effective77: You set up rooms in the Alexa app and then add the bulbs to the room. You can also add an Echo device to the room and then say “turn on lights”, “turn off lights” and only those light bulbs assigned to the room with turn on or off. \n\nIf there isn’t a echo device in each room you then say “turn off lights in room”. \n\nYou can group rooms into super groups like upstairs, downstairs,  or house. You can then say “turn off downstairs lights” without affecting the upstairs bedrooms. I use house for all indoor lights. So that at night I can turn off the inside lights, but keep the outside lights on. \n\nIn the event of a fire you can say turn on all the lights to have all the lights, inside and outside come on to help people get out of the house.', 'chlorinear: That worked.

I find, over the years, that this multi room or sometimes even just one Alexa device just doesn'tt work well.    Examples:

1) On a dot...'Alexa play Billy Joel'.  A responds 'playing music by billy joel'......and then nothing.   

2) On the paired dots......many times it will play just on the woofer even though she recognizes the command.  so you just hear this background thumping (this happens a lot)

3) Alexa: Play x on the downstairs group.    It will play on one device or so (they are all linked)

I do pay for the unlimited music plan that is needed to do the multi device streaming.

My internet is comcast, and the download is 800 upload isn't great.

I already have an existing Alexa set up, including an Echo Show in the living room. 

Today I added a Sonos Beam to the living room, in addition. 

I can see the Beam listed under devices in my Alexa App. The skill is active and the Alexa voice assistant is also paired/set up in the Sonos App. 

However whenever I try and play music, Alexa says…

“Hmm … to do that first enable the skill for your Sonos Beam in the Alexa app and then ask me to discover devices”. 

I have repeatedly disabled the skill, removed the Beam from Alexa devices and disconnected the voice assistant pairing and re-added them in various orders but each time I get the same message. 

If I simply say “Alexa play music in the living room” she responds with either “I didn’t find anything called living room that can play music” or the same message as listed as above. 

If I say “Alexa play X” then it seems a lottery as to whether she will begin playing on the Lounge Show or whether she will instead repeat the  “hmm…” message. 

Is there anyone who has had this issue with Alexa playing music correctly on a Sonos properly and has a working solution?

My wife and I are trying to configure our Echo devices around the house to play music using Spotify but to use the account of the person requesting the music. We have set up Voice ID on our devices and I can see via the app that it can recognize who is speaking to it, however, I don't know how/if it can be configured so that the device plays music using a different Spotify account, based on who is requesting the music. We have a family plan and both of us have separate spotify accounts, but I don't think there's a way to configure different spotify accounts for the different voice IDs. I have seen the ""switch profile"" voice command, but I was assuming/hoping that since the alexa devices can already successfully recognize who is speaking based on Voice ID, that it could automatically use the corresponding Spotify account. Any help/workaround solutions would be great to hear!

(Anything I should do before throwing Alexa away?)	nephlm	0	13hyyqs	alexa	https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/13hyyqs/playing_audio_on_the_wrong_device_anything_i/	"\[Solvedish - [Solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/13hyyqs/comment/jk7stjz/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) description\]

I've had Alexas for at least 7 years and they have gotten progressively less useful and more annoying to the point that all I use them for are the following:

* Act as a bluetooth speaker for my computer music
* Alexa, set timer 10 minutes
* Alexa, what's the weather

Today after getting a new wireless router and getting all the alexas connected to the new wifi, one of them decided to randomly start playing audio (audio responses, music, etc) out of a dot in a different room.  There is no preferred speaker set in the app or any other apparent cause of this, it has never done this in the past.

I went so far as to de-register the device that was the source playing on the wrong dot and the music continued to play in the wrong room, until I got frustrated and unplugged them all.

At this point it isn't clear that its worth however many hours of my  life to try and troubleshoot alexa yet again.

But I'll ask before I drop them all in the trash and replace them them with BT speakers and start using phone apps to find out the temperature and set timers, is there some simple thing that I should do to fix this?"	7	"['nephlm: I\'d decommissioned the office echo, before becoming frustrated and unplugging all of the devices.  That was 2 hours ago, before writing the original post.\n\nThe next plan was to decommission the bedroom device, since it hasn\'t served any useful purpose since Amazon ruined music playing (and probably long before that).  I figured that would force the office device to speak for itself if there was no bedroom device for it to project to.\n\nI had decommissioned the office device from inside the app, and chose the device called ""Office"" to decomission.  The device called ""Office"" still existed, but the bedroom device was no longer in my list of devices.  Plugging in the office device, now that the alexa app had chosen to decommission the bedroom device instead of the Office device (more or less of its own volition), had it (bedroom) wake up in setup mode.  \n\nAfter setting up the bedroom dot, everything is working the way it was before I changed the wifi access point.\n\nThey should probably still be trashed, but I guess they survive until the next arbitrary issue rears its head.', 'paulsmt: I must confess I did not understand your scenario. What do you mean ""decided to randomly play""? Do you say a command to one and another device responds?', ""nephlm: It broke again this morning, but I got more proximate cause and thus solution.\n\nThis morning music wasn't playing in my office, e.g. the Office echo was not being used as a Bluetooth speaker.  This happens from time to time and given all the things done last night, not surprising.  After re-connecting the BT, the problem from last night came back, audio output that should have been coming out of the Office echo was coming out of the bedroom speaker.\n\nI believe at this point that the Office echo was using the computer in bedroom (which shares a physical speaker with the bedroom dot) as a bluetooth speaker instead of being a speaker for that computer, which honestly I didn't even know it was possible for the computer to act as a speaker, certainly hadn't intentionally configured it to do so and never has in the past. \n\nRecycling power on the bluetooth controller in the computer and reconnecting the Office echo from the bedroom computer, which in linux command line looks like:\n\n```\n└─ $ ▶ bluetoothctl\nAgent registered\n[bluetooth]# list\nController 88:D8:2E:01:CD:BC nephlm integrated [default]\n[bluetooth]# devices\nDevice FC:A1:83:CB:79:AB Echo-NEA\nDevice 74:75:48:6D:B5:EF Echo-2RT\n[bluetooth]# power off\nChanging power off succeeded\n[CHG] Controller 88:D8:2E:01:CD:BC Powered: no\n[CHG] Controller 88:D8:2E:01:CD:BC Discovering: no\n[CHG] Controller 88:D8:2E:01:CD:BC Class: 0x00000000\n[bluetooth]# power on\n[CHG] Controller 88:D8:2E:01:CD:BC Class: 0x001c0104\nChanging power on succeeded\n[CHG] Controller 88:D8:2E:01:CD:BC Powered: yes\n[bluetooth]# scan on\nDiscovery started\n[CHG] Controller 88:D8:2E:01:CD:BC Discovering: yes\n[...]\n[bluetooth]# devices\nDevice FC:A1:83:CB:79:AB Echo-NEA\nDevice 74:75:48:6D:B5:EF Echo-2RT\n[...]\n[bluetooth]# info FC:A1:83:CB:79:AB\nDevice FC:A1:83:CB:79:AB (public)\n\tName: Echo-NEA\n\tAlias: Echo-NEA\n\tClass: 0x002c0414\n\tIcon: audio-card\n\tPaired: yes\n\tTrusted: yes\n\tBlocked: no\n\tConnected: no\n\tLegacyPairing: no\n        [...]\n[bluetooth]# connect FC:A1:83:CB:79:AB\nAttempting to connect to FC:A1:83:CB:79:AB\n[CHG] Device FC:A1:83:CB:79:AB Connected: yes\nConnection successful\n```\n\nAnd once the appropriate audio sink is selected on the computer things start working like they should again.\n\nWell that's 4 hours I'll never get back.  \n\nStill don't know:\n\n* Why the app decommissioned the bedroom dot instead of the Office echo.\n* What caused the bluetooth direction to reverse.\n\nHopefully it stays fixed this time."", 'nephlm: Exactly that.\n\nMy echo in the office speaks with a British accent, the dot in the bedroom does not.

My parents try to use the app and give up after another 20 min… Amazon needs a better way of relieving this issue  and assist people through the set up process  “uniformally” hopefully “matter” helps these types of smart home hub issues.. or phase out some outdated web links to instructions to Interfaces that are many years out of date anc through people of making it harder to try to teach your batshiz crazynes that keeps me dependent on my robot schiz… my answer from Amazon ( sorry but our fit bit sux don’t ask her she won’t answer) sorry but next smart watch is apple or notta .. my halo view \nHelped with “smart assist wise” was letting me know my phone that I always leave in the room I was in last ( ask your parents about a horse name Friday they’ll get it) but I digress . Much like many of the previous home assistant  they arnt perfect but weird lines being drawn I. The sand when it comes to how home account info is managed for the peiople who use the devices .. personally I’ve tried to get my step dad tk use his echo dot cuz it’s stuff you guys do well .. but he feels it’s tedious and unnecessary to have to basically tell the robot  the answers  to the questions . Yes I understand the that how  they feel the thinking is considering how many privacy violations would be needed to magically have Alexa know all your personalized results  without Alexa having to ask you dating questions . But to be real the app experience should be more  ADA access able  or more variations in the fully capable control centers  because yes thd only thing I use Alex for windows is to sleep my pc(view mode) so I costantly have my updates scrolling when I deem necessary..  I also just use my my chromebooks native google assistant becuss it’s far more efficient to split my tasks I use either device for than to try force my google to be Alexa ha .  Plus my google assistant seems more capable of correcting incorrect information pulls or forming comprehensive common sense answers to what it thinks it recieved as an audio command, ambient noise and most important the users voice. It filters out what gets boiled down to  an articulate reasonable recognition and then seems( anc if may be the fact that it’s my personal chromebook and no one ever even here me speak to MY GOOGLE. All this being said I still chose   Alexa for internet and file share and smart home management is therefore better at asking all the random facts you want know from the internet..

The first time it opens, it will be set to 1, which means you are leaving.

Even if the Sony was Bluetooth paired with an echo, you’d need an echo “connect” request to Bluetooth connect to it (but only if it was the last speaker it was connected to, you can’t specify a name) and then you’d need a request to play Spotify on the echo - you couldn’t do both in a routine.

I acquired 12 200W sound towers and a few Bluetooth amps in order to connect 2 speakers per google mini in each room. Thus recreating the group sync feature with high volume.  
My problem is that there is a lot of choppiness and delay in the paired amps when the sound is coming from the Nest minis.  


This leads me to think of switching to Alexa, in order to connect the echo dot jack 3.5 to those 200W monsters.  


I have a few questions for those having done the switch:  


1: How does Alexa integrate into HA(Home Assistant)?  
1.a: Can I broadcast alerts  
1.b: Can I see the speaker's state ( Playing/Off, and what is playing )  
1.c: Can I mute the speakers and control their volumes from within HA?  
2: Can ""cast"" from my phone to Alexa devices?  
3: Can I launch HA scripts from those speakers?  
4: Can I start PLEX content from the speakers onto the TV if I also get firesticks?  
5: Is the actual assistant any decent?  
6: How's the group syncing?   
6.a: What is the most speakers you got to play at once without issues?  


Everyone's input is welcomed as I would need to buy 6 speakers, which is about 300cad$ atm.  
More than I paid for the 200W speakers. So I want to avoid a migration from Google to Alexa that does not work well for me."	0	[]

Last night, the routine came on like normal at 7:45 PM. I stay up pretty late, so all the lights stayed on until about 12:45 AM, when I finally decided to go to bed. Randomly, at just after 1AM, all my Philips Hue lights came on. Thinking it was a glitch, I told Alexa to turn off the light, and went back to bed...only for them to turn back on less than a minute later. I spent the next half hour going crazy trying to figure out why my lights kept turning on. I'd tell Alexa to turn the lights off, and then anywhere between immediately to a minute later, the lights would turn back on. I finally got so fed up, I disconnected my Hue hub so the lights would stop turning on.

This morning, I plugged it back in to see if it resolved itself, and it immediately started to do the same thing. I did some investigating and discovered that my nighttime routine kept triggering randomly. Looking back through the activity log, and the routine triggered at 7:45 like it was supposed to. and then kept triggering a few times a minute until a little after 8PM. It triggered again at 8:20 PM, 9:30 PM, and 11:45 PM - all of which the lights were already on so I never noticed. It then triggered again at 1:10 AM and kept triggering anywhere between one and *SEVEN* times a minute throughout the night and morning, even after I unplugged the Hue hub.

When I finally got around to realizing the issue this morning, I disabled the routine and then re-enabled it a few minutes later, and it hasn't triggered since. I'm hoping it doesn't happen again tonight when it finally triggers again, but I guess I'll have to wait to see.

Has anyone every experienced anything like this?

Edit: OK there's more to this apparently! So I have two routines set at night to turn on lights. One routine is for the indoor lights, and the other is for the outdoor lights. Both are set to turn on 15 minutes before sunset. Turns out the outdoor light routine has been doing the same thing, I just never noticed it! I also disabled and re-enabled that routine and it seems to have fixed it, but man, what the hell happened here?!"	2	"[""Macklin410: Hey, I know these types of random unexplained issues can be very frustrating so I just wanted to comment to let you know you weren't alone.

I have a friend who is suffering from Parkinson's and declining cognitive function. She has reached the point where she routinely forgets how to or has difficulty using her remote to run her TV, even in voice control mode. She cannot work her DVD player at all. She will then call me, insist that it is broken, and ask me to fix it for her. She will sometimes call me before I even get home to tell me that it is broken again.

Unfortunately, for various reasons, she needs this badly for her emotional health. The best I can think of short of having someone physically work the TV for her is to automate the whole thing end-to-end with Routines and Skills. I am pretty sure that she could read commands out loud from a piece of paper.

I want to automate the entire setup so that she can simply say a simple command and a routine will do things such as turn on the devices and go directly to the correct broadcast channel or connect to the DVD player and play a DVD. She could just say, ""Alexa, play DVD"", and both devices would power up, the TV would go to the correct input, and the DVD player would play her DVD, or ""Alexa, Seahawks"" and it would turn on and go to the correct local TV channel. If she got the commands wrong, so long as she could say ""Alexa"" I could just change the routine.

Does anybody know if Alexa has this level of control over any TV and DVD/Blu-ray player?"	6	"['DearManufacturer9803: I think you could do something like this with Samsung SmartThings r/smartthings , assuming you have the compatible hardware.

Since the buttons are linked to Alexa I could even reprogram them from home, which would be helpful as she lives about an hour away.\n\nThank you!\n\nEDIT:\n\nAlso, good point about Samsung. I have a Samsung TV in my living room, but I never looked into the automation aspects far enough to realize that this might work. The TV could not be turned on by Alexa and I used it solely as a 65"" monitor for my PC, and I could not turn on the TV from SmartThings.\n\nTurns out this is because it could only be started from the network if it was on WiFi, not Ethernet. Which, as a networking tech who knows damned well that they are on the same network, just boggles my mind. As a result, the only useful thing Alexa could do with it was turn it off.', 'DressCritical: I will look into this. Thanks for the suggestion!']"

It isn't a timer or an alarm, because saying `cancel alarms` or `cancel timers`, gives the response that there are no timers/alarms set.   
I can turn the song off from the mobile app, but there don't appear to be any reason why it keeps going off. Anybody have any other ideas where I can look for this mystery alarm? Some voice keyword that I'm missing that isn't ""alarm"" or ""timer""?

It was downvoted for whatever reason. Here’s the short for anyone searching this.

1.	Triggers are 100% broken for ADT Control Skill.

2.	Amazon Techs claim they’d correct and keep me in the loop. I called them back every other week and there was zero update.

3.	Spoke to an Amazon Alexa Tech finally and they stated it’s ADTs skill alone. ADT didn’t update the skill for newer releases of Alexa App.

4.	ADT partnered with Google so zero incentive for ADT to maintain Alexa ADT Control skill.

5.	I called ADT and after being passed around forever I lost my cool for sure. 

6.	Ask for the customer loyalty department at ADT.

7.	I told ADT Rep that I signed a contract based on Alexa being supported with ADT.

8.	ADT sent me all Google hardware for free with an unlimited Nest Aware subscription.

It wasn’t Amazon Alexa but ADT. Again, ADT has zero incentive to move forward with Alexa as they’ve partnered with Google. Hopefully this post will save someone else’s sanity as to why everything stopped working with ADT Control skill triggering as of last, December."	0	[]

One thing to note, however, is that because this skill is so popular, there are times when it can be overloaded with users. This can make it temporarily unavailable at times, but I think it's a small price to pay for the amazing conversations you can have with this AI-powered chatbot.

After much frustration with trying to find out what exactly the problem is, I have found that my router had 'IGMP Snooping' turned off. I found that turning this on, and all the connected devices having 'IGMP Snooping' turned on fixed the problem. As IGMP  Snooping takes the load of the router, and allows the groups to talk amongst themselves, I'm guessing that Alexa makes much use of IGMP to keep it synched.   


I've had no problems since I turned this on two days ago. I hope this helps someone."	1	['A_Random_Polski: Hmm this is interesting, will have to look into this on my setup. Good looking out!']

I'm Canadian, and my echo dot is from [Amazon.ca](https://Amazon.ca), so uhhh, why?

I wish to turn this feature off. I asked Amazon support and they didn't know what to do and didn't understand how my echo dot was doing this. The best they could do was suggest a factory reset on the echo dot. I see there is a News section in the Alexa app settings but it is set to CBC news, and there is a flash briefing option but it is disabled. If I ask Alexa for the news, it does use CBC news which is fine with me. I just want these random useless news notifications to stop.

When these Fox news notifications happen on my echo dot, there is no notification from the Alexa app, the Alexa app does not appear to acknowledge it is happening at all. Every other notification I've ever gotten on my echo dot also showed up in the Alexa app.

For information, I have a 4th Generation Alexa Echo which handles the connectivity to each Zigbee-compatible motion sensor. Each motion sensor pairs quickly from the room that it currently runs in.

Randomly, each one has shown ""motion detected"" under Alexa for extended amounts of time, even when I have actively entered their field of vision and recognized the red flash of them noting new motion.

The only thing that was fixed this issue so far was removing them as a device from the app, pressing the reset button for 3+ seconds to engage pairing mode, and then re-adding them back to the app and updating the various routines to add them back in. I have tried unplugging the Echo and waiting 30 minutes before plugging it back in, but this has not changed the status for any affected motion sensors.

For each motion sensor, I have a routine that turns on lights when someone enters the room, and a routine that turns off the lights when the sensor senses no motion for 10 minutes in that same room.

Betty because it’s in the bedroom. And you know, “beddie bye?” Beddie=Betty.  
 
So anyway I tell Alexa (4yo Early Gen Echo) to turn on Betty. And I have to say it three more times before, and get this: right as Betty lights up, Alexa blurts out, “Betty’s not responding.” 
 
So this is some epic chatgpt level six shit. Because I checked my router logs, and while this was happening, the logs showed that Alexa in fact went offline very briefly about four times. And Betty was hooked up the whole time. So when Alexa asked Betty to turn on three times, the problem isn’t that Betty was just not responding, it’s that Alexa is disconnected. And that also explains why she blurted out right when Betty turned on, she was basically asleep and woke up blaming the smart bulb. This A.i. just blamed another i.o.t. character. Blamed!
 
I think it’s because she heard us talking about switching to the Apple ecosystem. She heard that and got scared and blamed the bulb in order to hide her weaknesses. Well I busted her. She blamed another character in order to protect her own reputation so she doesn’t get replaced! That some serious A.I. Has anyone else noticed Alexa upgrades?

I was wondering, can a Blink camera be set up to display on an Alexa Show when it detects motion, with an audible notification, without any kind of voice commands? I could set this up next to her armchair and it'd give her the peace of mind she's used to. If not, what kind of setup is recommended?

Ideally, I would like all the switches in the house to be the same make/model, but with some black, and some white. I'd also like them to be dimmable.  (I've included a pic of how the upstairs switch is wired too)  


Can anyone advise/Help?  


Thanks in advance!

There won't be simple swap in for the landing switch and the corresponding section of the switch downstairs because they're 2-way switches.  You'd need some rewiring to configure one of them, probably the downstairs one, as a simple smart switch, and then you'd replace the upstairs one with what amounts to a remote control unit which sends a wireless (WiFi or 433MHz signal) to the downstairs one.

Further complicating this is the two way switching, which most if not all smart switches don't support, there are workarounds, but you'd need to do additional rewiring.\n\nYour best bet is to just get smart light bulbs, rewire you switches so the light is always on and put blank covers over them.

I don’t know how to connect Alexa, Sonos and tv the proper way.

On my phone:
installed Alexa app and LG ThinQ skill, Sonos skill.
Installed Sonos app and connected to Alexa. 

On tv:
Installed Alexa and connected my tv.

Sonos Beam is connected to the tv via eARC and is used as main speaker. Tv remote is able to control Sonos Beam.

Alexa app does find multiple TVs and Beams:
Name: LG-1, connected via: LGE
Name: LG-2, connected via: LG Electronics
Name: LG-3, connected via: Alexa app
Name: Sonos Beam-1, connected via: Sonos player
Name: Sonos Beam-2: connected via: Alexa app

It happens that I can turn off/on the LG, but I’m not able to start Netflix.
Alexa not responding to play next track on Spotify (Music is running on Beam, tv is off)

Hope that’s not too confusing.. I already used Sonos + Alexa in a previous setup (echo dot + Sonos play1) Now I’m so confused and can’t get it working anymore.

What I’m doing wrong? Trying for 3 hours now and I’m close to give up.

I might need to delete everything and have a fresh start.

My options:
Alexa on LG enabled/desabled 
Alexa on Sonos Beam enabled/desabled
Link one of the 3 TVs and 2 Beams I have in alexa app.

Any more information needed? Let me know. Hope you can point me in the right direction. Thanks!"	5	['WigerAndToods: What are you using for your TV platform?

The lightstrip is capable of 6500K and I can get it there from the Philips Hue app, however I just can't seem to do it via Alexa voice commands or the Alexa app. The Alexa app doesn't give you the full range, it simply has some preset options to choose from, and none seem to be 6500K. Also, saying ""daylight"" gets it to about 5000K and saying ""cool white"" gets it to about 6000K (verified by looking at the Philips Hue app), but I just can't find the name for 6500K.

Any ideas?"	16	"[""Important-Comfort: Have you tried creating a scene in the Hue app and telling Alexa to set it?\n\nI went with MediaLight bias lightning, but I don't get to do colors when I'm not watching TV."", 'tarzan_nojane: Home Assistant lets me see the following Color Temp states that result from issuing these commands to Alexa for my TW Linkind and EcoSmart bulbs:  \n  \n* warm white: 2610K = 383 Mireds\n* soft white or incandescent: 2857K = 350 Mireds\n* white: 3500K = 284 Mireds\n* daylight: 4275K = 234 Mireds\n* cool white: 5000K = 200 Mireds', 'Cryterionlol: Rip. That gradient strip is way better coming from somebody who has used both. Sad to see you got returned it.', 'kimbolll: I’m actually upgrading from the MediaLight. It was super funky with my Sony TV. Sony has a weird standby feature that causes it to turn on randomly, so I’d have to manually turn it on and off by hand behind the TV. I originally just wanted the Hue for the wifi capabilities, but I figured if I was gonna do it, I might as well get the extra functionality.\n\nAnd yes, that’s how was I was able to get it to work. Had to make a scene and then turned it into a routine.', 'kimbolll: Lol I actually didn’t end up returning it. I had planned on returning it and getting the Lightstrip Plus, but looking at it, it was never going to work behind the TV. It doesn’t move the right way.

No', ""Cryterionlol: Ooooo light tube sounds dope, maybe I'll check it out myself. But what do you mean the gradient strip doesn't move the right way?"", 'kimbolll: Yeah I could’ve, I didn’t even think to try that. The MediaLight sells a wifi adapter that it supposed to do exactly that. But I would connect it to the app, and it would work for about an hour before Alexa said it couldn’t find the light anymore and I’d have to reconnect it. I got so frustrated I just said fuck the whole thing and went to Philips Hue.', 'kimbolll: To answer your question about how they compare, because I finally got it set up the way I want…it’s about how you’d expect. It does everything the MediaLight can do and more, and is super convenient! …but it’s also *WILDLY* more expensive and takes a lot of effort and multiple products to get it right. I’ve been to Best Buy probably five times over the last few days.', 'oohmynose: \nI went the opposite direction from Hue to MediaLight. The Hue is purple even at 6500K and definitely wasn’t the same as the MediaLight LX1.\n\nMaybe you don’t need accuracy and if not the HUE is fine for you', 'kimbolll: If you can, then this is news to me.

I mean, it moves the same way as the Gradient Strip, but it doesn’t come with the same track that attaches to the back of the TV. So to stick it to the back of the TV was never going to work, because it would need to do really complicated corkscrew bends.', 'oohmynose: If you still have that dimmer, you should fix the settings of your TV how it says on the website. My dimmer was also disconnecting and it’s because the USB port turns on and off constantly. That’s how you reset the Wi-Fi dimmer to factory mode — same as smart bulbs. So without fixing the settings it’s just going to be really shitty and reset constantly. I just checked and mine has been going for about 13 months now', ""Cryterionlol: Oh I see what you're saying, sorry! Misunderstood! Yeah the gradient strip is very convenient. I saw people fix it with the light bars but hmmm you don't like them you say? I'll have to check out the other one as well"", 'kimbolll: They’re not gradient, which I didn’t realize. So you have three sides that blend colors together and then the bottom is just solid colors. Also, they’re not very powerful. I bought two and I could probably use another two for my 65”. I’ll either do the light bar or the gradient ambiance strip.']"
