Today, I run the vacuum while I was out of the house and I found a purple stain on a carpet when I came back. I am also attaching a photo of what I found in the vacuum. 
I have no idea what this is and how to clean this stain. I looked around my apartment and I couldn’t find anything resembling this, so I’m not sure where these pieces came from. 
Just wanted to check if anyone has experienced something similar to this?"	2	"['DigitalDude_42: RIP Gumby.', ""CheesyCrackerMan: I don't think that's a shark issue, more something on the floor in your home dropped by someone recently or picked up from under something by the Shark.

I'm a student so my budget is tight so I need to buy second hand

I can't find the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra (so I gave up on this model) that I initially wanted to buy, but I found the Ecovacs X1 Omni for 900€.


A brand new Roborock s7 Pro Ultra is available at 850€.

What is the best choice a second hand's Ecovacs X1 Omni at 900€ or a brand new Roborock S7 pro Ultra at 850€ ? Or should i really keep waiting for a second hand max v  ultra to drop (I've been waiting for one to drop for weeks already and it pretty much seems hopeless)

I live in a flat with my girlfriend and a small dog. We have tiles everywhere that are an off white color and that need cleaning quite often during the day as they get dirty really fast.

A new Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra is out of my budget (1300 euros currently)

Home is single story, 1500 square feet. One pet that sheds a lot. Laminate throughout, with a couple rug runners. The laminate has been discontinued, so we live in fear of water penetrating it, it then bubbling, and having to replace the entire flooring in the home. Hence, I don’t think we really want a robot with a mopping feature; sounds like too much risk for water penetration. 

We currently have a Roomba 860 and don’t love it.  It’s dumb, scuffs the baseboards, gets stuck, needs constant emptying, doesn’t return to the dock, and is pretty underwhelming power wise.

I've researched more than I'd like to admit and still confused on what to get. My house is 60% hard floor, 40% carpet. Own 1 small dog. (never poops/pees in house. Just sheds a little)

Features I'd like to have:

1. Be able to spot clean a section of the house from the app. For example, if kitchen bar needs clean, I can spot clean a specific part of the map from the app.
2. robot avoid objects in floor. IE underwear/clothes, shoes, etc. Also want to identify on the map areas that robot can't go/bump into.
3. auto dispose bin would be great but not absolutely essential.
4. built to last. They are expensive and I expect it to last 10 years+. Only plan to buy extra brushes and battery replacement etc. down the line.

Roomba J7 pros:

1. better carpet cleaning, object detection for small objects like cords. Apparently roborock isn't as good as J7 bc it doesn't have camera. Easier to get replacement parts?

Roomba cons:

1. for price of q5+, doesn't have feature #3. Supposedly still has horrible mapping (bumps into objects all the time like the old school roomba did/do?). Doesn't use lidar.

Roborock Q5+ pros:

1. better mapping, more features. value for price (feature #3)

Robo cons:

1. doesn't clean carpet as good due to dual brush.

&#x200B;

I'm leaning towards the roborock. Seems like most people agree it's significantly better overall. I think the only reason I'd go roomba is for better carpet clean and maybe easier to get parts down the road. I'm torn and would love some help.

I've also looked at  Dreametech D10 Plus,  Shark - AI,  ECOVACS Robotics - DEEBOT T10+. None of them seem to be as good as name brand roomba or roborock. I'm open to any and all suggestions.

I’ve documented my observations that eventually led to a successful connection to hopefully help someone else out there. These instructions are specifically for a mesh WiFi system.

The systems:
Shark AI ultra with self empty base (from Costco, Model UR2000SR)
Internet: Starlink router with Deco 6E Mesh system (set at 2.4 GHz band, not auto). Starlink has its own network, while the mesh system has a different network name.

Initial observations: Shark vacuum was connected for a few months but then stopped doing its daily clean and clean logging, probably due to getting something stuck underneath and I didn’t save it in time and it ran out of batteries.

**Note do not skip any steps. Skipping any step will result in failure to connect and must redo entire process**

1. Delete bot on app (on iPad not iPhone)
2. Sign out of app then sign back in
3. Put bot belly up and hold the clean button to reset. Weird beeping noise, keep belly up/upside down
4. Unplug Starlink router AND wifi mesh system
5. Turn off iPad
6. Plug in Starlink and wifi mesh until internet is back and running
7. Turn on iPad and ensure internet is working/connected on mesh system. Ensure auto connect is on mesh system not Starlink network.
8. Roll bot back on to base and wait for happy bot noises, bot emptying and “Ready to clean” greeting. WiFi light should NOT be on at this point. If it is try resetting bot again.
9. Hold “dock and clean” buttons until “Ready to connect to WiFi” greeting
10. Check that Shark WiFi network pops up in settings but don’t connect to it. Stay on mesh system
11. Connect the new bot. The “bear with me” initial WiFi connection screen should only stay up for a few seconds before moving on to the next step. If it takes more than 30 sec connection probably failed.
12. Select the WiFi mesh system network and insert password and connect. Again, should only take 10 seconds to successfully connect. This step failed and received and “unable to connect to WiFi when I did not reset the iPad.

Map and schedule should be there already

I never got the bot to successfully connect when using my iPhone… so in summary, in order to successfully reconnect to WiFi from scratch you need to reset EVERYTHING, wifi, device and bot.

Hope this helps someone else. I really love this robot vacuum but not the WiFi stuff. I want to get another for my upstairs but the WiFi issues are stopping me. Let’s so how long I have to go before doing a full WiFi reset again. I have these exact instructions on a post it note on my base."	1	['rotarypower101: Thanks\n\nSaving for future reference.\n\nJust added another bot, and this time it was REALLY struggling to connect and set up!\n\nWould have likes to have seen this then!\n\nJust kept trying and eventually it went through with what felt like no change from my side...']

I have done some testing on this and want this info out there for anyone that it can possibly help.


Eufy 35C - this was my first robot vacuum. It has no mapping and just randomly bounces off walls but it didn't have any problem with the shag carpet. Additionally since it was under 3 inches in height, it was able to get under my couch


360 robot S5 - this thing is a beast. It's lasted me several years now with no issues. The mapping, suction, and reliability is great. It also handles the shag carpet with no problem.

Deebot n8+ - this thing sucks, and not In a good way. Has trouble getting to its base. Decent suction. The mopping function is useless. It can't get onto the shag by itself. It's pattern of cleaning seems insane. Not efficient.


Roborock q5 - good mapping and pattern of cleaning. Suction wasn't great. Can't get onto shag.

Shark vacuums only pair with 2.4 GHz, and Google Fiber will not allow you to split the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. Here is how I finally got my vacuum connected to my Wi-Fi and paired to my account:

The first step is to get the SharkClean app and add a device. Once in the app, it will tell you to hold down the dock and clean button simultaneously to put the vacuum in pairing mode. This is already incorrect, since the Shark ION robot has three buttons and the dock/clean combination does not put it into pairing mode. I can't quite remember which two need to be pressed, but it is some combination other than what is stated in the app. 

Once the vacuum is in pairing mode, I was able to connect to it, find my internet, enter the password, and then was stuck waiting for a couple of minutes before the app states that it was unable to connect to my home internet. I spoke with a Shark representative who took a random guess and said that I needed to purchase a $40 part to fix it. I ignored this and pushed the problem off for another couple of months.

I recently attempted to connect this vacuum once again and decided to give the Shark customer service another call. This time, the shark representative was able to understand what I meant when I said I had one network name broadcasting two separate frequencies. Rather than going through the app's provisioning page, she had me **connect to the vacuum's network and navigate to** [**10.221.203.1**](https://10.221.203.1) **on my phone**. Here, I again typed in my network name and password and the vacuum was able to connect (which was apparent from the Wi-Fi LED on the vacuum transitioning from blinking to solid). However, the vacuum was still not associated with my account or app. She took down my email address that was associated with my SharkClean account and created a ticket for Shark to add the now-connected vacuum to my account. I could see it on my SharkClean app about 12 hours later.

For those experiencing this problem, I would try and connect to your Google Fiber network by connecting to your vacuum's network and navigating to the IP address above. You'll likely still need to call Shark's customer care to associate your vacuum with your app, but already having your vacuum on the network will save you some time."	0	[]

Both wheels need the weight of the robot pressing them into the carpet or the robot thinks that it\'s ""falling"" or ""near an edge"". The problem I\'ve had on some rare occasions is the robot will come at a threshold like that at a 45 degree angle, get one wheel over the edge so that it pops out, read that as an edge and fully halt.\n\nIf you position your charging station correctly I think you can insure that the robot will never go over the threshold incorrectly but I can\'t be sure.', 'Itchy-Ad1005: Is that threshold flat like one leg of a triangle or curved?

We are making a new type of robot cleaner that can climb and clean stairs, aka, a single robot cleaner cleans the whole house and the stairs. And we also add a few other features, like the integration of ChatGPT(a note: the GPT thing is mainly for VCs since they are asking. AGI is still too early to be used on a robot cleaner for sure). MSRP is not finalized yet, very likely it would be $999, same with the flagship model from iRobot.

We would appreciate your feedback before we release our product to the market. If you find the idea of a stair-climbing robot cleaner appealing, please leave an upvote and share your thoughts in the comments section. If not, please downvote it, and if possible, also leave comments so that we can continue to improve our product.

When I try to make a map of turtlebot's world by useing gmapping, it is ok. So I think gmapping is ok. When I try to see point cloud of the lidar, I can see. So I think Lidar SDK and ros driver are ok. But When I try to make a map of a room by using data of the lidar, the lidar works, I can see point cloud but I can not observe a map. Two problems seems in the panel at the left side of rviz.1 - No transform from \[map\] to frame \[laser\_frame\]2 - No transfrom from \[odom\] to frame \[laser\_frame\]

Can you understand what the problem is?

How can I fix it?

I feel bad for the poor thing, and I wanna let it retire in peace, so I'm looking for a replacement:

\- I want to be able to perform maintenance by hand. Sliding hair off axles, for example. I don't want to keep pulling out scissors or a knife. I currently need to cut hair off both the brush and plastic rollers, side spinny brush, and all three wheels.

\- I only have hardwood -- no carpet.

\- I don't mind if I have to manually sweep up certain kinds of debris, as long as it can handle like, 80% of the dust bunnies and doesn't die doing so.

Based on what I've read here so far, it seems like I'm looking for something without roller brushes, but that they're harder to find lately? Anyone know some good places to start looking, or alternative solutions? Or do I just have tragically miscalibrated and unrealistic expectations?

I know no one specifically asked, but for the sake of those who, like myself, do their research by searching on Reddit, I decided to throw my expertise in the ring. 

I worked there as tech support for about 4 years, and in my time there, their models got progressively worse. Instead of working out the bugs of their previous models, they would just keep releasing new, half-assed models that customers would immediately call in about as soon as those models were released. 

That being said, some units worked great, and for those customers, their experience has been wonderful, and I’m really happy that everything worked out for them! But it was like a 50/50 chance with every unit purchased that a customer was going to run into a major issue with it. 

Their customer service carries the entire company on their backs, which is the only reason you might see good ratings for them anywhere. Their customer service is pressured to ask customers to leave positive reviews on various websites with the vague promise of perhaps one day product-testing/receiving a new model.

If you're only here for the solution: I used cassette player rubber square belts, got from Amazon.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So I got this little guy really cheap because it was broken. It would turn on, turn the vacuum on, roll around for a bit, and then stop with flashing lights and the red light (error) turned on. I would put it on the charging base (self-empty) and it would empty and go back to ""normal"" i.e. if I went into the app and told it to clean, it would leave the base, try to clean, and the same thing would happen.

If this sounds similar to problems you might be having with your Lidar robot, here's the trick: turn it on, press the clean button, and check if the Lidar starts spinning. If it ain't spinnin', it ain't workin'.

&#x200B;

[See the Lidar inside its enclosure? See how it's not spinning?](https://reddit.com/link/12j3uy4/video/6f3h0hztdcta1/player)

So, with that in mind, I set our to find out what went wrong, and to find an affordable fix for it. Got it really cheap, there's no point in spending loads of money on fixing it.

So, let the disassembling begin!

1 - We will remove all peripherals on the underside of the robot.

Start by flipping it upside down, take the dustbin off (self-explanatory), remove the cap for the battery and the battery, and the main brush.

&#x200B;

[And so, the journey begins.](https://preview.redd.it/59ouz6dgecta1.jpg?width=2249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c7ba76d22465b1ad7c5a4b5b68ea34d6367a9dc5)

Now, the wheels are coming off. You'll find 6 hex screws (the ones with a little dot in the middle, but you'll need specialized hex for that), get those out, but don't pull the wheel all the way out, there's a harness in there. When you're pulling the wheel out, roll it over towards the inside of the robot and using a thin flathead, press the safety clip on the harness to remove it.

 

[One wheel out. Careful with the harness when removing them.](https://preview.redd.it/1picefg0fcta1.jpg?width=2244&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6a3c1372f52108deab3fb6925e87502501c3df7d)

Now we'll remove the front ""bumper"". I don't know what it is actually called, but we'll call it a bumper. There are 6 hex screws (these are smaller than the previous ones, so you'll need a hex bit set). Remove the screws completely, and pull the tab the screws were attached to. It is held on with clips to the actual bumper, just pull it down. The bumper will come loose at this point. No harness here.

Also highlighted in red in the picture below are the final hex screws (bigsy ones) you'll need to remove on the underside of our little Wall-e. These are deep inside the body (no pun intended) and you'll need an extension.

[There might be more screws, these are the ones I could remember!](https://preview.redd.it/784c9be3gcta1.jpg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=51838a4d095663c2a76db11345905920c1fdd44d)

All right! Now, flip the little guy over to its natural resting position, and let's continue our surgery!

You see that ""Shark"" logo right there? Can you believe that is actually a cover? Yep. There are screws underneath it. Yeah, took me a f$%#$% long time to figure that out. And the glue is pretty good.

So get yourself a nice, thin flathead screwdriver and start prying it out. It'll come off....eventually.

&#x200B;

[Poor guy, looking skinnier by the minute.](https://preview.redd.it/engzij2sgcta1.jpg?width=2095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1db3376f144b45f77d55ee0b0ad9c09151c589ad)

Well, once you get that thing out, it will look like this:

&#x200B;

[Ok, the worst is over, now... or is it?](https://preview.redd.it/k26308p0hcta1.jpg?width=2224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c636d41e3f3b526bbbd2dab409a0a184ecade0d8)

Also highlighted in the picture are 3 hex screws (at this point, I'm not even sure if they are actually hex. I just call them hex. Correct me if I'm wrong, please), and you might need to ""fish"" them out of the adhesive.

OK, good job so far! Now it's time for perhaps the most sensitive part of the job. We'll separate the lower body from the upper body.

You've already removed all screws from underneath, so now it would just be a matter of carefully prying out the upper body from the lower body. There is a series of clips holding them together, but do not go crazy here, since there are harnesses still connecting the two:

&#x200B;

[Don't pull them apart all the way. There is a single harness still connecting them.](https://preview.redd.it/77a3q11whcta1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e3cd8a4dc143f512a236a8c027dcb58335b01f5)

Alright, disconnect them and set the main body aside, we're done with it for now.

You'll now remove 7 philips-head screws (yep, not hex this time) that are holding the silver piece that sits up top.

&#x200B;

[Philips-head screws this time. Go figure.](https://preview.redd.it/9gytidueicta1.jpg?width=2221&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c157d67db0b50946c50bba988f1845c0608a63a4)

The next step will be to flip the robot over, but be careful. The top 5 screws we've just removed are holding the button panel and warning lights of the robot. There are small plastic piece that will fall when we turn it over, so you might as well get them all out now, and set them aside (no pic for these ones, sorry).

Remember those 3 little gluey screws we removed earlier? They were holding a plastic ring - the one that the ""Shark"" logo sits on top of. Go ahead and pull it out. Glue will make it a little miserable, though. 

&#x200B;

[I bet you're rethinking why you started this mess at this point, right? I know I was.](https://preview.redd.it/vvgwsnnyicta1.jpg?width=2245&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=121f5d54e015fe430620dc25b2c13211b3c050e3)

Now you can pry the silver part out from the front - where the screws were - because the rear is held on by little clips.

Also highlighted in the picture are the next 3 screws you should remove. They hold the lidar cover, so anything we do from now on will be directly over the most expensive sensor on this entire thing. Be careful, shall we? 

&#x200B;

[\<insert a clever caption here\>](https://preview.redd.it/3tbjta9djcta1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1c13a12a72a1c8e580d051b9318a3aeed318651)

Awesome! We are almost there. 

&#x200B;

[Pay attention to that white plastic clip right above the sensor in the picture. It is a tiny plastic spring, and it will fly out on you.](https://preview.redd.it/h9sj5peujcta1.jpg?width=1785&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0c7eeae103003401e7ed7aa6328b03aeb99cfaa5)

OK, final screws! These hold the covers for the motor and the sensor itself. Remove the screws and take the sensor cover out first, then the motor cover.

&#x200B;

[Remove all 4 screws, but only remove the big, circular cover for now.](https://preview.redd.it/osmuk6kakcta1.jpg?width=2260&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e186629230fb8c372cc3b13f5dfed2b1d9a32e5a)

It should look something like this:

And you can actually see what failed: there's a little rubber band that spins the sensor, and it ruptured. It sitting just to the right of the sensor in this picture.

[Lidar sensor cap off, and rubber band overstretched to the side.](https://preview.redd.it/zc9n0amekcta1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fec49a7d86f8ec860c88ddb2e2d0f8cbc9e818a3)

Now you can carefully remove the motor cover. It will be very tricky. You'll only have a millimetre or so to wiggle it outta there, and the Lidar board is right next to it. Use a plastic pry tool.

This will be the final result. Can you se the rubber band snapped off?

[A tiny electric motor spins a tiny rubber belt, that spins a tiny lidar sensor. Pretty neat.](https://preview.redd.it/pvmv1c2vkcta1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b25ddbe2089bfce771d13f3705c1e95e385bf5e1)

Fun fact: the Lidar spins infinitely on a bearing. How would you connect wires to something constantly spinning? You don't. The sensor has a wireless system to transmit the distance data to the motherboard. Very cool stuff.

Now, onto spare parts.

I won't bore you with how far in the depths of the internet I had to go to find this kind of information. But what you'll want to buy from Amazon are cassette player recorder rubber belts. These tiny rubber-band-looking fellas are actually drive belts. I could find these pretty easily (and cheap!) here in Canada, so they should be available overseas and in the US as well.

&#x200B;

[Snapped OEM rubber belt to the right. Shark logo cap for reference.](https://preview.redd.it/ktcm0nvslcta1.jpg?width=2256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=460d3454d8f024dea71c585c3ac087a335887099)

These rubber belt kits come with what it seems like a million of these, and a couple in there will be the exact fit for our hard-working dust-sucking robot.

&#x200B;

[Old drive belt on top of a new, cassette-player drive belt.](https://preview.redd.it/xch6zl83mcta1.jpg?width=2253&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c4f17b886b7a425dd53bce4233b0327fdb2b34f6)

Now it's just a matter of replacing the new belt, and closing everything up in reverse.

Sorry, I won't give you a tutorial on how to put it together. If you got this far, I'm 100% confident you can put it back together.

&#x200B;

[Drive belt around \\""tiny motor\\"" and Lidar assembly.](https://preview.redd.it/b4tac4ufmcta1.jpg?width=2212&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4a314934cd8d13282b283c79dc2b547c8dcf81ae)

We live in an apartment, and the flooring consists of tile, low-pile carpet/rugs, and ugly laminate fake wood.

My husband works from home, and we’d like something that we can run once a day while he’s working. If he closes the door to his office, he can still hear our robot vacuum on the other end of the apartment. The vacuum will also repeatedly headbutt the office door for 10-15 minutes because we can’t tell it to avoid certain rooms.

I don’t mind using a full-sized vacuum and carpet cleaner on weekends for deeper cleaning. A self-emptying vacuum would be ideal, as well as enough intelligence/self-awareness to not eat socks/cables. Cost isn’t a huge issue…if it’s a reliable product that meets our needs, I don’t mind paying more.

Also, please add recommendations for cleaning schedule.	cle1etecl	1	12gpgv8	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/12gpgv8/roborock_s7_maxv_plus_or_ultra_station_or/	"*Previous post deleted because I forgot to make it a poll.*

I’m  looking for a bot that can also mop and I think I have narrowed  it down  to the Roborock S7 MaxV. I had briefly considered the Ecovacs Deebot X1 Omni and the Dreame L10S Ultra, but what makes me gravitate to  the S7 are its  ability to lift its mop (which the Deebot hasn’t - and  that’s already a  k.o. criterion for me; I have stopped my research on  the Deebot after I  found out about that) and its night light (which the  Dreame hasn’t -  though, how much of a difference does that make?) and  removable water tank. Plus, based on reviews I’ve seen, it can also supposedly mop  more closely to  walls than the Dreame.

But if it ends up being the Roborock, I still need to decide between   the Plus station and the Ultra station. I definitely want the dust bin   emptying. But while the possibility of having the mop automatically   cleaned mid-run and not having to deal with a rank mop at the end is   sweet, the idea of keeping the Ultra station maintained holds me back   from it. So I’m wondering which option is less messy and more hands-off for my situation.

I live alone without any pets and I don’t go out a lot, so not a lot   of dirt being dragged in by me. My apartment has about 80 sqm / 860   sqft. My bathroom has tiles, my kitchen has linoleum, the rest has   laminate. I was thinking of having the bot vacuum the whole apartment   every other day, having it mop the bathroom and kitchen once a week, and   having it mop the rooms with laminate maybe once per month or so, as I   assume the wood shouldn't get wet often. I think? I’m not even sure  what  a good schedule would be tbh, so any recommendations are  appreciated.  The plan above is already more than I’m currently doing.

If I get the Plus station, I wouldn’t mind washing the mop at the end   of the run, but I would hate it if the mop needs to be washed mid-run,   or if I had to do it significantly more often than once per week. Do  you  think that with the plan above, using the same mop for bathroom and   kitchen (altogether about 6 sqm / 65 sqft of moppable area) without   cleaning it in between would work (I’m aware that it probably won’t work   for the whole apartment)?

If I get the Ultra station, I'm not sure if maintaining the station   with my schedule isn't even more work than maintaining the bot with the   Plus station. I wouldn’t mind maintaining the bins, but I worry about   the risk of muck/mold/bacteria buildup (and the bot ending up dragging   that through the apartment), especially in places that are hard or   impossible to reach. Does the Ultra station have any hard-to-reach nooks   that need cleaning, or does cleaning it require significant   disassembly? What about the internal tubing or whatever it is that the   water flows through between bot and bins? I imagine that at least   anything that the dirt water passes would become incredibly nasty over   time. Also, have there been any occurrences of the station leaking? The   station has to be in one of the areas with laminate, so a leak would be   horrendous.

How do the stations of the Deebot and Dreame compare to the Ultra station when it comes to the ease of maintenance?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/12gpgv8)"	3	"[""cle1etecl: Adding some more questions: If I get the Plus station, can I set the app up so that the bot warns me when it is supposed to do a mopping run but doesn't have a mop or water in the tank?

BIG score) and an quite happy with it at that price. I loathe manual vacuuming, but am quite happy to clean the robot once it's done.  The big part of that is cleaning the roller brush; I use the Eufy tool to cut the hairs and comb out the dust/fuzz/etc. from the brushes.  For that second part I find myself using an Ace hair comb, but the teeth break out.  

# Does anyone have suggestions for a good metal comb, say from Amazon, or a better roller brush cleaning technique?

I do the cleaning out on the deck.  The filter I rap on the porch railing.  When I've done both the roller brush and the filter, I put them in the dishwasher which works just fine.

I bought [replacement spinner brushes, roller brushes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089N6SKHL) and [washable filters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BLGHDZ5) from Amazon; they've been good except that the filter snap-in hook is ever so slightly misplaced: the filters must be very carefully popped in so as not to break the hook tab, see pix."	1	['FakespotAnalysisBot: This is a Fakespot Reviews Analysis bot.

is available in the UK 
- Will manage a 2 bedroom flat
- Has good obstruction detection
- Will handle pet hair
- Can easily switch between carpets, rugs and hard floor & between mopping and vacuuming modes 
- Ideally has some form of self emptying function (at least for vaccum, if not mop as well)


Looking at getting my first robovac & want to make the right choice as this is an expensive buy.

I live in a 2 bed flat. mix of hard floor/vinyl, rugs & the 2 bedrooms are carpeted. 

I'm looking for something that will mop +vacuum, ideally one that can switch easily between modes, as the main rooms that require mopping are seperated by a room with rugs that extend almost to the edges of the room.
(was looking at the ecovacs deebot x1 e Omni which looked perfect but apparently will not cross carpet with mop attached, so I imagine it would not be able to access the kitchen if it was the other side of the room with rugs? Any advice on this would be appreciated!)

There's often a fair few things left on the floor so obstruction detection is something I'd require.

I also have a cat who leaves a decent amount of hair in the carpet so it'd need to have enough suction/good enough brush to handle it. I have long hair which seems to eternally end up on the carpet too, which could be a factor in deciding a robot.

Ive been looking at the-
- deebot x1 e Omni (potential issue with the mop as stated before)
- the dreame l10s ultra
- the roborock s7 pro ultra
- the roomba i7

finding it hard to distinguish which would be best, as so many video reviews have conflicting results when comparing them. 

Happy to receive any suggestions for robots other than these ones too. I'm a bit worried that while these seem to be the most well reviewed ones, they may be overkill for my needs (eg the auto cleaning of mop pads is something id love but likely I could do without it, if there was an equally performing, lower priced machine)"	3	"[""HeckinMew: I went with the roborock s7 MaxV Plus (not the one that washes the mop pad) I got it on ebay refurb.

2. I'm not opposed to dust self cleaning though. It's not a deal breaker and I can do it myself as well.

4. It consists of hardwood and low pile carpet. I am looking for anything that would make a smooth transition between 2 different flooring. My old lady Roborock is so LOUD when she drop her body from carpet to hardwood and she bulldozer forward without a blink!

I've been trying to decide where I might place the power docking station, since our house is pretty small, and there isn't any large area wide-open like the manual wants.  (40"" to each side?!)

So I've been wondering, in the corner of one room is a furniture cabinet, on legs, and the robot makes its way under there to sweep with good clearance.    Would it work if I put the power station back in that corner, which would be mostly hidden from view under/behind the cabinet.   Yet the robot ought to be able to get in there to dock & charge?   

Would that work?    Or does it really need wide open space around the dock?

Thanks so much!

It then moves straight away from the base station and sometimes makes minor adjustments before it heads to the base station.\n\nCan the base be behind a table.  Probably but it has to 1. have adequate height for bot.  2  It cannot obstruct the the homing beam.  The legs can't block the homing process and 3.

The little dust bin component that can be removed from the unit seems to quickly accumulate a lot of dust & debris on one side of the filter.    I thought all the dirt would be sucked out into the dock base, but a surprising amount builds up in the dust bin.  It looks almost like the lint trap in a clothes dryer.

When cleaning for \~60+ minutes vacuum mop starts saying that it's offline in the app and there's no way to reconnect to it remotely ( especially sucks when I'm not home ).   


In possible solutions it says to shut down and power back on the vacuum which always solves the issue but also always resets the cleaning progress which super sucks.  


One odd thing I noticed is that there appears to be a pattern ( not 100% ) of where the mop goes offline and it's the farthest part of the apartment which kinda points me to believe it may be losing the Wi-Fi signal at some point and doesn't reconnect ( router is also Xiaomi 1 Gbit version ).  
It only happened twice in a row now but never happened before ( I have this robot vacuum for 3 weeks now ).  


My question is, if it's Wi-Fi coverage, is there any way to reconnect the mop without restarting it to keep the cleaning progress?  


If not, has anybody faced this issue? What could be another possible solution?

Please note that I would  like to avoid disassembling it as much as I could."	2	"[""hi_from_brian: It could be a WiFi distance issue, which I would solve with an aftermarket WAP router with better antennas.\n\nAnother possibility, though, is that you have too many devices connected to the WiFi already.

When the ISP's router would reach a dozen devices it would start kicking off the weakest and oldest connections.

I really like it so far, app is super intuitive and the navigation seems flawless. HOWEVER, I have two Ragdoll (long-haired) cats, and I have had to clean the fur that accumulates/tangles on the brush roll basically after every single run/every other run.

Given that cat hair is the reason I got the robot vacuum in the first place, I'm tempted by the idea of getting a Roomba J8 instead. According to the Roomba subreddit certain Costcos have it on sale right now for $550 (when I looked previously, it was $700 which is out of my budget). The dual brush roll system is supposed to be better at avoiding tangled pet hair. HOWEVER, I know I'd be giving up the LIDAR navigation, and I feel like I'd be bummed to lose that. Plus, I see mixed reviews on how well the j7/j8 can ACTUALLY prevent cat hair from building up on the brush rolls, and if I sacrificed navigation and ease of use, only to discover the j8 still involved having to clean the brush roll fairly often, I'd regret it.

Currently, I have the old very first Xiaomi vacuum robot and think it is time to upgrade.

I want to buy one on Amazon Germany as I have gift card for it and the overall budget (including gift card) is ca. 400€. Advanced mopping is nice to have, obstacle recognition depends. I usually put everything away to get as much area as possible cleaned anyway. Auto empty dock not needed.

Initially, I thought about waiting for Roborock S8 release as the prices for S7 might drop. Instead, the S7 isn't available on Amazon anymore (at least in Germany). 😒

The second thought was Dreame L10s, currently available for 429€. But I saw some negative reviews and the fact that it leaves relatively big unmopped borders, is a no-go for me.

So right now, my list contains Ecovas T9/T9 AIVI (seems to offer most advanced features but Ecovacs devices are often reported to have issues with maps and getting randomly stuck), Ecovacs N8 Pro, Roborock Q7 Max (non+, available for 359-399€ right now), 360 S10, Dreame L10 Pro, Dreame D10S.

Does someone have experience with some of these? Which one would you pick?

Many thanks! 😁"	3	"[""Xeon2k8: I have the Q7 max plus, it's quite good overall, quieter than my S7, and better suction power on carpet. Though the mopping is not advanced at all so if you disqualified the L10s prob you wont want to have this one either.

As the title says, no carpets and mainly hair/dust on hard floors. While open area there is plenty of furniture and obstacles and as such I'd prefer a good navigation system. If truly capable of doing its thing unattended, a self cleaning/emptying station would be a nice feature.

Mopping wise, again, if it's not just a gimmick but a functional feature, that would be appreciated.

No need for world breaking suction or best battery life due to limited space and floor type. A brush system that wouldn't get caught in cat hair would be a major plus (seems like the cheaper low end do this better!).

However, where I live, it currently seems to be almost exclusively available in white which has made me second-guess because I'm worried that with such a light color, it will end up constantly looking dirty. Otoh, I've seen a video in which a black S7 had a lot of what appeared to be scratches or smears on the sides, which was looking just gnarly, so I'm wondering if maybe white is the superior color after all.

&#x200B;

Researching further, I found that the S7 MaxV Plus could be a good alternative (which would also be more easily available in black), especially because it's supposed to be better at recognizing obstacles, but I'm not sure if this is worth the higher price.

&#x200B;

I was thinking that if I'm getting the S7 MaxV, I could just as well go all-in and get the S7 MaxV Ultra as, honestly, I can see myself not wanting to use the mop function a lot due to not wanting to deal with the cloth after each run. But at that point, it really has to be worth it because the price is way higher than what I originally wanted to spend, and there seem to be some drawbacks.

I've seen a video in which a guy was pointing out that you'll regularly need to clean the station which seems a lot nastier and time-consuming than changing the cloth. 

I only have two smaller rooms that need regular mopping, so I assume that I'll only need to change the cloth after each run, and not mid-run.

Do I assume correctly that the Ultra station also dries the cloth? So that the vac can sit in the station with the cloth on for a couple of days after a mopping run? Or would I also need to remove the cloth after each run?

Having to use dust bags is a drawback as well, but I think I can deal with that better than with with a mop-cleaning function that, in the worst case, gives me more work than a station without.

I've been thinking of getting a robot vacuum, but the amount of options is overwhelming. After finally settling on Roborock, I now need to choose a modell. The S6 Pure and S6 MaxV seem to be good options.

It would need to clean about 100 square meters of space, deal with my long hair and be pet friendly, since I have two dogs.

I recently bought my first robot vacuum, Mi Robot-Vacuum mop 2. 

It cleans the apartment like a charm but I have a few considerations. 

During the second complete clean I noticed front sensor(?) already has a few long scratches on it. I also notice frequent bumps into furniture ( which I consider OK, I even find it funny sometimes ), though some furniture it doesn’t recognize as good and bumps full speed into those ( like keyboard stand and tall flower pots ). 

I’m okay with that as well but I’m not sure it won’t get damaged too much from those collisions? 
There is a small rubber bumper which I assume should absorb collision damage but he doesn’t always bump into objects with it but rather with that sensor. 

Am I just overly concerned and all is good or should I take some actions? 

I thank you for all your inputs."	2	"[""Long_Dealer_6147: Take action or you could have damaged furniture and/or scuffed-up baseboards. Put a strip of weatherstripping, felt, or the loop side (soft) of velcro across the bumper's top. They do also make rubber bumper strips for robots (may have to trim). \n\nIt's not a bad idea to follow the bot around on a cleaning run to find where trouble spots are, then find ways to protect the furniture and/or bot. For some furniture like on carts, the bottom of the bumper (the rubber strip) might not make contact and instead hit the sensor part then spins scratching the object and bot."", 'LoneStar_O_o: Thanks! I’ll see what I can do. \nFurniture in which he bumps doesn’t bother me if scratched, I’m mostly concerned about bot/sensor damage. Are scratches too bad for it?']"

RV2502AE w/cleanedge

It's been a about 2 weeks since I've checked the app but today I discovered some notable changes to the map. As a result I decided to see if there any changes to the way the robot maps your home.

Picture 1 (basement) is result of the mapping run I executed this morning. I should mention here that I neglected to take a before picture for your reference. Most notable to me is the greatly increased number of sharp angles added into the map, where as in the old map I can report that virtually all sharp angles were mostly smoothed/rounded out. Can also report that this new map appears to be a good deal more accurate, and while there is a reduction in anomalies/errors there are still some present in the new map. (Anomalies and errors did not previously impact cleaning, just visualization errors in app. Have yet to test cleaning based on latest map. Will update post.) 

Picture 2 (2nd floor) is the result of the updated app having made changes to the existing map. Again, I have no before picture for your reference (sorry), but the map is clearly different to me. Rounded edges appear to have been sharpened slightly, but not nearly to the same degree as in picture one. I'm assuming that if I remap the 2nd floor that the new map will reflect the same increase in sharp edges as in picture 1 (basement). 

Haven't bothered to search to see if there's a statement about the app update, but I'm gonna assume that there's been some modification(s) to the lidar mapping algorithm. Whether that change is merely to how the original data is being displayed in the app, or it's now actually inputting a greater amount of data (detail) from the lidar sensor into the map, I don't know. But clearly something has changed."	29	"['Cheedo4: Funny, I saw this so I went to go check my map and a pop up appeared in the app with new features and the first feature was “We have updated the look and feel of your home map.\n\nYou will now see a more detailed layout of your home and may notice some aesthetic differences.”\n\nSo yeah, looks like you are correct!\n\nEdit: it also looks to be only an app update, no update to the vacuum firmware, at least not on my end.', ""Scary_Lengthiness734: Post Update --\n\nI ran the basement vac with new map 3 separate times today.\n\nCleaning does not appear to be impacted whatsoever. The only notable difference was in the execution of the route it took clean on the new map. Previously, it treated the basement as an entire room and went line by line across the whole of the basement. Now, it breaks the room up into 3 distinct blocks, finishing one block before advancing to the next.\n\nJust guessing, but one possible reason for this is that the bot is unable to maintain a straight line over X distance.There are several sections of my home where the vac has the ability to travel 45-55 feet in a straight line, and if you watch it close enough after about 15-20 feet the straight line eventually begins to curve quite noticably. This is true of all 3 Sharks I own.\n\nWith the vac now breaking it up in sections, I noticed that the curvature issue seems to be greatly reduced because it is now traveling smaller distances. It cleans just as well as before, so I can't say that there's a benefit from having it split the room into smaller blocks to clean. \n\nOnly benefits I can see are 1) more detailed map in app 2) greater accuracy when mapping."", ""Itchy-Ad1005: My Samsung Tab A is getting a bit old.

Store them in the garage temporarily -- I know it may be a chore, but this worked great for me.\n\n2) Consider changing the position of the docking station. It depends on the layout of your floor, but I found that on one of my vacs I needed to relocate the base to a position that could be considered roughly the mid point of the floor. For example, the mid point for my main floor would be the hallway in picture 2.\n\n3) Mine had an issue recognizing dresser legs that were under a certain diameter, or low-rise supports for a weight bench -- they just didn't record as obstacles in the map and it caused the vac to harass these locations.

It was working ok up until recently now it just gets stuck in loop where it drives a foot or two forward, starts up everything, ramps it down, and just repeats that. The app does nothing until you force reboot it. 

I’ve had robot vacuums before, i had the Electrolux Trilobite and that was miles better than this, even my S9+ is better. How did Neato mess up this badly???

Across the past six years, I\'ve had three Neato bots starting with the original Botvac Connected (eventually died) and then two D7 one of which was a warranty replacement for the other due to a failed lidar. In addition to the above mentioned behavior, NONE of them could navigate as well as advertised. Often, in the middle of a job, they might breakout in a jittery-stuttering-spinning honey-bee dance in one spot for 5-min or more before continuing on or just giving up and proclaiming that it\'s lost. The ""D"" shape that they market as better for corners is a missed opportunity since the bot almost never actually manages to stick it\'s corner into a corner to capitalize on it. It even struggles to transition onto short 1/4"" high area rugs. The side sweeper brush barely spins - if at all - on smooth concrete floors. Yes, of course I can disassemble the bot and replace the ""O-ring"" belt that drives that brush - Not gonna mess with it. I\'ve moved on instead.

I know people have asked for million recommendations and I have looked through many of the previous posts.

I have owned many iRobot devices but stopped using them for one reason or another.  We got a mini Australian shepherd and I would love to have a vacuum that I can have run daily and create ""no-go"" spaces.  Also want it to be self-emptying.  The entire space is hard floor with a very low area rug.  We also have floor registers for central air on which our old roombas would get caught.  

I was hoping I could find one with Lidar and vslam that would be self-emptying and wouldn't be insanely expensive.  

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!"	6	"['Scary_Lengthiness734: I have two Shark models\n\n-RV2502AE more expensive, slightly better \n\n-UR2500SR slightly less expensive, still good\n\nBoth are more than adequate for what you\'ve described. We have no complaints about ours and we\'re quite happy. While both are essentially the same robot, we prefer the method of cleaning on the 2502. It runs the entire perimeter first, where as the 2500 seems to run the perimeter last. Obstacle avoidance and navigation does seem to be slightly better on 2502, and the 2502 has the added ""Clean Edge"" feature. It\'s basically a side mounted air jet which is angled towards the floor and is meant to help clear debris away from baseboards and corners -- it works surprisingly well.\n\nAs far as a combination of lidar and VSLAM, I\'m just taking a guess that what you\'re looking for is something that doesn\'t exist. Lidar renders VSLAM obsolete in many aspects and will likely be completely phased out in the not too distant future. It\'d be a bit redundant imo, but that\'s not to say that there isn\'t a manufacturer currently producing an RV with both options onboard.', 'open_pit_sierra: L10s Ultra has been amazing IMO', 'biimerge: Thank you for this!

VSLAM is method of navigation via a top mounted camera that actually builds a map off your ceiling lol. In that case you're looking at offerings from Roomba or Roborock. There are other brands, but generally these are just the most popular brands because they're the best performing. \n\nNot sure about roborock, but I believe roomba actually has a warranty that if it runs over dog poop (or something of that nature) within the first year they'll replace the unit."", 'drizzle_R: Stating vslam robots are building a map by using the ceiling is just wrong and showing no knowledge about it really works. Google for feature points / landmarks  + vslam and have a read.\n\nAnd for your future bet : i am pretty sure the opposite will happen for home environment robots since 1D-Lidar is only giving distance information while a camera offers lot more data (and you can also extract distance data from it) that can be used even more better with advancing compute power and computer vision.', 'Scary_Lengthiness734: You\'re right, I don\'t know much about VSLAM in regards it\'s operation, however I don\'t really give a flying fuck because virtually every review that I\'ve seen has given nearly identical descriptions as I\'ve just given pertaining to how it navigates.

Matter. \n\nIf the companies sponsoring some of these reviews are happy to not have the influencers correct their language in regards to it\'s operation, then so am I. \n\nLol and again, don\'t really care if my bet falls through because guess what?

My appartment has two problems the Deebot T9 Aivi isn't solving. First I have a large, black rug.

AlfieMcLuvin	2	11kcfge	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/11kcfge/yet_another_which_one_should_i_buy_question_and/	"I have read through lots of posts and feel like I have it narrowed down to the Shark IQ (gen 2 right?) but I still wanted to ask a few questions about things I couldnt find the answer for or am not sure.

* The Shark IQ gen2:
   *  does not require a internet connection (or does it?)
   * is bagless (no bag in the vac nor the docking station/t
   * ""immune"" to getting messed up by lots of hair?
   * Does not send (at least say they dont) information to the cloud? 

A bit of context. I have a large super hairy dog which, during shedding seasons, would likely fill up a robo vac daily, as a result bags would get expensive fast so what I get has to be bagless. I am not a fan of something that needs internet to work (wasnt there like a roomba / AWS outage a while back?) and dont like the idea of IoT stuff hovering up data about the house and sending it to wherever. I dont really have rugs, one but if thats not vacuumed then no biggie. I have a two story house but the upstairs does not get dirty nearly as quickly but would be nice to take the vac upstairs once a week or so - if thats possible. I am really hoping to not spend more than $400 max

I was thinking about the possibility of a vac/mop combo but #1 if one part breaks then the whole thing has to get replaced right? (as opposed to having a separate vac bot and mop bot) #2 The moping bots/components dont seem to be as automated as the vac parts - that is the mops dont seem to go empty/refill themselves, or do they?

Ok, last question. How worth it is it to get a new vac so I can have the warranty? It seems like they dont really last more than 2-3 years and it seems like many of the warranties last 1-2 years? I was thinking to just get something used/scuffed and save my $ for when it breaks. but wanted to see about others experiences. 

Thanks!!"	6	"[""Itchy-Ad1005: I have an older Shark self empty.  As far as I know all Shark bots are bagless.  Re internet connectionvity i know mine will work if my internal house network is up and running even if tgat network is not connected to the internet.  I have an internal Orbi network connected to the FIOS cheap router.  If the FIOS network is down but Orbi network is still functioning my Shark runs fine.  You'll still need to give your bot access to the internet for updates from time to time.  Without internet  acess the device with the application will have to be on the same network.\n\nMy Shark does an excellent job with dog hair (Airedale and Cairn) and I run it 5 days a week.  The Sharks like mine do not have a bin full sensor and I don't think they have one on the newer models.  It returns to the base on a fixed time schedule (every 30 minutes).  The internal bins on all the bots is pretty small.  If the bin will fill up in less than 30 minutes when you use it regularly I'd suggest looking at a different bot that has bin full sensor.  \n\nFWIW it does compact a bit in the internal bin but my guess its not much more than 30% or so unless its small.  Some of the stuff that comes off my dogs compacts almost to something that looks almost like felt.\n\nBig clumps of blown coat from a Husky might be a problem for any bot."", 'hi_from_brian: I\'m new to this sub, but no matter how you sort its feed there are an awful lot of problem posts related to the Shark brand. If I was to buy right now it would be from the iLife brand for their use of newer technologies and an app that\'s more configurable than their competitors (for example, Uoni\'s app is usable, but doesn\'t give you any control over the mapping, room naming, room ordering, or even the creation of room partitions. Grr...)\n\nYour home\'s exterior is already visible on Google Earth and Street View, and all of the information about bedroom and bathroom counts, the size of the garage, the presence or absence of a laundry room, etc. is already very public information. Run a web search for ""information about <your address>"" to see this for yourself. Using just these two things anyone can already guess the interior layout of your home with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nI\'m highly wary of anything that claims to be free of hair clogging. It happens to anything and everything from sinks and tubs to upright vacuums. There is no magic way to escape this while collecting it. I clean our unit\'s roller, brushes, and filter weekly.\n\nThe cost of bags for things like a big collection bin are negligible, like $2-4/month even with your dog. It\'s not worth entirely avoiding a purchase for this, but I would not be so accepting of any bags on the vacuum itself.\n\nFor going between floors, this usually requires restoring to a different map within the related app each time you change floors. This can become tedious enough that many folks end up with a second device for the second floor.\n\nDefinitely go for a vacuum + mop combo. The mopping piece is usually a gravity fed, non-moving attachment, so it\'s not something that gets broken easily. You need to fill its reservoir each time, clean its pad off after each use, and replace its pad sometimes. A nice spare parts kit for these devices can be had around $25, and they will come with some of these pads, extra side brushes and hepa filters, etc. The life of all these things is from many weeks to many months, so it doesn\'t cost much at all to keep them going. As for dedicated mopping robots, the reviews of them all say that they clean at a level consistent with a Swiffer Wet Jet without any added pressure. That\'s exactly what the reviews of these combo units say. Additionally, most of the dedicated moppers are not very intelligent while many of these vacuums use lidar and AI to get things done efficiently and smartly.\n\nI would buy new for two reasons. You already mentioned warranties, and you\'re right that most of them are a year, some two. However, if you get it from Amazon it only costs around $35 to extend the base warranty out to 3 years through their partner, Asurion, sold right through Amazon like any other listing. The other reason I\'d buy new is that many of us buy these vacuums because we\'ve been too busy or sick to keep with the cleaning. This means that there\'s a high chance that any returned units have already done some heavy duties, and then you\'d have nothing but the manufacturer\'s warranty to back it up.', ""Itchy-Ad1005: It's a Mesh tri band router.  It has satellite units around the house.   Extenders because of the way they worked cut your internal bandwidth in about half.also it required a separate password to use each router.

Sounds like the Orbi is a LAN router, interesting, I wonder what the shark needs to be connected to the LAN for? So just to be clear, you are able to map your home even without a connection to the internet? \n\nVery good to know about the dog hair situation! I have an old iLife and it is super basic, for the money I spent it was fine but its dying now and I'd like something that at the very least self empties.\n\nI actually called shark and got contradictory answers from the rep which was quite frustrating.

Edit: My apartment is 90 m², only 1 floor, i live alone and don't have childs nor pets. I have mostly tile floor with 1 medium carpet. I'm between this options but if someone have some suggestions would be nice:

1. Dreame L10 Pro $329 (no dock support)
2. Dreame z10 Pro $529 (with dock, need to investigate PROs and CONs about this)
3. Roborock Q7 Max $706 (no object avoidance, without dock, should buy one in future)
4. Roborock S7 MaxV $635 (without dock, should buy an auto-empty dock in future)
5. Ecovacs T10 Plus $823 (with dock, need to investigate PROs and CONs about this)

Edit 2:  Added the prices in dollars and s7 MaxV option without dock.

I never had any problems with them, they were all very reliable, the bags for the S7 and Q7 bought them on Amazon in Europe. I checked Mercado Libre and there are spare parts for both but not yet bags for Q7, maybe you could get the bags on TiendaMia. Anyways i dont think spare parts and support situation is any better with any of the brands you listed, since afaik they have no official stores/support in Arg. Maybe you would be safer with iRobot if all you care is support but to me their technology is ancient history.  \n\n\nBottom line: if i were you i would choose Q7 without hesitating, personally i think obstacle avoidance is still quite immature since shoe laces or streched cables continue to be an issue with every single AI robot i saw.', ""USToastGuard: i would recommend Dreame L10s ultra because it has a front camera, or D10 plus, it's cheaper because it doesn't have front camera."", ""alecipo: Hello Xeon, thanks for you suggestions. I edited the post and added the prices here in Argentina and also added S7 MaxV option (without dock), i don't know why is cheaper than the Q7 Max. \n\nSo my options are: go for S7 MaxV now and in the future buy the the auto-empty dock ($353) but i don't know if this is too much for my needs\n\nOr simply go for one of the Dreame bots just for 1 or 2 years and then upgrade to another when newer models arrive.""]"

I just got an iLife t10s.  The map it drew was awesome and accurate upon first run. 

That's the good part.

I connected it to the Toya smart app first of course (how I see the map)

I ordered and named the rooms.

Then I went to timer (basically the add schedule thing) in settings.  Did so....and it wont run.  I've tried multiple times... setting different times, checking time zone of app location and all that and it doesn't want to start unless I start the ""auto clean"" button.  It works fine doing that but I'd like the automation of it working on days at certain times and such.

Any help would be appreciated.  It's pretty generic..like when you connect to the app you use the Wi-Fi robot vacuum connection.

Thank you for any thoughts here.

Roborock Q5+, Roomba j7+, or Neato D9?	wxian	3	11dvbe9	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/11dvbe9/best_for_vacuum_only_for_medium_pile_carpet_and/	"Please help me pick my first robot vacuum. 

Multiple floors 1200sqft total, 1 cat, 1 human. I can speedrun vacuum my house in about 25-35 minutes, but that doesn't include stairs or multiple passes -- real ""deep"" vacuum cleaning time about 1.5 hours.  I'm looking for a way to reduce the amount of time down from 2-3 hours per week, while living in a cleaner house. 

First floor has hard floors with one area rug, second floor has mostly medium pile (.5in) carpet for bedrooms, but it's uniform cut (not berber style). 

 I have 1 senior cat that sheds some, but not excessively, but by the end of the week I can collect a decent amount of hair.  I'm looking mainly to pick up things like: crumbs in the kitchen, cat hair, litter, and general lint and dust.  No shoes upstairs, so I'm not worried about ground-in dirt in carpet. I'm also not too worried about pet mess, since I don't plan to run the vacuum when not home. It's more for after-work while I make dinner or fold laundry, or mornings when I go on a coffee run. 

Currently trying to decide between the Roborock Q5+, Roomba j7+, and Neato D9. Auto empty would be nice, but supporting multiple levels is a must.  Budget is about $500. I don't really need mopping, would rather have the best vacuum.

Roborock Q5+ pros: Lidar, good mapping, good app.  
Roomba j7+ pros: carpet performance, better build and support?  
Neato D9 pros: Lidar, better shape? edge cleaning? lower price.

Currently leaning towards the Roborock Q5. Any suggestions? Am I missing anything? Thanks!"	8	"['Outrageous_Bag_7412: Irobot S9 for best carpet cleaning.', 'jimacarroll1701: Neato.

Let me tell you this, it’s does the same if not better job than a corded vacuum. I have 2 cats and when the play, they get aggressive and you will see literally patches of fur everywhere, every day. With my back issues I’m only able to vacuum once a week, until I bought the S9! Now I run it every 2-3 days and my upstairs is perfectly clean.\n\nMy steam mop went out for downstairs last weekend as well (what a coincidence, right? Lol), and I decided to purchase the Roborock S7 Maxv Ultra since it’s 100% tile downstairs. Just ran it yesterday and boy am I happy with it!\n\nSo the con of s9 is that the mapping just sucks, and it’s pretty much useless for me. But it still is able to clean all rooms upstairs within an hour even with it’s shitty mapping system.

Both are great vacuums.  Ultimately, I returned the Roomba and kept the Roborock.  A few reasons why...\n\n1. I wanted mop functionality. Although I got the iRobot M6 Braava, it just didn't do a good job... It would take forever and just slam into things. The Roborock does a much better job at mopping and it also autocleans the mop and auto refills the water tank.\n2. Roborock has much more advanced navigation and obstacle avoidance than the S9/M6 combo.  With the built in sensors, the Roborock did a better job navigating around shoelaces, extension cords, and pet toys.  While the Roomba would just drive right over them. Roborock also has no problem navigating in a dark room, while the Roomba you have to keep the lights on.\n3. Sound... The S9 is loud, while the Roborock seems to be a bit quieter.\n4. Vacuum performance - This is a toss up.  95% of my floor is hard floor, and the rest is high pile carpet.  I also have a siberian husky who sheds a ton of hair.  Both vacuums got the job done perfectly in this scenario, although I'd have to give the slight edge to the Roomba S9 which does a better job in edge and corner cleaning. In addition, the S9 is supposed to do a better job in low pile carpet. \n5. RGB camera - Because I have a dog.  If I'm not home, the Roborock S7 MaxV has a built in camera and remote control where I can control the vacuum and watch through the camera from my phone.  This is handy when I want to check in on my dog when he's home alone.\n\nLike another poster said... If you can hold out, Roborock is about to release their S8 Pro Ultra in a couple of months which features dual rollers like the Roomba for better vacuum performance.  If you can hold out even longer, they will likely release the S8 MaxV Ultra sometime next year which will be the successor to the S7 MaxV (which adds the RGB camera over the S8 Pro)."", 'rslash7: You can consider q5+ which is much cheaper and is decent on carpet or roomba j7+', 'realitythrownout: The easiest way to narrow it down is to ask yourself if you really need/want advanced mop functions. Once you answer that question it makes the decision a lot easier.', 'Scary_Lengthiness734: If you can manage to hold yourself back from making a purchase for the next few months you\'ll be able to see review videos of Roborock\'s new S8 Ultra. Given the new upgrades to the roller brush assembly it\'s likely that we will see very similar carpet performance as found on current Roomba vacs. \n\nAlternatively, I\'d tell you to go with S7 MaxV hands down. You don\'t have pets, and so the S7 will be far more than adequate because you are all it has to keep up with, plus you get the benefits of the mopping feature and a newer robo vac than the S9. If you had a German Shepherd like myself, then I\'d be telling you to get the Roomba instead. \n\nIt\'s overkill only depending on how you look at it. Even if everyone in the house doesn\'t mind mopping and vacuuming, everyone is still going to love the fact that the S7 ultra mops and vacs. My parents for instance? They couldn\'t dream of having a robot vacuum because they thought along a similar line as you: is it overkill?\n\n""Oh we don\'t need that. We don\'t want one. They\'re expensive. Blah blah blah.""\n\nWell guess what, they love it now, and they don\'t for a second miss the vacuuming they had to do previously, and they certainly don\'t give a damn about what it cost. They vacuum twice a month now instead of 1-2 times per week.']"

(Dead screen and other issues.)  


I'm not expecting a replacement machine to last as long as this one did.  I bought it back when they were first released and have only had to replace batteries and give it a good decent cleaning every month. (I like maintaining machines.)  


I don't need a smartphone app.  I would prefer something with a LIDAR or optical system like the Neato has.  I'd also very much appreciate a robot that would work with magnetic strips as I find just tossing a magnetic strip down to keep it out of a temporary problem area doesn't involve much effort.  


I'd like a system that I can just push a start button on and it just goes, as the XV-11 did. I was fine with tidying the room a bit for the  XV and I don't need something that will need a lot of fussing over.

I don't need or want an integrated mop system. I currently use a Scooba with no issues on tile floors.  


We have a mixture of tile, oak flooring, and carpet.  Something with a wide cleaning bar like the Neato would be great, especially if it has a similarly powerful suction.  I don't need the vacuum to be quiet when operating.

I looked briefly at a RoboRock q5, but I can't find any confirmation that it works with magnetic strips.  If anyone knows for sure that it does, I will just go with that."	0	[]

It hates my kitchen.

My kitchen is next to the backdoor, so in between us and the dogs going in and out of the backyard every day as well as general kitchen stuff, it's always the dirtiest room in the house. We used to have the Vacmop plugged in in the dining room next to the kitchen, but unless I sent it directly to the kitchen, it would always clean it last. This meant that it would pretty much always run out of battery and/or mopping fluid before getting to the kitchen.

So I moved it into the kitchen, in hopes it would start with the kitchen and move on to everything else, because when it was in the dining room, it would start with the dining room, and then move on from there

However, even in its new location, I will set it to clean, watch it turn on, and then watch it proceed to run DIRECTLY THROUGH THE KITCHEN to get to another room before it starts its cycle. I re-mapped and everything when I moved it. I have no idea why it's doing this.

So, any ideas on how I can set it so any ""normal"" cleaning run starts in the kitchen? I know I can manually set it to just clean the kitchen (because if I ask it to do the kitchen plus any other room, it still always does the kitchen last) but half the point of a robot vacuum is so I can set a schedule and then just remember to empty the dustbin/set up the mop stuff before bed."	2	"[""Scary_Lengthiness734: You can link your Shark account to Google. From there you can create routines to have the vac clean specific rooms, at specific times and at which power level. You cannot have the robot do more than one room at a time through routines. Best way to get it work smoothly is to time how long the robot averages in each room. So if its 11am and your vac takes 15 minutes on average to do the kitchen, then the next routine should be set for 11:17-11:20am to start the next room you want cleaned. It's going to run the vacuum in the base between each room, but it can be done."", ""ace_at_none: Thank you, I'll try that out!""]"

Now the actual question: How does it hold up against the modern versions of vacuum robots? Is it considered fully outdated and performing worse than even the entry level robots nowadays or is it a viable option considering it was not a cheap model back then?

I am pretty new to this area of technology and I would have guessed that a huge leap in performance happened since 2013 when the Navibot was initially released but I could not find any reliable information on this. Maybe you guys can help me in finding an answer to this question?

Plus, it costs more.\n\nConsumable parts (filter, side brush, main brush) are also better on the Dreame, you can buy original ones for cheap money from China instead of getting generic ""compatible"" ones which usually are crap.\n\nI\'d buy the Dreame L10 Pro.

For example, Roborock is expected to put out a model like it in April. Meanwhile I'm seriously considering an Ecovac Omni or a Roborock S7 Max Ultra. But I'd hate to spend for a premium product only for it to be completely outdated in 2 months. Does anyone have any data showing how much better the performance would be for a dual roller compared to a single roller bot? I probably should just be patient and wait for the new models.	1	"[""Scary_Lengthiness734: Rest assured that there will be review videos from vacuum wars and all other YouTube channels related to robot vacuums almost immediately after they get them.\n\nYes roomba scores well on carpet as seen from multiple individual reviews, but there are a small handful of vacs that either scored similarly or better than Roomba on carpet test without the use of dual rollers.\n\nI'm sure it'll be an improvement on carpet for the S8, without a doubt, but I think where the real improvement will shine is in the upgraded mopping system: dual agitators + added down force\n\n^^ that's the reason that I myself would wait to see \n\nI'll happily eat my ball cap if the S8 ends up having amazing carpet performance, I just don't see it being that much of an improvement IMO""]"

Any thoughts, recommendations, experiences, words of caution or wisdom you care to share?

======== Edit: Details below =======

(I was trying to keep my post short, but since folks asked for details, here are some needs):

Going for as spotless floors as I can get, so for my particular needs I would want to pick up all the gunk the tires track in, which is mostly:

* Small bits of gravel
* Wet and dry leaves
* Mud and dust
* Water dragged in from the car, or condensation from its air conditioning.

And then also:

* The occasional dropped screw
* Occasional human messes like a small amount of sawdust, or grass and dirt tracked in from the yard.

And then I would want:

* Minimize the chance of scratching the paint on low to the floor sportcars
* Minimize the need to service it all the time due to small dustbins and the like
* Floors clean enough for walking on with white socks would be ideal.  (My cars don't leak oil, though the occasional condensation from the air conditioner, as well as tracked in water would be normal)
* Industrial enough that small sharp pebbles or a nail or other such garage debris does not ruin the robot.
* The usual obstacle and collision avoidance so it doesn't get confused by a shoe or loose cable.
* I don't have pets, though I imagine folks looking for such a robot might want to deal with pet hair and the like.
* I don't have a budget.  I would pay for perfection, or could go cheap and disposable depending on what makes sense.  I have owned many robot mops and vacuums in the past, and presently have 2 Roborock S7 Max V Ultras, and one iRobot Bravajet, which maybe will end up in the garage as they age and are replaced.

It seems the need for a garage robot is a lot different than what you would want for hardwood or carpet floors, but there is a lot of shared functionality.

The one robot that is sort-of close to what might work is the [makita drc300](https://www.makitatools.com/products/details/DRC300Z), but it seems alone in this product category, and it is really difficult to find a review that is comprehensive enough to make the buy decision from.

Amazon frequently has excellent deals on renewed shark vacuums that you can slap an additional 2-3 year warranty on for like $30-40. Woot also has great deals on renewed sharks every few months. Two of mine are refurbs and one was direct from Shark -- they all do a great job.\n\n2 - again for this specific job, I'd go for low features. Basic lidar navigation, generally good reviews, smart home integration, auto emptying base (absolute must), decent object avoidance. Again, I'd point you to Shark.\n\n3 - I don't have a worry about pet accidents in the garage, but if I did then I'd probably be looking at a top of the range Roborock or Roomba. They have onboard cameras to recognize pet accidents and avoid them. Anything without the ability to recognize pet accidents will drive right through it, spread it ALL over, suck a bunch of it into its guts, and this is all presuming the robot doesn't die right on the spot. \n\n4 - My garage is pretty clean. Has the occasional screw, but never a stray rag or anything like that. I don't have a vac out there yet, but when it's time to replace the vac inside the house then it will be moved to the garage. My current vac won't avoid any cords, socks, rags etc, so it will find the rag and likely jam, or likely just carry it around until it's done cleaning. I suspect that a screw of sufficient size may cause the robot to jam, thus requiring you to intervene, but I don't think it will jam every time it finds a screw. \n\nIf you're satisfied with the answers given, then you'd be fine with a newer model shark (anything that has AI Ultra in the name)(please confer with me before you buy a shark, the way they named their robots is stupid and it easily confuses a lot of people).\n\nMy two models:\n UR2500SR \n RV2502AE (this variant uses a jet of air to clean corners -- much more effective than robots that don't use this) \n\nI love both of them and can't find anything to complain about. Completely integrated and automated into my smart home, keeps the floors near 100% clean, and damn near forget it even exists lol. From my perspective, it appears that most of the people you see complaining about sharks are restricted mostly to older models, or what appears to be complaints from people who might have frequent issues with technology lol.\n\nIf not satisfied by the answers given, then you're looking at something a bit more expensive. Roomba, for instance, will avoid the pet mess as well as most objects, but at a premium. Same story for Roborock.\n\nMakita makes a robot vacuum intended for shop applications, so there's little to no worrying about what happens when a screw is thrown onto the floor. It's extremely expensive for what it is tho, and for that kind of money you could buy a top of the line roborock that's absolutely amazing for your house but extreme overkill for your garage.\n\nHope this helps, feel free to fire questions back\n\nEdit: another user mentioned oil spills from vehicles, this needs to go into your decision making. If any liquid spills factor into potential hazards in your garage, then the vac needs to have onboard AI (cameras) to see and then avoid the mess. Otherwise, same story as with pet mess."", ""Scary_Lengthiness734: Okay so given the updated details I'd have to say that you're pretty much just as informed as the rest of us when it comes to garage specific vacs like the Makita.\n\nIn other words your guess is as good as ours as to it's performance, let alone reviews.\n\nPebbles are probably fine up to right around like a quarter inch in height. Probably not really what roborock was intending and an S7 to pickup lol, but I do think that when you're ready to retire your vacs in the house that they'll do okay in the garage, sort of.\n\nReally it's going to depend on the size and shape of your leaves, but if they appear that they're something that the S7 would hoover up then yeah it's probably fine.\n\nFor the sports car you're probably going to want to set no go zones just to be safe and remove any potential of the robot getting anywhere near it.\n\nThe only thing that stood out to me as potentially being a hurdle is the water on the floor from condensation or ice melting off the car.\n\nIt's my understanding that the S7 probably doesn't play as well with pools of water on the floor as any other vac, which is why everything that has to do with water usually occurs behind the the vacuum inlet / roller assembly. \n\nExample: \n\n-you get home on a snowy day and everyone's piling out of the car with their wet and muddy boots\n\n-there's debris on the floor that should probably be vacuumed before a mopping run occurs, but there's also water all over the floor that the vacuum will suck up prior to mopping (not good) \n\nThis one issue alone pretty much has me ruling out every vac I can think of. I have no idea if the Makita can handle something like that. I know it's design was centered around it being used in shop-like conditions, but I don't know if it plays well with water."", ""finggreens: It'll be hard to meet all those requirements. What you want to consider is the height the robot's vacuum entrance is from the floor. Things bigger than that will just get pushed out of the way. \n\nI've never seen the Makita, but from everything I know thus far about robot vacuums, I've had one for 5 years and a mop for 1 and looked at commercial versions that suck and mop and return to stations to dump contents and refill fluid...\n\nThe makita looks like a great choice. Please report back and let us know!"", ""ZARdeous: Your post reminded me that iRobot once made a shop vac... the dirt dog\n\nAnyway, I wonder if a Narhwal Freo or a Shinebot would fit your needs?

It seems like water mitigation may be a concern.  I have heated floors, and a slight ramp up to the garage, and very little snow but loads of rain.  So the floors should not get crazy wet, but wetter than the robots are normally used to.\n\nI suppose if I program them to run at 5:00 AM or something, the floors would be at their dryest, which might help as well.  I could even program the floors to be a few degrees hotter during the night to aid in drying.   The floors warm at about 1 degree per hour, though, so that may not help a lot, but is something.  I could also program the robots to self clean at a very high frequency to handle the dirt and water load better.\n\nI think you and I have gone through the same thinking process in general here.', ""xamomax: I don't think so.  I believe it uses the same batteries and chargers used for other Makita power tools.

Used, probably knock about $200 off.\n\nRoborock has a pro version of their S7 ultra, but it comes without the camera system onboard. It sells for $1000, which is $300-400 cheaper than the variant with the camera. I\'ve only found these sold from Alibaba for about $1k. Know that it doesn\'t help keep you in budget, but it\'s something to consider.\n\nOutside of that, there\'s the Deebot Omni which you should be able to find in the $800 range.\n\nThere are some dedicated mop only vacs as well.\n\nJust do some searches on YouTube or Google for ""robot vacuum mop"" and see what you find.

Are there any botvacs that still utilize the magnetic strips to block off areas, or have they all moved to some sort of app-based mapping?

I guess I’ve just been used to it, but looking down on my floors now, pet hair everywhere, some muddy foot prints, drool marks near the water fountains, and crumbs where my kid clearly broke the “please only eat at the table” rule. Could definitely use a good scrub, but I just swept and mopped two days ago. I’m overwhelmed with how quickly it just turns back to chaos which is kinda why I block that part out. I would have been mildly embarrassed if anyone else brought it up, but I also wouldn’t have anyone else at my house without deep cleaning everything. 

My biggest thing is should I get a mop separate or together. I obviously want to make sure I get one that will avoid accidents with the little sensors, but the combo almost feels like a gimmick with my skepticism."	9	"['i486dx2: For your situation, I\'m going to say ""No"".\n\nThe robots need a certain amount of ""persistence"" to do a good job cleaning.  They have to get right up against things, sweep beyond their borders with the side brushes, push small toys aside to clean underneath, etc, etc.  A robot with fancy ""absolutely do not touch anything"" sensors that could reliably avoid what seems to be frequent pet accidents would also generally do a worse job cleaning everywhere else than a ""less intelligent"" bot would.\n\nThen the secondary complication is the amount of debris.  With that much pet hair, you\'re solidly into auto-empty being a non-negotiable necessity.  A combo vac+mop robot has a lot more parts to carry around (tanks and pads), so there is less space available for the vacuuming components - dust bin size in particular suffers, making auto-empty even more of a requirement.\n\nI think you should get two separate robots.  But I also think you would be much happier if you made it part of your routine to personally check the floors for the accidents first, then start the robots manually (vacuum first, then mop), to relieve the robots of the requirement to avoid those messes.', ""Foreign_Afternoon_49: In general, robots don't clean as deeply as humans do. I don't know if a separate mop vacuum is better than a combo, or how much better. But either way, you'll still have to deep clean the floors yourself. The robot mop cleans like a wet swiffer (but without elbow grease). So I'd say choose one that fits your budget and has the features you want (e.g., obstacle avoidance AI, auto empty, etc.). None of them can do more than light, maintenance, surface cleaning, so you may as well go for convenience. A combo is more convenient than 2 robots, imho."", 'SnooHamsters3342: I do have a roborock vacuum that both mops and vacuums. It works really well. I rarely use my mop or vacuuum now', ""Scary_Lengthiness734: The short answer is yes, they do work. They aren't a replacement, but they still do a damn good job in-between the times when you deep clean the house. They aren't perfect, but they will be enough to reduce some weight off your shoulders.\n\nOne thing you need to keep in mind about all of this:\n\nIf the pets have an accident on the floor while everyone is away, rest assured that the robot will undoubtedly find that mess, suck a bunch of it up into the robot, spread it into any remaining rooms it has left to clean, and all hoping that the robot doesn't turn itself into a paperweight in the process. \n\nRoomba and Roborock are really the only two who have AI systems good enough to avoid these issues. Outside of that, just know you're taking a gamble.\n\nI don't recommend any robot mop that doesn't clean itself after each use. However, if budget demands that the robot be cheaper, then anything is better than nothing. \n\nAn issue with a lot of combo robots is that sometimes they are built in such a way that they can't empty the dust bin if the mop attachment is attached, so the auto emptying bin is sorta useless if you want it to mop all the time. This is a problem with the shark 2-1 combo.\n\nPlease do a little research prior to your purchase, and just ask yourself what's the most you're willing to put up with in a robot vac. Personally, if I can't forget about it for at least a 7-10 days without any interaction from me, then I don't recommend it."", 'None: Accidents happen if I’m at work or overnight and are cleaned up immediately. So, I’m less worried about that, but would still want that feature as a just in case. Always have a back up and all.\n\nEdit: and it’s been a big reason I’ve not bought one sooner. I’ve seen those horror pics where the robot drags it everywhere and I would throw up. So it has caused slight anxiety whenever looking at buying one. My pets are well trained, but I foster for unhoused folks every winter since they can’t take their pets into shelters and are often not used to being left alone like a dog who belongs to a housed person so are more likely to have accidents. \n\nI appreciate this feedback. I think I’ll be getting a vacuum first then add a mop by itself. I know I should be better at just sweeping and mopping myself, but it’s been the consistent chore that I just can’t keep up with more than once a week.', 'None: I understand that. But I have time to do that ONCE a week, and that’s not working to keep things clean. A combo does sound convenient, but I just want whatever will work best I’m between my weekly cleaning days.', ""i486dx2: >  So, I’m less worried about that, but would still want that feature as a just in case. Always have a back up and all.\n\nOh yeah, not judging or anything.  I'm just saying don't let your quest for extreme obstacle avoidance make you end up with a robot that is so unassertive that it does a poor job with normal cleaning.  \n\nOur comparatively blind Shark IQ, for example, will happily push lighter-weight kid and dog toys across the room, and does a great job at thoroughly cleaning underneath them as a result.  A robot with better sensors and obstacle avoidance algorithms would have gone around these, leaving piles of hair as a result."", ""Foreign_Afternoon_49: I think a combo would be fine enough at mopping (by robot standards), especially if you're deep cleaning once a week (I only deep clean every other week). And it will make your life much easier than coordinating two robots! Again, AI object recognition is a must, and so is auto empty. Depending on budget, if you can go to the high end ones that clean and dry themselves, your life will never be the same :)"", 'None: Ah. That makes sense.

1675907940.0	08-Feb-2023 17:59:00	Bissell A3 is almost 1/2 off, I bought one here are my thoughts.	Blmlozz	4	10xi3mg	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/10xi3mg/bissell_a3_is_almost_12_off_i_bought_one_here_are/	"As of right now the ready clean mop head changing system is just $350.The TLDR is; I am extremely impressed and, this will replace my Roomba M6 .

I pulled the trigger on this because I like the brand's upright cleaning products/air filters and, coming from a roomba M6 owner of 2 years, I got tired of having to be at home while it runs as I have a large 7-800sq/ft first floor tile space where I run my mop. With my M6 I have to change mop heads at least once, sometimes recover it from a bad spot and, it ***frequently*** gets caught on my low pile rugs.  More recently, somehow it became damaged and, I am finding as time goes on, there is a strange degregation of it's ability to find the way around my house which is also repeated with my S9 Roomba. With Amazon taking chief ownership, I decided the A3 being on sale it was worth a try.

App:

The app and setup are top notch, registration required . Otherwise the interface is clean, easy to use & understand. Layout and settings are very easy to find. You get a big map layout, restricted zone controls, room controls , basic robot function buttons, bonus items include the ability to change when the robot changes mop heads, monitor water level in the tank, and a find robot function.

The robot;it's heavy but, that's a good thing!The A3 weighs in a 6lb 9z compared to the M6's 4lb 14oz.

this definitely helps pressure on the mop pad to release stains and dirt even with just my first nights use It seems . The very first night just letting it go It has definitely cleaned much better than the roomba just eyeballing it in the places it can hit.The A3 prefers it seems to avoid hitting walls and instead relies on it's key feature; the LiDAR to map where it should go. This means it does not clean completely edge to edge like the roomba. For me this isn't a big deal as I use my robots as a maintenance between manual cleaning.Most of the weight seems to be in the 34+ w/hr battery but, the robot has a mop head that both lifts and tilts the mop head to put pressure and capture dirt.Otherwise, build is comparable but usually better to the Roomba. The wheels have significant tread, enough to probably last the lifetime of the robot. The plastics feel similar to the M6, The water tank is smaller, I had to change it one time but might get away with a single fill in the future with some tuning. there not not appear to be user serviceable access ports.

I also really appreciate that Bissel includes many mop heads to use, 10-15 disposable mop pads, and 4 washable ones. I think my roomba included maybe half the amount of disposable heads and no reusable ones. Bonus points that the heads themselves are not proprietary unlike the Roomba's. In theory you could use whatever material you'd like so long as it sticks to the velcro on the mop heads.

Negative points; The A3 does give you washable pads and enough to do even my 800sq/ft of space once or twice but, they're pretty expensive for extras at $30 each or $35 for a 50 pack of disposable pads.

The Clean & BatteryMy first run, which included mapping time, took a total of 108 minutes and, depleted 40% battery. The A3 was certainly very quick and silent- I cannot understate this! The M6 has a very high pitched small motor whine that is distracting while the A3 is nearly completely silent. during the clean with nearly flawless execution to avoid obstacles . It did end up stuck on my sliding door overhang but, to be fair so did my roomba and, I did not set a no-go zone which I'm sure will fix the issue.

otherwise the A3 found my entire floor plan the first time around, something the roomba couldn't do and, even to this day sometimes gets lost. Then, it went on to clean the entire floor space with a second pass left in it. I would be confident in saying, this robot can do 1000+ sq/ft floor plans on a single charge . Ironically it even made it's way into my carpeted bedroom on the same level and, although it could not clean, it did not get stuck so to speak. It did map the whole room and, stop to ask for assistance to move the robot. This has happened to a degree  with the roomba before when a certain chocolate lab opens the door and, the results then with the M6 usually would end with the roomba running it's battery out or literally shredding the rubber wheels down trying to recover.  This didn't happen with the A3. It acutally made it into the middle of the room without issue but stopped and went to error state once it realized it was on carpet.

I used maybe 2-3x the amount of recommended 'capfull' of cleaning solution in the tank plus some hot water. It streaked on my white /gray colored tile but, to be fair so did the Roomba with the cleaning solution I used there. I think with some changes it will be reduced or eliminated.

Setting to a mop-head replacement at every 350sq/ft it changed heads twice before it cleared the 720sq/ft of measured tile at least once . I feel like it could have gone another round on the battery but it was late so I called it quits. Either way, after a single pass the M9 definitely would have been drained and, needed to charge for 4 hours but, the bissell was ready to go another around if I had let it.

There are a few parts available on bissell now which suggest to me this may not be a thing you keep long term but, for $350, even if it lasts for just 3-4 years, I think it will have been worth it. I would like to see longer term support of course. I have a Roomba 890 that's more than 5 years old now that still cleans with a new battery just fine and, I expect it to keep going until cleaning bin or battery parts are unavailable. I somehow don't expect the bissell to make it that long. $47 for a barrel charger and $40 for mop heaps are just obscene.

Final thoughts;

At $350 I am struggling to think of a more feature complete better value product right now. The mop head changing system, big battery, cleaning performance, LiDAR system, accessories, app , the whole thing is *easily* worth $350. It may not warrant the original $600 price tag but for $350 on sale now, this has to be the best mop robot value on the market right now.  I really hope Bissell reconsiders the parts and consumable piece of this,"	1	"['i486dx2: Interesting system, thanks for the review.

2. The area is about 90% high pile carpet, so one that can handle this. For reference, my Wyze robot vac gets stuck when moving forward and could only go backwards, the front wheel was too short.

I would need a vacuum that could either cover that much area on one charge or is able to return to base then finish vacuuming. I called Shark and they said the RV2002 (and maybe all of their vacuums?) can only continue vacuuming if they’re connected to wifi, otherwise they just give up after returning home.

It gets professionally cleaned every year but I have trouble maintaining it on a daily basis\n\nAlso, I'm not sure about automatic mopping as I have laminate flooring on the floor I'll be using it on, so if forgoing mopping lowers the price tag, that's an option.\n\nDid anyone with similar constraints had good (or bad, I'd like to know what to avoid too) experiences to share?

Until now, things have been great. I had gotten Error 2, which basically means that there is hair or something stopping up the roller so I took the roller out, cleaned it all up, put it back together, and no more problems. I had to do this every 3 or 4 days for a while.

I figured that was because my parents stayed with me for a few months, and they brought their dog, and she sheds a lot. I was constantly cleaning out white dog hair, but hey, it was working. As time went on, I had to do this less and less frequently, to the point that now, I haven't done it in a couple weeks. I figured it was just picking up a lot over time and there was less there since there was no more dog.

Well, apparently, I should have even though it wasn't giving me the error that it was giving me before. I got the error this morning, flipped it over to take the roller out, like normal, cleaned out a bunch of hair... and then realized something that I'm not sure how to explain.

Usually there's a big clump of hair that comes out when you take off the roller. It's like it gets pinned between the roller and the cap that screws down to hold it in place. Now, the hair is wrapped around the part on the cap that spins, but it can't be removed. There is some kinda screw head that I've never seen before on the wheel assembly next to the roller, and I think I would have to take that whole assembly off to get to this cap.

Does anyone know how to get a large amount of hair out of this thing? I've been scraping at it with a knife and tweezers for over an hour. I wish it would have alerted me before it got this bad...

I'm looking to buy a used robot vacuum cleaner. I leave on a quite big 1 bedroom apartment with only 2 thin carpets but a lot of cables, and the floor gets really messy (I have people over really often). I decided on getting a Roborock S7 MaxV, as I want something that would put me through as little struggle as possible. I know it's a really expensive for a 1 bedroom apartment but I've been saving some money and I want to get the best thing. But I would want to buy it second hand, not only to save money but also for some other reasons of principle. What should I pay attention to? Some of the ads say how many hours the robot has been used but I don't if the number is alright. Also, are there fake robot vacuums and if there are how can I spot one? I found a Roborock S7 Max V second hand for 400 euro/440, is that ok?	5	['ktmax750: Maybe Shark Ultra AI with Hepa filter auto empty.

I kind of want to get a robot vacuum but looking in to it is such a boring chore that it's almost as bad as vacuuming itself. The easy go-to choice for someone with as short an attention span as me is an i-robot vacuum, simply because for decades now their 'roomba' brand has become almost a generic term and they're just by far the most well known.

They also seem to often be the most expensive making them in my mind, the Apple of robot vacuums. That also makes me wonder if there's a decent chance that they don't justify their price tag and simply rely on the brand name associations to keep people paying.

Im looking forward to make little upgrade from mine Roborock S5 Max. Im very happy with it, but as I am a bit of clutterer, robot often eats something when im not at home.

So my priority is good obstacle avoidance. I have one carpet so it'll be good if the robot had no problem getting onto the carpet (s5 sometimes fails. He folds corner of carpet and spins like crazy few times until it manage to get in).

Second priority is as little as possible hair tangling. My gf has long, thick hair, and I must clean S5 Max every run or two. That's why I think T9 Aivi can be upgrade for that (it has roomba style brushes).

My plan is to sell S5 Max, pay a little extra and get some robot with AI. Which will be better? S6 MaxV or T9 Aivi?

Today however, is a different story. The app gave me a ""Abnormal network"" error and I could not get the robot to do anything. My WiFi was working fine, but I factory reset the router anyway with no success. Then I deleted and reinstalled the 360robot app and tried to login again, but got a ""Network error"".

Now neither of us can login to the app or activate the robot, and the robot is no longer connected to the WiFi because I factory reset the router.

Working fine so far until recently, the Robo starts making weird things. All the dust, debris and hair that suck by the Robo was stuck on the brush instead of going inside the bin. This has caused me a lot of problems as I have to clear the brush more frequently than usual (twice a week). After performing a few tests like swapping the brush to a new one, cleaning the whole robot vacuum (including dissembling the machine), it looks like it was not fixing the issue. A 1 month of experiment was carried out to see how much dust was collected in the bin, and just like the title said all of the dust was stuck on the brushes instead of sucked into the bin. Could anyone please help me or suggest any solution?  
Thanks in advance!

\-Swapping new brush"	1	"[""Itchy-Ad1005: I'd guess by your description that there is something wrong with the airflow.\n\n On mine the air travels from the brush area into the bin which by design creates some turbulence.  It then exits  the on board bin through a paper filter into the bot itself where the suction motor is then exits through vents to the room.  I'm not sure where those vents are.  I assume most work similarly.  I'd start by seeing if the bot itself after the bin still has suction.  If it does then the problem is before that.  \n\nCheck the various filters especially the one in the onboard bin.  That one is designed to protect the innards of the bot.  If its been a while since that filter was replaced I'd get a new one.  If there is no suction right after it leaves the bin it might be the vacuum motor itself.  Mine has a plastic grate in front of the air entry into the bot itself after air has exited the bin. Because of your question im going to try to locate the exhaust ports.\n\nMy Dyson stick suddenly didn't want to work.  It kept cutting off and on and when on didn't have much suction.  Turned out a popcorn kernel got stuck in the opening where the air from the wand entered the dirt chamber.  When off it would drop back a little so you could not see it and pop up and partially block the opening when on.  Once I found and removed it everything worked fine.""]"

The main feature I'm looking for in a robot vacuum cleaner with mop is its ability to handle long shedding human hair (has my partner has long hair which sheds).

Regarding long human hair, one of the design features is a vacuum without any roller at all. It still has one side brush, but does not have a main brush at all. According to the marketing material, this is meant to address the issue of long hair, and it's best suited for hard floors (which is my entire house).

My appartment has some weird height difference between rooms and it peaks at around(possibly a bit more) 2,5cm between kitchen and living room.

Can this roborock climb that height (it's listed as 2cm but i've heard it could be more)?

Is there another comparable product that has better step height? I am in EU.

I have a long ranch with mostly vynal floors, although one hallway and all bedrooms are carpeted. I also have a sunken living room (1 step). Besides the sunken living room step, there is only 1 small transition from foyer to a sitting room. (all vynal floor is floating so no other transitions).

&#x200B;

my main purpose it to pick up dust/lint/crumbs/dirt etc. while my wife and I are at work. We currently do not have a dog, but a baby on the way and possibly a dog soon thereafter. With that being said, I would prefer a stronger one with the capabilities to pick up dog hair and some type of senor to not go into the sunken living room.

&#x200B;

I appreciate any insight you fine folk have regarding the matter. I feel like when i try to google this, i get ads disguised as reviews.

&#x200B;

Thank you for you help.

&#x200B;

Edit- I just want to thank those who posted so informatively. There is a lot here to consider but just wanted to say thank you."	9	"['xamomax: Vacuum Wars is pretty good for reviews.  There are other worthy YouTube reviewers as well, though I don\'t know them off hand to recommend.\n\nMy past experience was with older gen Roombas which were not very smart, bounced around like drunks, but still got the job done.  The newer stuff from everyone is much better.   I now have a pair of Roborock SV Max Ultras which are about as expensive as it gets, but I really like them.  I bought mine on Black Friday for about $1K each, though they are normally about $1400 ish.  Price may come down with the S8 coming out, maybe, and the S8 may or may not be better, I don\'t know yet.\n\nMopping is adequate.  It does the job of removing the little drip dots that get on the floor in daily use.  I have not tried it for larger spills, but I expect it is better to handle those by hand.\n\nNavigation is quite good.  [I have mine hidden away in cupboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/10kdn6k/hidden_robot_dock_in_cabinetry/), and they find their way back to wash and charge there nicely.  Sometimes they will snag a loose cord, they like to ""hump"" my 1/2"" steel bars at the bottom of my coffee tables, and they are confused by floor to ceiling windows.  Luckily, it is reasonably easy to use the app to add ""no go zones"" in the problem areas, and then just touch up those spots by hand once in a while.\n\nThe auto-empty bins are really nice.  I get maybe 3 or 4 cleaning cycles on the water before I need to dump the gray water and refill the fresh water (about 1 liter).  It does require magic potion at an extra expense, which I think is there to keep mold away and maybe aid in cleaning a little.  Luckily a big bottle lasts a long time, since you only need a tiny bit per load.  The vacuum also auto-empties, and I have yet to have to service that, though my house is new and very low dust already.\n\nCleaning job is pretty good.  It seems to get everything I have needed it to do.\n\nThe software is very good.  It has a few very minor quirks and annoyances, but I have yet to feel frustrated or that I couldn\'t get it to do what I needed it to do.   The mapping is amazing, but if you are using the same robot for multiple floors, it can get a little confused in auto-detecting where it is if the floors look similar.\n\nIt can handle a 1/4"" threshold fine.  A 1/2"" threshold maybe sometimes.  I don\'t know how it will do with a sunken living room, other than you will have to probably just hand move it there like it is a separate floor.  I think it will do fine with that, even given the mapping auto-detect issue I mentioned earlier.\n\nIt has a ""cliff sensor"" which should prevent it from diving into the sunken area.  That will almost certainly work, but in the off chance it does not, you can just specify that as a ""no go"" area in the app.\n\nIt should be fine with baby stuff, as it does a pretty good job of navigating around shoes and toys and such.  It is not perfect, though, so does sometimes drag a shoelace or cord.  It has a special mode to be extra careful about detecting poo, which I have not tried since I don\'t have pets.  Many robots get stuck with hair tangles, which may still be an issue with the Roborock, but I have not yet had any issue other than a quick hair cleaning when servicing the water tanks.\n\nAlexa integration was pretty easy.  I just noticed them as new devices in the Alexa app.  This gives you the power to start and stop the robot and return home, but not to specify a specific zone to clean through Alexa.  However, through the app, you can specify it to clean only certain zones, which is nice if you have an entryway that tends to be needed to clean much more often than the rest of the area, and similar.\n\nI should also mention that for some hardwood / vinyl to carpet transitions it handles them very well, including the tassels of my India rug.  however, for one of my rugs it just pushes up the edge, which is kind of annoying, so I put a no-go zone there.  I suppose some carpet tape to hold it down might help.', ""Itchy-Ad1005: The sunken living room will be a problem unless there is a ramp down into it (assuming 3 inch or more drop).  After it maps the house i think it would treat the ramp as a hallway/doorway.  The other raised area could present a problem depending on the height With a sloped sill mine handles a 1 inch height difference.  Without the sill I don't know how largeba height difference it will handle.\n\nHow wide the ramo needs to be im not sure.  Guessing 1 1/2 to 2 times the bots width.  I also don't know the maximum slope any bot will handle   its not just being able to actually go up and down the slope but the at the top  going up and down the ramp triggering the cliff sensor before it tips down on to the ramp or upper floor.  Going down if its to steep it could hit the front bumper.  Also you'll need to babysit the bot until it leads to usebthe ramp.  Magnetic strips on the left and right edges of the ramp would probably be a good idea if bot recognizes them.  I'd probably mount them 1n inch from the edge."", 'Itchy-Ad1005: I agree on Vaccum Wars as a good reliable review site', 'LazyBox2303: I own two Roborocks, an S6 and S7. I do not have the S7 Max which has a camera to avoid things on the floor. It can be sent to the Baby’s room and show you how he is doing. You can even talk to him from another room or talk to the dog if he is doing something naughty, through the Roborock’s microphone. \n\nI recommend more than one if you don’t want to be around to have to pick the robot over the step. \n\nThe Roborock is reliable and has good mapping ability. Beginning with the S7 it is self emptying into a bag. \n\nRoborocks generally have far fewer problems with mapping and scheduling. Don’t look at Shark as you will find more complaints about them than the other robots. \n\nIt is marvelous to have these vacuums. They pick up the hair, fur, dust and debris from floors and rugs. If you have thick carpet, the Roomba is best for that. They can get under beds and high enough furniture. \n\nThey all need maintenance and cleaning after every run to keep them efficient and cleaning well. But that only takes five minutes, a small price to pay.', ""Scary_Lengthiness734: If budget isn't a primary concern, I'd say go with roborock S7 Max V Ultra.\n\nIf budget is a primary concern, a newer model from shark will do you fine. (please dm me which model so I can tell you yes or no, they have such a stupid naming convention that I can't be bothered to name all of them for you lol)\n\nMoving up in scale you can still go with Roborock, perhaps anywhere from the S5 lineup and upwards from there (S6, S7 etc).\n\nAlternatively you can go Roomba, about the same as roborock in quality and performance, however Roomba does do a bit better on carpet.\n\nOur house is mostly hardwood/tile floors (2 dogs) and our Sharks do a fantastic job keeping them clean. We'll help you make your decision, but just know that virtually all robots vacuums these days do a pretty good job on hard floors of any type. \n\nLastly, and this is an important consideration for everyone wanting a robot vacuum.\n\n1. Please please please do yourself a favor and make sure that whatever you buy comes with an auto empty base. And if you want something that mops, please please please do yourself a favor and make sure that the base station cleans the mop and drys the mop after every use (Roborock S7 Max V Ultra).\n\n2. Cameras on a robot vacuum? IF you have any concern whatsoever that your future pet may have an accident in the house while you're away, then a robot without a camera your robot WILL find that mess while you're away and it WILL then spread it everywhere. If it's at the start of the run, then get ready to see that accident spread throughout virtually every room in your house. If it's at the end of the run when it finds the mess, it won't be so bad, but it will still suck. Additionally, the robot is going to suck all of that into its guts and you'll have a terrible time cleaning it, and that's if the robot didn't already destroy itself in the process.\n\nPoint being, Roomba and Roborock are two reputable brands that have trained the AI recognition on their robots to detect animal accidents and avoid them.\n\nIf you don't have these concerns, then I'd tell you to go low. Like I said, I'm perfectly happy with our Sharks and they're easily attainable in the $200 -$350 range depending on where you buy them from. \n\nJust dm me if you'd like some more assistance"", 'MaxMadisonVi: Deebot X1 omni is simply the best of this kind of appliances check it out.

Xiaomi has a obstacle detection camera (I have a cat that sometimes leaves a surprise... Will it even detect that? Should I get Xiaomi because it's ""smarter""?).

I just discovered this subreddit today. I’m 28M trying to purchase my first robot vacuum. I’m overwhelmed by the number of choices (probably not surprising to anyone here) and would like some advice on the best model for me.

I currently rent one carpeted room in a house. I do not necessarily need the most sophisticated vacuum, as it does not need to mop, vacuum hardwood floors, or clean multiple rooms.

I’m looking for something that can vacuum the same path every day at the same time powered by an Amazon Alexa Echo Dot routine. Most of the options I look at use camera, LiDAR, etc. to map rooms automatically, but that seems like overkill for me. I’d like to create my own path manually and then have it run that exact path daily. 

I would also love for it to self-empty, but that’s not a dealbreaker.

Any suggestions?"	5	"[""bbabiuk: -Dreame z10 pro if you'd like to have obstacle avoidance\n\n-Dreame.d10 plus if you can live without obstacle avoidance\n\nDreame is good bang for your buck.  \n\nI also would recommend the Botslab by 360s8 plus.

1674991684.0	29-Jan-2023 03:28:04	Searching for a Robot Vacuum/Mop (with auto clean dock) for around 300/420 Euro's.	Skyrid3r	2	10o5lst	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/10o5lst/searching_for_a_robot_vacuummop_with_auto_clean/	"So for the  past week I've been searching for a Robot vacuum cleaner (with mop) and an auto clean dock for around 3 to 400 Euro's.. And it actually sucks making a proper choice. On [amazon.de](https://amazon.de) I found the following with quite a few nice vouchers:

\- Dreame D10 Pro  
\- Botslab S8 Plus  
\- Ultenic T10  
\- neabot Q11  
\- obode A8

I was hoping someone could help me out making a choice. I know the mopping wouldn't be 100% great, but it would be a nice addition to have for basic mopping. And the ability to have multi-floors within the app (so I can vacuum upstairs as well) is a must.  A front-camera would be a nice addition to avoid obstacles that would be in it's way, including the ability to go up obstacles which is about 2cm . We mostly have hard floors.

If there's anyone who could make suggestions to the above models and or other ones I don't know about, please let me know :D.

So what that means is that it only prevents you from scheduling your Shark robot vacuum to do a whole floor clean that intrudes into the Do Not Disturb time period but does not prevent you from ordering the Shark robot vacuum to clean by pressing the ""clean"" button on the Shark robot vacuum itself. So someone who isn\'t you or your cat might be pressing the ""clean"" button on the Shark robot vacuum.

It starts right on time at 9am, and it\'s likely just some communication issue/delay that causes Google to think something went wrong in starting the routine. \n\nAnd yeah that\'s the cool part about it -- by utilizing the ""try your own"" feature you\'re able to convert a spoken phrase into text form, and then schedule when to give google that command.

The first time it mapped my entire first floor as big area. The next two times, it mapped my kitchen, living room, and entry room as one big area. It only separated my bathroom as a different area. 

One of the reasons I got this specific vacuum was to be able to say, ""Alexa, vacuum the entry way,"" or ""Alexa, vacuum the kitchen.' obviously I can't do that if mapping isn't separating my areas.

This yeedi needs the lights on, which was something new to me. It\'s fine though, I have the smart lights turn on when it\'s scheduled to clean in the middle of the night.\n\nI need the vacuum to easily go over two cords (which the yeedi is doing perfectly. My roomba had a hard time with them.) Other than that, my floor is naturally picked up (no kids, no pets.)\n\nNone of these last 4 things are deal breakers or massive selling points. I need self emptying and mapping with a ~$350 budget. I have a hard time bending over so I don\'t want to have to bend over, pick up the vacuum, and empty the bin everyday.

So we\'ll have to go with a camera-based one, which really narrows the options.\n\nHowever, given your experience with Yeedi (you already know the app, etc) I\'d say the best thing would be to stay with Yeedi (as long as - aside from room splitting - your experience with your current bot was satisfactory).\n\nIn your case, even though it\'s slightly more expensive than your budget, the ideal solution is the successor of your current model, which is Yeedi Vac 2 Pro, plus the Yeedi Self-Emptying Station sold separately.\n\nThe Yeedi Vac 2 Pro is extremely similar to your model but with a few differences, which are: \n\n- it no longer has a floor tracking sensor (the large circular hole you see on the bottom of your bot, opposite side to the side brush)\n\n- it has a new mopping module that actively ""scrubs"" the floor by vibrating the mop pad\n\n- it has a new front laser 3D sensor that helps with obstacle avoidance (can be enabled/disabled in the app, so if you see in case when it\'s enabled the robot is too much ""careful"" and misses some spots, then you can disable it and it should behave the same as your current bot)\n\n- it has a few new software features in the app (make sure you update the firmware first thing after you configure it in the app), most notably multi-floor support (so you can save the map of multiple house levels, up to 3 if I remember correctly) and **editable rooms** (you can manually split/merge rooms in case the bot doesn\'t automatically get them right)\n\nAside from the above, everything else is 99% the same as your current bot.\n\nThe self-emptying station that is sold separately for the Vac 2 Pro, is the exact same model that you have for your current vacuum.\n\nThe RRP for the Yeedi Vac 2 Pro is $449, and for the optional self-emptying station $199 (tot. $650).\n\nHowever, the bot is currently on sale on the Yeedi website, *bundled with the self-emptying station*, for $440: https://www.yeedi.com/products/yeedi-vac-2-pro?variant=42771588415645\n\nThere are other options for a lower price, but their quality is awful. \n\nA few other options with similar/better quality do exist within your budget ($350), but require you to sacrifice the max 3.75"" height requirement as they\'re all laser-based.\n\nAmong those, the first choice would be Dreame D10 Plus: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VKZT1FQ (96.3mm, ~3.79"" tall, RRP $399 but currently available with a $50 off coupon, so tot. $350 as per your budget).\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit:\n\n> ldeally, l\'d be able to say, ""Alexa, vacuum the entry way."" She\'d vacuum the entry way and then go back to the base.\n\nThis (voice commands for room-level cleaning) unfortunately I believe is not available for any of the robots within or slightly above your budget.

Then on desperation I re-setup the old 2.4 router to see if I could get them to reconnect.  And yes, no luck.

Maybe that might work since I know the robots have had a number of firmware upgrades, but I never had to re-setup with the WiFi, right?  Well, that worked.  Then I got to thinking I wonder if one of the issues isn't just the 2.4, but maybe it didn't like the SSID of the updated mesh setup.  So I switched the SSID of the old system to the new one and the sharks wouldn't connect.  The principal difference between the SSID names was the factory default on the old router was 1 word.  I used 2 words, including a space, in the new setup (on both the new and the old router).  So then I just changed the name on the old 2.4 router to 1 word.  All 3 then connected easy peasy to the old 2.4 router.  then I turned them all off, disconnected the old router and re-setup the mesh using the same exact SSID and password.  Turned the sharks back on, and they immediately connected to the mesh system.  So from what I can gather, at least the older models I have don't just limit their setup dislike to multiband systems, they also don't like SSIDs that use multiple words ( most likely they don't like spaces in SSID names, and I didn't use any special characters so no idea if that could present an issue).

\-Mopping is not crucial as my house gets cleaned professionally once per month.  This is for the interim maintenance.

\-I have no pets.

\-I'd ideally like self emptying.

\-I tend to run at night on the main floor so I don't actually have a sense of how well the irobots do in the dark.

\-I have a mix of hard wood and area rugs.

I’ve cleaned it, I’ve replaced parts and even stuck our dryer cleaner brush up the hole to the other side and there is no obstruction. Even took the vacuum apart and cleaned there. I’m wondering if anyone else has had this issue? Or if my base is just pissed I moved it from one side of my living room to the other.	2	['FlashyCow1: Maybe replace any airliners.

I've also read the app doesn't work on Android 13 and the app doesn't look to have been updated in a while.

Is it better to go for something like the 360 S8 that has only 2700pa, a smaller battery for £60 more but more reliable customer service and app.

Personally I'd pass on mopping for a while since I'm not sure its there yet. The only one I might consider is that expensive Deborah with the multiple water tanks.  I personally prefer bagless because it saves me money because I don't have to buy and stock bags.  Also when they stop making bags for your model you have to go out and buy a new bot.  Over the years I've seen to many examples of that planned obsolescence.\n\nOne thing to consider thats not obvious at first is the height of the bot.

That video seems to show it had no problem even with long pet hair, and the guy seemed happy, however in the few review videos I was able to find none where they showed or talked about if the roller gets clogged up periodically with long hair. Another thing about the bin is that for long pet hair, it may fill faster than you expect and cause you to empty it far more often OR, you may not have that issue at all.\n\nCarpet:\nPet hair on carpet + robot vacuums, are like cats and dogs -- eternal enemies lol. They all do great on hardwood, then they all start to fall off to varying degrees when it comes to carpet because not all pet hair and not all carpets are created equally. Roomba is probably the best scoring brand when it comes to it\'s ability to clean carpet. Then, it\'s a gradual decline on carpet performance as you run across the competing brands in their price bracket. This vac has pet in the name, so one can assume that good results at picking up pet hair was one of the primary design influences. It may do alright on carpet, it may do porky on carpet. Generally, unless it\'s a Roomba or something very similar like a Roborock, I automatically assume that the vac will perform ""just ok"" on carpet. They aren\'t quite there yet to stack up against an upright vacuum on carpet. Soon, but not yet.\n\nI\'ll be honest with you, these days I really can\'t recommend a robot vacuum without an auto empty dock. To me it\'s like selling you a new car, but without any tires. Not the best example, but I think you catch my meaning.\n\nMy entire life is focused around saving as much as time as possible when it comes to things I do not enjoy doing -- vacuuming happens to be on that list. My house is too big and has too many floors for us to continue vacuuming and sweeping almost every day just to keep up with the dogs. \n\nHow does this matter to you? Well, I haven\'t had to vacuum or sweep our hardwood/tile floors once since we got ours. I mean it, not once. Once a week I\'ll walk around with the upright vacuum to hit the corners and baseboards, but I\'m completely done in 3 minutes and that\'s all I have to do. The floors are immaculate and I can confidently walk around the house barefoot without risking stepping on dog cookie crumbs that blend perfectly with my hardwood floors lol. We don\'t have one upstairs where all the carpet is -- thankfully the dogs spend most of their time on the lower floors so we can still get away with vacuuming once a week upstairs. Not sure yet about how mine would do on carpet, but I might get another one just to see because we really are pleased with ours on the lower levels.\n\nVacs without an auto empty dock require you to be in the loop much more than for those with one. These things were designed to alleviate us from having to do these chores anymore, and having to empty the tiny bin on the robot multiple times per week is just something I\'m completely disinterested in doing. I want to forget about it for weeks on end, and I do thanks to the auto empty. If you\'re fine with emptying the bin on the robot every day or every other day, then by all means I want you to buy this vacuum because I understand what a nuisance it can be when you just want to come home to a clean house.\n\nI\'m not trying to talk you out of this one, just want you to be up to speed when you make your decision.\n\nI\'m seriously happy with my Shark UR2500SR, and my Shark RV2502AE (30 and 60 day bin, respectively).\n\nThey are within your price range if:\n\n-you find a sale\n\nOr\n\n-you\'re okay with going refurbished\n\nAmazon frequently has both models in stock as refurbished (about $250-400 depending on the model). Both of them will have a bunch of cool features that I\'m sure you\'ll enjoy. I\'m completely hands off with mine -- I empty it once or twice a week (can go much longer) and that\'s it. Once a month they get put on the counter and cleaned, and I\'m DONE lol.\n\nMine looked brand new, and probably was, but because it was a return they couldn\'t sell it as new again. They come with a 90 day warranty, but I slapped a 3 year parts warranty on it for like 30-40 bucks at checkout and I haven\'t regretted it once. It may not cover absolutely everything, but ebay is littered with spare parts if I want to go down that route.\n\nI know this was long, but hope it helped somehow. Lemme know if I can clarify anything for you.']"

JoshBob81	2	10hqwjx	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/10hqwjx/after_market_rubber_roller_for_cheap_midrange/	"I'm still on a mission to decide which brand and model of robot vacuum cleaner I want to buy. 

My home is made up of hardwood floors and tiles (2 story house - 270 sqm in total).No carpet in the house.

I do however have long shedding human hair to worry about. This is probably the most difficult factor for me in deciding which robot vacuum to buy. I've noticed that only very few models have a rubber roller (without any bristles). Apparently the rubber roller is much more forgiving and effective with long shedding hair.

It seems that there are only a few top end robots which have an all rubber roller.(i.e. Roborock s7, irobot Roomba and Dreame L10s models). These are top end and are quite expensive.

There seems to be a lot of robot vacuums that are in the middle range, but all of these use a bristle roller or a combination rubber with bristles.

I'm not sure if it's as simple as I am imagining but, I was wondering if anybody has bought a cheaper/midge-range robot vacuum and then was able to acquire an replacement roller that was an all-rubber one (without the bristles).

Perhaps an aftermarket roller?"	4	"[""Scary_Lengthiness734: That's an interesting thought. \n\nI just did a search to see if anything came up for my two Shark vacs, but didn't see anything.\n\nIt's a good idea, I wouldn't mind the ability to swap out different roller brushes if they functioned differently.\n\nUnfortunately, I bet that it's somewhere in the realm of 1 in every 10,000 robot vac owners who ask these questions. Basically meaning little incentive to sell that sort of thing. Still a great idea tho."", 'JoshBob81: Still pondering and researching this. In my searches, I came across the Hobot Legee 7, which is a vacuum mop combination, and regarding long human hair, one of the design features is a vacuum without any roller at all.\n\nThere are two factors holding me back from buying it, however:\n1. It didn\'t get a very good score on ProductReview.com.au. Whilst ""on paper"", as per marketing material, it\'s really good for my needs, people reported a lot of issues, and I am getting the impression it\'s not very reliable.\n2. It\'s not sold my many retailers, and there doesn\'t appear to me much material online about it, in particular on youtube, and also it\'s not mentioned at all on the Vacuum Wars website. I get the impression this brand/model isn\'t a major player (but I could be wrong).\n\nAre there any models of robot vacuums (I.e. Roborock, Kogan, iRoomba, Eufy, etc, etc) that enable operation with the main roller brush after it\'s been removed? I know a lot of models allow for easy removal of the main brush (for cleaning and replacing), but can the robot operate without the roller brush re-inserted?\n\nI am guessing the robot will throw an error message and cease to operate if the main roller hasn\'t been re-inserted? Has anyone tried this?', ""ZipGuy17: Long haired dude here , I also got myself my first robovac from Xiaomi, mop pro 2. Imo it's really easy to clean . You just need a Philips screwdriver for the side brush if some  hair gets stuck and that's it. The brush itself is  a mix of rubber and bristle brush, it has some clips on the sides when you turn them they pop out and you can take out all the hair that gets stuck there which is genius, never sew anything like this and allways just had to leave those hairs on my previous vacuums."", ""JoshBob81: It's good that you can remove the roller as you described but, if you take a look at the claimed advantages of the top end robots which have rollers without any bristles at all, they claim to actually extract long hair a lot better without getting tangled as often, which is a really good thing.\n\nAfter researching far and wide there appears to be a common consensus that roller only brushes are definitely best for dealing with long hair.\n\nI'm really interested to know if anyone has gone to the extent of finding an aftermarket all rubber roller brush for their mid-range robot vacuum cleaner. And if so, managed to get it to work and have noticed an improvement simply by replacing the roller?\n\nPerhaps no one is manufacturing aftermarket all-rubber roller brushes? I tried to find some online sellers but from my search I wasn't able to find any however I'm not sure if I'm looking in the wrong places.""]"

We have a Yeedi K650, about a year-and-a-half old. It runs for about a minute, and then stops, giving me a ""main brush is tangled"" error message.

I've cleaned out the main brush multiple times; there's nothing tangled in it. I also removed the main brush, and cleaned out the places where it connects to the vacuum. I even tried replacing it with a new main brush, and it's still giving me that message. I also cleaned and dusted the vacuum thoroughly, and I replaced the two side brushes, in case those were causing issues.

It seems to work better on laminate flooring, but if I try to run it on carpet, it just gives me the error. It also works if I take the main brush out entirely, but I can't imagine it's sucking up all that much.

Also of note: When it goes in a straight line, after a few seconds the side brushes stop running, before starting again once the robot hits the wall. I have no idea what's going on there, but like I said, I tried replacing the side brushes, and the issue persists.

Additional information: This is actually the *second* Yedi K650 this has happened to.

My previous robovac has just died (Neato D7 Connected, it vacuumed a pool of water) and I'm looking to buy a new one.

The Roomba S9+ is available for 999€ where I am, and the Neato D10 is also down to 419€.

I could buy two D10's for the price of one S9+ so I'm finding the price difficult to justify, but is one objectively better than the other?

Or should I be looking at other models? I picked these two because they seem to be the latest, top release of both brands.

We have multiple floors so we need multiple vacs, but I can tell you that the cheaper Sharks that I have (rv2502ae & ur2500sr) do a very good job on my hardwood floors and I wouldn't dream of spending a grand a robot that just vacuums. For a grand I was able to put a vac on every floor of my house, where as it would have cost me 3 grand to do that with Roomba and had the same, if not very similar, results. \n\nIdk which models it applies to, but roomba has a warranty that if your robot runs over dog shit they'll replace it within the first year of purchase. Something like that anyway. They're designed to avoid running that stuff over.\n\nI'm sorry, but I just can't recommend that you spend that much on a robot vacuum unless it's a Roborock S7 Max V Ultra, or the new S8 that launches later this year."", 'spree01: S8+ comes out soon as well!', ""HeIsLost: That's right, I have no pets, my flooring is the fake wood stuff (laminate?), and it's a flat so only 1 floor. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAre the S7 and S8 supposed to be better than the S9+? That's a confusing naming convention. I quite liked the idea of D-shaped robot, feels like that works better than a round robot specially for corners?"", 'Scary_Lengthiness734: I really should get paid for this lol\n\n\nOkay so,\n\nRoborock has similar names to the Roomba. What the logic was behind choosing a name almost exactly like their competition.. you got me bud.\n\nRoborock has the S6, S7 and now the S8 in just a few months. It will be marginally better than the S7, however for your specific needs as it concerns no pets, carpet etc etc, the S7 will have you tickled pink.\n\nRoomba I believe has the S7 and S9, but no S8. You still with me lol? Both are very good, they just lack functionality for the price you\'re paying compared to their competitors.\n\n---------------------------\n\nOne floor, no pets, and it sounds like no carpet as well?\n\nIf no carpet, then you\'re going to be pleased with whichever option you go with. My Sharks do absolutely excellent on my hardwood floors, and Shark is basically the cheapest option I would recommend to anyone.\n\nRoomba seems to score better on carpet, but you can write that one off because no carpet. The Roomba and Neato WILL do better in corners than Roborock because of the D shaped design. With that being said, while the robots are really close to getting to 100%, none of them will completely remove you from vacuuming/mopping. Whether that\'s still once a week, or two or three weeks up to you. I haven\'t had to vacuum the floors once since I\'ve got mine, but I still walk around once a week just to get the corners and the baseboards, and I\'m usually done in about 3 minutes now lol.\n\nSide brushes do assit the round robots with corners, so if you get a round one it\'s not that your corners will be entirely unswept. I have a dog who leaves cookie crumbs all around the house. I find a very tiny amount of either dog hair or cookie crumbs in the corners, but it does get most of what\'s in the corners. The D shape is only really advantageous in corners, nowhere else.\n\nNow here\'s the deal, if you\'re willing to spend a grand, then I strongly suggest you buy the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra as opposed to the S9 from Roomba. Don\'t even give Rooma a second thought if you\'re gonna spend that much.\n\nNot only will the S7 vacuum your floors, it\'ll also mop them, clean the mop, refill the water tank on robot so it\'s ready to go all week, drys the mop head if you buy the drying attachment (worth every penny), where as the Roomba will only vacuum. Roomba has a mopping robot too, but I still recommend against it. It does great in all reviews, but it doesn\'t clean the mop and that is why the roborock wins every time. These things were made to remove you as much as possible from floor care, and only the roborock gets close to that. There are other offerings who have the mop cleaning feature, like one from Deebot called the Omni? It does well, but people seem to like their roborock\'s better because of the features it has. There are a few other brands launching this feature as well that just now got announced, but we have to wait a while.\n\nThe other vacuum you named on this list is something I\'m not familiar with. Watch some YouTube reviews, preferably several and see what you think.\n\nI\'d say it\'s a safe bet tho. And if you only want it to vacuum and not mop, then like I said before, my shark is very likely comparable to the Neato as far as performance. I\'m sure you\'ll be happy with it.\n\nSo, if you just want it to vacuum, the Neato will do you fine, as will a Shark, or even a highly discounted Rooma or Roborock ($500 or less). Paying more than that is just paying an unnecessary expense when cheaper options perform similar if not the same on hardwood floors.\n\nIf you want it to mop and take you out of the picture as much as possible, then look no further than Roborock.\n\nI\'d suggest going to their websites, they\'ll give you a good breakdown on the differences between models.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7Zduy_GdD4w Roborock review \nhttps://youtu.be/3YYr-q5rNLM Roomba review\n\nOn YouTube, type the name of the robot and then vacuum wars. He does good work and may have a review of the ones you\'re looking at. I\'ve provided you two links above to reviews on his channel.\n\nExample: ""Neato (insert model) vacuum wars""\n\nHope this helps, lemme know if I can clarify anything for you', ""HeIsLost: Wew, thanks for the detailed answer!\n\nHave watched the videos, and indeed the S9+ just does not seem to be worth it compared to the S7V Ultra, specially for that price. \n\nBut the S7V Ultra is about 1500€ over here, and both do seem quite expensive when my basic needs are just a  vacuum (for now).\n\nStrangely I couldn't find any Vacuum Wars video for the Neato D10 though. But the majority of reviews on Reddit seem to be painting a very negative image of the D10, and claim the D7 Connected was the last good model... which just happens to be the one I unfortunately lost to a pool of water. :/ \n\nOh well. Perhaps I'll wait until robo vacuums are a bit more democratized and their prices have gone down a bit before getting a new one. :)"", ""Scary_Lengthiness734: No problem! 😁\n\nYeah it's a bit cost prohibitive and that's why I didn't go with all S7's because it's approaching 5 grand just to put one on every floor of my house with added drying modules for each. \n\nRight now I can pick one up for $1300 new here, and a little lower if I wanna risk a shady purchase with potentially no warranty. \n\n1500 is a bit excessive I'm not gonna lie, and if you're really only wanting vacuuming then with the S7 Ultra or S9+ you'd be bringing a tank to a knife fight. \nBUT.... You'd be in a tank, so lol\n\nUnfortunate he didn't have a review for your Neato. The reality is that there really are a lot of RV's on the market and idk if it's simply a factor of cost, or what, that determines which vacuums he tests and which he doesn't. I'm sure there's someone with a video review of the D10 tho.\n\nAn alternative to your Neato that I can maybe recommend to you is perhaps something from Shark? I was afraid making my first purchase from them because I've seen people just losing their shit in the comments here about their experience with theirs 😆. \n\nI've had mine 3 weeks now, which granted isn't a lot of time, but I love it man. From what I can gather, the people saying stay away from shark seem to be restricted to just their older models which use VSLAM instead of Lidar. The people I've interacted with on here that have the same models as I do seem to love theirs as well and are having no issues whatsoever.\n\nTwo models:\n\nShark RV2502AE 60 day bin\nShark UR2500SR 30 day bin\n\nYou can find these all over, but Amazon appears to have the best deals on them. Go to Amazon, refine the search department for renewed, then just type model number in and see if they have any in stock. I got my renewed UR2500 for $250 from Amazon then added a 3 year warranty at checkout for like $30. Look around tho, there may be another online retailer in your region with a better price. \n\nDirect from shark is gonna be in the 400-600 range depending on the time of year. Amazon you can find them new anywhere from $350-$450. If you're interested and want to make sure you're getting the right thing, just message me here or privately and I'll help you out.\n\nIf the vacuum continues on over the next few months to a year without issue, then this damn thing has been worth every penny.

Kogan SmartHome™ LX16 Robot Vacuum Cleaner and Mop https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/kogan-smarthome-lx16-robot-vacuum-cleaner-and-mop-kogan?utm_source=kogan&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=android-productdetail-share

I did a search on YouTube and reddit it to see if anyone had any reviews or there was any discussion about this particular model but I couldn't find anything.

This is quite a cheap robot vacuum cleaner so I'm interested to know if anyone has had any experience with it.

I'm wondering what the pros and cons are and if it's been improved from the previous models (Kogan LX10 and LX15).

One of the deal breakers with this robot is the traditional bristle roller brush. My home is hardwood floors and tiles. There is no carpet. However I have a lot of long hair in my house (female hair is very long - i.e. 15cm - 30cm long).

I am wondering if anyone has been able to replace the original roller with an aftermarket all-rubber roller (without bristles)?"	8	"['kiwibloke: I have one of these (its my first robot vacuum cleaner).\n\nI\'ve found it to be very good, it mapped my house quickly and generates good paths and cleans well.

The machine appears nearly new.  It connects up fine and works perfectly for five minutes.  It then will stop and give the error message:

“Something went wrong
There's a problem with the object recognition sensor. Turn the power off and then on again. If the error persists, contact Customer Service.”

If restarted it will last another minute then give the error “There's a problem with the Al system.”

It will restart and give the same error message in a minute or two. 

The robot is clean, the sensor windows are clean. I’m thinking a problem with the motherboard or software. I can’t find anyway to reset or reinstall the software on the robot. I suspect it’s a motherboard problem. There are none available as far as I can determine.  Any suggestions for a fix?  Anyone had anything similar happen?

I suspect my best course is to wait until a broken unit is available and swap the motherboard, but any suggestions would be appreciated."	1	['Grapefruit-Spirited: Update and partial work around:  I found that the error message will not occur if the robot is in “monitor” mode, ie you can view through the camera on your phone and direct the robot.  I tried starting the robot on a cleaning job and then immediately switching over to monitoring.  My phone will show me the robot merrily cleaning and for some unknown reason will not produce the AI error messages. \n\nThe problem with this is that if I switch away from monitoring on the phone a few moments later the error message will occur and the robot stops.  Indeed, if my phone even blanks the screen due to lack of movement or auto timeout the robot announces “monitoring has ended.  Camera is off” or something similar and faults shortly thereafter.  So I have a vacuum that demands to be watched or won’t work…\n\nI’ve set my iPhone screen to stay on and the robot happily cleans away in the belief that I’m watching it.  \n\nA rather silly workaround but at least now I have a $1300 robot that I bought broken for $85, that cleans my house very well.  I just can’t use my iPhone while cleaning.  \n\nWaiting for a universal firmware update from Samsung or a replacement motherboard from a broken unit to fix the issue.  After reading in multiple forums about the way Samsung treats it’s customers I’m not holding out much hope for the first solution.  The software implementation through “smart things” on this machine is primitive and lazy, and shows an astonishing lack of interest in the customer.']

Both vacuums are on sale at Walmart with about $100 difference. To me, the hundred dollar jump is worth it for bin and mop (even if it’s mediocre).

I’ve heard great things about Wyze, and 50/50 on the t8+. Obviously they are very different prices when not on sale so there are no direct comparisons online.

These are the ones I am interested in:
- Rockrock S7 Maxv
- Dreame L10S Ultra

After doing the research, in particular YouTube video reviews, there is one scenario which I have not scene or mentioned in any of the reviews.

Since I have a two-story house, I'm intending to map both levels and I want the robot vacuum cleaner to operate on both levels.

I understand the robot vacuum will need to be lifted and carried to the upper level as obviously it cannot climb a staircase.

After allowing the robot to map both levels in the house, before cleaning operation starts I'm intending to relocate the docking station to the level which I intend to clean. I may do this several times per week.

Note: The need to relocate the auto empty dock to the upper level during a clean would be particularly necessary if I was to purchase the ""Dreame L10S Ultra"", as this particular model relies on the auto empty dock to clean its mopping pads several times during a mopping job. In fact it can be configured to clean after every 10 m² of mopping, which is a pretty good feature in my opinion.

1. Will relocating the dock confuse the robot in any way? 
2. Will it invalidate the mapping?"	7	"[""sparkyblaster: Don't bother moving the dock unless your house is too big for one run.

Making it so you have to manually move the thing multiple times per week completely negates that...  If you have to attend to them all the time, you might as well just buy two cheaper non-auto-empty bots for the same price at that point."", 'JoshBob81: The house is 180sqm on the ground level, and 110sqm on the upper level.', 'JoshBob81: 1.

The M7 has been discontinued as the M8 has just come out; I picked it up for about 220€ on sale a few months ago.

I'm overall very pleased with my purchase. It's reduced my regular vacuuming significantly and has made such a big difference in the amount of dog hair floating around my apartment. It does need a bit of supervision but it's very manageable. Details below!

Pros:

* Mapping. It's my first robot vac with this function so I may be easily impressed, but I'm thrilled with it. It made a map of my whole apartment, and I can set up zones and tell it to clean one place or room at a time. It doesn't go where I tell it not to go. It's luxury!
* It climbs over small obstacles. This was important to me because I have furniture with bench legs that are about 1-1.5 cm high and round, and it climbs over them easily.
* 2700 Pa of suction on powerful mode. From what I understand, this is bit higher than average at this price point, which is why I picked it because I have a big dog with short, stiff hair and a few flat-weave synthetic rugs. It's AMAZING at pulling up the dog hair on both the hardwood AND the rugs. I've been pleased and surprised by this. It's also pretty good at getting into corners and such.
* Option to buy a self-emptying station for about 100€ extra. Another reason I picked it thinking I might add it on later, but honestly the dust bin is so easy to take out and clean I probably won't bother.
* Gets itself unstuck very well. I almost never have to intervene when it's cleaning, I just put it on and don't think about it, which is also luxury. When there is an issue it will tell you exactly what is wrong (it talks to you, which I think is hilarious).
* It mops surprisingly well, and you can add a bit of floor cleaner to the tank. I wasn't expecting anything from the mopping when I bought it, but it's actually good, and easy to clean the mop cloth. It came with some disposable pads but I've yet to figure out how to use them haha.
* The build feels pretty solid, all the attachments are easy to put on and take off without flipping the vacuum over like I had to do with my old, dumb robot vac. It's also really easy to remove the main brush/rubber flap thing for cleaning.

Cons:

* It's pretty loud. Nowhere near my regular vacuum but still quite loud. The suction is loud, and it navigates by laser and with a front bumper so it's also loud bumping into walls and such as it goes.
* It climbs rather aggressively, which is great for the bench legs on my couch but it will sometimes try to climb the transition into my kitchen which is at least 3cm and it gets itself stuck halfway up. I have a table with bench legs about 2cm high and it also climbs but gets stuck. And it's super loud trying to get itself unstuck until it gives up and pings you to come fix it. It's loud when it's climbing even successfully, actually.
* It only has one mopping function and you can't set up zones and tell it to mop only one room like you can with vacuuming.
* The water tank for mopping is pretty small; it takes about 1.5 tanks for my 60m2 apartment.
* You can only set up a max of 5 restricted zones.
* Maybe 5% of the time it gets a little lost i.e. can't find it's way home, or gets confused by obstacles that are too close together and can't get around them even if there is enough room.
* The app is not terribly intuitive, and it can be a bit buggy, especially when setting up zones. If you're a Luddite, don't buy this vac, but if you're reading this on reddit you probably aren't."	0	[]

Better price point and a higher suction power. Oh and it's great for dog hair which is our main use for it.""]"
1673387430.0	10-Jan-2023 13:50:30	This is a serious question -- Is there a Robovac that doesn't suck? As in, it works consistently.	Famous-Ebb5617	4	108m4pg	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/108m4pg/this_is_a_serious_question_is_there_a_robovac/	"I'm a believer in Robovacs and I desperately want to find one that works. But I have had terrible luck so far. 

First I had a Neato D7. It was awful. It constantly had issues with mapping, had a sensor malfunction, and it never ended up working as I wanted it to. I ended up getting it repaired under warranty, and it had issues again with mapping and just randomly stopping during jobs and saying it was done or saying sensors were dirty or something. Then Neato made a new app that only supported the latest devices and abandoned the old one. I eventually just stopped using it because the issues were not worth the time. 

So, I replaced it with an ECOVACS N8+ last year. It has a pretty good app (way better than the Neato app) and physically the device felt like it was built better. Well, the auto-empty bin flat out doesn't work because of a design flaw (this is well documented). Not a big deal because I probably wouldn't have used it as I don't want to buy proprietary bags. But what is a big deal, is that the vacuum just doesn't really work. It constantly has issues following the map and always needs to re-map the house. It stops in the middle of jobs for no reason or again, has issues with sensors. 

So......the point of this post is this: Is there a high-quality robovac that will just work consistently without me haven't to constantly reset it, re-map, and just overall spend time getting the thing to work? I don't trust reviewers anymore because the 2 robovacs I have bought are highly rated so I'm looking for opinions from non-reviewers."	20	"['TbonerT: Another vote for Roborock. I have an S4 Max. It works very well and never gives me problems.', 'AlwaysWanderOfficial: Roborock q5 plus has been flawless for me. Only issue has been my fault.

I got them on sale for Black Friday and I have only used them for 2 months. My impression is they are a notch above my older Roombas in terms of quality and performance.\n\nI like the build quality, software, and mapping.  I love the auto docking and auto clean and empty feature, and that they find their way back to my fairly hidden dock location under my cabinets (where I removed the toe kick and installed power just for them).\n\nI don\'t like that they still get stuck on the low ledges of my floor to ceiling windows, and the 1/2 inch metal bars at the bottom of my coffee tables, where they hump them like a dog.  They otherwise have excellent object avoidance, but sometimes get confused by wires and shoe laces.   (Though I can manually edit the map to set no go zones)\n\nI don\'t like that it requires special soap for the water, but I was happy to see that it barely uses any so the bottle should last a year or so.\n\nSo far, it has been fine for hair, but we don\'t have pets.\n\nMapping is quite good, but it does get confused if you use the same robot on 2 floors.  It is supposed to in theory auto recognize what floor it is on, but in my house it gets it wrong and ends up overwriting the wrong map, and there is no way to say, ""hey, use this map"".  Also, if you use it on a second floor, it does not have the ability to automatically return to base to clean its mop.  So my recommendation is one robot per floor.\n\nOverall, I give them 4 out of 5 stars, and feel like I made a good purchase for my needs.\n\nDefinitely avoid the Roomba Bravajet, as it just smears the dirt on your floor around, and is barely useful.

The higher the number (roborock 6, 7, etc etc) the newer that model is. You can also buy the S7 maxv with just the auto empty base (no mopping refill base) if that fits what you want better.

You don\'t have to hover over it, just keep yourself nearby so that every so often you can come inspect it\'s progress. Design your test however you want to do it, but I\'d recommend that you send the robot out to do the whole house (just mopping) several times, and observing each time, and each room. Might take you a day or two, but if you see nothing, then you\'re golden bro.\n\n• If it\'s user error, then the 1st place you\'re gonna wanna check is whether the mop is attached properly. It just squirts water onto the backside of the pad and the water then wicks it\'s way through the pad, dampening it. Nowhere should you see water puddles left behind -- the only thing you should see are the residual streaks (which quickly dry and vanish) that you see left behind just as if you were using any other mop.\n\nIF you do see a small amount of water on the floor, dry it up, allow the vac to finish it\'s job (dry up any other spots if any), open the app and lower the water dispersal rate, repeat test and see if that resolves the issue.\n\nAfter that you\'re probably looking at hardware, which means you\'re gonna have to return it or get sent some new replacement stuff.\n\nBeyond that tho, unless a floorcare specialist/installer that you trust tells you in no uncertain terms ""This will ruin your floors"", you\'re good to go. \n\nBut since I imagine that your shiny new floors have been sealed, then this vac is no different than using the mop that\'s likely recommended in your floor\'s care instructions, and your floor guy is gonna have to explain to you how this robot mop is somehow extraordinarily different than using a standard mop (it\'s not).\n\nNote: If your care instructions say that your floors should be mopped no more than x times per week, month, then your robo mop should not exceed that number.\n\nAlso, you can set it up to only mop when you\'re home if that makes you comfortable, and I\'d bet there\'s an easy way to be notified on your phone, or smart home devices, that will annouce when the robot has finished mopping so that you can at least have a little more peace of mind while you\'re running it through the paces and can easily go check when it\'s done.\n\nOne last thing -- you got brand new floors man and idk if you have pets, but whatever you end up with just make sure that it has a camera on it. iRobot has some kind of warranty that if it runs over dog shit in your house within the first year, they\'ll replace the unit for you. Roborock and iRobot (possibly other brands) are the main ones as far as AI vision goes -- and they\'re the best performing when it comes to avoiding things like that. It\'s not 100% yet, but you\'re far better off with a camera onboard then not. I can already see the look on your face walking in the door and discovering that your spendy new robot has just spent the last two hours successfully spreading it to every room in your house lol.\n\nIf you have multiple floors I recommend one for each level. Some users have reported slight but annoying issues when ferrying it from floor to floor, aka the robot might do some stupid stuff it otherwise wouldn\'t. You\'re buying these things to save you time and labor -- babysitting one as you move it through multiple floors is not ideal.\n\nMy house has 4 levels and I\'ll be damned if I\'m gonna ferry that thing from floor to floor.', ""654456: That is correct. Because how they have the tank mounted it will not self-empty with the mop dustbin attached. It even charges facing the other direction. They may be able release another dust. Bin to change this if they change how the tank is mounted. Right now it just is mounted to the back of the regular dust bin. \n\nI knew this before buying it, I still wanted the mop option but my house doesn't have enough hard floors to need to mop everyday and I can Swiffer my hard floors in about 10 minutes total. I usually run the mop when the bin needs emptied. You also have to factor that most mopping vacuums you still have to do a lot of manual work or the pad will reek and be dragged over carpet until you get to the top of the line roborock. \n\nIf you have a bigger house of all hard floors the shark is not the vacuum for you. If you are mostly carpet and value not having bags or a camera on your vacuum which did matter to me then it has been solid for me."", 'Scary_Lengthiness734: Not all hardwood floors are alike, some are softer and more suspectable to abrasion.\n\nProvided your floors are properly sealed and maintained, the impact to your floors should be no different than if you hand mopped on a similar frequency.', 'Leading_Release_4344: Yeah I know you still have to clean the mop, but still that’s kind of an irritating design decision', ""654456: It's for sure an after though.

* Under 300€
* Better from Amazon (Italy)

* I have a long hair cat
* Would be nice if I could easly find replacements around the web (filters, brushes and so on), even on Aliexpress
* LiDAR mapping would be nice
* Not interested dust bin (well, in this price range.. :D)

Now, I am inclined to return the J7+ (vacuum only) and get the j7+ combo or I can keep the J7+ (vacuum only) and get the M6.

Questions:

**1) Is J7+ (vacuum only) and M6 better or J7+ Combo (vacuum and mop) better? I see that the Combo has obstacle avoidance and the M6 does not, so is the Combo better for mopping?**

2) **Is J7+ Combo (vacuum and mop) the best robot to vacuum and mop for now? I've also considered Roborock, but I've heard that Roomba has better cleaning power and better app in the United States.**

**3) Should I consider buying Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum and Mop (or another brand) for a better vacuuming and mopping experience?**

I have the Coredy R750 and the Roomba i3 evo 3150.\nThe coredy is nice for the price. It has a dust bin that it comes with that collects dust and I can swap it out for a water tank with a little mop thing that it drags along while dripping a little water (i put cleaning solution in it too) It seems to bump into things way less than the Roomba does. The thing about the coredy is the mop just drags a dirty cloth across the floor after a while. I can clean it, but I\'m bending down and cleaning it multiple times in the clean cycle or risking it just not doing an awesome job. The roomba has the self empty bin. I love that about it. I haven\'t had to empty that yet. I usually run both at the same time and block odd areas. They both have battles and will crash into each others\' bases making them have trouble finding home. I\'ve set roomba not to go near cordey\'s home and got magnetic straps i am gonna use so cord3y doesn\'t go near roomba\'s base. Roomba has more map features than cordey. But they both seem dumb. They clean the house, sure but there\'s no rhyme or reason to their movements. They move so haphazardly that it\'s just luck that they get the dirt. \n\nI haven\'t used my Narwal Freo at that big house yet. I\'ve only used it at my mom\'s place. Things I noticed the second I used it. The mapping feature is so fast. It goes into a room and scans it. It\'s not making the map by going around the entire outline of the room. It moves on a pattern. I know where it\'s going next. It shows live where it is on the map and knows where the base is. I can pick it up and put it down somewhere else and it knows where it is on the map. I can make my own names for rooms. I can set no go zones. I have carpets and I can actually let it go on them as it raises the mop. It actually mops the floor. I don\'t need to use cordey\'s mop feature anymore. \n\nI was watching it go near my brother\'s room door and prayed it wouldn\'t bang into his door while he slept. It did bang into a stool leg. It avoided hitting his door. It seems like it has a lift feature for getting over bumps. I watched it back up, lift itself up then rev forward to make it into the bathroom that had a lip. I can\'t wait to see how quiet or loud it is over my vents on the floor. Cordey is quiet over them, but roomba is loud AF. Brushes just spinning over the grates like a bad band came into town to play. One good thing about the Lidar is it should be too tall to go under and get stuck under my coffee tables. A minus is if I have bedspreads that hang low. It won\'t go unless I don\'t have them hanging. \n\nAnother bad about narwal is as it cost so much, I may be better off just getting the expensive solution rather than risking damage by trying to put my own solution in it. \n\nIf they sell a base for it that allows it to auto empty the dust bin,, I\'ll buy it and whatever attachments 8t needs. \n\nI saw that the Asian market had an auto fill auto empty tube mechanism... but they don\'t sell it in the US because setup was...too difficult for the US market. Gosh darn ""Stupid American"" stereotype making them not sell us stuff, haha...unless it was tested in America and users said it was too hard.

I just can\'t do all the food on the floor after they eat. It\'s still too often, and I may change the other 2 to once daily. The only reason I let them run is so I can empty the bins a little less. The carpet is always giving them a lot of dirt. The only one I don\'t have to empty is the roomba, but that one loves to get stuck. No lidar, older model etc. \nThe Narwal is my quietest vacuum yet. I love how it makes my floors shine. The cleaning solution and the oscillating mop pads are awesome. It has been pretty good at avoiding obstacles. It only got stuck twice so far under a bed... the bed had some double sided tape that I never ended up using to keep the mattress in place. That tape started to fall down and was on the ground part way and when the vacuum rolled over it, it got actually caught up in it and couldn\'t get out. \nAnother time it told me it was stuck and I checked the app. It said the brush rollers were tangled. My mom was doing laundry and it grabbed an underwear and told me it was tangled.  I told it to come back to the home base and saw it had a pair of undies.  Took that off before it went home and sent it on its way. I\'m glad I\'m able to override the""stuck"" nature and send it home. So far, it hasn\'t died on me yet. It charges while it cleans the mop and whenever I check the battery life, it\'s at least half. If I forget to leave my bedroom door open, it just skips it. I can tell it to do a specific room or avoid rooms or parts of rooms. For now, it avoids the laundry room and the room with the kids\' toys. I don\'t wanna risk it with their small toys. It has sucked up a battery before. I found it in the dust bin. \nIt is my smartest one yet though. It doesn\'t crash into things and doesn\'t get stuck under the coffee tables or the legs of the egg swing chair by deciding to shove itself under there so far it can\'t go back... looking at you coredy...it doesn\'t randomly get ""stuck"" on nothing at all where I have to go searching for it and making it make noise...looking at you roomba...I can see where it is in real time and know where it\'s vacuuming. When it got stuck, I looked at the map and knew where it was. And I\'m able to recall it to the base station, make it clean the mops or continue vacuuming if it says it had an error. I empty the dirty water bucket and fill the clean water after every 2 sessions since my house is big. My floors look great. I\'m way less worried about the nephews constantly dropping food. While I do wish it auto emptied, I\'m also glad it works as it does. I\'m thinking of moving one of the vacuums to the carpet area upstairs since narwal does such a good job... but I kinda want an auto empty one up there since it\'s carpet... but I don\'t wanna get rid of my auto empty one downstairs since I have a carpet down here too. (Roomba)\nThe Narwal cleans in a pattern that 100% makes sense. No random cleaning. I can tell it what order to clean each room and if it can\'t get to one room, it just moves on to the next one. I\'m happy with my purchase and I only have to change the water and empty the dust bin. I do have to take it from charging to empty the dust bin as it\'s covered, or pause the job as it\'ll pause and tell me to check the dust bin if I open and remove it. I love how narwal works. If only it could empty the dust bin, it\'d be perfect. I haven\'t messed with the cleaning solution as I was intending. Maybe once the one runs out and I buy replacements, I\'ll dilute it... but I\'m not sure I want to risk putting something else in there that doesn\'t belong. \nMy main concern with the Dreame L10s was I\'m worried about the water bin getting clogged as it has been known to do so.

I moved one of my vacuums down into the basement and just use the Narwal and the coredy (vacuum only) on my main floor. I empty the dust bins like every 2 days for both of them. I only use both of them because if I forget to empty the bin, I'll have double time before both fill up... I have like 1200 square feet and it takes 2h 15-2h 20 minutes to do the whole thing. I have to change the water in the morning... or whenever just before the 10pm mopping since most of my main floor is wood aside from the rug in the living room, and I let it wash the mops every 108 square feet. It has a method to the madness and I know where it's going and when as it does the same path every time it cleans. I've been startled by it before sneaking up on me when I've had my headphones on and been playing games. It is my quietest vacuum. It can be heard when not wearing headphones for sure, but it's not going to wake me up while I'm sleeping. I do like having it do 2 runs overnight only because my nephews eat in the middle of the night and I find the 10pm clean to be a bit early if they're gonna eat overnight and make messes, but I don't want the house to be dirty for so long. There's maybe 1 place where it gets stuck and I have no idea why. And it also gets stuck in curtains. Curtains that are on the floor are a no-go with lidar. It just won't go by them...and if it does, it may not want to get back out. Also, it doesn't always avoid cables. As it's 10pm or 4am, the lights are usually off. IDK if it needs light to see the cables or not...but yeah, it has gotten caught in them. It is really good about avoiding obstacles though for the most part...except skinny chair legs. It'll ram into those sometimes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the mopping, I haven't had to mop since I have been using it. I walk barefoot and after using it, it passes my inspection. It does the carpets too. I don't have small children over super often, so I don't have all the cereal and big food particles on the floor, but I'll have a random small food item they miss. It picks it all up. I feel less stressed as I'm not cleaning up after them so much...if only it did counters, haha. With all the washing and cleaning and mopping etc, the mopping pads did start to fall apart. Mind you, I was doing 4x a day at first. I honestly think I can get away with once a day...but kids make messes so often that even after it cleans, someone is gonna make a mess again and if I don't want critters, I want it cleaned up quickly. Better it than me though, right? Haha. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally went from dumb robot vacuum to smart lidar, so this is a huge step up. The mapping is so fast, the cleaning is great. The spinning brushes man, it's a godsend! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cleaning solution was like half way done...so I decided to add water with a syringe and a blunt needle... then added a bit of murphy's wood cleaner (10mL) and filled the rest with water... So far, so good. YMMV, but $47+ for a cleaning solution...It has only been a few days, but as I only added a little, I'm hoping for no clogs. The consistency is most likely the same. No suds so far. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really happy with it. Though I should say, there's a robot coming out that does it all and may be more reliable.  It's called the Roborock Q Revo. \n\nNGL, it's looking like the vacuum to get!""]"

This post is more of a reference for anyone who's searching for information on the S7 Roborock and is concerned about internet privacy/security and its mopping performance

This is **not a comprehensive review** and will **only focus on two things:** 

1. Performance without being connected to the internet ever (for those that have XL tinfoil hats like myself) 
2. Mopping performance

&#x200B;

**1. Performance despite never being connected to the internet: Great.** 

The good: 

* Easily controlled with the push buttons on the top
* Still maps the area and then vacuums in a grid pattern
* Auto detects whether it's on carpet or hard floor and changes the vacuum speed and deploys the mop
* Still returns to base to charge etc.
* Spot clean function is good for area cleaning.

The bad: 

* No idea what strength of vacuum it's on and can't change. 
* Can't change the water level of the mop either
* To do the spot clean  I have to pick the S7 up, put it in the affected area, and press the 'spot clean' rather than just telling it through an app. 

**2.  Mopping performance: poor**

The good:

* Auto detects hard floors

The bad:

* Without pre-wetting the mop it's pretty pathetic (may be related to not changing the setting in the app) 
* It doesn't raise the mop enough to not make the carpets slightly damp
* It doesn't do an amazing job of cleaning

&#x200B;

Overall: vacuum without internet connection is good, mopping is shit.   
**TLDR: If I was to buy again I would buy something with only a vacuum (maybe a J7 Roomba?)**"	0	[]

It also seems like electronics warranty services like Asurion will do everything in their power to avoid actually helping or refunding you (if you know of a better service good enough to make buying a Roborock safe, please let me know). 

Now thinking of buying a Roomba for vacuuming, and also a separate mopping robot. 

I'm looking for a mopping bot that's very low maintenance (self-cleaning, doesn't constantly have errors, etc.) and with good customer support that won't make you jump through any hoops if something goes wrong.

RR exchanged mine for a reconditioned one that looked brand new and it continues to work better than the original ever did. No mapping problems at all. I love the S7 and the fact that it rises over the rugs and lowers over bare floors to mop them is a very unique feature, one that none of the others seem to have.']"

It goes from 100% to 0%.  After a while most of the sounds are background like my dishwasher when it finishes.  My selective hearing only pays attention when it's a message like I'm  stuck or clean dust cup.  If I ran it at night when I'm trying to sleep id be ,ore concerned since I'm a light sleeper.   \n\nOne thing if you turn off the notification sounds the find my bot feature probably won't work since its really an announcement sound to help you locate it.  Hunting for a bot isn't a lot of fun since its probably going to be under something and not out in the open where it's easily spotted."", 'padamdam: Ecovacs allows this. I believe the top three brands do this as well (Xiaomi, iRobot, Ecovacs)', ""Itchy-Ad1005: The noise filtering came from years of having kids and dogs.  I learned to only pay attention to the important stuff.\n\nI've had a Shark self empty for over 3 years.  The first one had a sensor failure early on and Shark replaced it at no cost.  It was at the time the only other self empty bot and a lot cheaper than the Roomba.\n\nIts now a pretty basic bot so it doesn't have the AI obstacle avoidance and uses VSlam for navigation.  I run it 5 days a week in the morning.  I run it on medium power.  I clean the auto empty bin and clean the filters  weekly.  My dogs bring in plenty of fine dirt. I know its supposed to be able to go 60 days but the filters after a week are really dirty.  \n\nThe object avoidance may become more important since both my dogs are older and they could devrlop incontinence issues.  I have it start at 9 am so we've been up for a couple hours and hopefully should spot that kind of problem .  Cleaning a bot thats run over poop would be a pain.\n\nIt gets the entire 1400 sq ft house except under low furniture.  It is excellent at vacuuming.  It can be pretty agressive on objects in its path.  Walls not so much.  If the object is 2 inches or less it will try to climb over it.  I have a 1 1/2 inch diameter weight bar beside the bed up against the wall  i watched it this morning trying to climb over it only to be stopped by the wall.  The roller seem to handle hair very well  Theanti tangle measures seem to work.  The drawback is that if a cord like a charging cord gets into it you're going to need a new cord.  I use Anker charging cables and have lost 3 of them.  Took chunks out of the cable.  \n\nThe aggressiveness is beneficial in getting up into and out of the kitchen which is about 1 inch higher that the other rooms.  A 2 inch wide by 1 inch high threshold  facilitates its entry.\n\n Thick throw rugs or bathroom mats are a problem.  Itvwill push the edges up and get stuck on the folds in the carpet.  We fold the bathroom mat up when we aren't  using the bath.  Its easier to do that then to have to drop everything and rescue the bot at a random time\n\nWe have a type of grass that puts out runners. Occasionally the dogs will bring in a 3 to 5 inch runner.  We try to pick those up.  The bot will pick them up alright but it jams up when itis emptying the dust cupbtobthe bin.  I think that the runners would be a problem for all self empty systems.  It keeps the dust cup door from closing.\n\nMapping is good but setting up no go zones and room naming is difficult.  The problem appears to me to be  because of the tablet size and trying to do with my finger instead of a stylus.  There is no way to expand the map.  If I broke out my stylus I probably could get that to work but it hasn't been worth it.  We have a couple chairs that at precisely the right spot the bot can get underneath them but will become stuck.  It went under the chairs about 3 or 4 times then never went underneath again.    The app is pretty easy to use.\n\nInitially it did the bounce around navigation until it created a map then it switched to the lawn mower pattern.  Occasionally it will on its own go in a weird pattern near some piece of furniture.  It kind of looks like a square about 3 feet on a side.  It maybe we moved the table a bit and its trying to get to a spot that its map tells it that it should be able to ckean.\n\nIt will at times come back and completly do a room a second time.  Usually the master bedroom or the family room.  I've been unable to find a reason for that.  It's not because it needed to recharge then returned to finish the room.  Since I basically ignore it I don't care if it does a room twice.  I know that bothers some people here but I only care that the dirt is clean.\n\nI like that its bagless since I empty more frequently than they say you have to.  The bags aren't cheap and using them would probably mean that I would use them a lot longer than I do now.  Full bags reduce air flow and vacuum efficiency.   I usually dump the auto empty bin into the garbage just before I take the garbage out.  \n\nOverall mine does what I bought it to do.  I'd like object avoidance but not enough to spend more money and I'm not convinced that the mopping feature is ready for me.  The whole house is hardwoodband stone flooring.  The Debot Ultra is getting close."", ""PhilosophyCorrect279: I think most new robots offer some version of this. \n\nOur iLife robot lets us adjust the volume, all the way to off. I have it half way, just enough that I can make sure it's running."", 'Harpski: Yes!  My vacuum makes an announcement pretty regularly around 1 or 2 am saying ""Hello!"". It scares the crap out of me every single time as I\'m trying to sleep, alone, in a dark apartment.\n\nUpdate: Went to settings and the volume is already at zero. I guess I get to keep living with the ghost of my robot in the dead of night.', ""Proscapegoat: I'm a little jealous, we're going on year 5 of our Roomba and I still want to throw it from the balcony every time it talks. I'm just a person who hates talking inanimate objects I guess. \n\nI'm not super worried about trying to find it, there are very limited hiding spaces in my home. \n\nHow is Shark otherwise? I've heard some less than flattering things about their vacuums and app so they haven't really been on my radar. But with notification silencing, I'm interested."", ""FlashyCow1: Irobot doesn't, but you can lock the buttons and turn the lights off."", ""Proscapegoat: Ooh that's another bonus point in the Ecovacs bucket in that case.

ActualNonManual	2	100kn37	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/100kn37/finding_the_right_robot_vacuum_for_single_floor/	"Hey everyone. I'm completely clueless when it comes to robot vacuums, so I thought maybe you could help me out a bit.

No idea what's really important with these devices, so I thought I'd just list some bullet points.

* Trying to spend less than 500 bucks, lower is better.
* 2 people with long hair, no pets.
* no carpets, only hardwood or tile (kitchen).
* A bunch of furniture, some are movable like coffee table.
* Don't mind emptying the robot every few days (>2)
* Wanna be able to schedule cleaning times.
* No small objects on the floor.
* Mop feature is nice to have but not needed.
* No elevation changes other than some super shallow transition profiles.

Thanks for helping out you guys:)

I haven't been able to make it work fully. Below are the problems faced.

1. The robot cleans a small area in a crazy pattern. It moves backward a lot hitting obstacles. And in some time, it says cleaning completed. Next time when the cleaning is restarted, it follows a different pattern in a different area (sometimes the same area also). I was hoping that this way it was building up the map. But the map doesn't seem to be accurate with respect to the position of the base station. Also, it's taking a lot of time to do this small area. So it does small areas with some overlap every time and says cleaning is completed.
2. There are 2 big problems with the bot.
   1. It never finds the base station. Even if the bot is just starting the cleaning, if I give a return to base command, it cannot find the base station. It goes all over the place and finally, voice prompt says to move the bot to the base station. 
   2. Every 5 minutes or so, the bot stops with a voice message ""obstacle detected, please reposition"". And the bot will be in an open area with no obstacles at all. And it's very frustrating because it happens almost every 5-10 minutes. If I just give the resume cleaning option in the app, it continues cleaning normally for the next 5-10 minutes.

Tried solutions:

1. Cleaned the base station and the bot (sensors).
2. Factory reset the bot and reinstalled the app.
3. Moved the base station to a lot of different positions which included a very open area also.
4. Tried in day and night conditions with different lighting.

None of this worked. Has anyone faced these kinds of problems with Dreame F9 or Xiaomi robot and how did you fix it?

Any pointers will be helpful. Thanks!"	3	"['Foreign_Afternoon_49: Hi, I\'m not exactly sure, but I saw that you didn\'t get any replies. Have you already tried re-mapping from scratch? Does the map look accurate in the app? Every time you move the base station, the robot gets totally confused. That happened to me once, and I was afraid I\'d have to remap everything. But I read a post on reddit that said if you clean ""all"" instead of cleaning a room or a zone, it will find its bearings again. That worked for me. Let us know what happens!', ""SlackerGame: Hey. I couldn't do a full cleaning even once since the robot never went back to base on its own.  This happened every time. I had to wait until the voice prompt asked me to move the robot to the base or when I saw that its going crazy without finding base I myself used to take to the base. The next time when I start the robot, it may or may not clean fully (it keeps throwing an error that Robor is stuck, please re-position when nothing will be blocking the robot) And when its done finally, it cannot find its way back to the base station. \n\nI am planning to return it or exchange it."", ""Foreign_Afternoon_49: Sorry!

1672404473.0	30-Dec-2022 04:47:53	I bought a 360 S8 for my parents for Christmas - but the app appears to require a login, and I assume the app features (block/mop/etc zones) require the cloud servers and internet? What similar vacuums are *entirely* local and can't be semi/entirely bricked by a bust company, and have HA support	LevHB	1	zyzqjp	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/zyzqjp/i_bought_a_360_s8_for_my_parents_for_christmas/	"So basically I bought the 360 S8 when it was on offer on Amazon for £230. Except I didn't realise (or think at the time since I left my shopping until a few days before Christmas...) that you need a login, and hence the features are also likely cloud based (correction would be lovely).

My parents have a *huge* home automation setup that I have designed for them (great test case for if I ever manage to buy my own home). Everything runs locally except for Google voice assistant (which connects through the Home Assistant integration). All the lights are Zigbee Hue (which doesn't require a login for the app or the internet for the hub/app to function, although they don't use the hub anymore but Zigbee2MQTT), battery sensors are Zigbee, WiFi devices are nearly all ESP based running ESPHome, they have a Home Assistant server, etc etc.

They were previously running a Roomba E5. So this should be quite the upgrade, I want something with the ability to have no-go zones (since the E5 always gets stuck and is dumb af), a mop, good flat floor performance (only two carpets, one very flat carpet, one quite shaggy, but both small), etc.

I bought the 360 S8 since it looked really good for the money. But now I'm quite pissed that I think it could essentially be semi or fully bricked if the company stops supporting it, or goes bust. I haven't tried to see if it at least vacuums and avoids zones already setup without the internet, since I put it straight back in the box after going onto app setup.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a replacement, with the same features. But that works entirely offline, ie it cannot be bricked in anyway, all features will work offline, including setting up new zones etc. And ideally something that has no-go zones.

I don't mind spending a bit more, but it can't be mountains more.

Or should I keep the S8 360. If they do kill it within 2 years I should at least be able to get a refund under consumer protections. And hopefully someone hacks the local protocol or something (hell if it does store all the data locally then I might hack it, it'd be a step up from my previous device hacking experience, but I think within reach if I have enough time to devout to it)."	0	[]

It\'s possible that I have a level of control that others do not because of this. It\'s easy to get access to it, it\'s just a little unstable and needs to be refreshed once in a while.

I have an Anki Vector - but she just isn't pulling her weight in the hoovering department.

It seems the Eufy G30 and 30C are the most widely available ""budget"" units in the UK with not much difference in price, so I feel I'm missing something?

Features I am after are:

- Some kind of mapping;
- if possible obstacle avoidance (I have a toddler with toys) and chairs with legs;
- bonus points for Home Assistant integration;
- mopping is a bonus, but is rarely required in my place.

House is:

- 500sq ft downstairs - one continuous plastic floor (Karndean)

- 500sq ft upstairs - wool carpet in all rooms and hall with threshold strips. Vinyl bathroom floor.

My options so far are:

- Used 30c (about £100)
- New G30 (about £200)
- Roborock s5 (about £200)

Best heavy duty robot vaccum/mop for house with two messy rabbits	Irtexx	3	zpphqt	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/zpphqt/desperate_advice_needed_best_heavy_duty_robot/	"Me and my partner adopted two house rabbits. We have tried our damn best to litter train them, but there is still wee on the hardwood livingroom floor, and vinyl kitchen floor every day. Luckily they do not wee on the small section of carpet near the stairs, but they poop there lots.

It takes at least an hour every day to mop up, sweep/hoover up the poops, and brush up all of the hay that spreads around the house.

I was lead to believe that they would be litter trained, and the mess wouldn't be so bad, but we are really struggling to cope with it. (But don't worry, they are loved and well looked after, its just that we are loosing the little free time/energy we have after work on nothing but cleaning).

I understand that automation will not fully solve this. We will still need to manually empty their litter trays, manually sweep/mop up their rabbit run (a sectioned off area that they are free to go in and out of, that they do the worst of their mess in), and sweep up any particularly bad areas as we find them.

But it will help with my peace of mind knowing that the floors are regularly mopped, as currently the rabbits stand in their wee and spread it through the house. And if it can get the little bits of hay (not the big collection that congregates in their run), that will also help and make this task less arduous for us.

We have decided to not get each other Christmas presents this year so we can get a robot hoover/mop instead, but as it's such a big/expensive decision, and I'm still not convinced it will cope with the mess, we haven't bought it yet.

Can you please help me decide on a brand/model?

**Our budget is about £600** ($731), but if it absolutely needs to be higher than this for it to be any use, we might be able to afford this if we have to.

Required features/qualities:

* Hoover and Mop
* Heavy duty (can cope with hay/rabbit poop)
* High quality (we cannot afford to buy cheap, we need something that will last us a long time, and we do not need to upgrade later)
* Good navigation - the vinyl kitchen floor is easy, it's just a square with a mesh cage in the corner with a raised door that the rabbits hop through. The Hoover will just do the non cage bit. The living room is harder, it's an open living/dining area with lots of obstacles and a wooden beam in the middle.
* Maybe self emptying if you think this is necessary for this situation? With the amount of mess,  I can foresee needing to empty the hoover/mop many times in one day, and I can foresee this being another task that I procrastinate,making the whole thing useless.

(Btw, for those that don't know, rabbit poops are hard little balls of mostly compressed hay. They are not wet or mushy)

We will be moving house in 6 months as our landlady wants her son to move in, so we will get a house with a garden then. But for these 6 months, some robot help will be great. And I'm sure it will still be useful in our new place, as the rabbits will have playtime in the house. 

Thank you!"	1	[]

My girlfriend and I decided to buy ourselves a robot vacuum for Christmas as it will hopefully change our lives for the better but I must confess that we do not know that much about it. 

We've read several reviews, checked their pages on Amazon and other websites and for instance, in this subreddit is listed the Roomba S9+ as best of the best, is it an updated list or was it a long time ago? When I looked at the roomba's page, some people seemed unhappy, comparing it to the roborock s5 (I believe?), Is this some kind of robot wars or are there actual reasons to dislike it? I am very much afraid of making a mistake when finally picking one instead of another...

We're not very interested in a robot that mops, even if indeed it is a nice addition of course we won't complain if it does, just regular vacuum is fine and we perhaps also care a bit about the noise it might generate, if it is very noisy and takes a long time to clean we're afraid to piss off our neighbours. I've seen the deebot x1 Omni as well, which mops.

Please ignore it’s suggestions!', 'PhilosophyCorrect279: What are your needs? What type of flooring do you have? How much hardwood vs carpet.\n\nRoborocks are very good, but nothing cleans as well as a Roomba for carpets. The S9 is the most powerful Roomba and cleans very well. Most of the problems it has had have been worked out with all the software updates now. That said, their newest is the j7+ and it offers some of the best obstacle avoidance, and is the only one with any sort of guarantee to avoid pet waste. Roombas are almost always cheaper than Roborocks too, especially as most of them are still on sale. The j7+ can be found for around $600. If you\'re a Costco member you get extra replacement parts and a bigger battery, it\'s named the j8+, but it\'s the same price as the 7. Above all, Roombas are generally the most durable robots too, with nearly all major parts being available for purchase if needed, they still support their first robots too as they are still working! Irobots are also the only ones with real dirt sensors, to focus cleaning on extra dirty areas. They also are the only ones that reliably empty themselves as needed via sensors, vs just guessing and continuing. \n\nRoborock are very good too, especially if you have more hard floors and don\'t need to worry about pet waste. They easily have one of the best apps available , and software overall, along with navigation. Not to mention the S7MaxV ultra is more hands off in terms of floor cleaning, as it can vacuum and mop, and clean itself. It\'s worth noting however, while they are built well, and have shown to be pretty durable, if you have any problems, Roborock has a bad rap for customer help. Some people who buy their extended warranty don\'t even get help. I can\'t speak personally of that, but I\'ve heard it more than you would expect unfortunately.\n\nThese are the two main robots that have been dominating the market. Ecovacs are a ""hit or miss"" kind of robot,  generally their hardware is built well but their software is always lacking and they always have some sort of problem, or quirk. Other brands are where you start technically going from high end to mid, to lower end. Dreame, Eufy, Roidmi, etc. They are all generally good too, totally depends on your model and price. Again, given that the main manufacturers like Roomba and roborock are on sale right now, I\'d stick with them unless of course you find an even better deal otherwise.', 'thunderflies: Most vacuum robots are much quieter than a real vacuum so that might not be a big issue. If you want a real cream of the crop robot then I highly recommend the Samsung Jet Bot AI+, I have three of them in my house (one for each floor) and love them. They’re also very fast cleaners and much quieter than most robovacs which as I mentioned are already quieter than a real vacuum. \n\nThe main reason I recommend them is the fantastic mapping and object avoidance, it’s the best on the market and they never get stuck on things so you don’t have to pick up the floor at all before running them. Most robot vacs require you to pick up socks and cords and stuff, many high end ones now have object avoidance like the Roborock S7 but Samsung’s is just the best version of that. The MSRP is insane though, they’re $1200 full price but very frequently go on sale for $700-$800 which is a good value.', ""DBoy00: I'd like to piggyback on this thread as I've been reading since Black Friday. I really want to try out the Roborocks S7 series too, but I heard the support is basically non-existent. Looking at that, I'm afraid to put 1000+ investment into something that might be a warranty nightmare a few months later.\n\nGiven I know Costco sells the S9 online, and they basically take it back if it's broken no questions... I am fear deciding at this point.\n\nAnyone know if Roborocks customer service has gotten better?"", ""AnIdiotwithaSubaru: Roborock is definitely a great choice. The s9 would destroy the s7 max only in deep carpet cleaning but thats it. No ai obstacle avoidance, no mopping, and yeah, lidar is the shit. \n\nI have a Roomba j7+ and a Narwal T10 (one of the first self wash mops) and my Roomba CONSTANTLY gets lost and it takes so much longer just to navigate. It needs constant visual recognition to know where it is in the room. Lidar just always knows where it is. It doesn't need scan and position itself. \n\nMy narwal t10 even with it's more basic software cleans wayyyy more efficiently and never misses anywhere. Lidar is amazing and the roborock lidar camera hybrid makes so much more sense."", 'Asterite_: Thanks for the recommendations!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you know the difference between the S7 MAX V ULTRA and the S7 PRO ULTRA? I\'ve googled it but what they say is ""Almost the same but cheaper"", I mean we\'re talking about a 600€ price difference and they\'re not actually telling me exactly what are the difference, for such a price difference I\'m pretty sure there must be an uncanny difference, right?', ""Asterite_: It's alright, thank you for letting me know :D"", 'Asterite_: Thanks for quite the big message!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy needs, hmm, we have two ""small"" carpets (one in front of the sink in the kitchen and one in the living room under the table), otherwise the floor is mostly floor tile, hardwood and there\'s a room with Linoleum which is already hell with a normal vacuum as it tends to gets sucked in when cleaning the edge, or make some bubble (hope you know what I mean, doing my best to explain in english haha) where I\'m vacuuming.  \n\n\nYou and another user both mentionned the  S7 MAX V ULTRA, so I\'ve googled it and found it, as well as the S7 PRO ULTRA.  I\'ve googled it but what they say is ""Almost the same but cheaper"", I mean we\'re talking about a 600€ price difference and they\'re not actually telling me exactly what are the difference, for such a price difference I\'m pretty sure there must be an uncanny difference, right?   \n\n\nSomeone here mentionned how his Roomba gets lost very often, does it still happens or did they update their firmware or something? Also it\'s true that the actual ability to really track the dirts is nice.  \n\n\nI\'ll probably stay away from Ecovacs then, I don\'t know that topic well enough to give it a blindshot, thanks!', ""Asterite_: Thanks for the hint!  \n\n\nYou're pointing out exactly what i had heard beforehand, people who had, back then, ordered the premium robot vacuum made by Roomba, which needed assistance quite a few times as it always got lost somehow, did they fix it eventually?"", ""PhilosophyCorrect279: Sorry lol, sometimes I start typing and get carried away!\n\nAlso, I understand! It sounds like a Roborock would be a great fit for you! Roombas have gotten better, especially with the j7, but given you don't have a ton of carpets, and you have the tricky area of tile, I think the Roborock would be better overall, as they have good suction for crevices and such, so that should help. Their navigation is nicer and more accurate, along with more features, like being able to clean a single room or area multiple times as needed, and more of course. \n\nAs far as the S7MaxV vs the S7ProUltra goes, I believe the only difference is the object recognition. The S7MAXV Ultra has an AI with an extra camera and sensors on the front to recognize and automatically avoid objects that may cause problems, like socks or cables. The S7ProUltra is the same machine, but without the object avoidance AI.\n\nIf you're not worried about the robot getting stuck on cables or shoes and stuff, then I would definitely save the extra money and just get the pro. Likewise, if you don't need mopping, then both should be available with the regular self emptying bin, without the mop part, if you wanted as well."", ""Intelligent_Ice_3078: The max V ultra is the only one with the empty/wash/fill charging dock. I just got one and it is amazing. It empties the dustbin into the dock, washes the mopping pads and refills the mopping on its own. This is important if you have a larger home, as it will return to dock as needed during the cycle and then continue cleaning. I have roughly 2000 sqft downstairs of all hardwood, tile, and laminate, and it usually washes the mop about 3 times and empties the dustbin a couple times as well\nI generally don't ask it to clean the office or master bed/bath because of obstacles, so in reality it's self cleaning fairly often."", ""AnIdiotwithaSubaru: My j7+ is definitely a good vacuum and doesn't get stuck or lost (often) but it does still tend to miss areas and rooms. Because it's a camera only navigation system it needs ambient light to know where it is. If you don't have every room well lit it has a harder time figuring out where it is. Its definitely still a very capable robot though. They're also very easily repairable and easy to find parts for. \n\nThe reason why roombas are better at cleaning carpet is because Roomba has a patent Monopoly on the dual brush roller design.\n\nThe RoboRock Max V is also not without its issues. I have heard the washing system for the mop can be finicky and the lifting system only lifts the mop 5mm.  Another common complaint is that the max fee goes through mops pretty quickly but my Narwal T10 with a very different self washing mop system also goes through mops really fast. \n\n If you're looking for something with obstacle avoidance, self washing mop, lidar, it's still a great choice.""]"
1671326851.0	17-Dec-2022 17:27:31	Can't choose: (keep) Proscenic m8 pro, (get) ecovacs t8 aivi, or (get) ecovacs n8+	_deWitt	1	zomeeb	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/zomeeb/cant_choose_keep_proscenic_m8_pro_get_ecovacs_t8/	"Hi! before all a bit of context: i'm a uni student and have 0 time for cleaning, i'm kinda short on money but i've also got a dustmites allergy. for these reasons i decided i need a robot vacuum that also has self empty (less contact with the dust), that needs to be used.  
since it was on promo, i ordered a used proscenic m8 pro on amazon warehouse (182€). sadly it arrived with a dead battery.   
i'm now scared that proscenic might be a kinda bad manufacturer, since overall it gives somehow those cheap brand vibes, that i don't like especially in not-cheap electronics. am i biased or is this real?  
also, it came totally bare: i had to buy dustbags, filters, rolling brush, horizontally spinny things, cloths for the mop for 32€, for a total of 214€

in the meantime however i've found two alternative options, on fb marketplace:

\-ecovacs deebot n8+, used in very good conditions (250€)  
\-ecovacs t8 aivi (100/120€) + self emptying base (+\~80€) from two different users (total \~200€)

what should i do? should i send the m8 pro back and choose one of the other options?

\-proscenic m8 pro  
pros: amazon warranty/already have it(maybe less hassle)/could ask for a free repair  
cons: cheap (maybe)/maybe lack of future support

\-ecovacs deebot n8+  
pros: known brand/i also have a t8+ in my parents home (we could share dustbags etc.)/allergy filter/has everything needed + some extra dustbags, filters etc.  
cons: no amazon warranty (still have one year of ecovacs')/costs a little more

\-ecovacs t8 AIVI & self empty base  
pros: object detection with the aivi (this should make it the most versatile option)/cheapest option (less than 200€ in total)/could still share spare parts with parents/known brand  
cons: no allergy specialized filter/no amazon warranty (but probably still one year of ecovacs')/more hassle (two different sellers and shippings)/self empty base has a broken hook, and stays closed with adhesive tape (not much of a problem tbh, could be a reason to ask to lower the price)

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/zomeeb)"	3	"[""PhilosophyCorrect279: First, figure out your current non working robot. Definitely let them know you received it not working, they will probably ask you to send it back and refund you. They might even just tell you to keep it and refund you anyway. Either way, you bought something that's not working, and should be compensated, especially as it should be within the 30 day return window at the least.\n\nSecond, I personally agree with the person below, Ecovacs can be very hit and miss, and for how expensive they generally are, they should be better. Given how many are available for purchases used says a lot too. I also agree with staying away from some of the smaller known brands, unless you can score a really good deal to make it worth it. Some might be good, some might be bad, just be cautious. \n\nThird, I don't know what is and isn't available for you, but if it's available, a good machine I would look into is the base model Irobot I3+. They might be on sale for the holidays and are definitely worth the extra money. They clean well and last longer than most robots. Another would be a roborock or Dreame. Personally I have two iLife machines, they are not self emptying but are cheap and work well, the company was also helpful when I needed them.\n\nHonestly some more information would help too. Like how much space do you need to clean? Overall budget, what's the max? What type of floors? Pets? Features you need, want, or don't care about?\n\n Most robots have decent filtration now thankfully, but not all are equally as good. Some self emptying stations are the same way, some may use generic bags, vs some using HEPA. Some may use a bag and an extra filter. If you have allergies it would be better to get one with the better bags or filters. If you have a lower budget or less space I wouldn't worry too much about self emptying as that feature generally adds a lot to the price, but care more about the filtration of the machine. Robots tend to pack the dust in their bins well enough it doesn't fly around too much, but again, some or better than others."", ""bbabiuk: As someone who regrets purchasing a n8 pro plus, I'd recommend anything other than it.  I've had 2 units defective that I've had to send to ecovacs for repair under warranty.  I realize they all can't be bad, but regret purchasing an ecovacs."", '_deWitt: thanks for the feedback!']"

Finally got in touch with Shark support after they’re support number wasn’t available earlier and then the first call was hung up on during transfer. Walked the support tech through everything and he sent a link to a camera share to my phone so he could see the robot himself. 2 minutes later he tells me the brand new robot has a hardware malfunction and the only options are to exchange it at the store or do a warranty replacement.

I’m no longer certain if I should stick with the Shark and the decent $120~ in savings or go with the more expensive iRobot i3+ with base. Doesn’t sit well that an issue like this occurred right out of the box.


**Original Post:**

Picked up a Shark rv912s from Best Buy yesterday and had t charging overnight. Manual says it should take 6 hours first charge. Here it is 12+ and I’m checking on it and the battery indicator in the bot is blinking blue then red and the clean and dock lights will be blinking blue briefly and then go out.

I had an earlier, top of the line, very expensive robotic vacuum, and gave it away after about a yr. due to poor performance.  The Ihome Nova is a top of the line robotic vacuum with a very reasonable price.  It does an excellent job, where it can reach.  I have a few pieces of furniture it can't get under, but no big deal, I get to it about once a week.  The Ihome Nova is set to vacuum early morning each day and I never have to worry about my floors.  If you have deep grouted tile, it does a fair job but is great on hardwood floors.  I have two large german shepherds who are in a year-round shed mode.  Since getting this vacuum, I can enjoy clean floors and my dogs.  It also has a wet-mopping mode; I haven't used it yet.  It is so easy to mop the floors when the hard work of getting the debris up is already done. So 5/5 stars in my opinion.	4	"['mama2sixgr8tkids: I agree! We love ours.

I will be staying in a 2 story house and i am thinking if i should buy 2 or 1 robo vac. I currently have 2 options in my mind.

Option 1: Get the Roborock s7 maxv ultra.
i’ll leave the dock on lvl 1, and carry my robot up to lvl 2 manually to mop/vac there.
My concern with this option is that since my lvl 2 is about 800sqft, when it mops, the internal mop tank will run out and can’t refill the tanks since the dock is on lvl 1.

Option 2: Get 2 Dreamebot W10.
This means that I will have 2 robots on each level. However, this also means that there wouldn’t be the self emptying feature and also the AI features.
This would cost more too, about $225 more only in my country.

My questions are:
1. What is the area the roborock s7 can cover while mopping using the internal water tank only without the dock?
2. Can someone enlighten me more on the AI features that the s7 maxv ultra has?
3. Which option is more feasible?"	4	"['FlashyCow1: In all honesty, get roboroc, save up and get a second base later.

I've run the robot a couple of times now (always on the ""high"" setting or ""ultraclean""); it made a reasonable map of the house, seems to go in a nice pattern that does good coverage of the room...but it seems to leave quite a bit of pet hair behind, and if I check in the base station dustbin after a run, there isn't as much hair in it as I would expect.

I‘ve bought a new Roidmi Eva. I’m very happy with the vacuuming and mopping, it’s doing a great job. but I’m having a major issue and don’t know how to solve it.

Let’s say the door to the hallway is closed and he is cleaning another room and scans alongside, he now thinks that there’s a wall to the hallway. When I now want to clean the hallway, he says that he can’t access it. He doesn’t even start to scan if there’s a way, he just say no and don’t start. That’s super frustrating. 

The only way I see is to send him first to another room so he sees that the door is open now. 
But that’s not how I thought the robot will work. I want to chose the room and then rely that he will clean it.

Is there anything I can do about this problem? 

Thank you!"	0	[]

Luckily we had extended warranty so sent off to get assessed- just heard that we are getting store credit instead (so I am assuming it was not reparable)...

My options are to stick with ecovacs eg OMNI or go with a different brand which I have no experience with. I am a bit hesitant with sticking with ecovacs due to our experience and reading reviews..

Based on stated features, 1 difference I see between the Freo and Dreamtech's Dream Bot L10s Ultra is that the Dream empties its dustbin. I have a iRobot Roomba i3 with the auto emptying base and the Cordey without an auto emptying bin... I do forget to empty Cordey sometimes and it doesn't clean when I forget to empty it... I have the mop attachment, but it does get dirty and it's just dragging the cleaning pad around even after being dirty.

Based on the stated features of the Dream and Freo, both have spinning brushes, both lift the brushes when on carpet, both have dirty and clean chambers for cleaning the brushes, both use heat to dry the brushes... The only difference (which I really like) is that the Dream auto empties the dustbin...

I only don't know much about the Dreamtech's Dream Bot L10s Ultra and their brand. I don't know how well they are at mapping and the obstacle avoidance compared to the stated good of the Narwal Freo. Based on the readings I've done, the Freo is pretty smart and is a really good robot vacuum. The only downside is the lack of auto emptying...

I guess I want to know if anyone had any experience with any Dreamtech products (like the W10 or something) and can say how good the app and features are. I don't want to shell out a ton of $ on an item only to wish I got the Freo even though it lacks the auto empty bin. I just am not always there, and I can't run the Roomba when I'm not home as it likes to get stuck...a lot... I'd do Cordey, but I have to get some magnet strips to tell it not to go in certain places as it doesn't get stuck unless it gets physically stuck under furniture that's too tight for it to fit under. Roomba just randomly gets ""stuck"" on nothing, and if I'm gone for say a couple of days, I can't auto empty Cordey or Freo, and those would have been the only 2 I would have trusted to run while I'm not home.

&#x200B;

So, does anyone have the Dreamtech's Dream Bot L10s Ultra, or any Dreamtech products? Are they any good? I'm really trying to compare to the Narwal Freo as it's the alternative for me. For all I know, I may just wait until the next Black Friday... I can't believe the prices...but I only just learned about those today. The different Narwals first, then the Dreamtech's Dream Bot  So, any help would be great. You will have some time. I'll try not to impulse buy any of them until I hear about them both. Narwal would have been a no brainer had it had the auto empty feature. I need to see more reviews on the Dreamtech's Dream Bot to decide if it's good or not...

&#x200B;

Also...anyone who has the Narwal Freo...Have you tried refilling the detergent with your own cleaning solution? Has it worked? Was it easy to do?  I have a cleaner I use on my wood floors that I usually put in my Cordey that's for wood floors. Was seeing if I could put that in there, or maybe not. It's concentrated wood cleaner, so I'd have to mix it with water if anything anyway. "	5	"[""1selkie: We had a not-so-good experience with the Dreame W10. We bought it last December and loved it until August. Then the problems began. First the ultrasonic Sensor went bad--it stopped detecting carpet and started just mopping it. We got the notice on the app, contacted Dreame. They asked us to send the robot back (not the whole unit), and gave us a shipping label. In less than a week it came back, in the same box, and still didn't work. They said they would send a new robot. Repeated the return process. Received a new robot that wouldn't pair to the base unit because the serial numbers didn't match. They had us try something in the app but it still didn't work. So, they had us return the entire thing this time and sent a new one. This one had a problem sucking up the dirty water and flooded the area. So, again they had us return the entire unit and sent us a new one. This time it used too much water when mopping leaving a wet mess everywhere, and running out of water long before completing the task. Finally they admitted defeat and had us return it for a refund.  This all took place over a period of more than 2 months. \n\nSo, when it worked it was amazing. Once it developed a problem, customer service was slow to respond initially but became more responsive as time went on. Online chat was less effective than a phone call to get things done. \n\nAll of the units were manufactured in September, 2021 and some serial numbers were very close together, which tells me that maybe not many are being made. \n\nAll of them arrived in very damaged boxes although the contents were not damaged. \n\nI think they have come out with a new, improved version so maybe they have fixed the issues, I don't know. \n\nOh, and I had left a bad review on Amazon and after they issued the refund they asked me to remove the review.

I could let my other robots vacuum and that mop, or let all 3 vacuum and the narwhal mop and vacuum... I have 3 floors though and would like to be able to use 1 robot on each floor (once the basement is finished) but remembering to remove the dirt between cleans is not ideal, especially since most of the cleaning happens overnight while I'm sleeping. Roomba i3 would excel if it didn't always get stuck. Like, I think every day it gets stuck randomly and dies off base. But it does most of the work before that.

Like a lot of folks (probably) I bought the $150 refurb IQ+Base from woot or amazon recently.  It is a model # ur1100S1US which I believe is a 1st gen IQ.

We love it, the house (or at least the main floor of the house) has never looked better.

However, the map is weirdly wrong.

I have tried the ""delete map and try again"" as I've seen recommended but basically every time I get offered an (incomplete) map and my only options are to accept it or delete it, if you accept it, it says something about continuing to be refined but doesn't seem to?

It's extra weird because the coverage map from the history shows a much more accurate area map than the ""Map"" screen.

I realize that mapping doesn't seem to be the 1st gen's strong point but I was hoping to at least be able to fence off areas so I could request certain rooms to be cleaned/etc

In the screenshots you can see the home icon (assuming it's the base) doesn't even show up on the map but the history screenshot shows an almost perfect rendering of the floorplan.

Will the app map ever catch up or should I just keep deleting it until something kinda-sorta works?

thanks!

Should I return the roomba and go roborock? I feel in my limited use the auto-empty feature isn’t the grand convenience I expected it to be, and that the bump-learning on the i3 is primitive and leaves lots of missed spots. I have a few questions:

Does the i3 mapping become more accurate over time?

Does the s5 max have a camera or just LiDAR? I’m worried about privacy if it has a camera. 

Would you swap an i3 + emptying base for an s5 max even though it’s a slightly older model without self empty?

&#x200B;

I was a happy owner of **Roidmi Eve Plus** until recently.  About a month ago robot started to studently  turn off during its regular cleaning. Robot is in our household for about 1.5 year by now. 

It does not happen on every cleaning session but at least once a week it stops in the middle of cleaning session. At this point it becomes offline in the app. Additionally none of the buttons on the robot can be used both power button or home button creates no action. 

To get robot operational again I have to carry it to the docking station and make charging connection manually. At that point robot comes online but is offline in the app. 

To get it fully operational I have to reset the robot and re-add it to the Xiaomi Home app. Each time all of the history is lost include the scan of the apartment setup. 

What could be the reason for robot behavior? I am suspecting the batter does not provide stable current and this wipes its settings and stops him dead in its tracks. 

Is there a way to troubleshoot something or shell I just order new battery? Since robot is used in an apartment its batter was never discharged more then 50%.

I tried to reset it from app and from the device reset button but no luck.

The map was beeing updated in grey.\nWhen i cleared the whole house this way, i clicked again clean whole house but i made two virtual walls so it does not go around the whole house since i have a big house, and the map was updated, meaning the grey areas have now changed colour to match the rooms they form part of.\n\nYou might also encounter a problem where the robot might move the charging area on the map. If this happens, remove robot from charging, place it in front of charger hit return to charging dock from app and stay in front of robot when it is going the wrong way. This may take up to 5 minutes. Then the robot will see / sense that the charger is in that area and it will give up going to the previous wrong location and proceed to the charging dock.\n\nHope this helps.']

I recently bought a Xiaomi X10+. First problem was the robot didn´t get water from the station. This I could solve thanks to the internet. Now the water flows.

Now I got another problem. To make it more visible a map of the flat is atteched. The robot cleans in the order:

1. Badezimmer, tiles, high water flow
2. Waschküche, tiles, high water flow
3. Schlafzimmer, carpet, vacuum only
4. Flur, wood, high water flow
5. Küche, high water flow

The problem starts at step 4. Here the robot doesn´t put water to the mops. The mops are working but running dry. The same at step 5. But before step 4 the robot returns to the base to clean and refill (according to the app) at least once. The rooms at 1 and 2 are summed up less than 20 m².

Is there any thing I or the support can do about this? Or should I return it and get another robot? (I have a Dreame L10s on another floor that works flawless.

Thanks for all your help in advance.

I'm in the market for my first robot vacuum but I need some help because there are so many similar models. Roborocks seem to be the best, but they are a bit above my budget.

My requirements are quite simple: I just want it to vacuum the hardwood floors of my apartment, mopping would be nice too. I would also like it to have some mapping capabilities so it vacuums more efficiently and doesn't bump into things constantly  (lidar?).

* Xiaomi Dreame Bot D9 Max (€269)
* Xiaomi Mi Robot Vacuum-Mop 2 Pro (€305)

I’ve filled the clean water 2 times. No big deal for me. The dirty tank had an odor after a couple weeks. Rinsing was enough to clean it so far.

Which of these two do you all think would be better? I like the self drying feature of the l10s but the reviews seem to show a lot of issues with object avoidance, carpet cleaning with mops attached, and some weird water dispensing issue.	12	"['skunnmd: I went with 10s and have been happy with the decision!', ""Own-Safe-4683: I ordered and the Dreame bot Z10 pro and the Roborock S7 Max V Ultra with black Friday discounts. The Z10 is vacuuming my main level right now.  I so far so good.  Family says it's too loud.  It will eventually will clean a different level.  I can't get the S7 until Dec 12 but that's the one that will clean the main level of our house.  The main level has hardwood with two plush area rugs.  The Z10 had some trouble getting up on the area rug with the thick pad under it but it got there.  I got the Z10 because it can mop even though the mop function is not as automatic.  For the price could not pass it up.  \n\nI choose the S7 Max V Ultra because it looks like the mopping pad is more out of the way when it's just vacuuming and it's got top ratings everywhere.  Since I have two area rugs I thought that would be a better solution.  The black Friday discount made my decision a little easier.\n\nI think they both use the same app.  I had trouble with the app.  Every step of the process it would hang up or give me an error.  But when I went back into the app the step I was trying to complete was accomplished and I could go on to the next step.  Very frustrating but it all got connected."", 'ODoyleRules925: One reason I am going with the S7 over the L10s that I have not seen mentioned is that the water tank on the robot itself is removable. Having a place where water goes that cannot be manually cleaned with hot water and soap worries me as it seems ripe for mold or it eventually clogging due to mineral/deposit buildup. And the thought of moldy water being spread across my floors grosses me out. \n\nIf I am wrong and the l10s tank on the robot can be removed somehow, let me know? I am basing this on the user manual which shows no way to remove it.', 'ThaGza: Sounds like the s7 might be the right choice then? The only feature I don’t like is the fact that you need to pay extra for the mop drying feature on the s7.

I'm manufacturer agnostic so wondering about what's the best value out there today?	8	"['FlashyCow1: Irobot with braava m6 is best for discount percentage. Roboroc s7 max is best for value.', 'ARflipgurl: I bought the Airrobo P20 last week, Walmart early Black Friday had it at $99.99 and still does. It\'s a budget model so there are no mopping or self-emptying features but I\'m impressed so far. It uses gyroscope navigation so it\'s not randomly bouncing off of everything, it goes back and forth. That\'s the reason I chose this over the Eufy budget models.\n\nMy main vacuum is a Miele classic c-1 canister with a turbo brush (it rotates via suction). My husband is in a power chair and has a service dog. I installed 24"" industrial carpet tiles in the living room which is much smoother for him than padded carpet. The Miele leaves a surprising amount of dog hair behind on it. The Airrobo is picking up a lot of that now, so it\'s doing what I wanted. It has a rubber scraper type blade behind the brush that\'s probably helping. I\'m a little surprised (and a wee bit disgusted, LOL) by what I\'ve found in the dustbin so far.\n\nThe Miele is bagged; it has powerful suction and it does get fine dust better, which is why I bought it because my husband also has COPD from Agent Orange. Dog hair can make vacuums stink so I use a cut-to-fit charcoal filter along with the regular filter in it. I figured a robot vac would be good enough for everyday vacuuming between deeper cleanings with the Miele. So for my situation this little robot is a good combo.\n\nWe live in a double-wide so space is tight. The Airrobo seems to navigate our home quite well -- so far it\'s only gotten stuck under the edge of a rocker recliner. The app is nice. I was initially going to just use the remote control but decided I\'d try the app. I\'m glad I did because that enables the machine to downloaded a software update and there are more options.\n\nIt\'s the same price on the airrobo site today, as well as on Amazon. For a hundred bucks I\'m very happy with it.', '_Error_418_: Mopping on robot vacuum cleaners is pretty lame, even on high-end models. \n\nI would suggest focusing on getting a good robot vacuum cleaner. The Roomba j7+ is pretty good. \n\nIn terms of mopping – if you really care about mopping, you’re best off getting a dedicated mopping robot. \n\nDon’t bother with the iRobot Braava mop lineup; the overall cleaning performance is pretty good if you check out vacuum wars videos. But they use a very bad 2019 VSLAM system from the Roomba S9 and it struggles with floor transitions. \n\nIf they released one with the navigation system from the j7+ then it’d be an instant buy. But sadly not. \n\nBottom line: buy a good robot vacuum like a Roomba j7+ and a dedicated mopping robot if you really want mopping. :)', 'habibiiiiiii: Yeah because the braava does nothing but drag a paper towel across the floor. So trash.', 'FlashyCow1: Same with Roboroc, Bissell, eufy, Samsung, shark, deebot, narwhal or any other that doesn\'t use a bucket, dunk the pad, wring it out and go back at it. Even roboroc doesn\'t do that. It just sprays the pad to ""rinse it off"".', 'habibiiiiiii: S7 MaxV has a vibrating mop. That rises over carpet. EvoVacs T8 T9 have vibrating mop attachments.', 'FlashyCow1: Oh I see, vibrating paper towels and wash cloths. About as useful as braava moving back and forth with the options of more or less overlapping. \n\nYou know the only one that actually scrubs and sucks up dirty water at the same time is Ilife right?

I would ideally like to spend less than $700.	6	"[""Itchy-Ad1005: Go tonthe YouTube channel Vacuum Wars and watch some of their vids.  Thats a quick place to pick up decent basic info and see reviews of bots from major producers.   I wish they had more reviews of more of the smaller brands.  You only will need to watch a 3-5 of them. One should be the best of 2022.  \n\nDecide on the features you want and then narrow down your choices based upon reviews.  I'd recommend passing on the top end models for your first bot. Its like buying a top of the line computer for bragging rights only to have it become a run of the mill entry inn6 months to a year.  The rate of change has been pretty high.  Second after you've owned one for a while you'll find things you love, hate and could be improved which will help you pick out your next one.  \n\nAuto empty is a must.  I'd recommend based on my experience that AI obsticle avoidance is something to be strongly considered.  Id skip mopping.  I dont think they are ready yet Fourth pay attention to what the reviews say about the app. Fifth if you have furniture you want to get under pay attention to the total height of the bot."", ""PhilosophyCorrect279: So because you have mostly carpet, that automatically gets an Irobot Roomba recommendation. Nothing cleans carpets better than a Roomba. They are also built to last and have most major parts available if needed. Irobot still supports their old robots too, unlike most of the competition. \n\nThat in mind, and because as of today they are all still on sale, if you don't need any crazy fancy options, your best bet would be the Roomba i3+ Evo. Great cleaning at a good price. It also has the ability to select what room you want cleaner, and has a self emptying bin.\n\nIf you want more features, and the current flagship robot from Irobot, the Roomba j7+ is also your best bet. You get all the features and options, and it's on sale today too, with Amazon specifically giving a little extra discount. The biggest difference with the j7 is the object avoidence system, helping to keep the robot out of harms way. It also allows for better mapping too, meaning not only can you specify the room, but the exact area or spot too, even just asking Roomba to clean in front of the kitchen counter via Alexa or Google. Roombas are also the only machines to have dual rollers for cleaning, and can actually determine what areas are dirtier than others, and focus cleaning there. \n\nOf course any Roborock is also a good choice. If you want the highest end, the S7 MaxV is their current flagship. You can buy the robot by itself without any docking station now, and add one down the road if you wanted. The Q5+ and Q7+ are also great, and are considered there lower to mid-range robots at better prices.\n\n The biggest problem with Roborock is their price, they are expensive. But they are also very good. They clean very well, are built well, have arguably the best app and software, and better flexibility. They however don't clean carpets as well as Roomba."", 'The_Big_Cheese27: You are the best; thank you for responding and helping me!', 'The_Big_Cheese27: Thank you so much I really appreciate it!!', 'PhilosophyCorrect279: No problem! Happy to help!', 'bart_grewup: This was great advice.  I’ve owned the J7+ and just bought the Roborock S7 Max V.    I’ve also owned the Ecovacs T8 and Roomba i8.  The Roombas are great on carpet.  The Roborocks are good on carpet, but also mop,  super fast at mapping and navigation and reliable.\n\nThe i3+ would be great for a smaller apartment.  My one issue with Roombas is they bump into furniture a lot and sometimes loudly.  The J7+ with AI fixed this and is MUCH gentler and quicker.  It’s on sale for $599 right now.  It’s what I use for a carpeted upstairs.\n\nLast thing is where you buy.  If you have a Costco membership, I’d try to buy there over Amazon.  Costco took back a misbehaving T8 bot for me after 1.5 years, with no hassle.  Their bundles also added better battery life and a few extra filters and rollers.  They have the J7 and i8 Roombas on sale now.  Roborock Q7+ from Amazon would be another to look at for the price you mentioned.\n\nGood luck!']"

I'm interested in purchasing a robot vacuum but I'm having trouble deciding which one.  


1. The majority of my house is hardwood floors, I would like them to be clean and moped ideally. I've read that on some models the mopping does not work well or leaves streaks. Should I be concerned and no matter what model I get, I will have to mop separately?   

2. Is it worth it investing in a higher end model? Or are the features overhyped for my needs of clean and mop hardwood floors, I have no pets and we are only a couple living together.  

3. I was thinking of the Roborock s5 or s7 and was also looking at a lower or mid range Eufy by Anker.  I've bought Anker products before and they seem to have good warranty, customer service which I'm impressed with. I  have seen the Roborock got good reviews but I'm not sure about the warranty and have heard the machines breaking after 6 months to a year which makes me hesitant to purchase.  

4. What could you recommend as the best model for cleaning and mopping hardwood floors? No kids and no pets.  

5. I would like something that has a removeable dust bin as I view buying bags as a additional cost and cash grab, am I right to assume this?

Most reviews and comments are for large houses. I'm trying to find a simple vacuum that makes my life convenient. I also have long hair and shed a lot which makes life so annoying.

Therefore good performance on carpet and ability to work good with hair is very important. Self emptying is also important but mopping is only good to have. Don't need fancy app features as long as I can use an app to set it to clean when I am not home but even that is super optional

Like to keep the cost minimum 💯 but ok to spend a little for no having to worry about maintenance. Also not having to buy special/expensive bags would be good.

Thanks everyone in advance"	9	"[""PhilosophyCorrect279: To keep it simple, if you're following Amazon, the Irobot is $130 cheaper as of writing this, and seems exactly what you want, so I would say that.\n\nThe longer explanation: because you're not worried about app features, and are prioritizing longevity, I would still say the Roomba. Roombas are known for being durable, and easily repairable with many major parts available to swap out if you need to. Roombas are also the best at cleaning carpets, no robot has beat them yet, even with their lowest models like the i3. \n\nNow I'm not bashing the Roborock q5, as it's also a great vacuum. You will get way more features and options. No-go zones, virtual walls, carpet boost, suction settings, etc. They also clean very well on all flooring, however like I said, nothing out cleans a Roomba on carpet. If you have more hard flooring, and only some carpet then the Roborock would be better. They're pretty durable so far, but they don't have the reputation that Roomba has, especially on the customer service end. In fairness, nearly no company stacks up against Irobot, Roomba was, and is, the original, and they intend to keep it that way. The Q5 is a good machine for sure, however given the price difference, it could be a harder buy. Just be sure you don't want the extra features, sometimes they come in handy, but at the same time, it mind as well just clean the whole place anyways. \n\nIf you really don't care about the extra features, the Roomba is both cheaper, and will probably be easier to repair.\n\nTo note however, both utilize bags for their self emptying stations. If I'm not mistaken, the only robots that have bagless stations are Sharks. The exception here is Roborock, in that their station for the S7 does have the ability to be bagless, or bagged.

Or a j7+ where on top of that you get keep out zones and obstacle avoidance for items like socks, shoes, pet accidents, and cables. \n\nWhichever one you get, definitely get one of the + models.

Is it because of the Roomba patents for dual brush rolls?	1	"[""PhilosophyCorrect279: I believe they skipped Zero-M and went straight to Power Fins for most of their robots. That said, nearly every and all Shark Robots had some form of anti tangle system, mainly with a built in comb to help reduce build up, which is mainly how the zero m system works. \n\nAs far as Duo Clean goes, it's not really needed for robots. They're designed to be able to clean both large and small particles alike. They have a larger gap than a normal vacuum does for the floor head, meaning larger things can just get sucked up right away.\n\nThis actually follows their main vacuums now as well. Most, if not all, Zero-M machines have been updated to Power Fins. It's a very similar system, with the biggest difference being the fins are slightly longer, and the bristles are in long rows in-line with the fins, rather than separate. \n\nAbove all, I think you're also right, Irobot has dual roller patents for their Roombas, and they are not gonna let go any time soon, if they can help it. I'm sure there would be a way to change it enough to avoid problems, but I'm sure that's more costly, and nobody wants to temp them into getting in trouble.""]"

Most reviews and comments are for large houses. I'm trying to find a simple vacuum that makes my life convenient. I also have long hair and shed a lot which makes life so annoying.

Therefore good performance on carpet and ability to work good with hair is very important. Self emptying is also important but mopping is only good to have. Don't need fancy app features as long as I can use an app to set it to clean when I am not home but even that is super optional

Like to keep the cost minimum 💯 but ok to spend a little for no having to worry about maintenance. Also not having to buy special/expensive bags would be good.

(Prefer Lidar and bagless if possible)	ohFFSwtf	8	z5igw6	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/z5igw6/best_selfemptying_vacuum_for_house_with_pet_hair/	"Every vacuum review seems to include categories for carpet cleaning as well as mopping. I have no carpet in my house and I bought the Narwal T10 to use just as a mop, so I have no need for either of those features.

So now I need to find the best dedicated robot vacuum specifically for vacuuming lvp flooring. I have always used Eufy's but with pet hair and long human hair in the house I have to clean the roller at least once per day.

So what is your opinion on the best robot vacuum with self-emptying base that is best for pet hair and long human hair? I was thinking to get the Roomba S9 but it doesn't use Lidar and is very expensive. The Roborock S7+ looks good but is expensive and not bagless. I'm considering the Shark as it checks all the boxes but it seems to be buggy with the app and obstacles. Is one of the newer Eufy's a good contender?

The bagless bin is really neat, and the robot seemed to do a great job of mapping my house. I actually setup a little barrier at the door of a closet but the Lidar somehow still captured the closet space which I thought was very cool.\n\nThe couple downsides I'm experiencing are:\n\n1. it seems to hang out around obstacles like the kitchen table way longer than my other robots, rather than just moving around it.\n\n2. it doesn't go very long on a charge so it only does about 1/4 of the house before having to return to the station to charge which it says takes 3 hours. This might be a deal breaker for me... there is a way to turn off the auto-return/recharge so I think I will give that a try to see I can at least get it to do half of the house before returning to the base."", ""AnIdiotwithaSubaru: I have a Roomba j7+ and a narwal T10 and I can confirm that it's not a great combo.\n\nI have 1 dog, 3 cats, and my girlfriend and I in a 1600 square foot apartment.

Hot_Temporary1945	2	z4ya1g	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/z4ya1g/someone_here_to_help_wtih_my_decision/	"Hi it’s my first time buying a robot vacuum and I’ve been really doing a lot thinking to choose the right one for me.
First of all I live in a 3 bedroom apartment of around 60 square meter (or 650 square feet I guess) with a friend of mine and we both each have our own cat (one is a ragdoll🥲), we have a middle sized carpet in the living room and everywhere else is wood floor.
And we don’t have that many furniture but we have some pet stuff on the floor quite everywhere. Also I’m kinda tired with vacuuming all the kitty litter and fur lying all over the floor while I have to study for a long time during the weekdays.
In this situation I narrowed the candidates down to four ones and I hope anyone could pick the right one for me or maybe rank them. Thanks in advance🙂

1) Shark AI ultra self-empty (Av2511 something model)
This one is currently $300 on Amazon 
And it has all the cutting-edge(?) functions like Lidar mapping, auto emptying, and I heard its basic functions are as nice as others
Alhough I see bad reviews of Shark brand and its apps quite often, I think this one has everything that I need and has the best price.
Finally I also like that it doesnt have a dust bag

2) Dreame Z10 Pro
It has all the functions the first one has and even better, I saw that its obstacle avoiding ability is quite good. But quite more expensive ($480?) and considering customs and shipping costs🤯 since I live outside the US… And although I really like that it has mopping function but I don’t think I’m gonna use it that much… finally I saw some reviews that its basic picking up function could have been better.

3) irobot J7+
Many reviewers compliment this product and I saw that it has very nice obstacle avoiding technology. And I heard irobot’s two brushes thing is quite good at carpet cleaning and hair tangling. It is good in overall and cheaper than other high-end robot vacuums. Yet it’s way over my budget.

4) Eufy L70
It had that Lidar thing and basic functions also seemed to be nice enough. Its only drawback is missing autocleaning function I guess.. Though it also has mop function(which again I don’t really know how often I will use..) and I think cheapest of all these four

So which one of these four do you guys recommend? I’m about to buy Shark one but I would like to consider many things before buying.

It seems to be not quite as smart as it was when we got it, 50% of the time it can’t find a single room if you tell it to go clean one spot. The no go zones don’t really work. 

We have wood floor with a few rugs, one is fairly tufted? 

Are there any options that -
1. Actually map the house and can follow it? (I.e. not slam into the couch for 5 minutes that’s been in the same spot for 6 months?)
2. Are any of them continuously learning? (I.e. we move a nightstand, it picks up on it being open space now and adjusts for it?
3. Maybe a little more robust? The shark is very sensitive and stops a lot and needs reset.
4. Can be scheduled more than once a day? My shark can only be schedule to run at one time a day. I’d like to do half the house at 10am, the other half at 2pm, or something similar

Need to buy a robo vacuum for the first time & there are so many that I am confused watching the endless videos on YouTube.

We have the following requirements:
- Budget about 750 CAD or 550 USD (hoping to get a good Black Friday deal) 

- Mostly hardwood floors (90% hardwood with 10% rugs)
- Should have a self emptying bin. 
- Obstacle detection with AI might be good to have. 
- Mopping is not a requirement (as from all reviews, comments it looks like mopping isn’t good anyways unless it’s very high end)
- Should be able to schedule with option to choose a particular room for cleaning. 

Please suggest 3 options I can further choose from. 

Currently looking at:
1. Roomba j7+ (j8+ at Costco)
2. Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI 
3. ECOVACS Deebot N8 Pro+
4. Dreamtech Z10 Pro

Our primary concern is a completely automated experience (including cleaning/emptying)with great obstacle avoidance, something great with picking up pet hair (we have dogs and cats), and that can be efficient on carpet, hardwood flooring, and tile. So far the only device that seems to score very high for all of these is the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra, but that price tag is scary. Does anybody have any other recommendations? Just feel a little hesitant as this is our first robot vacuum purchase.	8	"['wwabc: If you want everything automated, that’s the one to get.\n\nBUT I think people over emphasize the auto empty stuff.  It takes like 10 seconds a day to empty a robot.   And many a time I’ve found things in the bin, or stuck in the roller that I’d never see with full auto (plastic bags, string, screws from stuff I ‘fixed’ recently)\n\nYou could just buy the robot and wait for the auto empty mop pad cleaner to go on sale in a while', 'TurkMcGill: I picked up an S7 on sale for $479 and a few months later added the auto-empty base for $299. We\'ve been SUPER happy with it so far!\n\nUnfortunately, I just checked the US prices on Amazon and right now that same combination is not that much cheaper than the S7 MaxV Ultra.\n\nMy wife and I moved in with my Mother to take care of her (she\'s 92 and has been living alone since Dad died last year). She and my wife absolutely did NOT want to buy a robot vacuum cleaner. It sounded stupid and ridiculous to both of them.\n\nAs soon as they saw it work they changed their tune. Now, when people come to the house, my Mom says, ""Do you want to see my new vacuum cleaner!?!"" My wife just shakes her head every time the robot starts up. Last week she told me, ""I thought this was going to be a huge mistake, but I LOVE this little robot. It does a really good job!""\n\n*NOTE: The first few times we vacuumed the robot had trouble getting the house mapped. There were also a few places where it kept getting stuck. I used the app to block off a couple of areas and since then I think it\'s only gotten itself stuck once!* \n\n*Also, even with the auto-empty dock, you still need to do a little maintenance every month or two. And every six months or so it recommends that you change out some of the parts. We found some cheap replacement parts on Amazon.*', ""None: It does take 10 seconds to empty the robot but I think you miss the problem with NOT having an auto empty vacuum.\n\nI have two robot self empties, one upstairs and one down stairs. I have 4 cats and 2 dogs and my house is about 4000 SQ feet or so. There's no possibly way in earth I could have any robot vacuum without self empty. It would go out and run for 30 minutes and stop waiting for ME to empty it! It couldn't work for what it needs to do. With one in each floor, they go out every other day and fully clean their floors. Every room, all 2000 ish SQ feet each. They go out, come back to recharge and empty at least 4  times per run. \n\nThat's the advantage to self empty, totally worth it. I'd never waste money on a non self empty unless it's job was a single room, say your at home office and that's it. And mine don't use bags so there's no maintenance costs. Thing is a life saver, I hardly have to vacuum anymore"", 'muddytodd: > I think people over emphasize the auto empty stuff.

Emptying the bin multiple times a day is a PITA.', 'brdwyxstar06: This was very helpful. Yes, unfortunately with Black Friday deals, anything that fits that criteria will be around $1k or more.

I\'ve grown into a life of luxury with my Shark Apex and my Roomba that I never have to detangle stuff... well, the Narwal definitely needs de-tangling, because it\'s a bristle-based brush roll.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDamn thing is quiet though, and it\'s floor mopping is 1000% better than my Roomba M6. I should note I do still have all my robots. I have an i7+ downstairs that cleans the entire floor (30% carpet, 70% large tile), the narwal which mops the tile afterward, and the M6 that sits there, looking onward in despair at how useless its life has become.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRan the M6 maybe a dozen times before I got the Narwal. The M6 was instantly obsoleted by the Narwal on the first run. I cannot begin to tell you how much nicer the Narwal Freo is at mopping, but in short, if you ran your M6 10 times on your floor, the Narwal Freo would still think it was dirty and do 2 passes. AND the Freo is faster and quieter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will say, I still wonder about the Roborock since VacuumWars says it\'s the best, but it\'s also louder than the Freo.

GET THE NARWAL!

I think the bundle gives us a better vacuum and a better mop, but would be more of a hassle for changing the mop pads daily? And if I understand well, with the OMNI, the pads would self clean? If I always leave the pads on the OMNI, would it be able to vacuum the rest of the flooring without mopping? I understand it would skip the carpet.

Not sure if mops would be worth the additional cost if it's not as good as manually mopping. I feel like mapping would be handy, I at least don't want the vac to be constantly crashing against the walls.

I have been researching a bunch about robot vacuums and currently narrowed it down to:

-Eufy G30 (no mapping just history map)
-Eufy X8 (mapping, 
-Dreamebot Z10 (obstacle sensor, self cleaning, mapping)
-Dreamebot D10 (self cleaning, mapping)

Also heard good things about:
-Roborock s5 (but I can't seem to find any online in Canada? Or at least at a budget price)

It keeps bumping and climbing on the thin black metal legs, which causes the paint to come off.

So I am looking for a new robot with Lidar, as I think all Roomba will have the same problem, because of VSLAM. I even see reviews where the J7 uses its bumper first and not always slows down.

For several reasons (mainly privacy) I don't really want a Chinese brand. I hope I can say this without insulting anyone. That certainly is not my intention. So no Roborock, Ecovacs etc. I feel more at ease with a European or American brand. I am aware that European and American brands can also have privacy-issues, but I still prefer this.

Neato might be an option, but the reviews on the D8, D9 and D10 don't really convince me. I know of Blaupunkt, but info on that is not very widespread.

Wanting to get my first robovac, and feeling pretty confused, so I have a few questions I was hoping you could help with:

1. Is it worth spending more? Will a £1000 guy really do that much better than the £500 guy?


2. Is it worth getting a self empty station?


3. What is the best mid-range?
Amazon has a few self empty options that seem decent, but I honestly have no clue:

Dreame D10 plus

Will certain high end vacuums clean better? Probably. One example is that the roborock s7 Maxv ultra has more power than the s7+ (I believe), but I think most people want it for its auto cleaning mop dock (which you may not care about) or it’s obstacle avoidance.

Any help is appreciated! I know this is a strange dilemma. Thanks for reading!

The eufy also uses random vacuuming and not mapping.

So I'm looking for a vacuum:

A) gets around obstacles such as chairs etc very well

B) Doesn't vacuume in a haphazard ping pong fashion

C) A remote is a plus, alexa not necessary 

D) under 500 dollars

Why am I considering switching then? Valetudo compatibility. 

Dreame/Valetudo: 

Pros: 
privacy. 
Longevity (I provide my own hosting so they can’t shut off function by killing their servers). 

Cons:
Probably a bit more expensive in the end due to getting the S7 very cheap. 
Time spend maintaining Home Assistant and Valetudo. 
No bag-less option. 
Possibly less performance?
Less polished app. 

Roborock: 
Pros: great performance. 
Polished app. 
Ready to go out of the box. 
Bagless. 

Cons:
Possible privacy issues.  
Server could be shut off and I’d be reduced to minimum features.

Since I have a 3 months old daughter who’s gonna “wipe“ the floors soon, I want to keep them clean.

We will vacuum and mop the floors every 2 weeks if we get a robot anyways, but I want to get one anyways.

We all know lots of toys are gonna be around, so I can’t decide if I should get a Z10 Pro with a base-station which has a 3D camera to recognize toys and stuff, or get a W10 to have cleaner floors because of the rotating mops?

We have about 150m2 of hard floor and one small carpet, across two floors.

Which one would you suggest?
I’d love the W10 Pro which has both but its kind of out of our budget.

I guess Z10 Pro could be the better, because I just want the mops to pick up the dust off the floors. I guess none robot-mop can remove stains from the floor.

Which one would you suggest?"	0	[]

It seems to be the most feature-packed at this price range and also has a really good discount going on in Best Buy right now. Compared to the roborock s7+ which is similarly priced, I like the fact that it has obstacle avoidance since parts of my floor are covered with wires. However, looking through the reddit comments, it seems like there are a lot of problems with ecovacs vacuums. I was hoping some of you may have tried this new model and can help answer a few questions:

1. Did they fix the issues with mapping (maps not being saved or getting skewed) and sensor malfunctions with the new models?
2. Does the object recognition work well, especially with wires?
3. On that note, is the AIVI tech a substantial improvement over the laser based object avoidance in the T8+? The T8+ is also being heavily discounted right now and is $200 cheaper. $100 cheaper with the Ozmo pro attachment.
4. Does it work with washable microfiber mops and are they readily available?

So you need to allow the vacuum to map your home once and never use ""Auto"" function after that.

Not 100%, but almost 96-97%: cables, children toys.\n* I prefer the mode with laser comparing to the one with a camera - don\'t like the camera on the wheels in my place. And it works great in the dark.\n* Washing works good, but (!) you need to set a notification to replace the mop every 10 -15 min to wash effective.

So far both seem pretty equal to me, but I have some doubts on how their mopping ability on multifloor environments works.

We live in a house with 2 floors, aprox. 66 sq. meters each floor. The base will be set up in the lower floor, but I wonder how mopping would work on the upper floor since it can't return to the base to replenish the water by itself. Will it have enough water in the deposit to mop the floor, or would I need to carry it down to the lower floor a few times to replenish the water?"	2	['PriusDriver007: Get both lol. One for each floor. But on the real I would go with the L10S just because it dries the mopping pads after cleaning them. It should have enough water to clean both floors, but the other reason it returns to base is to clean the mops in between mopping runs, so you should be okay using it on both levels?', 'ososxe: That would be a solution, and a great comparison test! But sadly, no budget for it..\nNot sure how much water it uses for mopping per square meter, or how often it cleans the pads during a run, but if it can do the upper floor without having to touch base, it would be great']

I’ve just moved into my first house, which has linoleum in the kitchen and breakfast area. I’m interested in purchasing a mop-only machine, but I’d rather it not have a room-mapping function. I know that sounds silly, but I just find it creepy. I wouldn’t mind it being connected to Wi-Fi, though I’d prefer it not be. I’ve been looking at the Brava Jet 240, but I’m concerned that the pads won’t clean adequately since they don’t agitate at all, just scoot along. Does anyone have any suggestions for other non-mapping mops? Thanks in advance!	5	['FlashyCow1: I robot scooba (if you can find one on ebay). It sweeps first, then scrubs and squeegee dry.

I really like the mopping and self clean ability of the Roborock, but every video I’ve seen has shown poor performance of hair pickup from carpet. The Roomba doesn’t have a good mopping kit, and the navigation is not as good as roborock’s, but the hair performance seems miles better on carpet.

I know of that several S7 owners have replaced the rubber roller brush with the Q5 brush, and that seemed to improve the carpet hair pickup performance. I was wondering if this would be comparable to the Roomba carpet performance after the Q5 brush change. Does anyone have insight into this?

Primarily concerned with my own hair (long) and two ragdolls cats who will be coming early next year. Ragdoll hair seems particularly long compared to the average cat. If I had no carpet I would definitely get the Roborock but as of now, I’m leaning towards the Roomba based on the carpet hair performance.

The model is ""Shark AI Ultra Robot Vacuum with Self-Empty Base - Model UR2500SR"" on their website, but the Model under the Shark itself is ""Model UR250BE0US"". I'm assuming these are the same thing?

I only ask because I'm trying to find replacement rollers/brushes/filters to have as back up when needed.

It also did not come with a manual, which was weird. 

I'd also like to know if this has cliff detection.

Any recommendations on replacement parts would be awesome thanks!"	3	"[""st3ph3n: I reckon it most likely does have cliff sensors, but you can check if you flip it over.

Shark IQ uses cameras so you need the lights on or it will constantly run into things, and has a rudimentary mapping system, Shark AI uses LIDAR, maps quickly and accurately and can run in the dark since its navigation uses lasers and doesn't need light. We had a Shark IQ for years and it did well for the price but was constantly getting stuck in random places or didn't always find its way back to the dock. We upgraded to Shark AI this year and the improvements have been substantial in cleaning and the software has been much better. The brush size should be the same but if you want to be safe I know Amazon sells spare parts for both Shark IQ and Shark AI."", ""SarawrAU: Thanks, I noticed the filters inside are a different size though (the round one), granted I think that's because we had the Shark IQ with XL dustbin, this one seems smaller.

-	Self empty station 


-	On demand cleaning 


-	Very good obstacle avoidance


-	Handle more than 60 m^2 (500-600 sqft)

Can someone explain what makes some models 10 times more expensive than others? What are the key features that I should be looking at? Are there brands I should avoid? 

My budget is probably 500-800 bucks, but could be flexible. I have a 1500sqft apartment with mostly hardwood floor and some rugs/carpets."	12	"[""rhtufts: We just got a Roborock S7 maxv plus. It's pretty amazing and so far we really love it. Part of why it so expensive is the auto rising and vibrating mop and also the front camera ai obstacle avoidance. You can get roborocks for half the price but you will lose stuff like the mop or obstacle avoidance or auto self empty bin.\n\nWe recently bought and then returned a week later a Roomba J7 + we loved our 10 year old roomba and this new one was pretty amazing but it started squeaking horribly within days. Tried to fix the squeak but couldn't so we got our money back. Other than the squeak it was pretty great also but had no mop. It did seem a little better on carpet than the S7.\n\nFigure out the features you have to have and what you can live without and then watch reviews of the bots in that price range. 500 to 800 will buy a VERY nice full featured robot.\n\n.02"", ""Itchy-Ad1005: What makes the difference in price: Features Brand Name and tgat companies marketing strategy.\n\nMy suggestion is to go to the various review/comparison sites and watch the videos.  After you've watched the videos decide on your must have features.  Then start narrowing down the field.  I personally like tge YouTube channel Vacuum Wars\n\nAs an example my house has all stone, hardwood and tile floors with a few throw rugs so carpet cleaning wasn't as important as handling the hard floors i have.  Ive got 2 dogs that shed and bring in a lot of stuff from the outside.  Being good at hair/fur was really important.  Next I didn't want to babysit the bot and have to empty it several times a day.  That means the self empty feature was really important.  When I bought it mopping was just being introduced on separate bots.  Today I'd have to consider getting one that mops but I'm not sure if they are really ready yet though I have been looking at the new very expensive Debot.  Finally after looking at all the reviews it got down to price for value received. \n\nI bought a Shark Auto Empty 3+years ago over a similar Roomba.  It was about 1/2 the price.  It wasn't as good especially in navigation but this didn't outweigh the price savings.  Prices gave continued to drop and I now could by a similar model from an other companies for upto 1/2 the price i paid.  A bot is probably good for 5-8 years but with the rate of technological change you are probably looking at an upgrade in 3 -5 years."", 'S3ndy: Thank you all! Sounds like self emptying, mopping, and navigation are key features that cost premium. I think My priority is not having to babysit the bot, so good navigation and self emptying are things I want. Mopping is probably less important to me. In that case, do you guys have recommendations in the 500-800 range? Also I don’t have pets but I live in a busy city so dust is an issue🤪', 'FunAd5677: Firstly you need to know any robot vacuum is perfect from cheapest to most expensive right now. If you don’t consider this, no vacuum can satisfy you. But it is better to have a non-perfect robot than don’t have any. \n\nThen you should consider do you want auto empty station or not. I think it is less important than the vacuum itself. I mean it doesn’t make sense to buy cheap robot with auto-empty. Since you don’t have very big apartment probably you don’t need auto empty if your budget is limited.\n\nDon’t take spesific features too seriously. (osmo pro 2.0, ai obstacle avoidince, matrix mapping, 3D map etc.) For an example you won’t ever use Roborock S7maxV as a walkie-talkie probably and 3D maps are really useless.\n\nAny robot vacuum is good with high pile carpets and rugs. Even the most expensive one. If you have shag carpets, probably the robot won’t clean it.\n\nWhile watching reviews on youtube, don’t be fooled secret sponsored videos. I saw a 20min video that all says shitty Viomi is better than Roborock S7.\n\nDon’t worry about Pa value too much. You will see Xiomi robot with 4000 pa and Roborock with 2500 pa. Xiomi is better? No. Pa is important but not alone. Robot also need power to function which indicated by W.\n\nI think it is more important to robot has good app than suction power, especially you are kinda obsessed person. You can go crazy about robot’s behaviour. I have deebot t9, it is pretty good but the app is horrible. On the other hand are other brands apps flawless? Ofc not. Like I said, every robot has a problem.\n\nIf your carpeted areas seperate the hardwood and you want robot to mop, roborock S7 or upper model are only choice because of mop lifting feature.\n\nThere are tons of things about vacuum robots as you notice. You need to do research deeply, good luck!', 'lil12002: How do you like the mopping? I need a machine just for mopping have no carpet in our home, just 1 single story 2000 sq ft home.

If not, what would be a better alternative?"	5	['mvbenz: I used to have a shark iq and when it died after 1 year I went with the iRobot select program which gives you the j7+ plus supplies and their premium support for $29 a month. I did the two year agreement and if I stick with it for three years I can upgrade the unit to whatever they are offering at that time. It is a subscription so they are giving you the robot and base but if your stop paying the unit ceases to function. \n\nI have two dogs, one of which is 180lbs with long hair and an under coat. He’s an Anatolian / Great Pyrenees mix. The J7 runs daily and I go thru a bag every two weeks so the $29 a month subscription is worth it to me. \n\niRobot mapping and support are superior to the shark. \n\nThe j7, if I don’t do weekly maintenance like cleaning the rollers, tap out the dust bin filter between changes and in general wipe the dirt paths out, it will leave fur turds when transiting from floor to rugs. Again I’m in an extreme situation with the one dog so I’ll just pick those up. \n\nThe j7 is a bit noisy. With fresh rollers they will make a flap flap noise on wood/vinyl floors until they wear in a bit. The auto bin empty is extremely loud but one lasts a few seconds. \n\nThe obstacle avoidance is great. Since getting is maybe six months ago it only sucked up one chewed/shredded dog toy the matched the color of the rug it was on. I don’t think I could have seen it. 🙂\n\nOther than that it’s never gotten tangled on cords. \n\nThe suction is a bit weak compared to the shark but the shark had a different pickup roller than the I robot. Honestly I like the iRobot pickup roller concept. \n\nThe scheduling feature is better in the iRobot compared to the shark iq I had. The shark only gave me one schedule. I can do multiple with the iRobot and individual rooms. There is also an option to do 1 or 2 passes in a room. I usually do two and it does the room in one direction (up/down) and then the other (left/right). \n\nOne thing to note is I use the schedule to hit certain rooms throughout the day so it empties more frequently and gets a charge between each. With the dog I needed to empty more frequently. The schedule requires you to have 3hrs between them so if I have it do one run at 8am, the soonest the next run could happen is 11am. \n\nWhen I had the shark I used Alexa to schedule multiple rooms throughout the day and that worked for the most part. I’m going to look at using Alexa again on the iRobot to get around the three hour window issue. \n\nThere is only one side brush on the iRobot unlike the shark that has two. I would prefer two side brushes but it is what it is. \n\nThe iRobot obstacle avoidance takes a picture of the item it thinks is an obstacle and at the end of the run you can review and tag as temporary or not. I stopped tagging as it was things like clothing, shoes and cords. \n\nI have the M6 mop and can schedule a tandem run with the J7 so when the vac is done the mop kicks off. \n\nBefore I got the I robot I was looking at a roborox s7 with lidar. Only reason I went iRobot select was the premium support. I used the support on the M6 once and it was great. They diagnosed the issue within an hr and sent me a new battery. Sharks support just sux. \n\nHope this helps.', 'Outlaw04: Shark AI does the same thing for much less $$', 'aBitchINtheDoggPound: The subscription program looks great but I’m not clear on what happens after the two year commitment if you don’t continue to subscribe. Is there never a point where you actually own the vacuum and it will work without the subscription?', 'Leading_Release_4344: Actually they do very different things. The shark ai does not have a forward facing obstacle avoidance camera. If there’s dog poop it’ll run right over it.', 'mvbenz: Stop paying, stops working. They are basically giving you the unit. \n\nIf you keep the subscription for three years then you can get the later model as an upgrade. \n\nWhat interested me was the support and supplies. This unit gets a workout daily so if it busts, I just call them and they will take care of it. I don’t have to go but a new one. \n\nIt’s a pay to use setup. \n\nLike I have a Microsoft 365 subscription that I pay $108 a year for 5 people and as long as I pay the software works. When I stop paying the software stops working. But I get support and all upgrade. \n\nI did the same with photoshop as I used to have a photography biz.

Glad I found the sub is there is a lot of really good information. I have a question and hopefully folks can enlighten me. I am looking at replacing my iRobot on my 8+ at Costco. The reason I love Costco so much as I am on my fifth replacement of this particular model, and they just keep allowing a return so anytime it doesn’t act quite right I return it for a new one. When I went there today, I noticed that they will not be restocking these anymore as I am assuming it is going to be discontinued. They do have the shark model UR2500SR for $399. I have looked at a lot of review videos about the shark AI ultra but they are all different model numbers. I know Costco and Sam’s many times have a special model number but I am trying to equate this to the actual model on sharks site. Could anybody let me know which model that would be? Thanks!	1	"['SnooDrawings7662: Its really hard to say-\n\nThe only thing I can say for sure is that the  \n\n""URXXYYZZ"" \n\nUR = Warehouse Model (Costco, Sams Club, BJs, etc..)  \nXX = same as major model..  10 = vslam (gen 1, 2)  25 = lidar (gen 3)   \nYY = who the heck knows, could be anything.   \nZZ = AE means ""auto empty""  .. anything else means not autoempty  \n\n\nBut you get the confusing situation where UR could be same as RV or  AV or AX or ??   \nThe UR means you have no idea. :(   \nThe XX is consistent.  \nThe YY -- this is tough. from UR2500SR .. then  YY is  00.. .. so it could be 10 or 05 or 02 or 01 or ... who knows..  the UR + YY is just..

The closest thing that competes is the Deebot X1 Omni, however I believe there is now a Dreame robot similar too. They all have Ai, vacuuming, mopping, and will self empty and clean its mop.\n\n However I believe most will agree that Ecovac deebots have many.... Quirks. They generally are ok, but personally I would rather just get the roborock. Roborock pretty much has the best software and customizability, with irobot being second. Irobots software is interesting in that it can talk to the matching mop, and can even suggest areas of concern and focus cleaning as needed if that's if interest.\n\nThe best robot for vacuuming alone is probably the Roomba j7+, and its new brother the j7+mop. While they now have a mop option with the j7 as well, it does not self clean like the above. The Roomba j7 has better Ai than the roborock if you have pets, it has a pet owners official promise (poop), if it hits pet waste in the first year of owning it, they will replace it. You also have the option to subscribe/rent it, everything included, even insurance for a monthly fee. \n\nThere is also the Samsung jetbot Ai+. Again it is not perfect, and only has a vacuum option, but if you have 90%+ hard flooring, it may be a better option. All the robots here have great pickup and cleaning, however the Samsung has a large soft brush roll that works best specifically for hard floors. It also has a very good Ai system, and is the only robot other than Dyson and iLife to use Cyclones to help keep the filter clean, if more fine dust is a concern. \n\nKeep in mind however, this can all be subjective and can depend on the user and your situation.

That's thanks to their dual roller system, Twice the mechanical cleaning action of all other robots on carpet. \n\nIf you have all carpet, their S9 is their best cleaning robot as it has the most powerful suction, and dual rollers that are almost double the size, however you lose the AI features and better mapping of the updated j7. Rumours have it, they are going to make a J9.

I am thinking something like 5 or 6 inches in diameter in the shape of a hockey puck but operates just like the Roomba, robo rock or the likes. It would be great if it self emptied into a base too 🫣. I am thinking this would be great for like an RV camper, or a small room, but can't find a product like it! 

Also, I wonder if having a mini-me work in tandum with a regular robot vacuum would mean it can get into the  small spaces and further reduce hand vac effort"	0	[]

Robothelpthrow	2	y5gsjs	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/y5gsjs/budget_vacuum_with_anticollision_recommendations/	"Hi, I'm after some advice please. I recently bought the Coredy R580. It seems to do a good enough job but it keeps colliding into walls at full speed, over and over again. It's really loud. It's driving me mad and I live in a flat with thin walls so my neighbours must also hate me. So I'm planning on returning it.

I'd like to replace it with a vacuum that can detect walls and not bump into them. That's all I need. Mopping feature would be a plus but not essential. Anything else is a plus, but again, not essential. I can't really afford more than £300, but ideally I don't want to spend more than £250.

I know roborock is recommended here a lot but it's difficult to find in the UK. I've had a look on this sub but it's so overwhelming, US centric (a lot of products not available here for some reason), and there are so many conflicting views. 

I'm looking at possibly the Deebot n8 (on sale atm for £210), proscenic 850t,  or the eufy g30. Does anyone have any advice/experience with these, or other recommendations?

I've had the trifo max pet for 3 years now and the battery life and power of it has dropped off a cliff so I'm in the market for a new vaccum.

We have a kid on the way so keeping costs low is an important thing but also freeing up my wife's time while she is on maternity leave.

So I'm trying to work out if the n8+ is a suitable model Vs forking out an extra £300 for the t10.

The main points for us right now are

1. Ability to self empty. 
2. No massive trouble with dog hair. 
3. Cost

So the vacuum needs an app, and seems to need wifi. Can both be via the same appliance or won't this work? If not, what can I still get out of this robot if it doesn't work? 

Other suggestions? I found a few other robots that seem to work without, but their vacuuming and routing seems to be worse (only chaos mode, can't get over low obstacles). Laser guided navigation is not an option it won't fit under my radiators and some furniture."	0	[]

After doing some research I realized my brushes were pretty bad. I have a few general questions about these brushes, and how I can hopefully fix it.	LankyVermicelli8	2	y54vn3	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/y54vn3/having_some_issues_with_my_roborock_e4_every_160/	"If you don't wanna read the whole thing, here are the important questions I have:

\-Tired of breaking brushes. Could I switch to brushless easily enough?

\-When brushes break, can you use something else of same or different material?

\-can I replace a 12v motor with a similar on with a different device? I tried this with a different brand. It failed but almost definitely my fault. 

\-during the aforementioned process, I took off some solder and replaced it. Didn't look great but it spun for about 5 seconds

\-Are there any DIY materials that work? I was thinking of using some sheet copper i have, or maybe romex or speaker wire, but I don't want to overload it or anything.

\-Roborock recommends doing a factory reset. However, as far as I can tell that's not a thing with the E$

Thanks. Maybe have more questions later. Sorry if this is vague, but I'm a little disheartened after so many failures. I love this little pain in the ass."	0	[]

They all tend to just stop charging and/or lose connection to the app completely after about a year.

Currently looking at either another i7+, the newer j7+ or the ecovacs t10+

The ecovacs having the mop attachment is a plus, as we have a large area that is mostly/only tile.  However, i have heard their app/software is pretty crappy.

The j7+ looks to have lower reviews on [rtings.com](https://rtings.com) and others, but seems to be the replacement of the i7+ as far as i can tell.

The i7+ still shows to be the highest rated for our use case on [rtings.com](https://rtings.com) but having to pay the warranty cost every year to year and a half is getting really old.

&#x200B;

Needs/wants - easy app usage, ability to get at least sort of close to corners, self emptying, mop attachment is a plus

Dont need obstacle avoidance as we mainly run while we are home, and our dogs dont really have accidents anyway.

Regular_Barracuda314	2	y3tt6l	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/y3tt6l/upgrade_fail_from_eufy_11s_to_g30_switch_to_roomba/	"I had an Eufy 11s for years that I was very pleased with. I had to replace it’s components (including battery) several times but it wasn’t a big deal because it was easy and parts readily available. It would start, run without complaint, and do a pretty good job. Every couple of months it would fail to make it to the base station, but no big deal. 

I upgraded to a G30 Edge because I liked the 11s so much. I have been less than impressed so far. The app is lackluster (and it doesn’t have a remote for basic use), it fails to get to the base station 50% of the time, I think the random cleaning of the 11s did a better job because the mapping sucks and the vacuum doesn’t recharge and continue as expected, its constantly complaining that I need to clean its sensors (which I then do), and my long hair tangles it weekly minimum. Stark difference in satisfaction between the two models. 

My question is do I stick with Eufy and go for an X8 or jump ship to Roomba? If so, which model?

1000 square feet of hardwood, a couple low rugs, house is kept very tidy and was previously robo-vacuum proofed by securing all cords etc. No pets, two clean adults, one with long hair. If it matters, any kind of Alexa type stuff is wasted on me. I use homekit (but not siri) for home automation. I’m capable of adding products via Home Assistant or Homebridge if supported. I’d be more than happy with a remote that has a start button though."	5	"['Informal-Candle9180: I am unsure about the X8, however it seems to be a decent bot but I would recommend having a look at what Roborock has to offer just to be safe. If you don\'t care about mopping, have a look at their Q-series. Of course you can\'t go wrong with an S-series if you can find one In your budget. I would personally stay away from the S5, as that is an older model and does not have some of the new features. As for the Roomba, if you have a cluttered home, I\'m not sure if I could recommend a Roomba, due to their camera navigation not being as smart as Roborock\'s and maybe even the X8\'s. I own a Roomba i6 and it works for me. I use it in a small space. It does sometimes bounce back and forth on my chair leg and table leg, which I feel like is typical behavior for Roomba. But if you have a fairly ""simple"" home where you feel like a robot shouldn\'t have trouble navigating, I would recommend the Roomba i3. I think Roombas have trouble navigating in tight/awkward spaces. If you can, get a Roborock. If you can\'t, I think the Roomba i3 wouldn\'t be the end of the world.  \nPS: None of the models I\'ve mentioned actually have a remote. I think Roborock has the best app. I believe the only Roomba model that supports the remote that they still make is the 692/694, which wouldn\'t be worth upgrading to from the 11s.

There's videos on YouTube about mopping tests so you could also check those out.

It doesn't raise that high though, so it really only for for low rugs. The S7-series also vibrates the mopping pad, which i'm not sure if they really clean better than the other Roborocks, but it's still there.

1665668856.0	13-Oct-2022 06:47:36	Doing research. Curious to hear some peoples opinions on the models I’ve looked at today.	Balmong7	2	y2z7cv	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/y2z7cv/doing_research_curious_to_hear_some_peoples/	"For starters, my house is primarily hardwood with some rugs here and there, and carpeted bedrooms. I own cats and The bedrooms are generally closed off, so if I am vacuuming them I will be explicitly initiating vs having a schedule. 

I initially was just planning on buying the Roomba S9+ and the Braava M6 for my hardwood floors. Then during my research found out the S9 and Braava can’t avoid objects like cat toys or puke. My wife is also pregnant so childrens toys will soon be joining that list of things the robot needs to avoid. I know the J7 exists and can avoid objects but that doesn’t fix the Braava mop not being able to avoid potential hazards.

I then discovered the Ecovac N8 Pro. All the reviews I’ve seen are incredibly positive. Has anyone used this? Does it work for you? How does it perform on real hardwood vs tile? I’ve always used special formulated hardwood floor cleaners and the idea of just using water is odd to me. Can I put a formulates cleaner in the Ecovac N8 Pro?

I was all set to go for the N8 and I saw a couple comments that complained about issues with the mop attachment causing the dock not to connect properly and complaint about having to remove the attachment to vacuum rugs and carpet.

So then I found the Ecovac X1 Omni and the Roborock S7 Max. Which both seem to have really good performance. But are also expensive enough that I will need to wait for a sale before ordering (which is fine I’m in no rush) my big question with these two is whether or not their performance is that much better than the N8 to be worth the price increase? 

It sounds like the roborock is easier because it can transition from hardwood mopping to vacuuming carpet with ease.But I’ve seen people say something about it not drying the mop attachment on the base, which I assume means I would need to get that attachment removed after it runs so I can clean/dry/replace it. 

So yeah. I’ve watched some YouTube reviews, read some online reviews. Now I want some Reddit real people reviews.

While it's not a top of a line robot it works better than another that I have owned (roomba s9, roborock s6max, and deebot T8 all of which I returned) Sure you have to switch out the mop everytime you use it and the app is clunky but I picked it up for $500 with a delf empty base and I don't have to vacuum or mop my house for a month so it's worth it to me. I have a 2yr old at home and the toy issue isn't a big one, just have to tidy up a bit before sending it out. My issues with the top of the line $1000+ modles is for that money they should work flawlessly everytime with routine maintenance and last a long time but they don't in my experience. So I opted for a cheaper version and I have had it for a month with zero issues. It also handled hair well, my wife had hair all the way down her back and there is minimal hair wrap on the brush.

Basically, the RR performs better but with no drying of the mops by the dock, you’ll need to decide if you live in a place where it’ll be fine to dry or want to take the pads on and off (which would negate the main reason to get the RR, you can leave the pads on all the time with it’s lifting capability).\n\nThere is a new dryer module, but it’s been out of stock constantly. It just came back in stock on Monday and went out of stock a few hours later. So I’m not taking that into account due to it being a unicorn for now lol. \n\nThe RR also has a removable water tank on the vacuum, which I like so I can make sure no mold, calcium, etc. builds up. \n\nSo Omni really for clean dock look and mop pads dryer.

They have multiple brands including roboroc and shark (not going to recommend that at all) at Costco. I got them both there. The robot was a special model that has longer battery and cost the same as the i7+. The braava came with a full size bottle of soap, disposable pads and washable pads.

Unless you find yourself having to walk around a lot and need to avoid the damp floors.\n\nBut - aside from vomit and pet waste (admittedly, a big aside) - obstacle avoidance on pad-style mops isn't an issue because they don't have spinning brushes that cords and cat toys will wrap around.

PansexualSatan	2	y2jrzi	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/y2jrzi/buying_my_very_first_robot_vacuum_and_i_need_some/	"Hello fellow humans. I am in need of some real help from some real people. 

TL;DR (I’m putting this here for those who don’t want to read the entire long post): I’m trying to choose a robot vacuum from Amazon, it must be able to pick up human hair and dog fur from tile floors. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Okay, so I have never owned a robot vacuum before but I have wanted one for a long, long time. Now that Amazon is having a sale and I have about $300 in amazon credit, this seems like the best time to get one. Only problem is there are so many options and I have been sitting here reading reviews for hours and I can’t decide because of course the reviews are all conflicting and confusing. I think I’ve narrowed it down to two but I am open to any other suggestions if there’s something you think is better (I do have some wiggle room on the price, as I’d like one that will work and also last). So here’s what I’m looking at now:

1. Roomba i4 + EVO ($400 with prime deal & comes with a free 3rd gen echo dot / listed price $667.98)
2. Shark RV1001AE IQ Robot Self-Empty XL ($400 / list price $600)

I live in a 2 bdrm/2bath apartment, approximately 1000sq ft. I’m a single parent with a teenager and a fluffy little yorkie mix. We all shed. Between the 3 of us, we shed a lot! There is always hair and fur everywhere. I hate vacuuming and you know the teen won’t do it so I think it would be nice to have one of these around to help me out a bit. We are quite messy, which is also part of why I put off buying one of these for so long but I’m hoping that having this will motivate us to pick up our shoes/clothes/etc off the floor. I’m tired of living in an apartment full of clutter and hair/fur. Would be great to be able to walk around barefoot in my house. I have a bona for washing the floors but it doesn’t work as well when there’s hair everywhere! Oh almost forgot to add, our apartment is all tile, no carpet or rugs.

Anyway, I think the most important thing is that it can handle picking up all the hair and fur without clogging up or anything. Ill be honest, I am not at all familiar with the Shark brand. I’ve wanted a Roomba forever but I think it’s just because it’s the one I’ve heard the most about. But I’m not going to make a choice based on name recognition alone. For all I know, the Shark is just as good or even better than the Roomba. One thing that makes me lean more towards the Shark is that it’s bagless and the Roomba bags are costly. On Amazon, I found a package of 3 replacement bags for $20 and another package with all the other replacement parts for $55. I could not find the Shark replacement filters on Amazon or even by googling it so idk the cost of those; all I found were off brand replacement parts that claim to fit but have mixed reviews on whether they actually do. Also, I’m not sure if it’s safe to use off brand replacement parts. But im clueless about this so if people who know more about it tell me it’s fine then I’m fine with it. I just worry if something goes wrong with a bad part then it will break the vacuum. Regardless, I won’t need to buy bags for the Shark so I assume it will cost less as far as replacements go. Other than that, both of these seem pretty good.

Of course, both have pros and cons. Also, both have an average of 4.3 stars on Amazon. I really just can’t read any more reviews or my head will explode. I don’t know if I can trust random websites who get a percent of every sale; I feel like this just incentives them to try to sell you on a more expensive product rather than what’s really best for you. And I honesty can’t tell what is going on with amazon reviews. I saw several reviews that made no sense. Someone actually wrote “I love it, but it leaves behind clumps of hair” (and many others are very similar to this, with 5 stars but a lot of negative stuff in the actual review). I don’t understand it… why do you love it if it isn’t doing its job? What do you love about it? Are you even a real person? Did someone pay you to put 5 stars but they don’t care what you actually write in the body of the review? I feel like either I’m going crazy or the world is or possibly both. 

So yeah, I need help. I hope there are people here who can help me. I really appreciate any and all information, suggestions, etc. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to respond. You are true heroes!"	12	"['rhtufts: I just bought a Roomba J7+ and really like it so far.\n\nI looked at shark robots and other brands but got the Roomba because of the extreme long life and durability of my old Roomba.

You probably already know this, but:\n\nRobovacs are much weaker than a regular vacuum. To keep your house clean, you need to run them every day. (Or, sometimes, 5/7 days - but with your house as you describe it, 7/7 days is probably necessary...).\n\nTo live with a robovac, you need to make your house robovac friendly. But because you have to run your robovac every day, you need to have your house be robovac friendly every day. Or at least for the part of the day where the robovac is running. \n\nFor everyone, making your house robovac friendly means two things: (1) removing clutter from the floor; and (2) doing as much as you can to get cords up off the floor.  (It might take a while to get the cord thing sorted out). \n\nWhile the above apply to everyone, you\'ll undoubtedly discover some other other issues unique to your house that you can address as it arises - maybe the vac gets stuck behind a particular bit of furniture or goes into a room but closes the door when it tries to leave, etc. You\'ll figure that out. \n\nBut the overall point is that a robovac is just one part of a your ""cleaning system"", and it won\'t do much unless you commit to let it work how it needs to.', 'None: [deleted]', 'LazyBox2303: Shark does not have a good reputation and seems to lose its way a lot.

Do you use off brand replacement parts or only parts made by Roomba (like for the bags, filters, etc)?

I’m just not sure if they’re any good.', 'PansexualSatan: >\tTo live with a robovac, you need to make your house robovac friendly. \n\nHonestly this is the main issue I have and the reason I haven’t purchased one yet even though I’ve wanted one for years. I move a lot and I have boxes still unpacked plus a lot of clutter. I have a teenage son who just throws everything on the floor and a dog who is supposed to be my son’s responsibility but of course, he doesn’t do anything. So I’m constantly cleaning up after both of them. I’m a single parent so I have no help and I live with several mental health issues that make it very difficult for me to keep up with everything. I’m not sure I can even get my place in shape and I won’t buy a robot vacuum just to sit there until I can get it done. So I’ve told myself over and over if I can get my place in order like you explained with all the clutter picked up, wires organized and out of the way, and all that then and only then will I reward myself with one of these vacuums. And honestly, the only reason I could even afford to buy one is because I have been saving up Amazon credits from various apps that reward you for taking surveys, scanning receipts, etc. and with it being on sale, I have enough credit to pay for most of the cost with very little coming out of pocket. But just like my life, my apartment is a total mess and there’s just no way I can use one of these until I fix that. I guess I got a little overexcited because of all the sales and because so many people I know have one; many people have had them for years and it’s something I always wished I could have but I think part of me knew that it would be a mistake to buy one.

Hey guys, update on RoboGem Arlene who we've affectionately renamed Meryl Sweep. I got Meryl in October last year and I cannot stress how much this thing has changed my life. It runs with no issues using the Tuya smart home app. Seriously zero regrets on this machine. Pet hair, dust and other dander is a thing of the past. Great suction on the vac setting and the mopping function is really good even on hardwood floors because you can set how much water you want to use.

I need a robot vacuum/mop because I’m chronically ill. Just saw these on Prime sale but don’t have enough energy to compare all the specs. Looking for a self emptying robot with laser mapping and a good mopping feature. We live in a 80m2 (860 sq ft) apartment with wooden floors. Will be used mainly in the living room for the dirt that our dog brings in 😅 we’ll still have a cleaner come over every couple of weeks for a deep clean.

Thanks a lot!!"	2	['Informal-Candle9180: None of the Roombas except for the j7 Combo and the Combo can mop and there are no Roombas that have have laser navigation.

Anyone who has the Shark AI Ultra Robot Vacuum, is the lidar system enough to keep it from getting scratches and scuffs. I had a old Shark IQ Robot and it would bump and get scratches from paint all over it, I'm just curious if that will happen with this one"	9	"[""Infamous_Self_7533: With lidar, it can map the house correctly on the first run. It is a very nice machine. It's still relies on its bumpers so they will get scuffed up, but less than 10% as much as the IQ version. I like my machine quite a bit. The voice control using Android or Amazon is not very good. The robots are so cheap that they are probably not making enough money to hire good coders to write decent apps."", 'SnooDrawings7662: It\'s supposed to be better - according to all the reviews online.  \nThat being said, if you are an existing Shark IQ robot owner.. i\'m a bit suprised you would consider another one.   \nI\'ve got a UR1005AE which is essentially a AV1002AE - and..  the first 6 months - it was great. but over time, as the app changed and got upgraded, it seemed to have performed worse.   \nThe only ""killer"" feature of the Sharks, is the Bagless Auto-empty... Otherwise, in all areas other options on the market appear to be superior to the Shark  robot vacuums. I\'m rather shocked that no other robotic vacuum maker has implemented the baggless auto-empty base.   \nThat being said, my Shark is going strong since Feb 2021 .. so..  I guess.. it mean.. it still works? so I shouldn\'t complain too much. It has proved to be more reliable and robust than the Neato Botvac Connected that I had before.  \\*when\\* the Neato worked.. it was cleaner.. .but .. it got stuck, it didn\'t have auto empty,,,, the rubber wheels wore out a couple times on my neato - because it would grind the wheels when stuck.. wearing the rubber portion of the wheels prematurely.   The shark is much better at not getting stuck, and it doesn\'t try as hard to recover. Eh.. it\'d be better if the robot didn\'t get stuck in the first place..   which is something the Roborocks are much better about apparently.', 'None: It just lightly bumps stuff. I actually prefer this to the x1 omni I just sent back', ""Luminoux_Venom: I'm hoping that the lidar will be enough that it at least slows down before running full force into a chair leg"", ""Luminoux_Venom: Honestly I wasn't planning on getting this, but I saw it in a retail store. I was able to return my old IQ that's a year old and get this new one for the same price. So I've essentially spent nothing to Upgrade.\n\nI've actually gotten to really like Shark Robot Vacuums. Once I was able to figure all the kinks out I kinda never had to worry about it on the daily."", ""SnooDrawings7662: Haha, cool. if you could return the old one then..  and if it is the same price.. then yeah, it's a no brainer!   \nGood luck ,and let me know how much better the Lidar is.. :)"", ""Luminoux_Venom: It is way better.\n\nNo shame to my IQ bot though. That thing would work its butt off 4 times a week and spend 5 hours total cleaning my house, and even then it would only clean a little more than half of my floor plan.\n\nThis new one seems like an actual machine, it sounds less junky and more industrial, it's more precise in it's movements. And it moves much quicker and charges more meaning it can actually get my entire floor plan.\n\nThe lidar itself is also very nice, the room by room cleaning works so well on this new one, on my old one the room by room cleaning would barely function. Another positive is that the old one used it's front bumpers entirely to clean, meaning once the front bumper got scuffed with enough paint it would just start ramming into objects because the sensors couldn't see. The lidar on the AI means that the lasers can detect objects so even if the front bumper gets coated in paint, the lidar will continue to work and it won't ram into everything"", ""SnooDrawings7662: If you don't mind me asking, which Shark IQ robot did you have before, and which specific model did you replace it with?   \nMy UR1005AE/AV1002AE  only bumps occasionally - mostly into new obstacles - e.g. chair that moved.   The biggest problem I have with the Shark is if anything (it's always socks.. ) is left on the floor by my children - then the Shark  will get stuck - and then it's a treasure hunt to find it, since it doesn't report it's position.-- something i'm a bit jealous of the roborock/dreame models..."", ""Luminoux_Venom: I had one from over a year ago. That one however broke and therefore we were able to exchange it for a new one a few months ago. The most current one I had was the UR1000SR. That one worked pretty well actually. There was a problem I noticed on the IQ models, when cleaning on carpet very occasionally the rotating brushes would get caught and twirl & tangle on the soft brushes located vertically on the sides of the robot. It would also get stuck if I left a blanket or something on the floor. That however is to be expected because you can't really expect it to not get tangled up in that. Whenever it did get stuck I would go in the app and click the locate button, it would make a beeping sound where I could quickly find it's general location.""]"

We have a 2 floor house, about 130 square meters, one floor with ceramic tiles, upper floor with laminate wood in the bedrooms, ceramic tiles in the bathroom. We only have one carpet at the entrance hall, for leaving the shoes on. 

Lower floor is an open space mostly, with a small hall, toilet and laundry room in separate rooms, upper floor is 3 bedrooms, bathroom and hall, not a lot of nooks.

There are no pets in this house, but 2 kids that leave their lego pieces everywhere, ideally I would like that the robot does not vacuum those. There might be some clothes on the floor sometimes, so it would have to avoid that. Oh, and cables too.

Vlad_Godoroja	1	y02wb1	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/y02wb1/i_am_a_student_what_should_i_buy/	I am a university student in Italy and I don't have a lot of time on my hands, but I still like my room to be very clean, so I was wondering which robot I could buy so that every day or two when I am away it could vacuum the floor, and mop it if it doesn't affect the price. My room is about 28 squared meters (or 300 ft^2). The floor is made of a hard material, that seems some sort of tile, non porous, very smooth. There are a few cables here and there and a coffee table that may move from time to time. Thank you in advance.	1	['FlashyCow1: Shark Self empty should be fine but if you want a all in one vac and mop then roborock s7 max would be your best bet.']

Everything works fine, except that it won't take a charge. I've had it sitting on the dock for about 5 hours--the app reports that it is charging, but the battery level is dropping slowly, and the indicator light has been doing the slow flashing red for the entire time.

I've checked all the standard things, cleaning the contacts, making sure that the base is fully plugged in, making sure the outlet works, etc...

Amazon won't offer a replacement (only a refund) and the price of these is now over $100 more than what I paid, so I'd much rather figure out a way to fix it. (Roborock has refused support, since it's refurbished through a third party.)

Personally I genuinely wouldn't worry too much, as your phone, TV, maybe even your car, share more data about you than your robot probably would. Even then, in most cases it's based on your decision on what to share and should be able to adjust that on your account(s). \n\nTheir best overall is probably the j7+, with the cheapest being the i3 and the most expensive being the i9. \n\nThe j7 I believe is on sale on Amazon as of writing this.

So, I've set a schedule that every weekday it should start at 7am, but instead it starts at 4am. It's been super disruptive, so much that I've completely turned off scheduling. I had also set my DND to 10pm to 6am, yet it had still gone off and start at 4am anyway.

Has anyone run into this before? It's like the internal clock is set to PST while I'm on EST."	7	"[""Only_Interaction4860: Yes, I bought a shark iq a couple weeks ago. Had a hard time with it mapping my whole house but after about 7 deletions, i got a correct map. Turned on scheduling for 8 am and it started at 3 am 3 different nights. And that's even with do not disturb mode on between 10 pm and 7 am. I too have turned off scheduling and just use it manually. I thought maybe a time zone was incorrect causing it to be 5 hours off, but i dont see anyway to update time in the app"", 'AnotherObsessiveMom: Yes!!. So we replaced our previous a couple weeks ago. Scheduled cleaning worked 100% of the time w/previous model. I found the issue to be the APP now attaching me to a different time zone. Shark support told me it was likely an app issue and had their tech advisor (supposedly) attempting to reset my time zone in my account. it didn’t work…however,  I set my schedule for 8 AM and it started at 1 AM in the morning. So to test it, I set it to begin at 8 PM and it started at 1 PM. Maybe this is your issue as well??  \nWhile it doesn’t solve the Root problem, at least I have some understanding of what the heck it’s actually doing and have a work around.', 'iamnos: I\'m having a similar issue.  We picked up a couple IQ XLs on clearance and this is my biggest concern.  I initially thought it was a timezone issue as I believe it was 7 hours off, and I\'m in the pacific time zone, so it made sense.  So last week, I adjusted the scheduling and do not disturb to be set for GMT.   Annoying, but I can live with it.\n\nThat worked last week.\n\nToday, one was supposed to run about 3 hours ago and hasn\'t yet and is showing its in Do Not Disturb, which it should be... IF its operating on Pacific Time.   So somehow, I\'m reasonably certain they were on GMT last week, but are now on PDT.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe app did update 5 days ago (new version was released on the 11th for Android).  That was about the last time it ran on schedule, so its possible that the newer version fixes the timezone issue.  Unfortunately there\'s nothing of any value in the ""What\'s New""', 'comFive: Wow. Just wow.', ""comFive: It's definitely not surprising that you're having this issue. \n\nMay I ask what your time zone is? Does this correlate to PST where i think the device and app are locked to?"", 'comFive: Hmmm 🧐 I appreciate your input.', 'iamnos: It does look like the new version has fixed the time zone issue for me.']"

EDIT: I Ultimately went with the shark AI with XL self-empty dust bin... and LOVE IT! I've only had it a few weeks, but 0 complaints so far.


As the title states, my home now holds 5 dogs (2 labs, 1 colli, 1 terrier, 1 mini schnauzer),  2 adults and an unreasonable amount of indoor plants. We understand this is a LOT for our space, and are actively looking for a larger home. The dogs each get hours of attention and playtime every day so please do not worry! 

My little roomba 960 I bought in 2016 just can't keep up anymore, so I'm looking for an upgrade. 

My house contains 3 carpeted rooms, a few low pile rugs, and laminate flooring in a single story. ~1900sqft

My requirements are: self emptying base, can move around objects (dog toys, plants, dog beds, etc), room-by-room mapping and scheduled cleaning, can handle light potting soil spills, dog hair, low pile carpet/rugs and laminate wood flooring. Preferably the new vacuum is quiet as we both work from home every day.

We have little to no interest in mopping capability and would prefer to stay under ~$800 but are flexible.

Please let me know what you recommend!"	10	"['BlaReni: #1 get rid of carpets…. \n\nmany robos cannot handle those well… also it’s easier with the dogs when you can easily vacuum/mop… I have an ecovacs, but it doesn’t deal with carpets well, but is a charm with the corgo and objects.. with your budet you can get something nicer if you drop the carpets…', 'tracymayo: I have the Shark 1000 XL and it does all those things.\n\n2 dogs (husky mixes), 2 teens, 2 adults 2 cats (one long hair) and we love it.. \n\nScheduled cleans, mapping, send to specific room function all of it. \n\nWe run it every other day.', 'TypicalBlox: Roborock s7maxv ultra', ""thewimsey: Roomba J7+.\n\nThe roomba is best for pet hair because of the dual rollers; its front facing camera also has very good object avoidance and comes with an animal waste avoidance guarantee. \n\nIt's $599 right now, on sale (normal price is $799, but it is often on sale).

My budget is about $600 but if there is something that is miles better than anything else and it's $700, I'd get it.  
Also, I am clueless on how the pad on the bottom works (of the S6). Is it wet? Do you replace them weekly? Does it just get disgusting when it goes over carpet/rugs? I've only ever had a eufy and a D7 so never anything with any mopping capability.

Does this seem like a good enough deal to buy now or is it likely that Black Friday or Cyber Monday will have better deals on robovacs?

Our needs are pretty simple - we have 2 cats in a full hardwood apartment and we currently spend \~2 hrs per week sweeping and vacuuming. Mainly looking for a vacuum to collect the hair on a rolling basis. I'm fine with emptying it daily and don't need it to mop for us."	8	"[""wwabc: if you've never had a robot, I'd recommend buying one with mapping capability.  keep-out zones mean the difference between coming home to a clean house vs. coming home to find the dumb robot is stuck under the couch again."", ""thewimsey: I don't think you'll find a much better deal than that; that's a pretty good price.\n\nI used to have the eufy 11 (same model without wifi) and it worked well for me in a similar environment - two cats, smallish upstairs, all hardwood except for a 6x9 area rug. The eufy is better than most cheap robovacs at not getting caught. Although you may need to roboproof your home a bit. \n\nBut if you run it every day, after a week or so you will be amazed how clean your house is. It's kind of shocking. \n\nThere are two downsides to the eufy. The first is that they aren't as rugged as something like a Roomba, so it probably won't last 5 years. It's easy to find inexpensive replacement filters/rollers/brushes online, but not replacement sensors, etc. But ultimately not an issue.\n\nThe second downside is really only a problem if you are home when you run the vac - as an old school robot, it uses a semi-random bump and run way of cleaning. This *works*, but it's not very efficient and so can be annoying if you are home when it runs. (If you're not home, it doesn't matter)."", 'killakeckles89: Noted!

It enters a room and vacuums in long rows, starting, say, at the left edge near a wall and ending at the right edge near the wall. It will then travel to the next room - often not vacuuming over areas it knows it has already vacuumed - and repeats the process in the next room. \n\nA bump and run robot basically goes in a straight line until it bumps into something - a wall, a door, a chair leg - and then goes off in a straight line away from whatever it hit - at a maybe 45 degree angle to where it hit. Imagine a pool ball bouncing off the edges of a pool table. (It\'s not *quite* like that - it will kind of ""feel around"" when it hits an obstacle, so it will clean along the edge of a wall, and it will also feel its way around a chair leg to clean).\n\nSo it takes a little longer to clean (90 minutes vs. 60 minutes in my house), and it will carom all over the house, sometimes entering a room, hitting an obstacle, and leaving it to clean somewhere else.\n\nIt does clean about as well as mapping robots - the bump and run algorithm means that it will almost always cover all of the ˜1000 sq ft in 90 minutes. Imagine a pool ball from the earlier example being self powered and bouncing from edge to edge for 90 minutes - it\'s going to cover the entire surface. \n\nThe eufy is pretty good at detecting obstacles a couple of inches before it hits them and slowing down to just gently tap them; OG Roombas used to hit them pretty hard.', ""killakeckles89: This looks like a pretty good deal - I'm all about refurbs so I'm going to add that to my list to check when the time comes to purchase"", 'killakeckles89: Thank you! The mental image of an OG Roomba smacking into a wall at full speed makes me giggle.\n\nI will be on the lookout for deals on a budget robot with mapping capabilities starting now']"

Whenever the map is reset, it deletes it and draws out a new one. In my case when I last reset the map, robot started up and started mapping as usual except the map details weren't being updated on the app.

A ""the map is being updated, please be patient"" error is shown. I have included a screenshot of this at the bottom of the post.

Other than this the robot is functional.

I thought this may be a software bug so I tried resetting the robot but for some reason it is refusing to be reset as well. Resetting involves holding down the home button for 5 seconds which prompts the start of a resetting procedure - when I hold the button down nothing happens.

I have seen a lot of posts from every brand of robot dying out just past the 1year warranty. The Roomba\'s also won me over because they\'re usually shorter than LiDAR based bots and go under more of my furniture. I tried two LiDAR bots but returned them to Costco. I fully believe in LiDAR though, in execution it wasn\'t superior for me. I know Tesla\'s have some other sensors but they rely a lot on the camera and Elon calls LiDAR a ""crutch"", I have mixed feelings about that. But iRobot has apparently said they won\'t add the structured light sensor like on the S9 to future models as the j7 exceeded their expectations.\n\nI think iRobot could add and others (while adding an object detection camera) could switch to a flat style LiDAR on the body like the iPhone 13 and 14 Pro have next to the camera. I think iRobot could add it and the other could shorten the body of their bots with it to get rid of the hump.\n\nI know the Roomba may have less suction but I love the dual brushes for debris pickup.

They\'ve come a long way, all brands of robot vacuums, and they are almost, and soon will be pretty much perfect.\n\nP.S. the LIDAR AI Shark was one I tried their current app & robot update about bricked it and the past 2-3 months on the Apple app store if you sort by recent there is not one review over 1 star.

“Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo, 2 in 1 Mopping Robotic Vacuum with 2000Pa Max Suction, WiFi/App/Alexa, Schedule Settings, Self-Charging, Slim, Tangle-Free, Ideal for Hard Floor, Pet Hair and Carpet”

Off of Amazon for about $150 a couple weeks ago. 

I only use it for vacuuming hard floors. I have 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 3 kids. 

So far: 
Does fine on hard floors and ultra slim rubber mats 
Its brushes get under rugs so it struggles to the climb over them while it has the edge snagged. 
It will suck up cords and get stuck. 
I programmed it to run daily at 10 pm. 
It runs at 10 am also (I guess it has a 12 hour day) 
We empty the nearly full bin of fur after every use 
It really keeps the fur and dust/sand under control 
It returns to its charger when done 
It’s easy to knock out of position so it’s not charging, we will be moving it because the dogs knock it out of position where it’s based now. 

So far, so good, no serious complaints.

I really wonder if the onboard tank is getting filled up.', 'Hairy-Heart-4302: I created this account just to post an alternative solution. Short version: Lying on the floor to suck with a straw is ridiculous and also ineffective. I got a 5 ml dose syringe at the pharmacy (free of charge in Sweden), but you can get them online for like 1 $/€ including shipping. Took one half syringe of air and then during the 2nd try it started bubbling and eventually water streamed perfectly. Much better than a straw (which I also tried and didn’t work). I had the waste tank removed and also the “Multi-Surface Floor Cleaner” removed as well – and I did not activate self-repair or anything like that just did while the robot was out and nothing going on in the base station.\n\nLong version:\n\nI also had the issue with no water coming to the robot nor base station. Pressing “Plug-in Version Number” 5-10 times and selecting “Base Station Self-Repair” did help after awhile to fill the base station with water. However the robot didn’t fill up. The way you can tell if it does is to tell it to go mop somewhere where you can clearly see and then hit pause -> turn it upside down -> remove the mopping pad (velcro), but keep the plastic holder -> put it back on the floor and hit resume. Then follow it around with a mobile torch or a flash light and listen to the sounds (easier if you put it on mop only and no vacuuming).  It takes a while before it starts pumping out water, like a couple of minutes, then every 20-30 seconds it will try to refill the mopping pads with water and should leave wet stains on the floor when doing so, how often/much depends on which humidity it’s set on I guess. If it doesn’t, there is no water in the robot and you need to try the syringe trick. I pressed down on the rubber in the middle with the dose syringe to open it and just used the syringe like I would fill it with medicine. I hade one of those dose syringes with a bottle adapter so it fit really nicely. Perhaps they should complement the box with syringes lol. Seems to be rather bad testing done since they rolled it out with this issue. I had two Dreame L10s Ultras and the build quality seems robust at first glance, but the two I’ve had are vastly different when it comes to sounds. My 2nd one sound has a low frequency mechanical whine from the motor when the mop pads are twisting and has way worse Wi-Fi connection than the first one. Failed to setup Wi-Fi first try and doesn’t seem to update as often on the map about its whereabouts as my first one did. I exchanged my first cause the straw trick didn’t work for me, wish I had thought about the syringe the first time. So I really hope this will help someone, obviously shouldn’t need to go through the hassle for a robot vacuum with this price, but at the same time it’s only air in the tubes that need to be evacuated, nothing is wrong with the product except for the engineering… Guess it’s the cost of being an early adopter.', 'saskia87: Need to follow this post.

I bought a W455 model a while back, and for the first two months it was fine.  About one tank in and one dirty water tank of output.  However starting about at the two month mark the dirty water pickup rapidly went down.  At the moment, a full clean water tank (500ml?) results in about 2-4 tablespoons of dirty water being vacuumed up. Most of the water is on the floor.  I've been following the maintenance and cleaning schedules exactly.

A shame that this is the only mopper on the market that I'm aware of that actually has the spray & vacuum style clean (as opposed to rubbing dirty water around with pads).  Bring back the Scooba! Or perhaps there's an idea for a kickstarter here.

I’m officially converted, but feel there is room for improvement and am thinking about exchanging this model.  

It often gets stuck on our floor grilles, which is a dealbreaker (it actually just got stuck as I type this). We can’t turn off the cliff sensor because we have stairs and a large landing. The vacuum would certainly jump to its death without the cliff sensor. I realize a vacuum with mapping may help prevent this. Another thing is that the 615 is a bit loud. We mostly have vinyl plank flooring with some low pile rugs. We are going to get a dog soon, so pet hair is the biggest concern. Our space is also small, so self-emptying doesn’t seem necessary.

Because it's always something of an annoyance, so it's nice that it finishes as fast as possible, and it's nice that you can tell it to not clean a particular room if you happen to be in it, and that you could further minimize distractions by having it clean only half of the house each day (although I wouldn't really do that with pets)."", ""Pretend_Swim3927: Skip the roombas I've owned almost $8k worth over 10 years and not one was worth half of what I paid.

Vacuums and vacuum+mops fine, but doesn't want to just mop	IronMew	1	xqkf1m	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/xqkf1m/got_a_mi_vacuummop_p_vacuums_and_vacuummops_fine/	"[This model](https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-mi-robot-vacuum-mop-p-review-1175442/).

If I set it to vacuum it does everything the way it's supposed to, and also if I set it to vacuum and mop. However, if I only set it to mop it tells me to make sure the water tank is present - which it very definitely is, and it damn well knows since it uses it to mop when set to vacuum+mop.

I guess it's not *too* much of a problem, because I can always set it to vacuum+mop - it can't hurt to have it clean *more* - but sometimes I'd rather have it mop without having to hear the vacuum motor all the time.

Any ideas what could be the issue?"	2	['ExtinctionGo: Water tank without the cloth mop , that what it means , this way robot will not enter mopping mode .

This Dreame Z10Pro seems to be the one, but I have a couple questions:

1. Can it 'learn', 'map' or be programmed where it's docking station is located?

My current location is under some shelving in the corner of the room with an entrance that can only be approached from one direction. My current vacuum can never find it and I always return home to a dead vacuum that died searching for its home.

I realise I can move the station to an easier-to-find position, but due to electrical outlet and tidiness, I'd like to keep it there.

2. Does Google Assistant work with it? I'd like to set up a scene where it starts cleaning when I leave the house. I do not use Alexa.

3. How does it fare going from tiled flooring to deep-pile rugs?

Thanks in advance.."	1	"[""DangerouslyUnstable: Yes, it knows where it's docking station is (and has persistent maps of the whole house/whatever areas you give it access to). Where my dock is isn't _that_ hard to access so I can't speak specifically to it getting to very difficult spots. I have seen it occasionally get a bit confused in tight spaces, so potentially your particular spot could be a problem? My guess is it would be fine.\n\nFor the deep pile rugs, I suppose it depends how deep pile. My house is all flat surface floors, with area rugs in a few places. The rug in one bedroom is a particularly deep pile, and the robot just completely avoids it. I watched it try to clean it one time, but it kept inching forwards, reversing, trying a different direction, etc. until it gave up and left the rug. This thing is basically a deep shag carpet though. It does fine on my other (mush less deep pile) rugs.\n\nFor your google assistant question, I don't know if it does or not with the default software/app integration (after a bit of googling, looks like [it does](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0553/1320/3405/files/Dreametech_Robot_Smart_Home_integration_Google_Assistant_FAQ.pdf?v=1642039874)).  \n  \nHowever, if you are relatively tech-savy, and feel like taking on a project, The Z10 pro is compatible with [Valetudo](https://valetudo.cloud/) if you flash the firmware. Valetudo can integrate with Home Assistant, which has Google Assistant integration.\n\nI've been very happy with my Valetudo install, but it does require a non-trivial amount of tech comfort. If you've never run anything in a terminal/command shell, then it may not be for you.\n\nFor me, it was worth the effort as a)I'd rather not have a lidar, camera, and wifi connected device sending data about my home to servers that I don't control, and B) by self-hosting, I know I won't ever lose any functionality in case the internet goes down or if Dreame ever stops supporting the robot.""]"

I just ordered a Roomba j7+ and a Roborock S7 MaxV Plus for my home. I have a very odd house layout with around six floors. 

I’m thinking of using the Roborock S7 MaxV for the Dining Room and Kitchen as that is one of the only rooms without carpet so it needs a good mop, and then the j7 for the family room as it’s all carpet.  

Those are our two biggest areas.  I’m also looking for a few more vacuums if I like the two I just bought, but those areas are much smaller.  

I really like self emptying and object avoidance but I know that it’ll get rather expensive with 3-5 vacuums in that price range.  What would be the best bang for the buck for some good secondary vacuums.

I am not afraid to buy used, that’s how I got a pretty good deal on the S7 MaxV and J7.

Thank you!"	0	[]

Shark updated their app. To where you had to create an account and reset up the shark robot. The model I have is RV1001AE(I think without going to look at the robot).  The point is their app sucks, and even more now. I don't think the new update added any new features. So now I have to baby sit this stupid robot so it can fix the map again. Do you know how many times I had to delete the map and have it start over? Too many times than I should have since we moved, and before that I was still trying to get the map correct at our old place. 

Features like:

* Silent Mode, I'd like to run at night and not disturb the bird. 
* Multiple schedules, Like set a schedule to clean a certain room and to set the power level for that schedule.  

I have a bird and would like to run the schedule more than once near the bird cage. Now I do it manually. I wish so bad I could afford to buy a new smart robot that has these features but I can't right now. I bought this robot while I was still working now due to my health I can't. 

Another thing this robot does is turn its self off. If you have those spring door stops when it goes against the wall it toggles the switch off. Also the robot does not support ifttt app.

I will never buy another shark smart robot again. The robot and the app are both not smart enough.  Anyone else having these issues now after the update?"	4	['katclimber: Shark does suck.

I was delivered a robot with a leaking tank and the robot couldn't pick up water from the ground. The seller (iLife) asked me for more money to send me a replacement tank... I paid. After the new tank arrived, thankfully this time not leaking... the robot continued making a complete mess on the ground spilling water everywhere.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately my customer protection time has ran out, because the seller lied to me that they will fix the problem and I was/am no longer able to open a dispute. Aliexpress customer support is non existent.

When I talk to iLife they keep making me do self repair on the product with useless solutions like adding paper between screws and so on... Nothing so far has worked and the robot doesn't clean anything. All of the water that it sprays out... stays on the ground.

I wasted a total of 5-6 hours on self repair tasks given to me from iLife. Keep in mind that they take forever to respond, because they claim to be forwarding my messages to their engineering team.

They keep repeating the same solution over and over again when I tell them that it doesn't work and **I've come to the conclusion that they are just trying to make me give up on this.**

So now I have a 250$ robot that sits in my closet being useless.

Keep all of this in mind before you buy from iLife.

Totally my fault. But on both occasions the company was super helpful and respectful, and sent me new parts under warranty.

Without that turned on we maybe get half the house completed before it goes back to base with a low battery. It doesn\'t resume now and will restart its routine at its scheduled time the next day.\n\nIt\'s also been getting stuck more often, but that likely has to do with the slowly shifting contents of our house needing to be adjusted back into better positions.\n\nI\'m concerned that the model is showing up on the app as a $150 robot and has key features being removed.

Some use a camera, however most use a Lidar laser sensor now. These machines generally tend to be the more efficient robots, as they can scan the whole room and adapt to a changing environment. Generally speaking in most cases, you will run it once to make a map of your home, that you can then edit and mark to help the robot avoid areas or clean areas. The robot will then make a decision to start cleaning and follow an up-down pattern to efficiently clean\n\nSome of the newest robots take the mapping to a second level, like the Roborock S7MaxV, where its additional lasers and sensors form a more in-depth mapping, allowing it to ""see"" to make a 3d map, add furniture, or adapt on the fly to changing environments. Some of these machines may also have a better learning algorithm, where after multiple cleanings, the robot will figure out the best possible routing for your home, to clean it in the most efficient way possible. Some will also add an AI system like the Roborock S7MaxV where they can detect and avoid accidents or obstacles to keep out of trouble. \n\nA good rule of thumb is that Lidar Laser sensor based machines allow for the most flexibility and customizability. They generally allow for whole home mapping, allowing you to mark and name specific rooms and areas, like the kitchen or living room. They also allow you to add no-go zones or virtual walls for areas you don\'t want cleaned or where the robot might get stuck. Further more they allow an even more impressive feature, like a to-go or sport cleaning zone, where you can draw a box to clean only a specific area anywhere, like in front of your couch because someone got lest crumbs there or something. Some will even allow you to ""deep clean"" and have the robot run several times in different directions to ensure a more thorough cleaning. \n\nThe biggest note here is that some machines, namely the IRobot machines, have all of these features and more, while only using a camera system. While Lidar is more accurate, they still do a very good job anyways, so keep that in mind as your mileage may very \n\nSpeaking of which, it really depends on the robot. Brands don\'t always matter but they give you an idea of that specific robot. For example, Roborock has some of the best software in the industry, meaning they have very good mapping. IRobot is right behind them, but due to using only a camera they sometimes get caught up in some ways, the biggest one being they can\'t run as well at night if there is no light. Lidar lasers don\'t need light, but cameras do. Some cheaper robots use lidar but don\'t have the best software for efficient cleaning. Others have completely weird mapping, like the Dyson or even Samsung JetBots, where they still follow a grid like pattern, but kind of however they feel they want to.\n\nOverall your mileage may vary! \n\nDo a little research on what you want, and what you need. After you do some research make sure to follow it up with reviews. The more good reviews the better, just make sure they are real reviews and not paid reviews.

Got ecovac 2 weeks ago. Has done nothing but give me headaches. The mapping software they use is awful. If anything in your space is altered, the robot can't just update the map, it thinks ""new area detected."" So it deletes your current map and needs to create a new map. You can't clean any custom areas or make any commands until it maps the entire house again. It's so unbelievably frustrating. Also the robot will not be able to find the dock most of the time so I need to carry it. Also,  mapping software and making boundary lines doesn't work most of the time either 

I will be returning it soon and getting robo rock."	2	"[""nitcan: I was debating between this n8 pro+ or a roborock s5 max.

I have short-haired pets and a few long-haired females in my all laminate floor house so I'm hoping to find something that isn't going to constantly need detangling. I previously had a Eufy RoboVac 30c and he was like a whiney toddler - just randomly puttering around, bouncing off walls, and screaming for attention every few minutes. I spent a lot of time cutting hair out of the wheels, emptying his bin, and getting him unstuck from rubber mats and chair legs. I would love to have a smarter robot that is much less hands off, thus the appeal of self emptying. I'm searching for something less than $500, if it exists. Any recommendations?  Side note - is the mopping function worth it? Do they actually get dirty spots off the floor, or just gently wipe over them?

When it comes to a cliff, it\'s sensor can\'t see the light, or sees it less, and this tells the robot there might be a cliff. Black carpets specifically, absorb nearly all the light, causing the robot to think it\'s a cliff. Unfortunately there is no easy way to fix this manufacturing wise, as lasers and IR senors need to see the light reflect back for nay sort of reading. Camera based robots also can\'t handle areas that are too dark as they simply cannot ""see"". This is the same reason they don\'t have an option to turn the sensors off, as without them, the robot may not work at all, or it may get itself into major trouble. \n\nThe easiest option would be to mark no-go zones on those specific carpets. As annoying as that is, it keeps the robot from constantly trying to avoid them.\n\nAnother option would be to tape off the cliff sensors with a white tape. (This however means the robot could catastrophically fly off a flight of stairs, or drive right out the front door or something, as it can\'t tell anything about what  the ground is.)

Both also include AI tech that can help avoid problem areas and keep itself out of trouble.\n\nRoborock is a probably a little better in the software department, they pretty much have the best, and they are constantly updating it. They are also very customizable for whatever you want. The Roborock S7MaxV also has the ability to create a 3D map and even add in furniture, for both better mapping and cleaning over time. The S7MaxV also is also TUV certified for privacy. Nearly everything is processed locally on the robot itself, with very little info going out.\n\nCleaning for both machines is good. Both are very comparable, but like I said, everyone seems to agree the Roborock S7MaxV punches higher than the Ecovacs does. But it's still a good machine so it's must be noted. \n\nIf you don't mind not mopping with the same machine, the IRobot J7+ is also a great machine. Cleans very well and is pretty smart too.

Pet vacuums usually don't have a huge difference compared to their regular counterparts. They usually consistent with having a couple different tools, maybe adding charcoal to the filter for odor, or swapping some bristles for rubbery versions instead. \n\nA canister vacuum would be a good candidate. If you can step up in price some, you could get yourself a James or Henry. Both are very good, built to last, and have huge bags with plenty of suction.

I have since given it to my mom who has been loving it. She has a Miele but uses the shark in-between deep cleaning. We also have absolutely beaten the hell out of it so maybe we just got Lucky with a good model. I think for the money you can't always find a better vacuum for cheaper.

The only Eureka I would consider is there new Innova model. It's actually pretty good from the limited reviews I've seen. \n\nBest of luck! \n\nP.s.: look into a robot too.

It's definitely a smaller robot so while it did help with pet hair it might fill fast. But the quality was good and it was super quiet.\n\nSince you have hard floors, a straight suction robot would be great too as there would be no tangles.

I'm currently looking at getting a robot for pure vacuuming of a \~150m^(2) apartment. One floor, no pets, all hardfloor.  
Currently looking at most 500CHF (basically 1:1 USD), and I don't really need auto emptying. The only feature I'm really looking at is LIDAR for obstacle avoidance. 

My problem now is that I have a lot of choice:

* Roborock S7, Q7 Max and S6 MaxV at around 400
* Dreame Z10 Pro at 400
* Ecovacs T9 and T8 AIVI at 400

There are also the regular T8, S5 Max and L10 Pro at 350.

I'm currently leaning towards the Q7 Max, would anyone have any feedback?  Or should I just get cheaper solutions from xiaomi or eufy?

Thanks a lot!"	4	"['thewimsey: What do you mean by ""obstacle avoidance""? \n\nLIDAR is great at avoiding obstacles like furniture; but it can\'t see obstacles like cords and socks', 'Faktion: I just picked up a roborock s6 refurb off Amazon for $219 and it came like new and had a ton of extra mop pads.', ""Narmonteam: Bad wording on my side.

It had both the vacuum and the mop function. After using it for quite a few good years, it is time for replacement and after comparing, I decided to get Roidmi EVA due to price factor. It was few hundreds of dollars difference between this and Xiaomi S7 Pro Ultra and Ecovacs Deebot X1Omni. The main difference is the camera and the sensor which I wasn't comfortable with. That is the main reason why I chose EVA.  
**Setting Up**:  
I only got to realise that it needs to have 2.4Ghz WIFI which I didn't notice it when I was checking on the features. Luckily I still have a DLink router that supports it. My old Roborock had no problem connecting to my Google WIFI. It took me a while to the WIFI setup for the system. Few days ago, I'm not sure why the base station had problems connecting with the network and didn't manage to wash the rotating mops before the robovacuum cleaner left the base station. And it took me quite a while to get the connection back together.  
**Cleaning**:  
Since the dust and dirt was suck into the dust bag after all the cleaning, I didn't get to see how much dirt it collected. Maybe I might want to try changing the settings and check it out. I only started using Liquid detergent after 1 week of water only cleaning. I find that it is cleaner from my bare feet. I had since use EVA to clean every Mon/Wed/Fri as compared to Xiaomi which is once a week and I will always mop the floor again.  
**Software and Motion**:  
After the first run, it is able to map out the whole house. There are few areas which I needed EVA to avoid. The main reason is more than 2 cm height of step. I believe all the robovacuum cleaners will not able to handle the height. So I will create the ""off-limits"" invisible wall. These areas are toilets, yard and balcony. I closed all the doors during the first run before creating the Invisible walls (total 4 walls). I did accidentally erase the first map that I had created and now in the 2nd map, it didn't recognise the kitchen as a room. But I'm ok with that. However it did go off the Invisible wall and onto my balcony twice! Only Balcony. Not sure why but I might create another wall to assess the situation again.   
Since I had both Roborock and Roidmi, the mopping mechanism is different; one is a mop pad while the latter is 2 small turntable mops. But with the 2 turntable mops, it will get stuck with long wires and managed to pull the turntable mop off EVA. So I had to ensure that my wires are properly stored which is part of my pre-cleaning routine (same goes to my old Roborock). There are 2 incidents where the mop came off and I'm not sure why.  
There was also a situation where EVA stop for no reason.   
During the first few runs when small incidents happen, it didn't resume cleaning but a new fresh start. So I had to stop it and select the room or area that I wanted to clean. But the problem seems to gone and it is able to resume without a new fresh start.  
Now I dutifully pour the dirty water away and it gives me the pleasure when I see how much dirty water it had collected and will also make sure that I took the mop out for drying. I recently clean the base below the plastic tray. I think this is fine with me as I going to do that once a month.

Looking forward to buy a robot vacuum for a small flat with hard floors, no pets, not much hair unless the gf comes over. I'm really indecided between a roborock s7 without the auto-emptying station and the dreame z10pro which has it, since they are very close in price in my region (EU/CH). Which one should i opt for?

Should i go for the better mopping / cleaning of the S7 or for the auto-emptying station / object avoidance of the z10pro?

I see a lot of posts asking similar questions but they all seem to factor in the ability to mop and clutter avoidance which are not really factors for me.

Some of the features I mention below may or may not be standard, or I may be calling by the wrong thing. I have never owned a robot vac before, so forgive my ignorance.

**Usage / Considerations**

* Mainly used on hardwood floors/tile, plus 2 low pile area rugs.
* Main thing being vacuumed will be pet hair.
   * 1 Medium Sized Dog - Short Hair - Pit/Boxer Cross - doesn't shed too too much
   * 1 Medium Sized Dog, Medium Double Coat - Heinz 57 mutt, sheds like a husky.
   * 1 Mid Sized Cat - Long Hair - Sheds like a beast
* Light Dirt - generally brought in by dog paws and the pit/boxer cross rolling around in it and coming inside.

**Features I desire**

* Price under 1K CAD if possible
* Auto Docking/Self Empty
* Being able to set ""no go"" zones
* Sensor for stairs - Stairs are generally blocked, but I have a teenager who likes to not close things.
* Pattern cleaning (not random all over the place waste of battery/time) I believe this is a mapping feature?
* I do not want to have to constantly detangle/unplug due to pet hair. I have no issues with routine maintenance, but I seen posts talking about having to do it after every cycle for some cheap models.

**Features that do not matter to me**

* Mop function - If it has it, cool. If not, I'm not concerned.
* Noise level - I have a loud teenager, and loud dogs. Noise is irrelevant.
* Clutter Avoidance (nothing on my floors I'm concerned about)

I have spent the last few days reviewing lots of websites, videos, reddit posts, etc. They all seem to encompass everything with focus on the Mopping feature, so none really stand out for my wants. Vacuum Wars channel did help a fair bit, but again, more focus on features I'm not concerned with.

I'd rather not overspend for features I don't need/want. That being said, I am sure there are lots of features I left out, that may or may not be important factors.

Thanks in Advance, and I hope I will be able to get the answers I seek."	4	"[""Outrageous_Bag_7412: I'd go with roomba J7 it has excellent obstacle avoidance and a easy to repair (if necessary)  design.

It mops really well and with a bunch of little kids it's so nice to wake up to a clean floor! 

Since a couple of days now though, I've noticed it's not finishing it's tasks. Turns out it doesn't connect well when driving back into the dock itself. So not sure if the back or the bottom connectors aren't connecting but it's not really registering when it drives in. So that means it doesn't drive back out when cleaning or charge. 

Ive cleaned the robot and the dock thoroughly! I removed the inlay and cleaned everything but alas it's still messing up when driving back into it. If I push the robot or dock it manually it works. Resetting didn't help either.

Since customer service is a bit of a nightmare I really hope someone knows if and how I can fix this myself.

Could manually emptying the onboard dust compartment daily perhaps be better?	Timely-Landscape-383	1	x00djc	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/x00djc/controversial_idea_is_a_selfemptying_dock/	"You know that old vacuum smell? The smell that fills your house when you vacuum? It comes from small particles that can’t be trapped by even true hepa filtration. Ie from the bacteria breeding in the dust hanging out in a vacuum bag. They get sucked into the motor and aerosolized in the exhaust. You can’t clean your motor, so once the stank is there, it’s there for good. The solution is to change your bag frequently or go bagless. 

I’m researching my first robot vacuum purchase. I’m concerned that these docks with $$ bags meant to be emptied every few months will promote vacuum stank.  I also want good exhaust filtration on the robot itself, so it’s not just blowing dust in circles. 

I’m thinking I might actually be better off manually emptying an onboard dust collector, or a bagless self emptying dock every day. I’d empty outdoors.

Why buy a self emptying dock if I want to empty it every day? Well it might buy better filtration. 

What’s your experience with the bagged docks after a few months of ownership?

# PARTIALLY SOLVED

**Solution:** *I was told that this is most likely an issue with the sensors on the dock simply being old and wearing out. The only thing to do is replace the whole thing. The reason (and this part is my own adage here from my own knowledge) is that the docks for most robot vacuums are not replaceable - basically, each one is ""coded"" to the vacuum it comes with and while not impossible to do, it is certainly difficult to reprogram a replacement dock with the proper ""code"" for the robot vacuum.*

I have an EcoVacs Deebot N79 that is about 3 and a half years old.

For the past two weeks or so, it has been just stopping for no apparent reason in the middle of cleaning. It is not near anything when it stops and the sensors are all clean, the rubbish collection bin is almost empty, and the brushes and wheels are not blocked or jammed at all.

It still has anywhere from 50% to 75% battery left (as seen on the ECOVACS HOME app), and will not respond to any buttons on the remote nor the button on the vacuum itself. The only thing that seems to fix this, is manually pushing it onto the dock and then it beeps and starts charging. After that, it will respond to the remote again and the button on the vacuum itself works again.

Any suggestions on how to fix this? Or is it simply time to get a new one?

I have tried cleaning it thoroughly (without opening up the actual chassis of the vacuum itself), I have tried replacing all the brushes and filters, and I have tried resetting it, but nothing seems to help.

All the best to everyone and have a wonderful week!"	5	"[""Beatchlady: I have the same problem.

The problem is when it stops to empty itself those first two times it only stays on the base for about 2 seconds while it’s running. It pulls away quickly and the base is still running. Is there a way to have it stay for a a few more seconds till the base stops sucking? I’ve been having trouble with it emptying all the fur. Today I tried the tape trick to cover up one of the ports.

Originally they said it was a Alexa skill issue because it was working with the App. Then it dawned on me a few weeks later to just install Google home on my phone. It responds the same as Alexa. You tell it to do a specific room and it just cleans wherever it wants. So after more than 15 hours of troubleshooting on the phone, I call shark back and tell them this to try and have them send me another one through warranty.

Room names are all default. The best way I can explain it is that communication is a 2 way street. It's receiving them command but not processing the instructions correctly. On 2 different occasions I even had a shark advance tech live stream in to see what it was doing. Luckily I record all my phone calls with them so I have proof of all the deception.

The cheapest will take a month and may not even fix my problem. The other two will cost the same but that assumes it is the wheel and not the board.

We're really wanting to buy a mopping robot and we've come across the Yeedi Mopping station. I like the idee that it actually cleans its mops with clean water a couple of times through the cleaning process. Other vacuums simple use a single pad that gets pushed throughout the house.   


In my mind that's not mopping, that's just smearing.   


Thing is, I don't have any experience with Yeedi and it's internet information is a bit on the low end.   


Things I'm curious about are:  


\- No lidar; How's the mapping accuracy? Does it have camera's instead? 

\- It seems to carry a small water tank with itself, is that not used when you have the big station or does it get refilled in the big station?

\- Can I ask it to only clean a single room and return?

\- Can I choose what order to clean the rooms?   


If anyone has some info, I'd be very grateful.   


(And before anyone comments, I live in the Netherlands, so the Narwal T10 is a no-go since it doesn't ship outside of the US)"	10	"[""Pau1ey: We were so excited to get it since it seemed to have everything we wanted but then  immediately returned it. A few observations:  It does not carry water around, it only wets the pads and then uses them until cleaning them - there are 3  choices to choose from for how long it uses the pads before cleaning them, with water. You cannot have it vacuum the entire house and then mop without removing the pads first - it avoids carpet/rugs - this was not clear before purchase. The mapping seemed worse then others - we watched from the back porch and saw that it had made at least 6 trips back & forth in the 4 foot area front of our stove. The dust bin is tiny with pads installed but does come with a larger one without. Overall it was a major disappointment, especially for the price, so I wouldn't recommend it. The only positive thing is that it was very well packaged and excellent build quality. It seems like any that are not iRobot, Shark, Samsung, LG all use the same Tuya app, but they tweak the UI. My experiences mapping with other Tuya vacs is not good either - we ended up a Shark IQ with LIDAR and it's been excellent, and I'm thinking of trying the new Bissell Ready Clean mop since none of the vacuum/mop combos seem to work well."", 'Apprehensive-Place90: It sucks, I returned it. Buy the roidmi Eva, great device and much better.', ""NuttyNutworks: Weird though, seeing that they do state that it carries a 200ml water container.   \n\n\nAnd I was afraid the mapping was bad since it doesn't have a LIDAR. It seems to be making a map based on where it hits it's head against furniture or obstacles.   \n\n\nWe currently have a Xiaomi Robot vacuum with a LIDAR and it always vacuums everything, never misses a spot. It doesn't mop.  Yeedi seems to be a a step backwards with their current mapping.   \nThe Shark you mentioned has the smearing pad so it wouldn't be a good upgrade for me.  \n\n\nThanks for your feedback, let's hope another company figures this out."", 'NuttyNutworks: Thanks, and we just discovered the Roidmi indeed.', ""Pau1ey: I didn't even get to try the mop part out since it didn't work without removing the pads so sorry I couldn't be of more help with that. With 3 dogs I also am not interested in one that smears the same pad throughout the house. The new Bissell looks very tempting as it holds disposable or reusable pads and you can set how often to swap them during cleaning. The Shark I have is just a vacuum since its hard to loose the self-empty once you have one with it, so I'm stuck mopping with a spinwave every few days for now."", ""oxemenino: Had Roidmi Eva for about a month and it worked great but then started having software issues where it wouldn't go back to the charging station, would randomly stop halfway through cleaning, or would think the mopping attachments weren't on when they were connected.

I've been using a Narwal ever since then, it was a bit more expensive but does it's job great and I've had zero problems."", ""NuttyNutworks: Just had a look at the Bissell one. To me it seems you're paying a lot of money for a machine that simply wipes a damp cloth back and forward twice over each area.

Or they have a Dreame which reportedly has terrible service. 

Do you assume you’ll have to replace it if something goes wrong, and budget accordingly?

After weeks of research I was all set to buy a Roborock Q7max today and realized the brand won’t ship to the Caribbean. So if I acquire one elsewhere, and buy and use in different countries, the warranty is instantly void. So far no company I’ve checked out ships directly to my country. Except some aliexpress vendors. 

It’s not a disposably priced item for my budget. And I assume the app or wifi connection will rat my location out (can I use a VPN?).

Should I go for very low price units, assuming I’ll have to replace if something goes wrong? 

Or Roomba, since they’ll have the most user replaceable parts for self repair? 

Or a not wifi connected model?

I feel the pain of the 1.5 months, the two wheel package, and the international wait times. It seems like the convenient futuristic robots are surrounded by very pedestrian and human time suck. I spent an hour in chat with Roborock today going around in a circle after the rep used the phrase “power converter.” Rep meant a plug adapter, not a transformer. \n\nI appreciate the credit card extended warranty idea. Smart.', ""PhilosophyCorrect279: No problem!\n\nWe own the A9 and the A10. Both have mapping, the A10 is smarter. Interestingly I found them because they were the only ones using cyclonic filtering for better performance.\n\nWe also own a w400s mop bot, and while I loved it, it ended up taking longer than I really liked, and we got a Tineco instead. Although the newest version looks much better! \n\nThe A9 is a no frills robot, It uses a camera to make a map so it can clean in rows. I find it's been very efficient in cleaning, always finding hidden dirt laying around even after vacuuming with the big vac. It also is very quiet. It's a little clumsy at times, but not nearly as bad as a dumb, bounce robot. I don't even have it connected to the internet either.\n\nThe A10 is a Lidar based robot, similar to Roborock s4 probably. It makes a map you can edit and adjust to your preference. You can set rooms, no go zones, carpet zones, virtual walls, etc. It's also interesting in that you can adjust the suction and side brushes too. You can even get a mopping attachment, that actually vibrates for better cleaning. Its mopping is great for daily upkeep, maybe not necessarily deep cleaning. Overall it's been good. It's not perfect but plenty good for us! \n\nThey just launched their A11 too. It's similar to the A10, but adds second gen lidar for much better mapping, and the option to vacuum and mop at the same time, along with an upgraded app. They also made the mop have an option that goes back and forth in a scrubbing motion. I've been looking into getting it purely to see the difference. It has much more power at 4000pa, but the downside was they replaced the cyclones with a more traditional setup, but I think it will be good still. \n\nAbove all, you get 90% of the same features (and then some I personally believe), while also spending half to a quarter of the other machines. They technically are lower to mid range robots, but personally I don't care lol. You can spend 300 for a base dumb robot from a big brand, or 200 for the A9 with mapping. Best of luck!"", 'SlimeQSlimeball: Yep or just buy the Assurian warranty that Amazon sells alongside the robot. Worth it 100% if something goes wrong. Obviously a waste if it doesn\'t but they handle claims fairly. \n\nThe Roborock vacs are far superior to the Roombas but the Roombas have a ""proper"" company behind them and a supply chain that isn\'t bullshit. Did you know the only way to buy an OEM dustbin filter and brush for Roborock is through the app and it costs 1/5 the cost of the S4 it goes into? And the aftermarket versions of both are garbage that don\'t work right? Filter is too restricted and brush roll is too small so neither picks up dirt. \n\nRoomba stuff is available in stores and online and isn\'t expensive. I guess it\'s two different philosophies; pay upfront for the robot and less for consumables or a cheaper robot and pay out the ass for parts. \n\nI will be buying original branded parts be cause it\'s $6 for a filter from irobot and not $16 from roborock.', 'Timely-Landscape-383: Helpful, thank you!']"
1661198375.0	22-Aug-2022 12:59:35	How much difference really is there between expensive/cheap vacs?		7	wv3ih5	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/wv3ih5/how_much_difference_really_is_there_between/	"Getting ready to buy my first robot vacuum and I've honed in on the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra due to the overwhelming positive reviews and the fact that it seems to be the overall best rated vac.

But its expensive.

I don't really mind spending the money on it, but the frugal part of me is asking if I really need it? Would a cheaper, stupider vaccuum without lidar and such be just as good for my main goal--keeping my floors clean? At the end of the day, they are all just circles that roam around and suck, right?

Most of the reviews/comparisons online test using a ton of cereal and hair on the floor... which, I of course would never actually leave or have on the floor like that. Mostly the vac would suck every day dust and some random hairs or crumb here and there.

Is paying the premium price worth it or would I be just as happy with a $300 vacuum? What's your experience going from a budget/mid-range vacuum to a premium one? Is getting the theoretical 'best' really worth it?"	12	"['PeteyNice: Do you need mopping? \n\nHow much will you depend on a functional app for things like individual room cleaning and no go zones? \n\nDo you need a self emptying base? \n\nDo you need obstacle avoidance or are you good about getting your place ready to clean by picking up cords and things?\n\nYou want LIDAR though. Unless you specifically want a Roomba J7+ for the obstacle avoidance, I would not spend money on a non-LIDAR option.', ""Itchy-Ad1005: I have an older Shark self empty bot that uses VSLAM rather than LIDAR.  It's on the dumb end of the decent robotvacs.  Our floors are hardwood, tile and slate with a few area rugs.  This bot has no mopping  capability and no forward looking camera for item avoidance.  We've used for about 4 years.  It keeps my floors clean and does exactly what I expected it to do.  Our floor area is 1500 sq ft.  Because it's a camera based navigation system it can really only run when its light.  Of course thats exactly when I'd want it to run.  If it ran at night it would wake me up.\n\nI wouldn't buy any vac that isn't  self emptying.  Object avoidance would be something to strongly consider since mine sometimes gets stalled by running over something I've left on floor like a sock.  Especially important if its going to run when you're not there.  If something like a handkerchief. Paper or sock gets tangled in main brush it stops where it is.  You may come home to dead bot and then find my bot won't work with dead battery.  I've had to hunt for it several times because of this. I'd want a smarter robot if I had a complicated Floorplan,  lots of no small no go zones or it runs mostly when I'm not home.\n\nMopping is something im debating based on new debot.  The others I dont think would be able to do my house unless I was there to change and refill water etc.  I'm probably going to wait a while longer so that other people work out the bugs."", ""ErrorFindingID: Honestly after getting self empty, I cannot think of going back to a unit without one.

Realistically it's small enough that I don't really need a robot vacuum but I have both the budget and the interest to get one to try them out. The apartment is all linoleum/tile though I do have area rugs, one of which has a pad underneath so it stands 3/4"" above the floor at the edge.

My main goals for a vacuum would be:

* Ability to clean both hard floor and low pile rugs

* Self emptying base

* Easy ability to schedule cleaning times (I work a very inconsistent schedule so I cannot schedule for a cleaning every Wednesday at 12pm for example. It would need to be scheduled at different times week to week.)

* Lidar is a bonus, but would be highly appreciated

From what I could see, the iHome Nova seems to be the best fit as it has both lidar and self-emptying. The mop attachment seems adequate and would see occasional use. I would appreciate input on other options as well.

Also, should I wait until Black Friday to see if there are sales? And what kind of sales should I expect for that day?

Amazon is finally back in stock, but I think that after these gears sell through there I am going to close that listing.  Selling on Amazon gives my product more eyeballs than ever before, but Amazon limits the interaction between seller and buyer so severely that I simply cannot resolve customer complaints. On eBay I have resolved every single issue for customers. On Amazon, after selling only 6 units, I have two negative ratings - both for issues which were never communicated to me and for which I cannot give any help or remedy.  I don\'t even know who posted the one-star ratings because Amazon hides that from the seller.  If you want to buy this gear at Amazon, this is probably your last chance.\n2. I am back in stock at eBay, and I\'m going to keep this product on eBay as it allows buyer and seller to work out all the issues of a transaction.  You know: down the thread on this post the ""price"" complaint comes up.  The one thing which I try not to make too much of here is that included in my price is personal customer service.  About 80% of my buyers have no issues out of the box, but 20% of the gears are going onto robots which, it seems to me through problem shooting, have other mechanical issues.  There\'s no way to find this out unless we talk to each other, and I am willing to talk to everyone who buys these gears to work out their problems.\n3. One thing I think every person having issues with the gear has to consider is that wen ich the gear has failed or is failing, there has to be a problem in the system causing the failure.  The first reason to think so is that the original gear failed.  In other updates I have mentioned the ""overdrive"" problem some people have.  The next clear cause I have seen most often is a mismatch between the gear and the brush - meaning: at some point, you replaced the brush and the brush itself is causing more resistance than it ought to against the gear.  My experience is that the best replacement brush is **BBT BAMBOOST Replacement Main Brush** \\[AMAZON ASN: B07T41MKZ8\\].  I am not the seller of this brush, so I have no stake in you buying one except to give good advice.  At the hex interface on this brush, there is a very tight and clean connection to the hex gear and no accidental resistance to turning.  The one sold by Neato has a huge orange shield on the hex side, and that shield causes friction every time it gets even a little bit dirty.  Do yourself a favor and replace the brush when you replace the gear.  Your results will be much better.\n4. I continue to be worried about D7 users and their high rate of gear failures.  Most are getting failures due to the way the gear interacts with the spindle (most commonly: either it doesn\'t fit, or there is friction-related heat melting the gear).  I am contemplating posting a separate listing for a gear spec\'d out for the D7 only, but I know that the version I have right now isn\'t perfect.  In order to accommodate all the variations on that D7 spindle the cavity is too large, and on most machines, it rattles when it runs.  I\'ll post more when I have a better solution.\n5. Since I am rattling off root causes, some people will ask why I don\'t list ""faulty gear"" as a root cause.  The first reason is that the original gear is not faulty, per se, but it wears out.  A suitable part can wear out over time. But the second reason is this: when my parts are faulty, I replace them with no questions asked.  In fact, I have replaced gears for people who have other problems that have caused a gear to fail at no cost to them. I have sent buyers multiple parts when it\'s not clear which issue is causing them to fail so that they can find the right one to get their machine back in service.  It might be legal to be intransigent when your buyer breaks a part out of ignorance, but it\'s not being a good seller with a good conscience.  Gears can be faulty, but my experience in selling these so far is that there\'s a problem in the drive system we are trying to solve, and the gear is just the symptom. Because I am charging a premium price to solve that problem, I want to provide premium service.\n\nThanks again to all who are trying to get their machines back in service.  Best wishes!\n\n**\\[ORIGINAL POST\\]**\n\nI am back in stock at eBay, and I\'m going to keep this product on eBay as it allows buyers and sellers to work out all the issues of a transaction.  You know: down the thread on this post the ""price"" complaint comes up.  The one thing which I try not to make too much of here is that included in my price is personal customer service.  About 80% of my buyers have no issues out of the box, but 20% of the gears are going onto robots which, it seems to me through problem shooting, have other mechanical issues.  There\'s no way to find this out unless we talk to each other, and I am willing to talk to everyone who buys these gears to work out their problems..ear at Amazon, this is probably your last chance.\n\n1. My first reaction is that for all the gears I have sold (about 100 now after about a year between various eBay listings and Amazon, so I am not retiring yet), the machine which is giving people the most problems with the brush driver system is the D7.  It\'s not completely clear to me why because most people who are having trouble just want it fixed but don\'t want to help me create a base of experience with the D7 to get to the bottom of it.  Even if I would give them a free gear or a full refund in order to get their assistance! But: the D7 gives the brush drive system a hard time.\n2. I don\'t own a D7, but I am told it has some sort of ""extra"" mode which runs the battery down faster and allegedly sucks harder and drives the brush harder. The one customer who did walk through the remedy process with me switched off this ""extra"" mode (maybe it\'s called ""ultra"" or ""hyper"" mode or something) and he stopped beating up the driver gear immediately.  So if you are using this extra-power mode, stop doing it.  I have a D3 with now overdrive and it works fine for daily use.  It is using the original prototype I made for my wife a year ago and no stripping out, no overheating.\n3. The feedback that the aluminum gear (which I have seen on eBay and Amazon) gets chewed up by the D7 is shocking.  It would be highly resistant to the heat problem I have seen on some gears, and it ought to be harder than the female connector on the brush - it should be tearing up the brush link, not the other way around.  I\'d be interested to see pictures of that rounded-over gear to take a guess at what caused it.\n4. Even all this said, I have only given out 3 refunds over 100 gears (and to be fair: about 5 replacement gears for those who wanted to try a second time).  It\'s worth trying to replace your gear to salvage your Neato robot.  And it\'s worth fiddling with the settings on your Neato App to try to get the cleaning done without tearing up part of the machine. ;-)\n\nBest wishes!\n\n\\[UPDATED\\] So I have comments about selling on Amazon, and about the current status of this product:\n\n1. Selling on Amazon is terrible.  I have ZERO ability to talk to customers and work out problems - I can only either give a refund or nothing.  That doesn\'t really help anybody. Also: their ability to put items back into stock stinks.  I have a shipment to them that is rotting in their receiving yard for more than 30 days now to replenish - and not only do they list the item as ""out of stock with no replenish date,"" but they also keep sending me messages to send them more stock.  Seems like lousy management.\n2. I am about to stop selling this gear to D7 users.  There is something wrong wth the brush drive set-up on the D7 in which the gear simply does not fit right even when it is properly built.  If someone has a D7 and bought this gear and can\'t get it to work you can contact me here on Reddit or at ""frank at iturk dot com"" and we can work out a solution to your problem.  I like selling these gears and funding my hobby, but I like it, even more, when a robot is back in service.  If you bought a gear on Amazon and are not happy, please contact me and I will live up to my commitment to your satisfaction.\n3. To my other faithful customers who did get robots working, thank you for making this worth it to me.  I\'ll continue to do the best I can to sell these (even if we shut down Amazon and only sell via eBay going forward).  Look forward to eBay being back in stock before the end of next week.  Who knows when Amazon will get itself together.', 'Outrageous_Bag_7412: Did you replace the rollers on the bottom? That could be the culprit, the brush to floor clearance could be too close?', 'rabidasma: Hey! I just bought a replacement gear from you cause it looked like your edges were more crisp and they definitely are. I actually have not installed it yet because I think I got to the root of my problem. I do indeed use the ""extra"" mode and have been for a few months. It definitely seems more rough on the female brush end and the gear and on top of that, the battery does not last for a full cleaning - it has to dock and come out for a second go. \nSo, the aluminum gear getting chewed up was very surprising to me as well and I honestly think something very hard got stuck in there at some point because you\'re right, there is no reason the aluminum should be getting rounded or chipped by anything and certainly not the plastic brush. \nThis brings me to the reason this was all happening in the first place and it\'s a pretty dumb mistake on my part. Looking back at my order history, I purchased a Neato Robotics Neato Botvac D Series Combo Brush which is on Amazon from the Neato Robotics store and explicitly says it\'s compatible with all D series vacuums. I had two of these and upon installation, there was a lot of resistance due to what seemed to be too large a brush. Stupidly I thought ""well it\'s from Neato and it\'s supposed to work with this vacuum so it\'s go to be ok, right?"" Wrong. It stripped out the initial plastic gear, I replaced the gear and then it slightly damaged the aluminum one. At which point I replaced the brush with another and the brush end then stripped out. Finally realized that the damn thing didn\'t fit properly and bought the Neato Helix Multi-Surface Brush which fits like a glove. It works wonderfully. \nSo it was just a mistake on my part buying the wrong brush and just going with it for too damn long. \nI am going to replace the aluminum gear with yours soon. The aluminum isn\'t bad but I seemed to have damaged it and the gear is slightly more rounded than yours. I like a snug fit. \nThanks for all the awesome advice and the great part.', ""TransportationOk4787: Here are the specs for the D3 to D7 [https://neatorobotics.cn/en/compare-robot-vacuums/](https://neatorobotics.cn/en/compare-robot-vacuums/).\n\nThe D7 has the same modes as the D3.  I always use the turbo modes on all of my 11 Neato's D3, D4 and D7.  The D7 seem to vibrate more new from the factory... perhaps because they come with the spiral brush that has a different brush design and different endcap than the original brushes which are no longer available.  If the brush fits too tightly it might be because the endcap is not pushed in all the way from the factory.  With the new design aluminum endcaps sold by the ebayer who is also selling the aluminum gears, I actually have to use a hammer to get the endcap in all the way into the helix and spiral brushes.  The endcap for the new helix brush has an improved design.  It is enlarged so there is no room for it to vibrate.  It can be used on the spiral brushes too.  Hope this helps.  As for original D7 gears wearing out faster than other Neato's, my guess it is due to the spiral brush that came with it.  The endcap on it was a step backward.  The new endcap on the helix brush is an improvement."", 'rabidasma: Great question and not something I’ve thought of! They’re pretty worn and probably time for a change. I’ll give it a shot. Thanks!', ""Fun-Inspector-4018: That's incredible feedback - super-helpful!  Let's see what happens with your new gear.  My hope is that you get the result most people have gotten: the tight fit at the hex end reduces jumping out and rounding-over, making the gear last longer.  \n\n\nPlease keep in touch. I am 100% invested in your 100% satisfaction."", 'Fun-Inspector-4018: Great, helpful comment.  Do you have photos of the different brush endcaps, or links to the brushes you think are best?', ""rabidasma: I appreciate it. Even if all goes well, I'll reach back out to let you know. I was very happy to find a good product out there. BTW, what grease did you use in the shaft hole?"", 'TransportationOk4787: The original brush which was V shaped is apparently discontinued.  Neato now sells a pet brush that has one poor review, the spiral brush that came with the D7 and the new Helix brush that is supposedly quieter.

Originally the endcap on the spiral cap did not have that wide circular area but if you look at the photos on the Neato site, the latest spiral endcaps look identical to the new helix brush endcap.  As for whether the helix brush is better and quieter than the spiral brush, the D7 with the original spiral brush always had a lot of vibration even when new.  It seems better with the new helix brush but that could just be because of the new endcap which did not come with my original spiral brush but comes with it now.  So the answer is, maybe.', 'Fun-Inspector-4018: Great question.  I just recently changed from a product called ""X-1R"" to PTFE lubricant.  If you got a gear with a brownish lube, it\'s X-1R.  I stopped using it because my small pot is almost empty, and they don\'t make it anymore.  I switched to PTFE (looks translucent in the cavity) because it\'s safe for plastic, food-safe (reg#096790), and I think it actually gets better results than my old solution.  It\'s functionally a teflon coating which is good in the high-temp situation we have on the shaft of the driver due to friction.', ""rabidasma: Hey there. It seems like you're really passionate about this (which is awesome) so I thought I'd give you an update. So, I used the aftermarket aluminum drive gear for quite some time after this post instead of using yours. It stripped out the hex receiver on a brand new brush and it's own hex male end became more rounded. I then swapped it out for your product a few days ago and I have a few observations, which you likely already know but I'll share anyway. \nYour drive gear is slightly longer and therefore seats better in the hex brush roll receiver than the aluminum after market product. Also, the edges on yours are sharper right out of the box. Because of both of these, the fit seems to be much more snug and thus the chance of stripping out a brush roll seems less. The only problem I had with your product, and it was minor, was that when I placed it on the stationary axis shaft, it was a very tight fit and I had trouble turning it with my hands. Assuming it was going to be too difficult for the motor to turn, I took a small cylindrical file to the inside to shave off a very small amount of material. Took about 3 minutes and when I put it back on, it fit like a glove. Anyway, nothing to complain about, just thought you would want to know. \nThanks for selling a great product. I don't know what my other options would be other than to buy a new vacuum if you hadn't had this. Thanks for saving me some $$$. If anything else comes up, I'll let you know."", ""rabidasma: Thanks, I just used good old white lithium, Lucas Oil I believe. Not that I have a strong opinion on greases for this application. Lol. I was just curious. I got your translucent grease. Thanks again. I'll keep you updated."", 'Fun-Inspector-4018: That is great, useful feedback.  You are spot on about how tall my gear is.  That’s a huge reason why mine resists rolling over the corners.  I am very much torn about the diameter of the hole that receives the spindle.  When it is 7.1mm, on some robots it rattles and this is annoying, but it runs like crazy.  Mine is running 13 months now. When it is tight (right at 7mm) it is quiet and functional, but it gets hot fast.  Sometimes that melts the tip.  My remedy is the PTFE added, but sometimes the narrow cavity can’t support enough PTFE to matter.\n\nI really like the collaborative effort to get robots back on line, but I admit that charging $35 for the gear means (to me) that my customer should be getting a good product with excellent service.  Asking you to modify the gear seems shabby to me. Thanks for making the extra effort and please let me know how I can help in the future.']"

Orange_fury	1	wiy6dz	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/wiy6dz/need_to_replace_a_roborock_s5_switch_to_roomba_j7/	Live in a 1200 sqft apartment (mostly low-pile carpet with a few tiled areas) and have 4 cats. I bought a Roborock S5 in Dec 2019 that has worked flawlessly, up until recently (keep getting error codes about the left wheel circuit, and I’m not confident replacing the wheel will fix the issue). I’ve been very happy with the LIDAR mapping and the cleaning capabilities, but because of the mechanical issues and my concerns about support, I’ve been thinking about making the switch to a Roomba j7+. I mop the tiled areas separately, so I’m more concerned with the vacuum capabilities over the mopping ones. Having never owned a Roomba before, is the LIDAR on the Roborock that much more effective than the camera/V-slam system on the Roomba? I’m hesitant to spend almost double on something like the S7 Max V Plus when I’m not anticipating using the mopping function, and I’ve heard the area where Roomba shines is carpet/pet hair.	4	['AlwaysWanderOfficial: Why not Q5+?\n\nHad mine for a month and it’s fantastic.

I have a black Labrador, so lots of hair. My house is two stories. First floor is all hardwood. Second is mostly carpet. The current setup that I have is a roomba i3 with the self empty base and a Braava m6. The roomba gets my floors clean. I run it everyday (only downstairs). The Braava can only clean like a third of the floor before the pads gets too dirty. But it’s enough for the highest traffic areas (long halfway and kitchen bar). I bought both used for $300 total, plus I spent around an extra $50 to get new replacement parts. 
Wanting a better option I purchased a roborock s7 during prime day (for $430). Since my budget is tight I got the basic robot without any base and my plan is to sell the iRobot set to cover most of the cost. But now I’m wondering if the roborock will be really an improvement, considering I won’t have the self emptying base. I haven’t open it yet. My motivations to get it were: 
-having more than one map so I can use it upstairs (cleaning different rooms different days of the week) 
-having mopping and vacuuming at the same time (and therefore being quicker) 
-vibrating mop, hoping to get better cleanin
-quieter machine (nice to have) 
-getting newer technology, and being new hoping to last longer.  
Is the roborock upgrade worth it even if I don’t have the base? I don’t think I would get is soon. The roomba has been such a lifesaver getting rid of all the hair and crumbs and other stuff (have a toddler). The Braava I don’t run it that often. Maybe because I have to set up the pad. I used to prefer the set and forget approach and I think the self empty base made it so easy to run the roomba everyday that I’m now convinced a robot is a great investment. But I also have noticed that the roomba does requiere attention (cleaning brushes, filter, etc) so I know I’m willing to put some effort."	4	['drizzle_R: Vacuumwise you will not upgrade it is more like a downgrade regarding carpet performance. \nHardfloor performance is even with the i3 doing better  with debri like sand and the edge cleaning is bettter.\n\nThe m6 is a better mop.\n\nI would go with an i7,j7 or s9 for multi maps.

I'd appreciate some advice from owners of either or both of these robot vacuums. I know they're not in the same league, AFAIK roborock is considered more 'top-class', however, I have a budget of about 500 EUR and I can buy either Roborock S7 without Auto Empty Dock, or Lydsto R1 that has AutoEmpty dock included by default (it's cheaper too, around 350 EUR versus 500 for Roborock).

&#x200B;

Some of my friends have Lydsto and they recommend it. However I've read a lot of reviews that say Lydsto's performance is a bit wonky, some people have issues with vacuum losing maps, some people were declined warranty repairs in Xiaomi centers (they were basically told that Lydsto isn't Xiami, despite the box saying it is, so they won't fix it), some got faulty LIdars, etc. Also, my wife doesn't like disposable bags, and Lydsto Dock uses disposable bags, which means buying a new pack every 6 months (what if they cease to be produced?).

I'm not sure Roborock is free from these issues, but being a higher priced unit I tend to think it will be more reliable.

Now... where was I..?

A question therefore is:

Do you think it's better to get a higher priced Roborock and hope it will be more reliable, despite not getting the AutoEmpty Dock; or should I just get a Lydsto, which is cheaper and has an Auto Empty Dock included? Is AutoEmpty Dock a big deal from convenience perspective?

We are pretty new to the robovac world and bought a Samsung JetBot AI. Our overall setup is 50/50 Carpet/Hard floors. We started using it downstairs and after attempting to use it upstairs realized that it doesn’t support multiple maps, and figure that even if it did, transferring it up and downstairs throughout the week would get pretty old. After doing some research, we decided to get the Roomba S9+/Braava M6 combo and moved the S9 upstairs. Long story short, the S9 seemed to take forever and a day with it’s cleanings, couldn’t cover all of upstairs within one day and needed too much babysitting for it’s price point. We never used the Braava and they are both going back….

Now we are looking for another vacuum that can handle our upstairs which is mainly plush carpet.  Initially I was thinking about getting another Samsung Jetbot AI (on sale of course), because it has been able to cover the entire upstairs….but I’m thinking there may be better options out there for carpet and am looking for advice. The auto empty bin is a must have for us, and we prefer something that will find it’s way around ‘stuff’ that may not have been picked up off the floor (we understand that small cords may be an issue). We currently don’t have any pets living with us, but that could change. 

Flooring Details: 

Laminate: “Revwood Select” by Mohawk (water resistant), has a matte finish. 

Carpet:  SmartStrand Silk by Mohawk/Pleasant Touch -  Plush/High Pile type carpet (pile height is .782 inches)

Downstairs: 80% Laminate, 15% Carpet, 5% tile

Upstairs: 75% Carpet, 25% Tile 

\*Robot mopping would mainly be done downstairs on the laminate. 

Sorry for the lengthy post but I’ve been watching sooo many youtube videos and while they are helpful, am still at a loss.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions."	2	['SkepticalSenior9133: Bought two Shark IQ Robot Self-Empty XL units about a month ago and could not be happier.

Can't run whole house on one map so have to manually split the house.  That is a deal breaker.

Requirements:

Hardwood Floors 90% + Tile Floors 10%

No Mopping

Must have 2600-2800 SF capability as the house is one story without steps.

Must have the autoclean/dust bin.

Strong battery.

Navigate runners/area rugs (not too thick)

Have 1 dog so some pet hair (nothing crazy).

Suggestions?

Thanks in advance."	14	"[""PhilosophyCorrect279: What is your price range? That is perhaps the biggest factor.

And then I got new rugs, and the shedding kicked the little vacuum's butt. I started to get a filter blocked or wet error. Changed the filter cleaned with forced air, and still the error wouldn't stop.

I don't drive. That certainly isn't Roboroc's fault or problem, but it complicated things for me, when they told me to ship it for service at my expense and they'd see if they wanted to fix it, under the warranty. Ultimately, I decided that since the Roborock was doing it's job, I could live with the error messages. This may have been unwise. Fast forward a month, the vacuum is no longer covered by warranty and it keeps dying mid-cleaning. I keep cleaning the sensors and turning it back on.

During prime day, I bought a Roomba i3+. There's no way to add keep away zones. I don't like the app as much. It's also very loud.

My reasoning for moving away from the Roborock is that I think a vacuum should be able to handle rugs and it should last more than a year.

We will be moving house soon and I want a robot vacuum for the new, larger house.

Most reviews seem to be American, and it seems like our hones are very different. UK homes are very carpet based but all the reviews I see focus on hard floor with rugs. Because of this there's a bias towards mop combos which I just don't care about.

I want an auto-empty robot that I can run daily to deal with dog hair in the carpet. Object avoidance will be a bonus. 

I keep coming back to the roomba J7+ but there are mixed reviews on the pet hair issue and I think I'd rather have LiDAR.

Obstacle avoidance, lidar, good on carpets	PeteyNice	1	w869qh	RobotVacuums	https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/w869qh/buying_advice_obstacle_avoidance_lidar_good_on/	"My Neato D3 has fallen victim to their planned obsolescence scheme and cannot clean my whole house without intervention. I had been hoping to get it to the point where the technology was better, but here we are. I am not giving Neato another dime. 

My budget is around 400USD. My priorities are LIDAR so it can run at night and obstacle avoidance. I would love a self empty base but only if it is bagless or bag-reusable. Mopping will not be used as 90% of my place is carpet.

Things I am considering:

* Dreame L10 Pro or a Z10 if it is better at obstacles or performance. 
* A Neabot Q11. This seems to tick the boxes but what little info there is about it is mixed. 
* Importing a Xiaomi from AliExpress
* Accept worse obstacle avoidance and get a Shark

A lot of the vacuums I see are still from 2021. What is the usual release pattern on this stuff? If I suck it up with the D3 for another month or two is it likely that something that hits my big three requirements comes out?

Thanks!"	2	"['enorl76: Yeedi vac max.

It doesn't make any sense to me why would it blow air out on the side, It'll never pick up the hair, since every time it passes by the hair just gets blown aside again.

It picks up stuff (although seem like a very weak suction) it rolls over, but not on the sides, where it hasn't gone over yet.  It's not heavily used and I cleaned it the best I can , but the problem remains.   The reason of low usage due to its extremely poor performance.  It's one of those $250 types, no wifi or smartphone app or anything for this model.  My wife sort of given up on this thing and wrote it down as a waste of money and I figured if there is something I can do to make it better, unless it's just a poor design. "	3	"[""PhilosophyCorrect279: We had one of those! We loved it at first, but after about 6 months-ish to a year, we upgraded to a new machine. It was slow, for louder the longer we owned it, and it's performance was lacking after so long. It was great for when we weren't home, and it could bounce around and do whatever, but it was just annoying when we were home. The air blowing is normal, just the vent, most robots are the same way. \n\nWe also upgraded because we found better machines for the same price, some even lower. We upgraded to an iLife A9, found it on sale on Amazon and absolutely loved it! We loved it so much we ended up getting it's big brother the A10!\n\nSharks are great beginner vacuums, or if you just need a little extra help from the normal. Otherwise you want something better. Their new AI Lidar machines are actually good now though!"", ""couchcaptain: Ok thanks!  I just figured out it does have wifi. and app control, something my wife never even bothered to try.   I watched some video reviews, unfortunately none of the Shark models  make it to the top 5 or even top 10 robot vacuums.  I sort of educated myself for about an hour on which robot vacuum is worth to get and which isn't. Unfortunately the recommended ones are insanely expensive, I don't think If I'd  ever get one for $1300 , even if it can pole dance to me, lol!   I'll might get  a mid range something, that has better avoidance and moves in more orderly fashion instead of just getting stuck under a chair for 20 minutes. Even my cats are doing a facepalm while watching it struggle, lol!"", ""PhilosophyCorrect279: Lol I completely understand!\n\nPersonally I like Vacuum Wars on Youtube. I feel he does a good job overall with testing and deciding on good ones.\n\nAlso trust me, I hate how expensive they are, but some of them really are quite good. Some of the cheaper machines are also quite good. Like I said, we ended up loving our iLife machines. They are nothing fancy and have some quirks, but they are made well and more importantly, undercut the competition by hundreds. I actually found them because they are some of the only robots that use cyclones to help keep the dust from clogging the filter. They are almost always on sale on Amazon too, we got the A9 for under 200. The A10 offers basic lidar and mapping via app, for under 400. Their new A11 has much better lidar too. Not bad for a duget machine.\n\n If you want a good all round machine the Roborock's are hard to beat. If you have carpet and pets then I would recommend the IRobot J7+. The new Ecovacs I hear are good, although I don't personally like them. Dreame is a brand that makes some good machines on a budget too. There is also the Roidmi Eva that might still be on sale, mopping and vacuuming for less.\n\nOverall I wish you the best of luck! Just do some digging and wait for a sale, they happen fairly regularly!""]"

I'm looking for a Lidar vacuum robot to vacuum and mop hardwood floors. We have two long haired cats who leave litter around the whole house and would like to have a robot to clean up every day.  
With the cats, we are looking for a vacuum good at avoiding obstacles such as hairballs, cat waste and cat toys! Compatibility with alexa is needed and mop would be nice.
