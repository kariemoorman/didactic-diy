We are going to use SD cards in each camera as a storage solution, and our plan is to have an electrician install USB port-style outlets in the ceiling and we'll run a usb cable to each camera. Everything will also be connected via Wifi.

I know it's not the best solution - POE cameras with a POE switch, and a DVR with bulk HDD space  is a more enterprise - friendly solution, but it was the bosses call and our team is tasked with installation.

\-Is there a limit to how many cameras we can have on an account at one time?

\-Is there any type of Windows or Linux software that we can use to view multiple/all cameras at once? Or do we just need to buy a ""community"" tablet (multiple people will need to have access).

I am looking for a way to power the Cam off the grid without me needing to mess with the Birdhouse. 

Has anyone tested and found a DIY version of the solar panel for the Wyze Cam Outdoor that could be applied to a V3?
Seems like you could get a standard battery bank and plug something like the Wyze solar panel into the input and the v3 cam into the output. 

Don't know if anyone has tried it.
Thanks.",3,"[""wordyplayer: Yes this will work.   Make sure you buy a battery pack that can be charged AND provide power at the same time (this is more rare than you might think, read the reviews and comments). A v3 uses about 0.3 amps, maybe use 0.5 for easy math.  So for one day, it will use about (0.5x24)= 12 amp-hours.  Keep in mind this is at 5 volts, you might convert it to watt hours (12A-hrx5volts) = 60 watt-hours.  So you battery should probablay be at least 60 watt-hours in size, or bigger.  Then you need a solar panel that is larger than you might expect.  It needs to Provide 60 watt-hours per day to keep the system running indefinitely.  You need to see how much solar energy your area gets, and size the panel for your worst time of year.  Let's pretend 1/4 of the day is enough sunlight, so you need a panel sized at 240 watts or more.  \n\nI have not done this, it was easier to run extension cords!"", ""Drysandplace: From the time I got my first V1 I've experimented with solar and found right away that power banks don't hold enough charge to power a non battery camera for any practical amount of time.\n\nAt the same time  5v solar panels are also marketed for battery cameras and are too small to keep up with the power demands of a V3 (which is significantly higher than a WCO).\n\nPanels large enough to keep up are typically 12v and unregulated. I've seen the output go from 0v up to 20v. That means a controller is required to regulate the voltage and also provide a battery charging circuit. Improperly charging a battery will just fry it.\n\nI have three solar projects in operation currently. The first is overkill with a 100w panel but it operates two cameras, a V3 and a Eufy. The second is a more reasonable 20w panel and operates a single V3. Both use the same type controller that has a 12v charging circuit and a regulated 5v USB-A output. Batteries are optional but they match the design output of the panel so one is a marine lead acid and the other is paired 6v gel motorcycle batteries.\n\nThe third, just online for a week, is a WCO V2 that I attached two Wyze solar panels directly to. Coincidentally I incorporated it into a printed birdhouse. The solar is a sucess but I hate the camera. I let the battery get down to 69% while I was making some modifications to the bird house but was back to 100% within 2-3 hours back outside. The camera gives me really good live views but the recorded video is the problem. You have to pull the card to see it.\n\nYou could try the power bank and small regulated panel but your bank will drain quickly with a V3. Even if you shut it down at night I doubt that you'd make it through a short Grey winter day.\n\nUnfortunately nobody I've found have marketed a plug-n-play solar option for plug in cameras and like I said, I've been looking almost 5 years."", 'xXEvanatorXx: thank sfor your context.']"

But when cameras start having massive issues with connectivity after an update and continue to do so update after update when they were working well prior is not a user wifi or  house issue. \n\nWyze puts out buggy updates and hides all their issues behind meaningless error codes.  \n\nI currently have 4 cameras at 2 different locations, all going offline with ""error code 90"" constantly. All of these cameras at their respective locations are within 15 feet of an access point. And had been working relatively reliably up until recently. \n\nSo please tell me how it just so happens that both locations decided to reconfigure their surroundings to make the experience suck.\n\nTo blame a user\'s network is just people trying to hide Wyze\'s buggy software under a rug.

It can still be shit if your router is shit - and most ""router/wifi"" combo units *are* shit, or at least take some serious tweaking to make them *not be shit*. Just because you may have bought the most expensive gaming nighthawk or whatever bestbuy sold doesn\'t mean it\'s properly configured for how the wyze cams need it set. It also still doesn\'t rule out interference from neighbors or other devices, which is huge when dealing with dropping connections. \n\nYes, the wyze cams are sensitive, but again - I have never had one drop offline yet, because I ensured my network was configured properly *for them*.

If you\'re in an apartment building and everyone around you is on channel 11 and your AP is on channel 11, it\'s noisy AF and the wyze is going to complain. If you have no neighbors and you\'re all alone, then that\'s not a concern.\n\nWhat\'re your power settings on that wireless AP? How far away is the wyzecam? How many walls between cam and AP, what\'re they made of? What appliances or other electronics are line-of-site between the two?  \nWhat\'s the lowest supported data rate set at? What\'s the signal/noise ratio look like, using a 2.4ghz device in the same location as the wyzecam, since you can\'t actively tell from the cam itself?\n\nThe point here is, there\'s not a single ""what\'s correct"" answer. I can\'t tell you ""yeah, use channel 8, high power"" without knowing what *else* is going on nearby. Wifi is *a huge pain in the ass* to make work well, let alone perfectly. If you want something always connected with no issues and don\'t want to think about it, you wire it in.\n\nIt takes a crapton of testing to determine what\'s correct. You go test. Low signal? Ok, bump up the power setting. Now it\'s noisy? Alright, check channels. Still noisy? Something\'s in the way / causing interference. Either move that something, or add another AP midway between the two. Rinse and repeat, ruling out every single issue until it\'s as close to perfect as you can get it. Hell, I\'ve got one location that I cannot get *any* devices to stay connected in one single room, no matter where I put an AP. Why?

The cops should have been given the ""789 Ronald-kun"" address and been able to find the house they were looking for. Someone at the investigations department fucked up their work, and they probably also looked at a map without satellite-view which would have shown the direction the houses are facing.

1678494806.0,10-Mar-2023 16:33:26,Fix-It Friday 3/3/2023 Issues Check In #1,WyzeCam,6,11o5w6n,wyzecam,https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11o5w6n/fixit_friday_332023_issues_check_in_1/,"Happy Friday, everyone!

We have our new batch of Fix-It Friday issues! We also have some updates about submissions that were dormant so we’ll add those at the end of the document. Let’s begin with our new topics!

**Forum - Alexa Person Detection Triggers on some Wyze Cam v3s with Cam Plus Lite have disappeared for new activations for some users. They are still present for some people or those who previously set them up**

We’re looking into this from our side! Stay tuned!

**Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro and Wyze Cam Pan v3 30-second forward and back Playback buttons skip random hours**

We have confirmed a fix for this issue and we’re working on adding it to the 2.41 app. We’ll keep you posted as we progress.

**Core - Wyze Cam Pan v3 detection zones not working**

It’s suspected that this is related to the motor drift issue that we’re working on. We have an improvement in beta now but we’re still collecting more data to find the optimal tolerance level for the devices. Once we have that sorted out, we’ll release the firmware to the public. We’re also working on new processes in manufacturing to prevent this problem from occurring for future cameras. We’ll keep you updated about the beta progress.

**Discord - Special characters not allowed in Wyze Mesh Router Pro SSID or password**

It is expected that SSID and passwords with special characters should work unless that special character is an apostrophe. The block on apostrophes is by design. However, we saw a report that the router behaved incorrectly when dealing with this case so we want to look into what happened there. If your router crashed or otherwise stopped responding when special characters were used, please make sure that you’re using firmware 1.0.0.73 or later. If you are on updated firmware, please then send in a log using these instructions:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it here as a reply to me so I can get it to the right folks.

**- Let’s Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later***

No further update on this one this week. We’d like to have more logs from people that have set up Wyze Rules to turn on the spotlight for X minutes instead of just to turn them on, if you don’t mind! Here are the log instructions:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

***Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position***

The beta still looks promising but we’re still collecting more data to find the optimal tolerance level for the devices. Once we have that sorted out, we’ll release the firmware to the public. We’re also working on new processes in manufacturing to prevent this problem from occurring for future cameras. We’ll keep the updates coming!

***Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card***

We have verified that this issue is fixed on future firmware. We’re about to have another round of testing for the build that is currently in beta testing. The version that goes through after that is released to the public will have the fix.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

No further updates on this one yet. Here’s the info from before: We’ve gone through all the submitted logs! Some of them don’t have information because the log was created after the camera was power cycled or rebooted. But we did find that all the useful logs showed that the firmware keeps trying to reconnect IoT but cannot get the IP address and cannot connect to the internet.

If your internet connection was solid at the time, we think that there was probably a crash on the Wi-Fi driver not related to the firmware. We’re working on adding a health check function to recover devices in similar states. The cloud side is already in place and next we’ll work on firmware.

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

We’re getting ready for the next beta firmware round! We’re aiming to release it to testers next week.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

We don’t have a new update for this yet because the fix is moved into the firmware build following the one currently in beta.

**- Updates For Dormant Topics -**

**The Alexa Routines trigger ""IF clear for 'X' time” wasn't executing when using a Wyze Sense Hub and a Wyze Sense v2 Motion Sensor**

This isn’t something we’re able to replicate anymore. Is this still a problem for people? We’ll leave this open for a bit to see if anyone is still experiencing this problem. If we don’t hear back, we’ll close it. We have reason to believe that this has been addressed already.

**Slow Alexa announcements of Person Detection from outdoor cameras**

Is this still a problem for anyone? If so, how long does it take for an announcement to happen after the Event Video is triggered?

**Greater control over marketing popups in the Wyze app**

We’re working on a toggle for improving control over marketing messages in the Wyze app. We’re also working on auditing what we send and when as well as a duplicate data cleanup initiative that will help ensure that messages sent to folks are more relevant to them. We’ll provide more information as we move forward.

**Wyze Cam Pan v2 siren not able to be selected as an action in Rules when it was previously available**

Is this still a problem for folks? We’re looking into it but could use some confirmation from all of you.

**Moving object detection**

We are testing out a prototype. It’s possible that this will be released to cameras in the future but we can’t promise it yet. We need to see how it performs first.

**Wyze Sense Hub Events not showing the correct time**

We are aiming to work on the Wyze Sense Hub time sync in the next firmware release but this isn’t final yet. We’re aligning on a solution and will provide updates when we have them.

Thank you for reading! We know this update was longer than usual. See you next week for Fix-It Friday!",4,"['Affectionate_Tip_937: You missed the duplicate notifications for v3 pro and not correctly tagging motion.', 'Mollysindanga: Ios (fully updated phone, newest just released app) app is still returning [2001 error](https://i.imgur.com/d2EbO5M.png) when starting it, Cams in groups get all twisted when going horizontal.', ""mantarayfrog: Voip doesn't work on doorbell pro press on pixel devices"", 'WyzeCam: I am sorry this is happening.

1678492349.0,10-Mar-2023 15:52:29,Wyze Cam Pan V3 (V2 Power Adapter) Plug? I need several of just the plugs. I'm replacing dead V2's so extended micro USB's are already behind my vinyl. Anyone know a cheap solution before I return these cams for something else?,joshw0000,9,11o4xqx,wyzecam,https://i.redd.it/j23354sij1na1.jpg,,17,"['Bluefire-JD: I have the V3 Pro. When I upgraded, I continued using the same extended Micro USB purchased from Amazon. I just changed the wall charger that came with the new camera and it continued to work perfectly.', 'Angus-Black: My thought when I first saw these was it was going to be a pain. Proprietary connectors always are.', 'sackling: That’s a dick', ""thecounselinggeek: I sent my v3 pro back mainly because of this reason (and because it didn't support accessories like the light bulb socket). The screwed the pooch with that release."", 'ndnchild: https://www.etsy.com/listing/1396828931/\n\nIs this what you need?', 'doggyStile: I used the screw base for an old v2 cover which meant the bend did not matter. If you change the base mount, you can probably use the old wires', ""MightyZygote: That Etsy link for the spacer looks nice if you want to use the mount that comes in the box with the V3 Pan Cam and and an existing run that doesn't have a 90' angle connector like the cable that comes in the box.\n\nHowever my experience with Wyze cams, including the outdoor models, is that their notion of quality/fit/finish/consistency on their products including those with IP-65 ratings for water ingress/protection is very poor and inconsistent. So unless your existing cables really fill that connector area up well, it's a perfect place for water to enter, especially if mounted upside down without an eave or covering above it, or if the cable doesn't have a good drip line to avoid feeding water directly to that area. The 90 degree connector it comes with doesn't completely fill that area up all the way to where it looks or feels like it would really offer great protection, so YMMV, but a little dab of silicon or covering it with silicon tape certainly would help.\n\nIf you don't mind sacrificing the cables that came with the Pan V3 cams, you can make a simple adapter for your existing runs with some inexpensive female micro-usb power pigtails ($6.99 for a two pack on Amazon: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JYSZR2N](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JYSZR2N) ), some solder,  heat shrink and silicon tape.\n\nDefinitely cheaper than buying multiple $16.99 V2 power adapters from Wyze just to get those dongles. For an example with photos, take a look at this thread related to some issues with Pan Cam V3's and overly long cable runs and power drops. The anchor link I'm sharing to that thread jumps to a comment that includes info and photos, but the overall thread may be valuable as well as the V3 Pan Cams are definitely very sensitive to cable run lengths that didn't pose a problem to the earlier pan cam models - see here for more: [https://forums.wyze.com/t/wyze-cam-pan-v3-wont-power-on-with-extension-cord/259722/6](https://forums.wyze.com/t/wyze-cam-pan-v3-wont-power-on-with-extension-cord/259722/6)"", ""joshw0000: I was going to try that but it won't work for the V3 Pan. There's a plate that goes over the port and it swivels. So if I were to cut the mounting plate and run the plug straight through I lose the ability for the camera to turn."", ""joshw0000: I didn't even consider these cameras not being compatible. The V2 was great for its time. It could jumper to run 2 cams, SD support, and if you got in early enough basic service  is free. I just assumed the newer ones would have that or more. Where I'm replacing I had 2 cams in each so I'm pretty much forced to use the pans or redo my wiring so I can get power to them. I found an adapter on Amazon that might work to adapt the old cord to the new one. IF it works I'll have to shrink wrap the connections to make them waterproof. If I end up having to re-run wires I may just pull a few outlets where I want cameras. More hassle now but I won't have to redo it in a few years.\n\nI haven't even looked to see if this camera works with the light bulb. That definitely crossed my mind as an option."", ""Wtfplasma: I had the same issue. Wyze light bulb socket adapter only outputs 1A.. Not sure why wyze hasn't updated it yet.. V3 Pro and Pan requires more amperage. I found a socket adapter from another brand that has 2A output on Amazon. I was able to install a v3 Pan outside without having to add extra wiring."", ""joshw0000: After experimenting some it turns out I was wrong. Something internal swivels, not the outside piece. So I've got some options for hooking it up. I can simply drill a hole in the plastic mounting piece or I can  rob the swivel mount from the old V2 boxes and screw directly into the camera.\n\nMy next concern is whether or not my old plugs are skinny enough to plug in the plug. I tried a random micro USB from a drawer and it was too fat. If not hopefully I can grind/sand it down to fit."", ""joshw0000: That's what I'm going to try."", ""thecounselinggeek: I shaved the plastic down to get the connection to work but the not being able to use the bulb was the deal breaker for me. It really wasn't that much of an improvement for my use to sacrifice the usability"", 'TedTeddybear: Get some F4 tape and wrap it around the connection -- that stuff stops leaks in steam pipes!', 'ellingson17: The cable that came with my Wyze Cam V2 fit the pan v3 no problem.   I drilled out a slot in the pan mounting plate to run the cable up through and had just enough clearance to still get the screw in the bottom.  I can send some pics if you would like', ""joshw0000: Thanks. I did just that and my old wire (from Amazon) fit. The first camera is mounted. I think they're going to work out fine.""]"

I’m wondering if anyone can answer my question. 

I download all my cameras footage to my SD Cards 24/7 and do not use any cloud storage to store my recordings. Occasionally I will do a time lapse video and was wondering where does that get stored? 

I’m using iOS and have removed all associated photos and videos downloads from the settings->privacy and security -> Edit selected photos. But when I go into the albums folder i see it still lets me download my time lapses from over a year ago. I know this isn’t stored on my phone or SD card since I’m constantly overwriting the recordings. 

Does this mean it’s being stored in the cloud?

When I reboot the router, all is well.  After 60 minutes, almost exactly, every time I reboot, all of my wyze devices go offline and I have to reboot them to get another 60 minutes of use.

I have a 2.4G network for my IOT things that works for all of my other stuff, its just Wyze that dies.

I have also noticed that the wyze devices poll DHCP for an IP every 30 seconds until they drop offline.  They all have a static reservation set in the router, and this is the same behavior as when they were just using DHCP without the reservation.

Caught some of the action from a few different cameras (neighbor's ring, my v3 saw the car turn around in the street, but couldn't see the licenses plate number).


The majority was outside the FOV of my V3, so I'm trying to decide what camera to get next, to add additional coverage to the front of my house. 

Car is parked about 50 feet from the camera, which is pointed more for the walk than the car.

I considered getting the Pan v3, but I actually like the coverage of the current camera and just wanna add additional coverage.

These will be mounted outside the window (still protected from the weather), so hopefully won't have any IR issues?


Is the Telephoto a good option? I'm not fully sure how the zoom works, it's just always 3x zoomed, with an additional 8x zoom? 

I have CamPlus (and will probably get it for the new camera) but I don't think Cam protect is gonna do anything for me here


Any other feedback welcome, thanks",5,"[""mantarayfrog: i actually had my cat stolen in front of my house with the wyze cam looking down at them, but the cam neither got clear enough images of their faces nor their car/license plate. \n\nfrom my understanding, wyze cams should just be used to monitor your property. you'll have to invest in way more expensive equipment to get any good fidelity on identities or license plates..."", 'warmon6: > Is the Telephoto a good option? \n\nDepends on what you\'re looking for out of it. \n\nIf your looking to get license plates numbers, it\'s a hit and miss. \n\nOk during the day time, mostly a miss during the night. The 10 FPS night mode (Day is 15FPS) really limits this cam potential on reading plates at night. (Although if the car sits still just long enough, you might get some plate numbers). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a complementary camera to a wide FOV cam (like the v3\'s) covering the same area, it\'s great (and is my use case). Any detail the a wide FOV cam might of missed in a particular area, the tele cam would most certainly have caught it (usually) in better clarity. \n\n Here\'s a screenshot of my cam group that shows the differences with ""Street Cam"" being the OG Telephoto cam and the Driveway cam being the V3 (Floodlight) cam. \n\n(I know group view doesn\'t give the most detail but I think the differences are clear enough).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmp3nt6zgoma1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4bd77a9a581214e852178d69a7908c3d17aa996\n\nNow, as a standalone cam (no additional coverage of the same area from other cams), it would certainly have constricting use cases. Because this cam has a narrow FOV, it would be best suited for long and straight confined areas the the cam can look down like streets, sidewalks, alleyways, narrow side yards, etc. (Just something that would keep a person in view of the camera for as long as possible as it\'s not hard for people to get out of this camera view.)\n\nThe other standalone use would be to monitor something far away that wide FOV cams would barely make anything out \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I\'m not fully sure how the zoom works, it\'s just always 3x zoomed, with an additional 8x zoom? \n\nIt\'s strictly a 3x fixed optical zoom (so if you pull the sd card out of it and look at the video\'s on it, thats the zoom you\'ll see.) The 8x zoom is the digital zoom in the app and behaves exactly the same as all of other wyze cams.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> The majority was outside the FOV of my V3, so I\'m trying to decide what camera to get next, to add additional coverage to the front of my house.   \n>  \n> Any other feedback welcome, thanks \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf your trying to get additional coverage where the cams FOV\'s are not overlapping (say a cam facing west and a cam facing south), I would say the v3 or regular OG cams would be a good fit (unless of course you meet on of those conditions I mentioned earlier for a OG Tele cam).', ""Mego1989: Get a dash cam.

Here are my impressions about Wyze products today and the company in general.

My setup: 
Wyze Wi-Fi 6 Mesh routers
Wyze Floodlights
Color Bulbs
Light Strip Pro
Wyze Cam Pan v2
Wyze Cam v3
Wyze Cam v3 Pro

Can access my Wyze cameras through Apple and Android (2021 iPad and Samsung S22) running the latest firmware

General Observations: 

Company
- Somewhere in the past year or two, Wyze has exclusively focused on bringing as many new smart home products to the market while neglecting both the Android and iOS apps
- There’s been a bigger push for marketing and PR than ensuring products work as advertised
- The Customer Service Team has been outsourced almost entirely to the Phillipines
- The Customer Service Team does not or cannot engage with the Wyze engineers. There’s a disconnect

Android App
- The android app is buggy and when it does receive updates, it usually causes more issues with connectivity. It’s probably better not to update right away
- Consistent connectivity issues with Android (much less than iPhone)


Wyze Lights (Color bulbs) - Hardware is great, using them is difficult
Wyze Cam v3 Pro - Super promising, no major issues
Wyze Mesh Routers -  Constantly having dropped connections, device management features (restricting access through parental controls. And blocking devices) simply do no work
Wyze Light Strip Pro - No issues
Wyze Cam Pan v2 - No issues
Wyze Cam V3 - No issues",1,['bobes25: so cams have the least amount of issues.  they should go back to their roots.']

I have an issue with the Wyze lock bolt though.  I have it on an entrance door to my garage, with a small overhang from my roof.  I installed it last June, and had no issues through the summer and fall, but winter temps have been a big problem.

I have had 4 different replacement units since January.  First the keypad stopped working for fingerprints and most numbers.  Second one the entire keypad failed completely.  Third one the batteries drained 35-45% per day for about a week before calling.  I just installed my Fourth unit Sunday. 

What I have noticed is that each time I take the keypad off, there is moisture on the back of the metal housing.  There is no water going in there, and I have even added some silicone caulking around it, but it still has moisture.  Now, the garage does have some heat in it, keeping it around 60 degrees, and exterior temps are anywhere between 5 degrees and 70 degrees in the past 12 weeks.

How do I keep moisture away from the keypad?  I had a ""dumb"" keypad from kwikset that lasted in the same location about 8 years with no problems at all.  I also have another Wyze lock bolt to my basement, but it is covered by my deck, and has no issue at all.

Unfortunately I did this because I wanted to completely restore my bootloader, and various other partitions to undo all my past modifications to it. So, I successfully updated, restored, and reflashed to the latest firmware, even logged onto the app and reconnected, verified I was now on the latest firmware, everything's working great. But my plans were to install custom firmware afterwards, I don't like the cloud-based firmware and as a person who manages his own networking and home security all at home, with a VPN to my house, so that I can watch an RTSP feed of whatever no matter where I am, I wanted to use either DaFang Hacks, or OpenMiko and manage the camera myself as an IP Camera. Anyways, I've recently discovered that when I use the SD card to flash another custom demo.bin, that the light does change to light blue as it previously has and should, but instead of staying blue and flashing the firmware, it proceeds to cancel and go right to yellow. When I then normally press the setup button, it says it's ready to connect. Essentially, it won't take any demo.bin anymore, I've tried downgrading, upgrading, using many versions, nothing's working. It's like firmware flashing is just patched. It literally will not say solid blue, it cancels every time and boots to the latest firmware. Was this done on purpose? Is this camera basically useless to me now? What can I do? I've verified the SD card is working, I've done pretty much everything I can.

1678079154.0,05-Mar-2023 21:05:54,My Wyze experience for the last two months,Buhrner,1,11jp428,wyzecam,https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11jp428/my_wyze_experience_for_the_last_two_months/,"Hello all, In the last two months I decided to rip out a large number of Nest cameras/doorbells of multiple generations, I live in a quiet area so overall security was  my #2 concern vs just having visibility to the front of my house, certainly monitoring the house while I am away was important as well.

I won’t go into the deficiencies of the nest ecosystem I am sure others can cover that.

I’ve messed around with all sorts of different ecosystems over the years (arlo, reolink, ubiquity  to name three)

I have a lot of OG, 2 OG 3X, PTZ V3, 1 V3 Pro and 2 Doorbell Pro as well as some outdoor battery cameras.

I had a few older Wyse cameras around and the responsiveness and reliability is night and day. In fact the improvement between the v3 pro and the OG/PTZ V3 is very noticeable. I decided not to use some old PTZ I had.

I also have well a number of color / BR30 Bulbs and plugs

A few points, I don’t work for wyze so no reason to complain to me:

* if you don’t want to pay for the cam plus subscription, I don’t believe it’s a good idea to go down the road of investing in wyze (modest though it may be) – after a few cameras getting the “unlimited” is the way to go.
* Work under the assumption that custom firmware / RTSP hacks will not work, however I use the wyze docker rtsp bridge for the tech inclined, it works very well with the PTZ v3 and V3 pro but doesn’t work with the OG and may never work with them.
* I would recommend buying at least a 32 gig microSD for every camera ( I got 128 for. Most)  - this is the only way to do continuous recording.
* while it hasn't come up yet for me  I would recommend having a different brand smart plug (wemo/kasa/etc) on your important cameras in case something goes goofy with the wyze cloud or firmware updates. usually doesn't hurt to do a hard reboot, which not every camera can do remotely, especially if there some type of hiccup when you are away.
* The “AI” detection of vehicles/people  via subscription immensely cuts down with false positive motion notification – it is essential to tweak detection zones and the detection sliderBecause of this rules such as “if camera X detects vehicle/person do y” works very well – the one “hackjob” is that you really need a wyze plug to be triggered which can feed into an Alexa routine – Alexa doesn’t know anything besides “motion” on cameras so can’t be tied to a “AI” event, but once added a plug for this purpose, Alexa routines executed almost instantly.
* something I was used to with nest, but there is a complete lack of email notifications - obviously things can be done with IFTTT and such - this is another spot where tying wyze rules to their smart plug makes IFTTT much more useful.
* One of the very under-rated features of the doorbells is that it can be made to give a “voip” call, so a doorbell press comes up similar to a skype call and connects very quickly – I am not sure how well this works with multiple household members using wyze but I found this feature consistently more reliable than any battery or wired doorbell I have tried. however due to the fisheye Lense and of course battery life I would recommend some kind of camera to complement the area the doorbell is in (I don’t think there will be an Alexa notification for ring  feature for it however) - I have the solar panel on mind but placement makes this of limited value recharging for me.
* I think the utility of the OG  telephoto model is under-rated, this immensely helps in busy areas and complements detection zone to say zoom in on a driveway area and cut out a busy street or sidewalk.
* Grouping cameras (and devices in general) works well, this allows me to quickly enable/disable all my indoor cameras when geolocation detects me leaving (however it doesn't seem to detect me arriving home)
* so far the IOS widget  seems rather buggy I am sure this will improve with time
* not referenced often enough is the wyze outdoor AC kit, this is basically a self contained AC to microusb cable with helpful outdoor shielding (make sure to get the right version for your camera - the big difference is an angled USB adapter for the v3 PTZ)
* the stacking kit for OG cameras actually includes a 2 to 1 microUSB cable and AC adapter as well and not just the little plastic screw to connect two OG cameras together
* one absurdity is the new OG cameras have a non standard screw that is incompatible with the 10,000 different camera mounts on the market, this adapter basically solves this problem:

* I also got the home monitoring hub, but at this time didn't get the subscription (can't buy it without 1 month of service) this allows me to use motion and leak detectors even without a sub, but the keyboard and other features on the monitoring tab won't work without a home monitoring sub

 \* one quick of the current (and older PTZ) is that while it does a good job of following motion, I consistently found it a challenge to return to it's original monitoring position, it also seems to be the most challenging to tweak since it follows all motion, not just ""people and vehicles"" so I think you have to either pick follow motion or pan and scan. I have found having a single waypoint it returns to helps, but tracking motion just distracts it too much no matter how much you tweak (see shadows) 

Anyway, in conclusion, two thumbs up overall.

1678062637.0,05-Mar-2023 16:30:37,PSA for those with wyze cam V3 spotlight accessory problems,Ruitakim,5,11jj0fr,wyzecam,https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11jj0fr/psa_for_those_with_wyze_cam_v3_spotlight/,"After a lot of painful back and forth with a customer support representative I discovered today that 4 spotlight accessories purchased in July 2022 from wyze fulfilled by Amazon shipped with beta 0.0.0.19 firmware instead of the only firmware listed on the wyze website 0.0.0.16. 

It appears that the latest firmware for wyze cam V3 does not work well with the 0.0.0.19 spotlight firmware and even though it says there's a spotlight in device info, when you go to accessories it says there's no spotlight connected. I have an older spotlight on 0.0.0.16 firmware that's worked without any issues from the start. 

I had one of the 4 spotlights brand new in box that I opened today and it was on the 0.0.0.19 firmware out of the box. I emailed support asking if the 0.0.0.19 firmware could be downgraded and after some very painful replies I finally was told that there's no way to downgrade the spotlight firmware. Not sure why I was told several times to unenroll from the beta program when I never enrolled and never upgraded the spotlight firmware. Also what's the point of telling me to unenroll in the beta program if there's no way to downgrade the firmware in the first place? It seems like the only way is to request warranty replacement and hope wyze is not still shipping spotlights with buggy 0.0.0.19 firmware pre-installed. 

If you search wyze forums for this issue there's basically no response from wyze and some have comments such as ""I threw them away out of frustration"". I hope Wyze will look into this issue as many people with spotlight issues may have purchased spotlights with 0.0.0.19 beta firmware installed from the factory. I'm not sure how something this can happen but hope this saves someone from being as frustrated as I was.

I fully agree with a comment I saw, the spotlight was probably just a paid beta hardware for wyze to test spotlight to include in the V3 pro and newly released og cam since they don't care at all about supporting people who have purchased the V3 cam spotlight accessory. Based on the lack of a fix, maybe Wyze hopes people just throw it out instead of voicing a complaint for a defective product.  There's been one user ""Rulwiz"" who has been asking for months for help on the forums and it seems that Wyze just doesn't care.",5,"['Affectionate_Tip_937: Post your message here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11hjvh2/fixit_friday_callout_for_new_issues_3323/', ""y_zass: I've never had a problem with mine, I have it mounted above my door.

Interesting discovery...,clockercountwise333,9,11jiypc,wyzecam,https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11jiypc/ios_vs_android_app_performance_interesting/,"So I've been pretty frustrated with the Wyze App on my brand new-ish iPhone / latest iOS lately. It's unbearably sluggish, taking sometimes 10 seconds (!) to initially load. Sometimes it takes so long to load that it just gives up and crashes. Once it does load, the load time from screen to screen is almost as crazy. Like I can tap on an icon 30 times in frustration before it actually loads.

So perhaps you can imagine my surprise when I decided to dust off a *5 year old* android phone and load up the Wyze App, as I wanted to have a dedicated view for a certain group of sensors.

Shocker: It's smooth as butter.

The app loads instantly and screen to screen it's totally usable.

You know what that means. it means it is time for this month’s Fix-It-Friday callout! 

If this is your first Fix-It Friday, welcome! For background, while our communities are not designed to be a replacement for [Wyze Support ](https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us), our community members and community managers do our best to help you out here. As our communities scale up, we want to make sure that any outstanding bugs or issues that you folks are facing are on our internal radar and that we’re transparent in our process of working on them.

Here’s how this works:

* We’ll make a post on the first Friday of the month in every community (Core Community on Facebook, Forums, Reddit, and Discord).
* Check the comments. If you see any other comments with issues that you’re facing, vote for them with a like (the heart button at the bottom of their reply)
* Got something new? Reply to our post with the top issue that you’re facing this week with your Wyze products to help loop us in.
* We’ll grab the top comment from each community and make a follow-up post on Monday to detail what those issues are and how we plan to fix them. If we need more info from the community to help figure out what’s going on, we’ll let you know on Monday - so please make sure to take a look!
* The following Mondays in the month, we’ll be posting updates about our progress on Fix-It Friday submissions.
* Sometimes Mondays are actually Tuesdays if we don’t get all the info we need on time for posting on Monday. Our apologies! 
* Remember, this is for existing things that aren’t working right. If you are looking for a new feature or for us to add functionality that’s not already available, please use our [Wishlist ](https://forums.wyze.com/c/wishlist)instead!

We’re constantly working on improvements for everyone. But we hope that this process will both help us prioritize issues that are important to our communities and help you feel more in the loop.

Got a request for something new or an additional feature? Check our [Wishlist ](https://forums.wyze.com/c/wishlist/l/votes)to see if it’s in the works or has been requested. 

If you want to see how this works, you can check this previous Fix-It Friday post:

We have a new callout for the March Fix-It Friday bug submissions! Please make sure to go vote for the bugs you’d like to see included for the next month. Here are your updates for this week:

**Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later**

We’re continuing to look into this! We’d like to have more logs from people that have set up Wyze Rules to turn on the spotlight for X minutes instead of just to turn them on. Here are the log instructions:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

**Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position**

This build is still in beta and people are reporting that it’s helping. We’ll be sending it out to the public when it’s ready.

**Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card**

We have verified that this issue is fixed on the firmware that will enter beta after the current build is released. We’ll keep you posted!

**- Let’s Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn’t auto-unlock when the “Disable during hours” schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again***

Firmware 1.0.6.2 has now been released to the public! We’ll be removing this from our update list next week.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

No further updates on this one yet. Here’s the info from before: We’ve gone through all the submitted logs! Some of them don’t have information because the log was created after the camera was power cycled or rebooted. But we did find that all the useful logs showed that the firmware keeps trying to reconnect IoT but cannot get the IP address and cannot connect to the internet.

If your internet connection was solid at the time, we think that there was probably a crash on the Wi-Fi driver not related to the firmware. We’re working on adding a health check function to recover devices in similar states. The cloud side is already in place and next we’ll work on firmware.

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

The beta results for this are still promising! We aren’t quite ready to release the firmware to the public but we’re getting there. Additionally, we still have some work to do for Wyze Cam v3 with additional products like a floodlight that we’re in the process of completing.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

We don’t have a new update for this yet because the fix is moved into the next firmware build.

Thanks for tuning in! Don’t forget to vote for Fix-It Friday submissions and come back next week to see our new batch of Fix-It Friday topics!

The other night, Spectrum experienced an outage in my area and everything went offline.  The little flashing indicator on the Switches were flashing to the point that it made it impossible to sleep.  In effect, they turned into anti-transient strobes you see outside of convenience stores.

Now I'm beginning to regret this decision and thinking of the upcoming hurricane season and what life would be like if the Internet is out for any length of time while my home still has power from the stand-by we put in a couple years ago.  I've also got a lot of Color Bulbs that are controlled by those switches as smart devices.  If the Internet is out, there's no way to turn on those bulbs.  I'd be in the dark except for the disco coming from the Switch status lights.

What are the chances of Wyze developing a local server/hub to go with that new mesh router?  Something that can take over to allow switches, bulbs, plugs, vacuums, and maybe even cams to continue to work locally if the Internet goes out?",15,"[""minionsweb: The cams annoy the living hell out of me when they can't connect at night, pancam in particular flashing blue led\nHammer...."", 'stevemcqueen50: Pretty positive you can control the lights like normal switches without internet by just pressing the switch.  So you can still control the Wyze bulb as normal lights.\n\nDoes just turning off the status light in settings resolve your concern with the blinking status light?', 'lagger: Not relevant to your question but I just purchased 30 switches… \n\nHow did the install go? Did you learn and tips you could share? I installed 3 on a single switch panel and it was a real PITA with the cables slipping out as I tried to muscle things around. Hoping the others go a bit smoother. \n\nAlso related to your question. I purchased the Wyze doorbell and the LEDs bothered me so much I just opened up the inside and severed the connection for the LEDs. It’s a much better product now. I would bet you could do something similar but that would required opening up your work again. 😵\u200d💫', ""BizzyM: No on both.  For switches that were set up as normal control, they still turn the circuit on and off.  For switches that are set up as smart control, they leave the circuit on and when they lose connection,  they don't do anything.\n\nI have several where the status light is turned off.  Those also blink when connection is lost."", ""BizzyM: Yeah.  Typical household wiring takes advantage of the fact that normal switches are tiny, simply things that don't take up much space.  Wyze Switches are huge and really complicate things when it comes to wiring.\n\nFirst, a caution.  Never use Phillips screwdrivers on the lugs, only straight blade, and use the biggest one that will fit.  Never push the lugs into the body.  The screws are tightened down hard and you may instinctively want to push into the body to make sure the screwdriver doesn't slip and strip the head.  Too much force will bend and possibly break the lugs.\n\nI take a couple short wires and put them in hot and neutral on the Switch and jam them into a switched power switch so I can set up the Switch on my account before installing.  Nothing worse than going through the effort of replacing a switch only to find that Wyze is experiencing problems and you can't add new devices (This actually happened to me).\n\nFor multi gang setups, I get the 2 part faceplates.  BUT BE CAREFUL!   I ended up with [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09GB5TX36) and they have clips between the switches that will hit the body of the Switch and create a bulge because they won't seat right.  You can see what I mean on the 7th picture in that listing.  I had to break them off.\n\nThe 2 part face plates allow me to install the switches in the faceplate frame before installing them into the box.  Helps with alignment.   Also allows me to create short jumpers for hot, neutral, and ground between the switches to reduce the amount of wires (and Wagos) wedged into the box.  I replaced all wire nuts with Wagos.  Much simpler and can be a space saver.   It also makes it so that if I ever need to take them out, I unscrew the Switches from the box, but keep them in the frame, and take them out as an assembled unit instead of individually.  The Wagos make disconnecting them easier too (Which may come in handy if I ditch Wyze for another brand).\n\nSince they've already been set up, once you physically install them and provide power, they are ready to go.\n\nYou can also create soft 3(or greater)-way  switches, if you need to.  It has its drawbacks, but it's doable."", 'stevemcqueen50: I guess I may have misunderstood where you have the smart bulbs.  If they are in the light actually physically controlled by the switch, then yes, it still should control it if you just turn off the ""additional/smart"" controls.\n\nUnfortunate about turning off the status light. Maybe just put a piece of masking tape over the light temporarily with the switches where the light is bothering you until connection is restored.', 'lagger: Hey man. Thanks for the detailed reply. Two things. 1. Do you recommend any WAGOs? 2. Also, if you do end up ditching your Wyze switches for a diff brand, if you could save me a little bit of money I wouldn’t mind buying used unless you can manage a full refund.', ""BizzyM: Ah, I see what you're saying now.  Change them from Smart to Classic to eliminate the problem in the future.\n\nNow I have to remember why I bothered setting them up as Smart to begin with."", ""OON7: The real kicker is how is the light switch going to know it's changed to classic if it's not connected to the Internet."", 'BizzyM: Not sure what you mean by ""Any Wago"".  I used the 221-41x (where x is the number of connectors).\n\nIf I ditch Wyze, it won\'t be immediately soon.  I\'ll have to research alternatives, especially in how they handle offline situations.\n\nYou just bought 30.  You need more??', 'lagger: I appreciate the help. \n\nYou should see this house we just bought… it has possibly the most autistic electrical plan ever (overdone). There are over 30 switches on the first floor. The master bathroom alone has 7 switches. Its 3 floors and has multiple outbuildings.  I bought 100 plug plastic covers for my 1 year old — and I barely covered half of the first floor’s electrical outlets… (they are 4x4 and every 4 feet)', ""BizzyM: JFC.   That sounds massive.   No offense, but if you're shelling out for a huge place like that, why skimp and do Wyze?  Personally, I'd seek out a better, more robust platform."", 'lagger: No offense taken. \n\nI admit I’m a total homer. I did my last house with a combo of products (wemo, Wyze, Phillips hue, off brand stuff, ring, nest, Alexa) and it’s all worked but a pain in the ass because of the multiple ecosystems. I’ve never had bad luck with Wyze and figured I could get just about everything on one platform. I’m about 1/10th the way there on the new house. Wifi, cams, sense, monitoring, and vacuum are set up. I’ve been procrastinating the switch installs because how much trouble I had with the first go of it.', ""BizzyM: Wyze has a lot of potential to be a great platform, but they need a unicorn of a development team that's able to pull everything together at, what I can only guess is, an entry-level pay scale."", 'lagger: My assessment is similar. They seem to have 2x the amount of products as they seem to have support and true R&D for. And some products that should just have never been launched or even entertained.

I was sound asleep when my camera detected a 'person' - which was actually just a cobweb. Noonlight both texted and called.  Problem is they could not view the video and contacted the police. Who were at my front door in the wee hours.

Wyze has not responded in a useful way.

In the past, systems were available that included some number of cameras and some sort of recorder.  At first these were hard-wired, then some became available wireless.  Now these Wyze cameras, and others such as Blink (sp?), work through an app on the phone and I just don't know enough about them to trust them.

So what I need is an education in this sort of camera, including alternatives (like maybe wireless via my home WiFi, if that's a thing), and especially with regards to security.  I'm no computer or cell phone expert, and just don't know what to read or to believe.  I'd appreciate links to websites that contain relevant information or reviews.  (I do better reading than watching videos, given a choice.)

Thanks in advance.",10,"['AgentAaron: If you want true security, you need to go with something that records to a secured DVR/NVR. The cameras would also need to be mounted in a way that they would be completely unreachable without the aid of a ladder/lift. If you plan on going this route, I suggest IP cameras and a DRV that supplies POE. You would not have remote access to the camera system if there was an internet outage, but the cameras would keep recording.\n\nI spent several years designing and installing these types of camera systems for residential, commercial, as well as government buildings.\n\nPersonally, I switched over to Wyze several years ago because I had many residential customers that were sick of paying the price for Ring/Nest cameras and the subscription services that went along with them. I tried both Blink and Wyze, and liked the Wyze cameras far better because Blink was all battery powered back then...so I have put 9-10 cameras on both our houses since that time. I do have each camera fitted with a 32GB SD card and get about 4 days of footage (even when there is no internet) that I can play back. For me, that is plenty of time, but this would probably not work for any commercial situation.\n\nMy cameras are mounted both indoor and outdoor (in a sudo weatherproof mount) and are all in public areas of the house indoors (kitchen, living room, hallway, garage, etc). For safety and personal security of individuals, I would never (and have refused to customers) to install cameras in bathrooms or used bedrooms.\n\n90% of IoT devices have fairly mild security (they have to be easy for a novice to use). If you are connecting these types of devices to your home internet, I would greatly suggest creating a ""guest network"" and connecting them to that rather than your primary network, which is usually pretty simple. This is not limited to Wyze at all and goes for your TV, Roomba, even your appliances. \n\nAs for the apps permissions and the security of your data...lets face it, there are far many more hacks through social media accounts then there are through security apps. Could it possibly happen...sure, its the internet after all. However, if someone wants to hack my cameras and judge me by the tidiness of my living room or garage, or if they want to watch me cook dinner and mow the lawn...I really do not care.', 'ikilledtupac: A $300 Ali Express Wi-Fi jammer will destroy most “security cameras”.

Or there was no recoring at all because the camera didnt detect any motion or sound. very few Wyze cameras have solved a crime. \n\nIn short, Wyze devices don't live up to the sales hype often enough to be called a security system."", 'Itsallkosher1: Do you want decent quality cameras for $35?

Rings user  interface to review recordings is much easier to use than Wyze. I totally agree with comments above that every time I’ve had an incident I get frustrated with Wyze – ie Had a burglar alarm go off today.

My name is Gwendolyn and I'm a Senior Digital Community Manager at Wyze. I would really appreciate it if you spent a bit of your day filling out my survey. This survey is looking for insight from you into which Wyze communities you participate in, how you feel in these groups, and how you feel about Wyze. Please make sure you only fill out this survey ONCE. There will be posts in all of our community spaces for this, but your info will already be counted with your first submission!

  
If you choose to answer every single question and are active in every Wyze community, it may take up to 20 minutes to complete the survey. To help save time, this survey is designed to skip sections that aren't relevant to your experience and I added a page where you can choose if you want to answer more questions about Wyze in general.

  
The information provided will not be shared outside of Wyze. Your responses to these questions may lead to follow-up surveys and investigations for experience improvements.

I trialed one on the corner of my house. I cannot make out the number plate on my car parked approximately 5m from the camera and doing a test walk back toward the camera you wouldn't be able to tell the significant distinguishing features on my face. I also checked footage of my girlfriend driving out of the driveway and at no point can I distinguish her numberplate. Am i doing something wrong or are these just not that good? I have these setup with a PoE network with a usb adapter/breakout, I also have a micro SD card installed. I have looked at the footage directly off the card too and it seems no better. Interestingly I did notice a few frames that were maybe marginally better but they were few and far between and really i need something that i can navigate the video frame by frame to pull these images. When zooming in it looks like theres some seriously heavy processing going on, is there anything i can do about this? I'm not so fussed on the live stream or even what i can access via wifi but if i cant distinguish prominent facial features or number plates at a sensible range then these just aren't good enough to be security cameras. 

Added a couple of pictures for example, you can see the difference in the number plate quality between the two photos. One is almost legible, the one with me also in the photo is horrendously bad

Welcome back for another round of Fix-It Friday! We saw some people asking about this. So as a reminder, the callout for new submissions will happen next Friday. So start thinking about what you’d like to vote for! Here are your updates for this week:

**Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position**

We’re still testing the firmware build related to this! We’re hearing that the issue is improved though not perfect in some cases. If you’re a beta tester, please try the firmware currently in beta and let us know how it goes for you!

**Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later**

We’re looking into this still! If possible, we’d like to have more logs from people that have set up Wyze Rules to turn on the spotlight for X minutes instead of just to turn them on. Here are the log instructions:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

**Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card**

We have verified that this issue is fixed on the firmware that will enter beta after the current build is released. We’ll keep you posted!

**- Let’s Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Discord - Wyze Home Monitoring Keypad will not stay connected to Wyze Sense Hub***

Last call for information before we close this entry! We’re doing a holistic look at connectivity that goes beyond this submission. Here’s what we’re looking for:

1. Your system setup range. How far is the keypad from your hub?
2. Are there any steps you took that created a consistent disconnection?
3. Could we have logs after you pair your keypad again?

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

The beta results for this are looking really good! We still have some work to do for Wyze Cam v3 with additional products like a floodlight and we’re working on it.

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn’t auto-unlock when the “Disable during hours” schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again***

No further updates yet! The firmware for this is currently in beta. Please test it and give us feedback if you’re a tester!

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

No further updates on this one yet. Here’s the info from last week! We’ve gone through all the submitted logs! Some of them don’t have information because the log was created after the camera was power cycled or rebooted. But we did find that all the useful logs showed that the firmware keeps trying to reconnect IoT but cannot get the IP address and cannot connect to the internet.

If your internet connection was solid at the time, we think that there was probably a crash on the Wi-Fi driver not related to the firmware. We’re working on adding a health check function to recover devices in similar states. The cloud side is already in place and next we’ll work on firmware.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

We don’t have a new update for this yet because the fix is moved into the next firmware build.

Thank you for reading, folks! We’ll be back to give updates and do the new issue callout next week!

**Pros:**

\- Outstanding quality. I did noticed the video quality upgrade.

\- Faster notification on cellphone.

\- No lag issues when viewing recordings from SD card (compared to V3 that froze around second 5-10)

\- Integrated Spotlight does help for better recordings.

\- It's awesome that camera can follow a person moving and auto zoom in while he is walking.

\- I can continue using same extended cables purchased from Amazon. Just changed the power outlet charger.

\- Works without issues with Tmobile Home Internet.

**Cons:**  
\- None so far. Only the sensor seems more sensitive. I'm still trying to adjust the sensor to the perfect level to avoid getting alerts form cars driving on the street.

&#x200B;

I do recommend them. It was a good investment in the upgrade.

I was thinking switching to Arlo 2K / 4K cameras or Google HD cameras but the price was to heavy and saw that 4K live video is not transmitted at 4K quality, it's actually downgraded to ve able to view it for Arlo cameras.

During the last AMA, some of you suggested a customized image control for OG. We researched them and come up with the below basic controls.  I want to get some feedback from you :

1. Assuming the default image quality is good, will the below granular control be valuable to you? 
2. Are there other more important/valuable parameters other than ""brightness""/""contrast""/""saturation"" that you would want to have? 
3. Will have some preset filters like ""vivid"", ""warm"", ""cool""  etc, be helpful at all?

I know I can do it through the app or through Alexa/Google hoe/etc. But I'm looking for something simpler, like a literal light switch or a simple button.

The closest thing I've seen to this in the Wyze ecosystem is the wyze light switch ([https://www.wyze.com/products/wyze-light-switch](https://www.wyze.com/products/wyze-light-switch)). But I would really prefer something that doesn't require changing electrical wiring, as I rent my home right now. Maybe there is some way to setup this switch without real wiring?

The main other alternative I see right now is to use a switchbot plug and remote. The remote will just cut power from the camera. I'll set a schedule to automatically turn it back on nightly just in case we forget to do it ourselves. The main problem with this is that the camera is outdoors, and I'm not sure if the plug is rated for water/moisture.

We have a new batch of Fix-It Friday updates for all of you! Remember, if you see anyone experiencing one of these problems, please send them over to the post! We saw some of you doing that over the last week and we really appreciate it. :) 

Here are your new updates:

**Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position**

We have a firmware currently in beta testing and we could really use your help putting it through its paces! Please test the beta build for us and give us feedback!

**Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card**

Alright, we ran into a complication with this beta build and the level of complexity for everything. Because of this, we’re moving this fix for the public into the next firmware and not the release we’re currently testing. Thank you for your patience!

**Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later.**

We’re still looking into this now and will let you know if we have any questions!

**- Let’s Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro streaming and Playback issues when using 2K resolution***

We recently released Wyze app version 2.39! So far we’ve been hearing that the issue appears to be resolved for people. If you’re still experiencing this, please let us know! If we don’t hear that this is still a problem on 2.39, we’ll remove it from the update list.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 Pro is not live streaming in the app properly during the day but works properly at night even without night vision enabled***

We just released the 2.39 app. How are things looking? If we don’t hear that this issue is happening on the new app, we’ll remove this from the update list next week.

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

The beta for this firmware is going on and we’re hearing positive feedback about the firmware! Please test it and let us know how it works for you, if you’re a beta tester.

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn’t auto-unlock when the “Disable during hours” schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again***

No further updates yet! The firmware for this is currently in beta. Please test it and give us feedback if you’re a tester!

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

We’ve gone through all the submitted logs! Some of them don’t have information because the log was created after the camera was power cycled or rebooted. But we did find that all the useful logs showed that the firmware keeps trying to reconnect IoT but cannot get the IP address and cannot connect to the internet.

If your internet connection was solid at the time, we think that there was probably a crash on the Wi-Fi driver not related to the firmware. We’re working on adding a health check function to recover devices in similar states. The cloud side is already in place and next we’ll work on firmware.

***Discord - Wyze Home Monitoring Keypad will not stay connected to Wyze Sense Hub***

We’re investigating our online/offline structure in general. But if you’re experiencing this, we could use your help! We don’t have enough information to continue this investigation. If you’re impacted by this, please give us the following information:

1. Your system setup range. How far is the keypad from your hub?
2. Are there any steps you took that created a consistent disconnection?
3. Could we have logs after you pair your keypad again?

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

This fix is also being moved into the next firmware build that we’re working on and will not be part of the build currently in beta testing. We’ll get it solved!

Thanks for your time, folks! We hope you have a great weekend.

Overall it’s awesome! Super bright lights that I can angle to not annoy my neighbors, clear camera picture with excellent night vision capabilities that Wyze excels in, camera expand-ability, what’s not to love? Well… one thing really across the whole device; the pivot mounts for the camera and lights could use an upgrade. Don’t get me wrong I’m keeping the light and loving it. Just the next model could be better. 

The two floodlights stay in place by tension only. It takes about (I’m estimating here) 3-5lbs of pressure to move them. While this seems to be enough for most days, with recent high winds I’ve found they’ve drifted a bit. I believe a small locking screw could fix this. 

The same is true for the camera mount. The latest version (according to my internet searches and recent purchase in 12/22) has a tension screw nut on a pivot ball. On initial inspection I thought this was perfectly designed and would hold very secure; rather it just holds. The entire camera mount rotates on the base despite being tightened, and retightened, and a bit more. It does hold the ball joint fairly secure preventing it’s movement, however due to having to rotate the mount about 7deg in order to get the view I’d like, it barely holds its position when any outside force is applied. 

Being the fix it guy I am, I un-mounted the whole unit and opened the entire base looking for a way to tighten the camera mount from the inside. No such luck. The internals are just a pressed plastic piece that rotates as well to allow for movement of the power wires. Again, I feel Wyze could fix this with an external locking screw. 

One more thing that would take this unit from 95% awesome to 100% is just one additional piece. I would like to see (preferably included) a Y style dual camera mount. Wyze has already thought ahead and placed a second power port on the existing camera mount to allow for power to a second camera; which is exactly what caused all this as the weight of a second Wyze Cam V3 was too much for the rotating base. While this can be overcome by mounting the second camera direct to the building, having it on the light would be preferred, and an included interchangeable dual mount would be awesome! (A short 3”-6” usb wire to fit that distance would be nice too) 

So if you’re reading all this for a review, the Wyze floodlight cam is well worth the money! Just hoping that Wyze does some simple improvements for future models. 

TLDR: Buy the Wyze Floodlight cam, but know it can move a bit and could use some tightening.",6,"['WyzeCam: Thank you for the feedback!

I had a V3 whose image went so fuzzy everything was a blur. I throughly cleaned the lens but it didn't help and when I looked at it with a strong magnifying glass I thought I saw tiny water droplets on the inside.

I had bought a package of gel desiccant from Amazon called Wisedry (coincident) so I thought I'd give it a try. I put the camera and the entire packages content of desiccant into an airtight container overnight and when I checked the next day the lens looked clear so I powered it up right next to a brand new V3 that had just arrived. The images were identical. 

The camera had been outside for a couple of years and not really protected except for a silicone skin but it still shouldn't have let any moisture in.

One thought I had about the cause. The camera was set up to see what nocturnal visitors I got at a water dish but I turned it off every morning due to vegetation tripped clips. When the camera goes off in the morning the internals cools off slightly and creates a pressure imbalance allowing air from the outside to go to the inside if there is a path. Obviously the camera had a leak. If I had never turned the camera off I probably would not have gotten the moisture in, but now I know hot to get rid of it.",4,"['emRNcritMEDIC: Perhaps you can setup a Rule on the camera to only record motion events at night, and no motion during the day?

I literally have to use a magnifying glass to check progress, and when I’ve done an all-day time-lapse, it can take 15 or 20 minutes to download. Why can’t the text be black? Why can’t the app display this window a LOT bigger? Am I the only person who thinks it’s ridiculous to make it so hard to see the information during downloads?

Complaint:  Only 1 watch is allowed per App.  And it looks like per email also?

Details:  Was trying to connect a second watch-2 to Bluestacks Wyze App.

Had 1 watch-1 on phone app.  Went to connect another watch-2 to Bluestacks Wyze App and had to delete watch-1 there (had previously connected watch to Bluestacks Wyze App, but watch can only be connected to 1 device, so chose to keep prior connection on phone app).

I've reset it, reconnected it to a different wifi access point, moved it to different locations, etc and it seems dead. 

The weird thing is this is the 2nd time this has happened. The other camera was in the same spot and now the replacement camera has the same issue. Certainly this isn't a coincidence. I'm using a wyze-branded power adapter and cable and the normal camera location is like 2ft from the access point. 

Any suggestions?",1,"[""Mikzeroni: I've been having this problem for as long as I've been using Wyze cams (only a year and a half or so). I reset my internet to bring them back online, but I don't know why it happens""]"

The issue is interference with other peoples wifi on the same channel. You can remedy this issue by “stomping” on their networks by increasing your strength of signal, by moving the access point closer to the device, which is my mesh wifi is so great, or increasing transmit power of your access points.\n\nFor example, a consumer router as mentioned has a max throughput on its antennas of 1000mbps, and each camera consumes less than 1/100th of that. The issue occurs with a high bandwidth device, say you start steaming 4K Netflix on wifi, and chew up the available bandwidth and then the cameras scramble for the remaining amount if there isn’t enough leftover. \n\nIn my house I have a bit of an overkill setup, I have 3 access points (which put out the wifi) and a single router (which just routes traffic) and each of the access points is hardwired to the router. Each access point is capable of 2000mbps, and since they are all hardwired, I have 6000mbps available over wireless “technically” so I could saturate the connection of 2000mbps in the kitchen access point and the remaining two and unaffected, however any devices connected to the kitchen would be scrambling for the remaining bandwidth, or dropping. If you have a good wireless controller, it could switch the other devices to the other points which may not have as good of signal strength, but they aren’t over utilized so it’s much easier to get the needed bandwidth. In addition my access points are technically a stadium grade solution so I cranked my transmit power up a ton and stomp over all other routers nearby in my channel and have my devices set to a static channel, most do nightly optimization so all of my neighbors automatically followed suit without knowing and left my channel because they were getting stomped on. \n\n\nKind of a long answer hope it helps or makes any sense lol. But basically the TLDR is that if you have a camera right at farthest point of your wireless signal for the most part having a ton of other devices doesn’t make its signal worse or “congested” that would be more of an issue with neighbors on the same channel, unless your kids are steaming 4K Netflix and eating up all of your bandwidth anyway', 'EpicEpyc: So congestion isn’t what you are thinking. Congestion would be a ton of wireless networks all broadcasted on the same channel that are “stomping” over each other causing actual interference. You are referring to if camera X is streaming it will take bandwidth from camera Y, while this technically is true as your router or specifically it’s wireless access point (what actually puts out the wifi) has a theoretical max bandwidth, which drops off with distance. Let’s say a standard AC router capable of 1000mbps. So if camera A is 2’ away from the router or access point getting the full potential and camera B is all the way at the end of the range getting access to 1mbps max due to signal strength, if camera A takes up 10mbps, that only means that camera b has access to 990mbps now, well above the original 1mbps it could even get access to by itself. The same still works with two cameras in the same far out distance (for the most part) however the newer Multi User MIMO does make things trickier as it attempts to “aim” it’s antennas at devices for better max potential at a given distance, but again, it only does this to increase that potential, and it doesn’t take away from the total bandwidth available. Hopefully this makes some sense', 'difractedlight: Cool that is super helpful. I’d like to redo my wifi setup so this is helpful.', 'T8i: tl;dr - I don’t really get what you’re talking about. None of the cameras support AC.\n\nIt is congestion. Most likely caused by multicasting.\n\nJust lookup the the wifi channel utilization while streaming from multiple cameras.\n\nThis is a known issue even with good coverage on higher end unifi networks.', 'EpicEpyc: Yeah, the cameras were the reason I switched from a single linksys router to google wifi, and now a ubiquiti setup. Random drops and disconnects and odd streaming performance. Beefing up your wireless or being smarter about router location (if you can move it) also helps. Simple and free tip is to login to your routers GUI and set the transmit power to its highest setting (if this is an option)', 'EpicEpyc: You realize your wifi SSID only exists on one channel at a time right? And I was just giving an example, I know the cameras don’t support AC wireless, 1000mbps is just an easy number and a common max theoretical bandwidth', 'kneetoekneetoe: @EpicEpyc may I ask what Ubiquiti APs you have and like so much? I have a USG doing router/firewall, but still running three hard-wired Airport Extremes (802.11ac) in AP mode for wifi. Still works great, but’s 10 year-old tech, time to look beyond, so I got the USG about a year ago to start that process. Just not sure the next step. Frankly, the Ubiquiti product line confuses me. TIA', 'EpicEpyc: I’ve got 3x UAP-AC-HD access points and an edge router X. entirely overkill for my 2500sqft house, however moving into a house nearly twice the size soon so they can finally stretch their legs.']"

It’s a new month and we have a new batch of Fix-It Friday topics to give updates on! Thank you to everyone who voted for submissions in the callout. We appreciate you! Let’s get started:

**Forum - Wyze scale displays are reverting to kg despite settings set to lb**

Which scale is impacted? If it’s one of the newer ones, please check the button on the back labeled UNIT/RESET to make sure it’s on the correct setting. The app will then sync when connected. If that doesn’t do the trick, please reach out to our support folks for help! This entry will be removed from the update list next week unless we hear that it’s an issue on the original Wyze Scale.

www.support.wyze.com

**Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card**

This issue is caused by the same root cause as the Event frame loss problem. We have a firmware update in beta now that addresses this. If you’re a beta tester, please give it a try and let us know how it goes for you!

**Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position**

We are working on resolving this problem with the manufacturer. We’ll share updates here as we progress!

**Discord - Wyze Can v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later.**

We’re looking into this now and will let you know if we have any questions!

**- Let’s Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro streaming and Playback issues when using 2K resolution***

We’re looking at releasing this fix next week with the 2.39 app. If you’re a beta tester, please give us feedback about the success of the fix! If we don’t hear negative feedback about it, we’ll remove this entry the week after the app is released.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 Pro is not live streaming in the app properly during the day but works properly at night even without night vision enabled***

We are still on schedule for releasing this fix with the 2.39 app release. We have the release candidate for that app in testing now! If you’re a beta tester, please give us feedback about this topic!

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

The beta for this firmware has started. So far, we’re hearing positive feedback from beta testers! If you’re a tester, please give it a try and let us know how it goes!

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

The beta for this is currently in external testing. Calling all beta testers! Please let us know if this issue is resolved in the new beta firmware!

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn’t auto-unlock when the “Disable during hours” schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again***

We just released the firmware update to beta! If you’re a tester, please give it a try and let us know how it works for you!

***Discord - Wyze Home Monitoring Keypad will not stay connected to Wyze Sense Hub***

We could really use more logs for this problem! If you’re experiencing it, please follow these instructions:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

We’re going through the logs we have! But we could still use some more. If you have a microSD card and a computer that can read the card, please send us a log to look at if you’ve been experiencing this problem. Here’s how: 

When the device shows offline, please take out the microSD card and wait a second before re-inserting the card (or inserting a new microSD card). The camera will then make two ""ding"" sounds usually within 30 seconds. On your microSD card, there will be a root or log folder with the device log that you can access with a computer. The files are named as xxxxx\_log.txt. If there are multiple logs, select the most recent log file.

When you have the log, please email it along with a description of the issue and the date, time, and time zone that it occurred to:

[microsdcardlogs@wyze.com](mailto:microsdcardlogs@wyze.com)

Whew! Love seeing all those beta updates going out. If you’re one of our beta testers, we could really use your help testing all of those builds and giving us feedback! See you all next week!

Is there any chance that some glare filters or light filters that won't affect the colored night vision or drastically affect recording that can be made or stuck to the camera lens like I sunglasses filter you know like yellow or polarized to get rid of light glare which is a major problem because the motion system is set off by light glare and it is bothersome so any suggestions or any chance that something like this is in the future works thanks,1,"['DAMAGEDatheCORE: You could try polarized film that\'s used for automotive window tinting. That may help reduce it a bit, but the overriding problem is that it\'s nearly impossible to negate the issue since the cams use pixel-based motion detection. Light glare has been an ongoing gripe for many users.\n\nIf pointed at a roadway, really the best way of dealing with the light glare is with Cam Plus and setting the cam(s) notifications to whichever AI motion events, but disable the notifications for ""Other motion events"". The caveat though is if the AI fails to classify something as a person/pet/package/vehicle, it defaults to ""other"", so you may sometimes not be notified of something you actually do want to know of.']"

Right now it's a bit too obtrusive in the window so I kind of figured out a way I can hide it in an existing piece of equipment on the outside but it would require making the form factor a bit smaller.

So far I’m finding it working well with color night vision and notifications - while security of course is important thankfully primary concern is just visibility while home.

Had some questions for what people were doing for two aspects - doorbells - I have two spots where I need them and unfortunately both have challenges with running power. (Long story) I’ve used the latest gen of nest battery doorbell (may just end up keeping it to make life simple)

and I have one wireless battery camera looking down my driveway with a solar panel.

The ONE nice thing about the current generation of nest cameras is that people / vehicle alerts are very quick - getting an actual live stream is a whole other matter.

Is it worth migrating to the wyze battery cam? And what vendor if any are people using for doorbells

the other question is with google home hubs - in testing I found a few things

\- doesn't seem to want to show streams triggered from routines

\- only one hub can stream at a time ? (this is not great for my use case) 

\- some hubs say OG/OG Zoom stream isn't supported but they all seem identical models and firmware (maybe they just need a reboot)

YMMV of course but I\'d look up ""doorbell"" on this subreddit and check some reviews (LifeHackster has some good comparison videos on doorbells).

I have the Wyze Robot Vacuum 200S and beginning on Friday 02/03 it has started powering down due to inactivity and doesn't boot back up for scheduled events. I turned it back on this morning at about 9 a.m. and it was at 76% battery and charged itself fully, and at about 2 p.m. it said ""powering down due to inactivity.""

I keep it in my home office and as I wasn't working I didn't notice. Checked the logs and it was last active Thursday night. I have it mostly set to clean different zones of the house on different nights at like 3 a.m. so it doesn't disrupt my family's routines. 

Not sure if an update rolled out that made it start doing this but I've had it going for more than a year and this is just now becoming an issue. The firmware is up to date and I checked the Wyze forums and found this question asked many times but no fix is mentioned. 

Any help on how to get it to stay on in low power mode or something? Or do I attempt to roll back an update?

One of the cams just kept saying “offline” last week, and it wouldn’t let me restart it from the app, only delete it and add the same camera again (had to do this a few times).

Had it been one customer, it would probably have been hopeless, even though personally I'm eager to fix problems, even for just one customer.\n\nUsually, fixing an issue hinges on our ability to duplicate the problem at our offices, and often we just don't know and/or can't find out enough to solve cases that do not impact lots of customers in a consistent way.

You know what that means. it means it is time for this month’s Fix-It-Friday callout! 📷

If this is your first Fix-It Friday, welcome! For background, while our communities are not designed to be a replacement for [Wyze Support ](https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us), our community members and community managers do our best to help you out here. As our communities scale up, we want to make sure that any outstanding bugs or issues that you folks are facing are on our internal radar and that we’re transparent in our process of working on them.

Here’s how this works:

* We’ll make a post on the first Friday of the month in every community (Core Community on Facebook, Forums, Reddit, and Discord).
* Check the comments. If you see any other comments with issues that you’re facing, vote for them with a like (the heart button at the bottom of their reply)
* Got something new? Reply to our post with the top issue that you’re facing this week with your Wyze products to help loop us in.
* We’ll grab the top comment from each community and make a follow-up post on Monday to detail what those issues are and how we plan to fix them. If we need more info from the community to help figure out what’s going on, we’ll let you know on Monday - so please make sure to take a look!
* The following Mondays in the month, we’ll be posting updates about our progress on Fix-It Friday submissions.
* Sometimes Mondays are actually Tuesdays if we don’t get all the info we need on time for posting on Monday. Our apologies! 📷
* Remember, this is for existing things that aren’t working right. If you are looking for a new feature or for us to add functionality that’s not already available, please use our [Wishlist ](https://forums.wyze.com/c/wishlist)instead!

We’re constantly working on improvements for everyone. But we hope that this process will both help us prioritize issues that are important to our communities and help you feel more in the loop.

Got a request for something new or an additional feature? Check our [Wishlist ](https://forums.wyze.com/c/wishlist/l/votes)to see if it’s in the works or has been requested. 📷

We hope you had an excellent day. Please check the new Fix-It Friday callout to vote for new content for February over the weekend! In the meantime, we have some new Fix-It Friday updates for you! Here’s the scoop:

**Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro streaming and Playback issues when using 2K resolution**

This fix is currently in beta and we aren’t receiving complaints about this issue right now. Beta testers! How’s it going? Is this problem still present for you? If so, please let us know now!

**Forum - Notifications not working on Wyze Video Doorbell when the button is pressed**

We haven’t heard from anyone about this issue since we posted the workaround and log callout. If you’re running into this, please let us know now! Otherwise, we’ll remove this from the update list. Here’s the info from before:

If you are still experiencing this issue please try turning your notifications off through Settings and then turn them on again. If that doesn’t help, please submit a log and post your log number here so we can route it to the right team! Here’s how:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

**Discord - Wyze Home Monitoring Keypad will not stay connected to Wyze Sense Hub**

We don’t have a new update for this but are continuing to look into this issue. If you are experiencing this problem could you please submit a log and post your log number here?

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

**Let’s Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions**

***Reddit -  No motion detection notifications on Wyze Cam v3 Pro when a custom detection zone is set***

Final call! If we don’t hear from folks, we’re going to remove this from the update list because it looks like this has been fixed. If you are impacted, please give us a log! Here’s how: 

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it here as a reply so we can get it to the right folks.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

We’re going through the logs we have! But we could still use some more. If you have a microSD card and a computer that can read the card, please send us a log to look at if you’ve been experiencing this problem. Here’s how: 

When the device shows offline, please take out the microSD card and wait a second before re-inserting the card (or inserting a new microSD card). The camera will then make two ""ding"" sounds usually within 30 seconds. On your microSD card, there will be a root or log folder with the device log that you can access with a computer. The files are named as xxxxx\_log.txt. If there are multiple logs, select the most recent log file.

When you have the log, please email it along with a description of the issue and the date, time, and time zone that it occurred to:

[microsdcardlogs@wyze.com](mailto:microsdcardlogs@wyze.com)

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn’t auto-unlock when the “Disable during hours” schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again***

Still waiting on that beta but we’re still making progress working up to it!

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

The internal QA has started. If that goes well, the fix for this will enter external beta next week. Our initial results are promising and don’t show the frame loss issue.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

This is part of the internal QA that we’re running for frame loss! So far things are looking good.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 Pro is not live streaming in the app properly during the day but works properly at night even without night vision enabled***

We are still on schedule for releasing this fix with the 2.39 app release. We have the release candidate for that app in testing now!

More scoops than an ice cream sundae! Thanks for tuning in. And as always, please point people to this post if you see anyone experiencing problems discussed in the update!

For the most part, they all work as intended and I have no complaints, except for the outdoor plug, which has atrocious connectivity.  I'm lucky to get 2 days out of my outdoor plug before it disconnects, is unable to reconnect, and stays in the on position 24/7 (which silver lining I guess is that it says ON and not OFF), at which point I'll need to go out back and unplug it to reset it, and hope to get another day or two out of it before it is unable to reconnect again.

The plug is right outside and below the window where the router is, and below my floodlight that has never had connectivity issues.

The outdoor plug is in a protective metal outlet encasing with a clear plastic door on the front, maybe 10"" x 5"" IIRC.

Is there any way to boost the signal, or put a repeater or something nearby or in the encasing that will allow the outdoor plug to stay connected?  What about the outdoor cam base station?

* No magnetic stand, screws in with a mounting plate. This originally surprised me since I thought I could just do a quick swap, but the mounting plate is at least easy to install (2 small screws and anchors if needed)
* Setup is much faster - no more scanning a QR code, does everything via Bluetooth 
* More limited flexibility on the stand (for instance, it can no longer  be all the way down or up), however it can now lock into place, which does help with the camera being knocked out of place
* True to Wyze's claims, does load video faster. I barely see Step 1 and 2 and Step 3 only takes few seconds at most.
* New video interface which shows your recent videos below and is streamlined.
* Color seems warmer then V3s, so it seems to blow out flesh tones
* Built in spotlight instead of needing to add one. The addon ones were finicky for me and sometimes would just get stuck on and never turn off, not be detected, whatever. These seem to be more reliable. The controls are more limited though - you can manually turn on/off and you can set it to turn on when needed.
* Others have made a big deal about the lack of Cam Plus Lite, but as I have Cam Plus Unlimited, this is not a factor for  me.

I am receiving motion events that say, ""Complete Motion Detected"", but I cannot get object detection to work.

I tried many things, but I just can't get it to detect people:

1. I toggled all notifications and detection on/off.
2. I power cycled the doorbell.
3. I pressed the reset button on the back and re-added it with the QR code.
4. I removed it from Cam Plus, removed it from the app, then used the reset button on the back to re-add it. During this re-adding, I chose to link it to Cam Plus.
5. I even tried turning notifications ON for ""Detects Wyze AI Events"" and turning OFF ""Detects Any Other Motion"". With these settings, it still sends me a ""Complete Motion"" alert.

Sometimes I get events that are longer than 12-seconds, so it seems like it might be linked to my Cam Plus subscription, but it is not detecting a person.",6,"['AutoModerator: Hi there, Gdefender!

We have Wyze cameras, have for many years now back to the OG… we are moving out of state and will be renting our house here with a local property manager. We are allowed to have cameras outdoors for security as long as it is disclosed and will also have one or two in our locked basement to monitor that area as it can get some moisture or pooling around one drain, also in case utilities need serviced etc. it’s a very old house, and will be putting one inside a detached locked garage for security, no access to this for the renter. 

I currently have the Wyze cam v2 outdoor cameras on some rooflines, trees, etc. and just take them down periodically to recharge, but that won’t be feasible when we move.
I’d like to set them up with solar panels where I have them.

I also have a few Wyze cam v3’s that we have plugged in looking out upstairs windows. This also won’t be doable with a tenant who could just unplug them/they can’t be indoors in a tenant area. 

I’ve seen mention of the Wyze solar panels as well as some other brands. Some recommend a battery as well. I may have some cameras near each other but I’m assuming one solar panel to one camera, cannot combine a battery and solar for 2 cameras close by pointed different directions. Other cameras will be far apart and would need their own dedicated supply of power/solar. 

What would be your recommendation for how to best move forward? I’ll be back in town every few months and also my dad lives nearby in case we need to tweak something but I’d like to make this as stable before I leave as possible. We have a while one mesh wifi system with extenders to cover the outdoor and garage cameras that currently works great. I’m willing to buy new cameras or supplies however needed.

Very Unreliable,Alice-154,11,10pbucn,wyzecam,https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/10pbucn/wyze_sucks_very_unreliable/," I did like Wyze, wyze cameras and other products at one time and would recommend them to anyone who asked about them. Unfortunately I will no longer recommend wyze products to anyone nor will I purchase any wyze product in the future. The cameras have become unreliable lately. An important note, Nothing has been changed on my home network or with my internet provider since I have owned wyze products. Camera connections have appeared and disappeared very often. I have also had multiple camera failures Just outside of warranty. Tech support is of little use. You get the standard reply, update the cameras and app, restart the cameras, send us the log. Terrible tech support in general. I really need something that is more reliable. I did have a camera that was replaced under warranty no questions asked. It failed again in less than a year. The app is very buggy and not intuitive. I would say I have had better luck with my wired V1 cameras. It seems that as products and firmware are updated, reliability goes down. The outdoor cameras are the worst. They will no longer pair to the Wyze base station after the firmware updates. I do not have the time to go back and forth with tech support. Waited on hold for awhile, got disconnected.",12,"[""blackechoguy: I'm in the same boat. I was a big advocate who recommended Wyze to everyone. I pay for Cam Plus on all my cams but have never had to search or download event videos until this past weekend.\n\nI was trying to get a video record of Ash, a beloved outdoor kitty we had been slowly been acclimatizing to come inside and get used to our other cats. We were in the process of getting him to the vet to be neutered and checked out so we could finally bring him inside for his forever home. \n\nSadly, he was struck and killed last week, so I started making a memorial video including clips from the Wyze cams. After I downloaded a few events, the app started crashing, and not saving anything. Then the app would crash every time I tried to save an event. Then some events just showed as static images. \n\nAfter firmware updates, rebooting and resetting multiple times and trying a second android phone, the issue persists. I ended up screen capturing the few videos on my phone that I could view, so I got as many memories as I could.\n\nI guess I should be grateful that I didn't need video evidence of a break in or something similar. My next step is to get SD cards for all my cameras so I'm not relying on Cam Plus at all.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with setting up Wyze cams with a backup drive or PC to store content locally?

It may sound silly, but I don't live here full time and I need to know how much snow is on the driveway and if the snow plow came through because the plow blocks in our access. If I know that has happened, I can call my driveway plow guy and get it cleared. It snowed yesterday afternoon and evening and the lens got some flakes stuck to it. Later on it got a bit windy and the entire lens got covered and I had no visual from the camera.
Any tips to keep this from happening, or would one of the outdoor cameras be better for that purpose? For reference, it gets into the teens-20s F in the winter (and sometimes into the 40s) but we don't get temps below zero F.
Also, when the snow plow comes through, it deposits 2-4 feet of snow on my side of the street (including in front of my driveway), which is the downhill side. He isn't being an AH, the snow can't go on the uphill side of the street. I cannot clear it myself if I am not on-site, as it freezes hard.

I soon plan to install some security cameras, doorbell, garage door floodlight/camera combo, maybe a few other outdoor camera locations. In shopping around I came across the Wyze products.

I could ensure my existing products are on 5ghz, as Wyze mostly runs on 2.4. Regardless, would the Wyze products make any noticeable negative impacts on wifi performance?

If my wifi goes down, do the wired Wyze devices stop working? I read the spotlight feature won’t function if the wifi is down, is that true?

We have a new batch of Fix-It Friday updates for you today! Here’s the information:

**Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro streaming and Playback issues when using 2K resolution**

Those on the 2.39 beta how is the fix going for this? Please give us your feedback if you are a beta tester.

**Forum - Notifications not working on Wyze Video Doorbell when the button is pressed**

If you are still experiencing this issue please try turning your notifications off through Settings and then turn them on again. If that doesn’t help, please submit a log and post your log number here so I can route it to the right team! Here’s how:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

**Discord - Wyze Home Monitoring Keypad will not stay connected to Wyze Sense Hub**

Still no updates for this one but we are still investigating it. In the meantime, if you are experiencing this issue would you like to submit a log and post your log number here?

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

**Let’s Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions**

***Reddit -  No motion detection notifications on Wyze Cam v3 Pro when a custom detection zone is set***

Is this still affecting you? If so we would love some logs about this issue! Here’s what to do to provide us with a  log:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it here as a reply so we can get it to the right folks.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

We are still working on improving this. We still could use some more logs for this problem if it is affecting you! The process for these logs is a bit different. If you have a microSD card and a computer that can read the card, please send us a log to look at. Here’s how: 

When the device shows offline, please take out the microSD card and wait a second before re-inserting the card (or inserting a new microSD card). The camera will then make two ""ding"" sounds usually within 30 seconds. On your microSD card, there will be a root or log folder with the device log that you can access with a computer. The files are named as xxxxx\_log.txt. If there are multiple logs, select the most recent log file.

When you have the log, please email it along with a description of the issue and the date, time, and time zone that it occurred to:

[microsdcardlogs@wyze.com](mailto:microsdcardlogs@wyze.com)

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn’t auto-unlock when the “Disable during hours” schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again***

We are getting close, the beta should happen very soon!

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

We are still doing internal testing on this. If it goes well we will move it to an external beta.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

This one is being tested internally. We will move it to an external beta if we get promising results.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 Pro is not live streaming in the app properly during the day but works properly at night even without night vision enabled***

This is getting close as we are still on track for the 2.39 release!

That’s it for this week! Thanks for your attention. As always, if you see anyone else experiencing any of these issues, please help them (and us) out by sending them a link to this post. please send them a link to this post! Talk to you next week!

Using Wyze v3 cameras, paired with sockets:

I have rules that turn on the sockets 15 minutes before sunset.
The first time you view the livestream after the sockets have turned on, and then leave the livestream, the sockets turn off immediately upon leaving the livestream.
At this point, I can manually turn the sockets back on and then enter and leave the livestream with no more issues, until:

Inversely, rules turn off the sockets at 10pm. The first time you view the livestream after the sockets have turned off, and then leave the livestream, the sockets turn on immediately upon leaving the livestream.
Again, after this, I can manually turn the sockets back off and then enter and leave the livestream with no more issues until the next rule-based status change.
The sockets do not change until leaving the livestream. They stay in their expected state while viewing the livestream.",1,"['AutoModerator: Hi there, Boring-Tiger-3161!

My CC changed and google play couldn't bill me. When I updated the CC all my services were instantly billed and restored.

Except for wyze...

* Inside the wyze application it says that I don't have cam plus.
* There's no way to manage the subscription
* I click on my camera an click 'add subscription' and it goes to the billing page where it says I ***already have an active subscription for cam plus***.

So I contacted support to get it enabled properly on my camera.

Their response: ""Sorry, we don't manage or have access to any subscriptions made through google play so we have no way to add that to your account. You'll need to take that up with them."" and then gave me the link to google support.

This is ridiculous, because I work in software development and the API absolutely allows you to verify a customer's subscription. Not only that, if wyze doesn't have the ability to activate or deactivate a subscription for any reason whatsoever, that's *not* a google issue, that's an internal development issue. Wyze requested google process a subscription, and they did. End of story. The ball is back in wyze's court to honor that.

So since there is literally ***no*** way to fix this. I simply cancelled all services with wyze and am charging back my subscription for services not rendered. Probably the stupidest thing I've ever heard from a company tbh.

Long time Wyze owner and am looking for recommendations for a camera to watch my bird feeder. I have several v3, v2, and hardwired cameras but currently have the V2 outdoor camera on my garage gutter connected to the solar panel for the sole purpose of watching birds. I have cam plus and sd cards and it never seems to catch any big movement- even a squirrel hanging off of a platform feeder 5ft away.  I have all events selected to capture, played around with the sensitivity, and still nothing. The only time it records is if I’m walking by. I’m wondering if I should get the v3pro when it’s back in stock or the regular v3 so then I’ll at least have playback options. Any thoughts on which would be best for this purpose?",23,"['wordyplayer: The outdoor cams are very much sub-par performance compared to the v3.   The outdoor cams look for a difference in IR (temperature) in the scene.  If the critter and the environment are the same temperature, it will never trigger.   But, the v3 looks at the actual video to detect motion, much better performance.', ""bohoish: Excellent question. I have a spare wyze and was thinking about setting it up near my bluebird house, but haven't gotten around to it yet."", 'wordyplayer: The v3 is a great choice for this.   \n\n1. not capturing movement.  You need to go into the settings for that camera, click ""Detection Settings"", slide the slider up to 95, and turn off detection zone.   Now you should get a LOT of captures.\n\n2. With the SD card, you can watch an event, and at the bottom of the event, click ""Playback"" at the bottom.  Now you can watch the continuous video recorded on your SD card.  You can drag that timeline backwards to whatever time you want.\n\n3. Go into the Event Recording setting and make sure ""Detects Motion"" is turned on.\n\n4.  If the camera is too close to the subject, it is blurry.  BUT, you can refocus the lens by twisting it to change the focus.  The safest way to do this is to open the camera up, grip the tip of the lens assembly with a pliers, and firmly rotate to break the glue they put on the threads.   Once you break the glue, you can focus with your fingers.   If you don\'t want to open it up, you can very carefully put the tips of a needle nose pliers on opposite sides of the lens assembly and firmly rotate to break the glue.

I am not technically savvy, so I apologize in advance. Thanks so much for bearing with me. 

I am going to make my own 5 volt dc power cable by using a 5volt power adapter plugged into a 120v a/c outlet and connect a usb to 5 pin screw terminal connector using only the + and - with jacketed thermostat wire (18/2).  

On the other end, I am going to connect the same + and - to another 5 pin screw connector to female usb (only using these 2 wires and pins) and plug the accompanying wyze power cable into this usb and then into the wyze cam with the other end (micro usb connect). 

Do I need to worry about getting the + and - right or are they interchangeable with the camera? 

Additionally, how would I waterproof the connections that are outside? Install a weatherproof 1900 electrical box? Or use di-electric grease on all connections?

[ I understand installing an electrical outlet near the camera is best but, I would rather not install an outlet outside, as that will present more problems for me. ]

I hope I made myself clear. Im wracking my brain to figure this out and think I have a solid plan of attack, if you guys and gals that are smarter than me agree!!

Thanks again!

I have been using wyze cam outdoor v3 for almost a year now and to day disappointed is an understatement. They recently rolled back features that were available for free, which means buying just the camera gives you nothing more than a live video viewing function, with no triggered recording possible. 

The camera used to allow 12-second motion- triggered videos for free without subscription. 

That changed when they introduced cam plus lite, making these motion triggered preview videos available to those with cam plus lite, although technique it is still free as cam plus lite allows user contribution at $0. The cool down period is limited to minimum 5 minutes.

I purchased a cam plus subscription, hoping to record more videos with no cool down period.

Guess what - the camera stopped recording any event videos as soon as the PAID subscription is applied to the camera.

I spent many hours on customer support chat (which kicks you out of the chat as soon as you leave the window - worst user experience ever as it makes it impossible to chat with CS and adjust your app settings as you talk to them), updated all the apps & firm ware and tried everyway to fix the issue to no avail. They returned the money on the subscription in the end but i still have a valid subscription in the account. I just don't assign it to the cameras and use cam plus lite (free) instead.

I have never imagined a company whose product actually stops functioning Entirely as soon as you paid for it, but worked fine when it is free/not subscribed to.

Anyway there goes a few months, the cam is not ideal because i have no way to upgrade it from 12-seconds+5min cool down, but i get by. 

Ans then a few days ago, i realised I've been locked out of the 12-second videos as well. 

Instead i get a static image with a playback button. Clicking the playback button sends me a pop up saying that Cam Plus is required to view these 12-sec previews. It includes a button to the service page where you could buy a subscription. 

This literally means my camera is good for nothing except a few motion-triggered photos and live cam views when I check it on the app.

We have a new batch of Fix-It Friday updates for you today! Here’s the information:

**Core - Wyze Cam v3 Pro is not detecting people when subscribed to Cam Plus**

Our cloud fix seems to be working well here! Are you still having trouble with this? We didn’t hear confirmation from people so we may remove this entry next week. If you are still having difficulty with this, do you have the “Rotate image 180 degrees” setting turned on?

**Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro streaming and Playback issues when using 2K resolution**

The 2.39 beta testing has started! So far this fix appears to be on schedule. Please give our new beta app a try and provide feedback to us if you’re a beta tester.

**Forum - Notifications not working on Wyze Video Doorbell when the button is pressed**

Please try turning your notifications off through Settings and then turn them on again. If that doesn’t help, please submit a log! Here’s how:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

**Discord - Wyze Home Monitoring Keypad will not stay connected to Wyze Sense Hub**

We don’t have a new update for this one yet. We’re still looking into it from our side. In the meantime, would you like to submit a log if you’re experiencing this?

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

***Reddit -  No motion detection notifications on Wyze Cam v3 Pro when a custom detection zone is set***

It looks like some of the Wyze Cam v3 Pro rotate image 180° reports got mixed into here. It makes sense because they have some overlapping components. So we’re still looking for logs about this issue! Please help us if you’re experiencing this problem! Here’s how to do to give us logs:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it here as a reply so we can get it to the right folks.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

We still could use some more logs for this problem! If you’re experiencing this and have a microSD card and a computer that can read the card, please send us a log to look at. Here’s how: 

When the device shows offline, please take out the microSD card and wait a second before re-inserting the card (or inserting a new microSD card). The camera will then make two ""ding"" sounds usually within 30 seconds. On your microSD card, there will be a root or log folder with the device log that you can access with a computer. The files are named as xxxxx\_log.txt. If there are multiple logs, select the most recent log file.

When you have the log, please email it along with a description of the issue and the date, time, and time zone that it occurred to:

[microsdcardlogs@wyze.com](mailto:microsdcardlogs@wyze.com)

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn’t auto-unlock when the “Disable during hours” schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again***

We’re still waiting for the beta for this firmware and we’re currently planning on sending it out next week.

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

This is being tested internally and will either be moved to an external beta later or we’ll need to create a new build for internal testing. It’s a high priority for us and we’re working on it!

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

We’re testing a new build internally for this issue. If it passes, we’ll move to an external beta later. Otherwise, we’ll work on a new version for internal testing.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 Pro is not live streaming in the app properly during the day but works properly at night even without night vision enabled***

We continue to be on track for 2.39!

And that’s a wrap! Thanks for your attention. As always, if you see anyone experiencing any of these issues, please send them a link to this post! Have a great weekend!

Same router, network, password everything.

Tried to set it up the same way today, select the WiFi network and enter the password, then it takes me to the settings and I switch to the new ""WVCR-xxxxx"" signal, then back to the setup. I can see it connect to the ""WVCR"" signal (that doesn't have internet, so has a ""!"") and then it turns off of the WiFi signal (vacuum stops broadcasting it) and sits on ""Connecting... this may take a minute"". After 5 or so minutes it then gives me [this error](https://i.imgur.com/M0feu1Y.jpg).

I've tried all of the troubleshooting steps on [this Wyze article](https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360054559111-Wyze-Robot-Vacuum-Setup-Troubleshooting), including:

* Turn off cellular data. 
* Confirm the status lights are blinking white while attempting setup. 
* Confirm that your phone/tablet is connected to a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network. (I disabled the 5GHz on my router to try, no change).
* Try forgetting and rejoining your Wi-Fi network.
* Confirm Wyze Robot Vacuum is within 10 feet of the router for setup.
* Forget Wyze Robot Vacuum’s Wi-Fi.
* Reboot the router. 
* Factory reset Wyze Robot Vacuum.
* Although there is no restriction for using special characters, if you’re using special characters in the Wi-Fi network name and/or password, try changing it to just letters and numbers. 


None of the above have made a difference. The unit just sits with the blinking white lights for minutes after the phone disconnects from the vacuum temporary network until it gives the above error. Oddly, the original vacuum (the one with the hole in the mesh filter) is still working fine. The engineer in me wanted to see if I could setup the old unit, so I deleted the old unit from my Wyze app and then re-setup the old one, it gave a similar error to the new one, but then still added it back to the Wyze device list and now continues to function normally (?)

How can I *actually* lock the thermostat so he can't just unlock it with the dial and crank it up to 90 again? I've had it installed for a few weeks to try it out, but if I can't actually lock it I'll have to put the Nest back. I figured ""Lock Thermostat"" would, you know, actually lock it like the Nest does.

If it's not possible to lock it, could you at least change the setting from ""Lock Thermostat"" to ""Require A Few More Clicks To Mess With The Heat""?

Since I'm ranting about the thermostat, other Nest features the Wyze thermostat sorely lacks are:

* Ability to *schedule* the fan, vs just having it run X minutes/hour 24/7. I like to run the fan 15 minutes/hour when sleeping to keep air moving, but I don't want it running 15 minutes/hour all day.
* It would be great to see the actual heat usage broken down by time.  The Nest app shows when the heat turns on/off on an hourly timeline so I can adjust according to how much heat the system actually uses. With Wyze, it just shows me how many hours it runs per day, which is much less useful.

It's a big learning curve but once you start, you want to continue because there's a million plus one of things you can do with it! \n\nA lot of smart devices have more abilities (called entities in HAss) that it can do that you can create triggers for, that you can't easily do with the app for the device itself. Either way, in order for you to be notified that a camera is offline, you will need an external device running 24/7. Your Mac Book Pro is fine, but if you don't leave it running 24/7, you can't use it for what you are needing. \n\nMy best suggestion is buying a cheap thin book. I use one. HP T620 Thin Client. You can buy it on eBay for $50 including shipping ([here](https://www.ebay.com/itm/374245512537)). Then I installed Q4OS ([here](https://q4os.org/)) which is a Debian based version of Linux. Then install Docker and Portainer. There are many guides on google on how to do it. But don't get confused with Home Assistant OS versus installing it inside of Docker. They are different. \n\nMy friend did the OS version and I find sometimes I want access outside of HAss and it's not very easy to do anything outside the OS version. So I elected to install it on top of Linux (as a program in docker). Doing it this way also allows you to install many other programs in separate dockers. Many can link into HAss.""]"

I\'ve purchased 7-8 cameras, 2 thermostats, 2 scales, 3 locks with keypads, 5 watches and the Wyze security system. I\'m replacing everything (at significant expense). I used to be a huge advocate for Wyze but can\'t take it anymore. You asked for specifics, so here goes:\n\n* Smart locks need to be recalibrated very often and now often fail recalibration with no option but to ""try again,"" which I did more than a dozen times last weekend until I finally gave up. \n* Thermostats behave erratically. Woke up freezing one morning (set to 63) and sweating in the middle of the next night (set to 74) when I\'d not changed the temp at all and it should have been 70. \n* Cameras not connecting until 3rd or 4th tries.\n* Camera recording often doesn\'t catch the important stuff, even though I have CamPlus. It\'s triggered, films for a while and then goes into cool down and misses too much. (I\'ve adjusted.) My Nest cameras at the office record 24/7 with 10-day look back. I do pay $120 a year for that but decided it\'s totally worth it. \n* THE MOST ANNOYING thing of all, however, is the security system. I bought it when it first came out and I\'ve been waiting nearly 2 years for you to allow for more than one PIN code. The security system is worthless. (I\'m still paying my alarm company because I can\'t shut it off. Your security system is literally unusable. I\'ve been very patient.) That feature has been ""in development"" for over a year. I pay $10 a month for a brick.\n\nFinally decided last weekend that I\'m done. You keep breaking out new products but these basics are not taken care of. So, on Saturday I ordered Nest cameras, Nest thermostats, August door locks and Simplisafe. It will certainly cost me more, no question. But it will work. And they will all talk to each other in Google Home so I can build routines and such. \n\nAs you can tell from how much I bought from you over the years, I was a huge fan and an advocate to others. But I\'m punching out. Done with it. I hope you\'ll take my experience to heart and focus more on fixing the little things rather than continually churning out new products. \n\nI do sincerely wish you the best.', 'House0fMadne55: HA!!!!!

I\'m going to give this a shot because the two methods I found to do it are worse. Does hard powering off the cameras corrupt the filesystem when it loses power? I feel like that could be a problem with FAT32/exFAT.\n\nFor my crappy method:\n\nFirst, Set up a Wyze location event to turn \\_off\\_ the cameras when you arrive home. Sign into the same account on all phones of family members and they will all sync and obey this rule. This is fine because anybody coming home should turn off the cameras. The same is not true of leaving home: if you make a Wyze rule to turn on when you leave, if one person leaves, it will turn on the cameras even if others are still home. So instead, we can do one of the two following hacks:\n\n1.) Set up a Google Home routine that triggers on Nest thermostat going to eco mode. This is proxy for home/away, which Google does not let you write custom actions for. Add a custom action to say ""Hey Google, turn on camera X"". Requires a Nest thermostat or some other device you can trigger off as a proxy for home/away. Google Home is only able to turn cameras \\_on\\_, not \\_off\\_, which is why you first need the Wyze rule I mentioned above.\n\n2.) Use Apple Homekit + IFTTT webhooks to turn on all cameras when all home members have left home. IFTTT can turn cameras both on and off, but only one camera at a time or all cameras together. With the free plan of IFTTT you only get two applets and one action per applet. If you have some indoor and some outdoor cameras like I do, you would need the paid version to make rich enough applets to toggle the indoor cameras but not the outdoor ones. Fortunately, if we made the Wyze rule above, then we only need a single IFTTT applet: IF webhook ""cameras\\_on"" THEN turn on all Wyze cameras. The mechanics for getting webhooks set up is really simple and doesn\'t require much technical know-how. It does require that all people in the household have an iOS phone, in order to use HomeKit\'s geofencing.

Any cool name on social media is considered an OG. = ""Wow, that Instagram username is so OG.""\n* WHAT DOES OG MEAN?

For example, one might be jokingly labeled an OG if they are considered nerdy.\n   * \\[Wyze OG is cool nerdy tech\\] \n\nRegardless of origins, Intended use and meaning of things can and does change over time to mean something completely different. The word ""Literally"" is a good example, to my horror. Dictionaries now say it is proper use of the term to say it when you mean ""figuratively"" or just to emphasize whatever you are saying.

Say they unlock the bitrate so you can set it as high as you want.  That\'s great for a power user who knows what they are doing, but most people aren\'t in that category.  The Wyze model is about making smart home technology accessible and affordable, which means you\'ll get a lot of non-tech folks using them.  So let\'s say the average user goes into settings, sees ""hey this number can be higher"" and turns up the bitrate.  Now their camera is laggy, the frame rate is bad, artifacting is occurring, etc.  What do they do?  They probably aren\'t going to know to reset the value because they likely forgot about it already.  They\'re just going to use it for a few weeks, say Wyze is trash, and then complain on social media.  Alternatively, they get frustrated and call Wyze support about this.

They work best with the power block and cables they ship with. If you need longer cables then you have to learn about voltage drop due to wire resistance. Your cameras need 5dc to operate and with long cable runs you start to lose voltage to the point the camera will start acting up.\n\nYou get around that by getting cables with heavier wire and sometimes more powerful power blocks.\n\nMost power blocks give the minimum so don't double up. No splitters. If it's easier to run two cameras off of one block buy a good quality block with dual outlets.\n\nElectrical items have to stay dry. Not everything has to be put in water tight enclosures but it's got to be kept so high up under eves and porches that it will never get wet even occasionally from blown wind.\n\nThere's an open debate about how long is too long for cables.

I'm thinking about getting the pan cam v3. I'm trying to get a camera mounted on the ceiling of my kitchen pointed downwards so that I can monitor my mom who has dementia and type 2 diabetes. She is forgetting that she's already eaten, and has recently gone through an 18 count box of her ""healthy"" ice cream bars... In ONE day. I can't be at her side every second, but the Dr wants me to track her food intake. I need to be able to see exactly what she's getting from the fridge or cabinets.

Side note - my 23 nephew also lives in the home and I can't always be sure that mom is the only one eating certain things. Therefore, a camera will help.

Side note 2 - I am looking for a garage refrigerator that I can keep things in so that I can keep the kitchen refrigerator stocked with X amount of ice cream per day. That way, once they're gone for the day, they're gone. Until I can get the other refrigerator, this will have to be what I do.

So, has anyone ever mounted to the ceiling pointing downwards? Is the live feed going to be upside down? Is there anything else that I need to know about this setup? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",8,"[""DrJohnDPT: Not so much helpful with the setup but one thing we did with a freezer we have that my kids kept leaving open in our garage was put a door sensor on it.

1673845187.0,15-Jan-2023 20:59:47,cam Plus lite does not support the newer cameras FYI... cameras like the new pan v3,Wildcardsec,28,10d5l65,wyzecam,https://i.redd.it/h1yulmh4pdca1.jpg,,29,"[""nafterclifen: I'm not surprised. Why not? Wyze is a small company. They need to generate revenue to stay in business. We're lucky Cam Plus Lite even still exists. Here is how I remember things unfolding up this point...\n\n1. Wyze partners with Xnor.AI to bring FREE edge-based AI (e.g. person detection) to Wyze cameras.\n2. Apple buys Xnor.AI and Wyze looses their access/rights to edge-based AI. A bit of a goofy situation but it is what it is.\n3. Wyze develops their own cloud-based AI. Since they originally promised free AI, they try to make good on that promise by offering their new cloud-base AI to those who had the original edge-based AI. I think a sign up was required. They offered a name-your-price subscription which meant you could pay nothing per month or any amount of your choosing. Props to them for doing this.\n4. CamPlus evolves into a bamboozlement of options. But at the end of the day, it effectively generates revenue for the company to stay in business because the profit margin on their camera hardware is little to none. CamPlus Lite is a legacy offering on mostly legacy devices. So they're phasing it out by not allowing it on new devices. They're still honoring their original promise since it still works on older devices. But if you want AI on new devices, you need to pay and I don't blame  them for that. It's a important part of them staying in business.\n\nFor the record, I don't like the situation either. But I understand why it's playing out like this."", 'Itsallkosher1: This is not new news. A reminder that Cam Plus costs $1.67 in the US. That’s not a typo. One dollar. And 67 pennies. \n\nAlso, another reminder that you paid less than $35 for camera. \n\nIt’s honestly hard to be mad at this. It’s a steal all around.', ""Wooden_Bus_4679: Go host someones GB in the cloud, and not on google drive or something that loses money traditionally.\n\nYou'll find that storing video gets very pricey, real fast, then have them download that GB at $0.15/GB in Asia (That's what Google charges for Egress/Outbound traffic). Imagine google charges a business something that is most likely 8000x+ their cost.\n\nThe cloud companies milk these object storage costs, and you as a consumer pay the price.\n\nI did the math, just to transcode 24/7 footage down to smaller files with [coconut.co](https://coconut.co) on one camera would be $648, with AWS elastic transcoding, that would be nearly double. Of course on device could do this, but to have footage compressed in real time on device, means you need to pay a higher price for a better SOC, and the SOC on a wyze camera is not good, 20FPS or 15FPS at night SOC's are last generation kind of thing. But of course, the SOC is most likely $2 or less. A next generation Fullhan SOC for an IP camera is slated to be around $4 in March/April.\n\nHosting video is not profitable. Google Nest Aware at $9 for 24/7 with unlimited cameras, albeit at 2MP of the worst quality, is still, never going to be profitable & is an absolute STEAL.\n\nHomekit secure video from Apple for FREE, is never going to be profitable.

I often recommend the Wyze Pan for clients to keep tabs on their pets at home. I love using tech to monitor my cats coming and going and have a couple of smart cat doors. Its been handy to pair my cameras with the info and notifications from my smart doors. 

There is not much competition in the smart pet door arena, and Petsafe is finally releasing one to compete with the SurePet one. They are crazy expensive and I've had so many headaches with SurePet. So why doesn't Wyze or Eufy jump into the game? I have probably referred over 10 clients to purchase a smart cat door and would love to be able to refer a much better product. Honestly, the demand is very high for smart pet products with actual good design. There's just not enough competition to inspire innovation and improvement. 

Given that Wyze offers many smart lifestyle devices, its the perfect time to jump into pet tech altogether. In the world of pet tech, they could easily rake it in with:

We have a new batch of Fix-It Friday issues for you all today! As a (dis)honorable mention, we fixed the Error Code -1 issue for grouped cameras viewed on iOS devices. If you’ve been experiencing that problem, please download the iOS 2.38.4.3 app version from App Store.

Here’s the list of new Fix-It Friday issues we’re tracking:

**Core - Wyze Cam v3 Pro is not detecting people when subscribed to Cam Plus** 

This appears to be related to the rotate image 180° setting. We have applied a fix from the cloud side that seems to be working for the people we’ve spoken with. We’re working on a more robust firmware fix for this issue as well. If you’ve experienced this, could you please let us know if you had been using that setting and if you’re still running into this problem?

**Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro streaming and Playback issues when using 2K resolution** 

We are working on improvements for this in the 2.39 app. We’re aiming for the beta to start next week.

**Forum - Notifications not working on Wyze Video Doorbell when the button is pressed** 

Our team is looking into this one! We’ll give you an update later.

**Discord - Wyze Home Monitoring Keypad will not stay connected to Wyze Sense Hub** 

We’re looking into this from our side and will provide updates later.

**Let’s Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions**

***Discord - Wyze Cam Outdoor image is not saving the rotate 180 degrees setting and it must be reapplied when entering the live stream*** 

We have released firmware 4.X.4.418 to the public and we’ve heard confirmations that this problem is now resolved. We’ll remove this from our update list next week.

***Reddit - Wyze Outdoor Cam gets stuck at 1/3 without reset of the base station*** 

The fix for this was included in our recent updates. Are you still experiencing this? If we don’t hear back from anyone still having this problem, we’ll remove this from the update list next week.

***Forum - Wyze Air Purifier Insights graph is not updating when expected*** 

Is this still a problem for anyone? We’ve received feedback from multiple people that the current app version has resolved this for them. If we don’t hear back from anyone still experiencing this bug, we’ll remove it from the update list next week.

***Reddit - No motion detection notifications on Wyze Cam v3 Pro when a custom detection zone is set*** 

It looks like some of the Wyze Cam v3 Pro rotate image 180° reports got mixed into here. It makes sense because they have some overlapping components. So we’re still looking for logs about this issue! Please help us if you’re experiencing this problem! Here’s how to do to give us logs:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it here as a reply so we can get it to the right folks.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable*** 

We still could use some more logs for this problem! If you’re experiencing this and have a microSD card and a computer that can read the card, please send us a log to look at. Here’s how:

When the device shows offline, please take out the microSD card and wait a second before re-inserting the card (or inserting a new microSD card). The camera will then make two “ding” sounds usually within 30 seconds. On your microSD card, there will be a root or log folder with the device log that you can access with a computer. The files are named as xxxxx\_log.txt. If there are multiple logs, select the most recent log file.

When you have the log, please email it along with a description of the issue and the date, time, and time zone that it occurred to:

[microsdcardlogs@wyze.com](mailto:microsdcardlogs@wyze.com)

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn’t auto-unlock when the “Disable during hours” schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again*** 

We’ve had a delay in the beta firmware release for this but still plan to release it for testing in the future. We’ll keep you posted!

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)*** 

This is still planned for the next firmware update. We’ll let you know if that changes!

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 Pro is not live streaming in the app properly during the day but works properly at night even without night vision enabled*** 

We continue to be on track for 2.39!

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering*** 

We’re still in progress developing this fix. It’s a high priority and we’ll make sure to update here as we progress.

And that’s all we have for you today! Thanks for tuning in. If you see any of these issues reported in the wild, please direct people to this post so they have access to the information. We’ll be back next week!

1673579671.0,12-Jan-2023 19:14:31,Wyze denied a warranty claim in the worst way,melted349,32,10ajkj6,wyzecam,https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/10ajkj6/wyze_denied_a_warranty_claim_in_the_worst_way/,"Starting with the issue, I have a wyze floodlight that recently stopped detecting the floodlight in the app, and at night the floodlight turns on and off repeatedly. Super annoying; I tried power-cycling the camera from the app, by physically disconnecting it from the floodlight, and by killing power to the circuit the floodlight is on.  I eventually opened a support case with Wyze, they finally replied with instructions to do a factory reset and then closed the ticket.  I performed the factory reset which did allow me to trigger the siren afterwards, but the floodlight was still undetected and still turning on and off at night.  So I opened a new ticket, referenced the first ticket as asked them to return it under the warranty.  They denied it because I was past my warranty period.

So here's why that's super crappy of them.

• Purchase date (from wyze directly) 11NOV2021• Ship date 28DEC2021• FedEx delivery date 04JAN2022 (I also installed it the same day) <- The point I think the warranty should start• I open the initial ticket 23DEC2022• Warranty denied 12JAN2023 because the warranty starts from date of purchase, so the warranty period ended 11NOV2022.  Nearly two months of my warranty were wasted waiting to receive the product from Wyze

I guess I'll cut the wires to the lights on the floodlight, because the cameras are more reliable in the dark than they are with a strobing floodlight.  IDK  


EDIT: Wyze responded 14JAN2023 saying they would send a new floodlight with a prepaid return label to return the old one.  Looks like they decided they would honor the warranty after all.  ",31,"['chucktaylur: Buy another one and return the broken one?', ""DAMAGEDatheCORE: At worst, it should be the ship date, which still puts your initial support ticket start before the 1 year mark. The first support ticket should not have been closed. It should only be closed if the customer agrees that the results of whatever information or advice was given has satisfactorily resolved the issue in the customer's opinion. Or, if the customer doesn't respond that the issue is or is not resolved, then auto-close the ticket after an expiration period of, say, 7 days.\n\nAutomatically closing the ticket on a date that puts it outside the warranty period without resolution of the issue or confirmation by the customer is just plain wrong in my opinion.\n\nu/WyzeCam could you bring this to the team for review?"", ""Keliam: This is a case where a company is given the opportunity to show their true colors, in my opinion. Obviously, Wyze has shown their terrible customer support and lack of standing behind their products. I'm reminded of how the V1 Sensors were handled similarly horribly. I had a ton of the sensors, which all died on me, and they simply replaced it with the same known faulty product.\n\nI work in another industry, but we sell products online as a retailer. If there were a question of warranty time, I always suggest it would start from the date of delivery. In my case, I can go to bat for the customer if the manufacturer denies a claim, but most of the companies we work with are very good about standing behind their product. Many claims made 1, 2, or more months PAST the warranty window are still approved as the company can see it is a faulty product that should not have failed.\n\nI'm constantly reminded to steer clear of Wyze. I was an early adopter and sang their praises to many, but that's not been the case for a while now. Wyze could and should have been something exceptional, instead they just appear exceptional to someone who has yet to purchase their products. They soon find out they're rebranding Chinese white label products (largely), slapping half assed firmware on it, and then slinging it out the door. \n\nIf you purchased with a credit card you can see about it extending the product warranty.

It's both helpful for me to check up on the doggos, and it's an AWESOME add-on for pet parents looking to check up on their dogs whenever they want.

That said, it would be even better if there were other controls in place. It would even be a service that I'd gladly pay for were it offered; or it could simply be additional options on the sharing screen:

-- logs for every time a shared cam is viewed by a shared account

-- ability to control what is available to shared accounts: checkboxes for simple viewing, allowing playback, allowing movement, allowing talking through the camera, etc.

-- Notifications for when the cameras are being viewed


I'm actually not sure how sharing works on a user end so perhaps some of this is moot; but I definitely don't want customers to have the ability to view timeline from the MicroSD card. I have 256GB cards and they might have several different dogs that have been in that kennel; we record everything as a safety backup in case something ever happens, but we want our customers to only to be able to see what's going on right then and there.

Anyway, just suggestions for wyze to consider. I just bought 3 of the V3 pan cams so I'm up to almost 50 different wyze devices; I definitely like the products.",1,"['Heftylope: Wow I was just searching to see if there are logs. That’s an awesome thing you’re doing and I’m sure it attracts business, but because of your concerns alone I think you’re a brave soul for offering that. You’re correct, you don’t want people looking through your timeline. Honestly shared cams should not have playback options. \n\nSurveillance is my profession, I love the Wyze to tinker with because they are something special, but with so many little things that can drive you nuts. Not sure if you’re on the east coast, but if you were I’d help you with a better solution. Sounds like you should have a normal NVR that can give limited and scheduled access to cameras. Really wouldn’t be expensive either. I’d be happy to give you some tips.']"

Our clicker will only open or close the garage door from the outside.

I moved the sensor closer to the door as much as possible, and it solved the problem for my van's built-in garage opener as long as I keep pressed it for about 5-7 seconds before it triggered the sensor.  Also, I had to get as close to the door as possible for it to work, meaning I had to get out of the door quickly before it opened and closed so it wouldn't hit the van.

However, the clicker in my husband's car and my daughter's keychain clicker still do not open or close the garage door from the outside, no matter how long I press down on the buttons or how close I get to the door.  We use the Wyze app, which is tedious and slow, having to wait for the network.

Is there a way to extend wires so I can move the sensor closer to the garage door or beside the original garage door sensor(s) on each of the bottom corners of the garage?   Does Wyze sell longer cables or some extension cords?  Is there a way for me to extend the wires somehow using 28 gauge wires?  I'm not savvy with electrical stuff and don't want to burn the house down.  Pictures are attached for reference.  Please excuse the messy cables.  I'll fix them after I get this sorted out.  TIA

I am really shocked at how much it simply does not work. I get constant notifications for every car and pedestrian that goes past. The detection zone feature is a great idea but simple does not work.. at all.. in the least. Even if I leave only a single square selected on my porch. Also, I put the Motion Detection Sensitivity all the way down but it automatically resets to high every time. I had to turn notifications off but that defeats much of the point of a video doorbell for me. I want to know when the mail is delivered and Amazon packages get dropped off. If they fixed the detection zone problem it would be a near perfect product for me but I have a feeling it isn't going to happen. But why have the feature if it won't work? I guess I'm just looking for an excuse not to return it at this point.. I'd love for it to work as advertised but c'mon Wyze, get it together..",46,"['MrCertainly: Same here -- it faces a busy road, so my detection zone was like 4-6 ""blocks"" on the screen.

My doorbell is dead by the next morning. It suggests ""hey, you\'re getting a lot of alerts. maybe you should try a detection zone?"" LOOK HERE YOU DUMB PIECE OF CRUD, I ALREADY AM! \n\nIt\'s a totally broken product in that regards. It\'s a ""doorbell"" with a camera on it for only when it gets pressed. And a camera for when I want to manually view a livestream. What a complete and utter waste of my money.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake? The dang IR flood light triggers my motion light, so anytime a car goes past -- triggers the camera, then triggers my light. If I manually view the livestream at night, same exact thing happens too.

If you forget to press Save, the app doesn’t keep your changes when you leave the page.\n\nAnother common issue is that the settings for what you want the camera to record are different from the settings of what you want to trigger notifications. Be careful when you’re setting them up that you aren’t confusing the two different concepts.\n\nAnother extremely common issue is misunderstanding what the detection zone actually does, and how it interacts with notification settings (or, rather, how it does NOT interact).\n\nWhen you set the detection zone, you’re telling the camera “start recording if this area of the image changes”. The definition of “changes” is kinda murky, but is based on how many pixels of the image are different from one frame to the next, and the sensitivity level you set. “Different” can be something you might not even notice with your eyes, like a slight darkening from a cloud drifting overhead, or a slight brightening from a car’s headlights reflecting off another house onto your porch. This is really important to understand… the detection zone is where the camera looks for image changes to trigger recording, NOT where it looks for things to trigger notifications. This is where many people get confused.\n\nThe next step, after an image change in the detection zone triggers a recording, the camera uploads that video to the Wyze servers. Then those servers check the video for any of the objects you chose to get notifications about. If something is identified that you selected, it pushes a notification to your phone. Now… this is the part that Wyze doesn’t make totally obvious… the AI detection and notifications are independent of your detection zone setting. After the video has been uploaded to Wyze to check for AI events, your detection zone is irrelevant. The process of finding objects in the recording to notify you about does not take your detection zone into account.\n\nSo, to put it simply, the detection zone specifies where to watch for anything to change, not where to look for cars/people/pets/packages. The entire video area is scanned for those things, NOT just the detection zone. That’s why you can get a notification about a car on the far left side of the video even though your detection zone only includes the far right side. Something on the right side triggered a recording, the video gets uploaded, and Wyze identifies an object you want notifications about, regardless of where it appears in that video.\n\nI should be careful and give the disclaimer that this is how things worked as of late summer… I haven’t kept up on the latest news so it’s possible they’ve integrated the detection zone into the AI scanning, but since the app settings still have those things in separate places, I assume they still operate independently like I described above.\n\nI hope this info was helpful!', 'ascullycom: I bought one at Christmas as well and am having the same issues, detection zone does not work at all, motion detection sets itself back to 5 randomly.

I just spent about 3 hours hooking up my new Wyze doorbell pro. Where my old doorbell was, it wasn't wide enough to support the Pro.


I drilled a few holes, ran some more 18 gage wire... Hooked everything up. Everything is up and running but it shows the camera being at 68%...


Im assuming it's run on battery? I double checked the connections everything seems fine.


Is its running on wired power? Or because it's shows 68% is it running on the battery? Is there a quick way to check?

 Hey everyone!  I just received the Wyze robot vacuum and was vac really excited about it until it showed some potentially serious issues that won't work for me.  Anyone else have these issues?

1. As it goes along the walls, it raises the wheel closest to the wall and rides the quarter round trim, leaving a gap that doesn't get vacuumed (a few inches along the floor).  No idea why this is an issue as quarter-round trim is really common.
2. Sometimes the vacuum persistently tries to go through the wall, even though the wall is on the map.  It tries to go through the wall, can't, backs up, raises its wheels and tries over and over again, as if there is nothing in front of it. Meanwhile, it's spinning it's wheels trying to get through the wall, making horribly loud sounds as the wheel skips against the floor.  How is it not recognizing it's a wall??  Doesn't it have sensors that prevent it from running into the wall in addition to the map?  This one boggles my mind.

Seems this thing has a few kinks to work out...

1673375794.0,10-Jan-2023 10:36:34,Here's a fix to resolve the Cam Pan v2 bricking issue caused by a faulty firmware update,pfc9769,10,108h7dz,wyzecam,https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/108h7dz/heres_a_fix_to_resolve_the_cam_pan_v2_bricking/,"Most of my cameras were bricked due to a firmware update that was released in the last few months. Support was unable to provide any guidance on fixing the issue. After doing some research, I was able to fix the issue myself by performing a manual firmware update to a previous version. I thought I'd share the steps since I noticed quite a few comments about the issue across various forums. I hope this helps:   

1. You'll need a microSD card that's smaller than 32GB or smaller and formatted with FAT32. While the camera can record to a larger card, the firmware updater can only read smaller cards. The file size is 10MB so any small capacity SD card will do. Amazon sells 2GB cards for less than $7. Just make sure to format it to FAT32.  

2. Go to https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024852172-Release-Notes-Firmware and download the 4.49.1.47 (March 17, 2022) firmware.  

3. Follow the Wyze Cam Pan v2 firmware update instructions here:  https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360031490871-How-to-flash-your-Wyze-Cam-firmware-manually  

4. Once the update completes, the status light will change from purple to red, and then blue and likely blink. The camera should then go through its startup routine of rotating the base left and right and then back to center. If this happens the firmware was updated successfully and your camera is no longer bricked!  

5. The camera should reconnect to your wifi and be visible in the Wyze app again. This was the case for me. If it doesn't come back online, try resetting the camera to factory default and setting it up again.",13,"['Htowntaco: Do you think this would work for a v1 cam pan?

No problem there if you're in a state that allows this behavior.  However, they were able to confirm that on a completely separate account/hardware set with no connection to the first account, the camera instantly recognized the person's face even though they had never appeared on that account.  That means they are storing the facial data for access across all devices which is not in compliance with their ToS and would violate quite a few state laws if it is confirmed to be true.\n\nHere is a brief article with a TL/DR in the first couple of paragraphs.

We both have Wyze accounts and the app on our phones.

First, the trigger has failed for whatever reason once or twice since I set this up. It’s not a big deal for me because that means the pet cam is on/off when it shouldn’t be, but I wouldn’t want it to fail resulting in my door being unlocked when I’m not home. The second problem is that the minimum geofence is a 500ft radius around your house which is fairly large.

It’s the first Friday of a new month! That means it’s time for this month’s Fix-It Friday callout!

If this is your first Fix-It Friday, welcome! For background, while our communities are not designed to be a replacement for [Wyze Support](https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us), our community members and community managers do our best to help you out here. As our communities scale up, we want to make sure that any outstanding bugs or issues that you folks are facing are on our internal radar and that we’re transparent in our process of working on them.

Here’s how this works:

* We’ll make a post on the first Friday of the month in every community (Core Community on Facebook, Forums, Reddit, and Discord).
* Check the comments. If you see any other comments with issues that you’re facing, vote for them with a like (the heart button at the bottom of their reply)
* Got something new? Reply to our post with the top issue you’re facing this week with your Wyze products to help loop us in.
* We’ll grab the top comment from each community and make a follow-up post on Monday to detail what those issues are and how we plan to fix them. If we need more info from the community to help figure out what’s going on, we’ll let you know on Monday - so please make sure to take a look!
* The following Mondays in the month, we’ll be posting updates about our progress on Fix-It Friday submissions.
* Sometimes Mondays are actually Tuesdays if we don’t get all the info we need on time for posting on Monday. Our apologies!
* Remember, this is for existing things that aren’t working right. If you are looking for a *new* feature or for us to add functionality that’s not already available, please use our [Wishlist ](https://forums.wyzecam.com/c/wishlist)instead!

We’re constantly working on improvements for everyone. But we hope this process will help us prioritize issues important to our communities and help you feel more in the loop.

Got a request for something new or an additional feature? Check our [Wishlist ](https://forums.wyzecam.com/c/wishlist/l/votes)to see if it is in the works or for new requests.

If you want to see how this works, you can check [this previous Fix-It Friday post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/zawyju/fixit_friday_callout_for_new_issues_12222/) or a recent [Fix-It Friday Update post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/ztx0c7/fixit_friday_122_issues_checkin_3/).

My only (admittedly small) bone to pick is it *has to* have an internet connection for the controller to work. 

Just out of curiosity for security's sake, I blocked internet access to it at my firewall and set a couple firewall rules so that I can still view the camera whilst on my LAN or VPN'd back from remote. That works. I can view the camera that way. However, I get `operation failed` when trying to control the door.

 Hello   
   
Thank you for reaching out to Wyze wizards team, My name is Renfred. I will be happy to assist you.  
   
I am sorry to hear you’re experiencing some complications using your camera after the recent firmware update.  
   
Here are some troubleshooting steps I would like you to try.  
   


1. Please go ahead and power cycle your device by unplugging the camera from its power source. Allow the camera to remain unplugged for 1 minute before plugging the camera back into power.
2. If you are still experiencing the behavior, please go ahead and attempt to [set the camera up](https://support.wyzecam.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033823671-Wyze-Cam-Setup-Guide) again as a new device.
3. Once done and the issue persists, [factory reset ](https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360031484511-How-to-factory-reset-your-Wyze-Cam-v1-v2-v3-or-Pan-v1-v2)the device. 

I hope these steps help correct your issue. If not, please let us know through this email so that we can further assist you.

I completed their request which removed both cameras from the app when attempting to reinstall. I replied to their email telling them they still wont connect and this is their reply to that .

 Thank you for contacting Wyze. This is Ze from the Wyze Wizards Team.   
   
I apologize that the new firmware version of the camera made your camera stop working. No worries, I have informed our engineering team about this issue because this is ongoing and you are not the only customer experiencing this concern.  
   
Kindly follow and provide the info below:  
Go to the Home Screen of your Wyze App, and tap the picture of your Device showing Livestream.  
Tap the gear settings icon on the upper right corner of the screen.  
Scroll down to Device Settings  
Then, tap Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Put in all of the details about the issue.  
   
After submitting the log, please reply to the LOG ID to this email, and phone model. I will keep an eye on your response.

Used to have a Samsung phone but had to switch sadly. 

I am getting the Wyze cam v3 notifications on new Iphone 13 (all software updates, all Wyze updates and firmware)  on the lock screen of my iPhone and on the iPad.  Used to get vibrations and notif's on Samsung. This was handy so I could put phone on silent (Samsung) and in my pocket locked and still get vibrations from Wyze alerts of Cam activity. 

So  TLDR,  I’m NOT getting is any Wyze Cam alert vibrations on the new iPhone.

 I’m hoping someone with an iphone and Wyze app can answer this. I also wrote Wyze with little luck thus far (am waiting) for this seemingly easy question

Any suggestions on the no vibration on iPhone, which, at least on the Samsung would vibrate and give me the notification?

Long story short: bought the Wyze Doorbell for Christmas for a relative last year and for a number of reasons it didn't work for them so they gave it back to us. I'd like to use it at the front door, but we don't have the wiring at the front for a bell (old house, never had one, most people use back) and I don't want to pay to have it run. Back door area is already covered by a camera, so the doorbell would be redundant plus we'd prefer to have the real chimes ring and not the Wyze chime.

I do have an outside outlet near a corner of the house that faces my shed and the path between my house and the neighbours' and I've often wanted a camera around there. The Doorbell is the wired kind, and I was wondering [if something like this](https://www.amazon.ca/3-3Ft-20AWG-Pigtail-Cable-Black/dp/B09FF883CX/ref=sr_1_10?crid=12XTXGUZHRCKS&keywords=usb+wire&qid=1672838221&sprefix=usb+wire+%2Caps%2C132&sr=8-10) \- a USB-A to plain wire would work to power the camera if it was plugged into an adapter in the outside outlet?

I'd cover it with tape or paint it to match the grey outlet box to camoflauge it, but the area it's in is surrounded by a low fence so anybody creeping through the yards to the shed wouldn't easily notice it or disable it.

Is there anything I'm missing or some reason why this wouldn't work? Does the chime need to be plugged into a socket inside and connected to the camera to work, or would it just work as a camera/doorbell that is never rung?  


Thanks!",6,"[""bmk4993: The doorbell actually has a micro-USB slot.  It's under the rubber cover right above the wire contacts.

I tried to hit the reset button for 20 seconds. Nothing.

When I first got my v3 Pro, I wanted to enjoy all of the features it had to offer (including 2k). That seemed to cause a slew of performance issues, so I toggled it down to SD.

Now, the lone remaining issue that I am experiencing is my SD card playback does not work. When I tap on SD Card from the live view, I get a freeze frame of the live camera feed at that time.

I contacted Wyze support and they asked me to swap to SD if I hadn't already and then try a factory reset. The issue went away for a little while and then came back again. I've restarted via the app and pulled power, waited 5 min, plugged it back in but no luck.

The camera is mounted up on the side of my house, so I have to get the ladder out each time I factory reset it.

Given the increased price of this cam compared to the regular v3's, I was hoping for a stable experience out of the box but this thing has been a headache.

My parents have setup two outdoor cameras in their house and shared the devices (via email) for me to monitor. They have microsd cards in them and haven't opted for the pro version. However, they are saying that the events are not getting captured. When I look at the event page from my account (of their shared cameras) I see events appearing as images and when I try to play it, it says ""Try cam plus...."" 

Why do we need ""cam plus"" to save & view event videos? I was assuming that given we have an SD card, it will store the events on there and we would be able to access it.

As long as the camera and whatever it is streaming to are on the same network, the video itself remains 100% local on the network. The video livestream never leaves the local network.\n\nHaving said that, all Wyze firmware requires that after a restart, the camera must first authenticate with the Wyze server before it will start recording or streaming at all... So this camera does require that is able to authenticate with Wyze's servers initially or the camera will not function. After a stream is started though, and authentication is confirmed, there should be no reason why internet continues to be needed until the device restarts, etc. But regardless, the only time Livestreaming video leaves the local network is if the device you are streaming to is not on the network. OR if you use their WebView, which for some reason is not local. But even using the Wyze App on your phone, if your phone and camera are both on the same router/SSID, the video feed stays totally local and does not go through any outside source.\n\nSo with the other RTSP options, it will also keep the video local.\n\nIf someone wants Wyze cameras to never, ever even authenticate through Wyze and be 100% local with no internet ever, the only option for that to my knowledge is using V2 cameras with Dafang firmware flashed onto then. I don't believe it's possible with any other Wyze Cams.\n\nThough the VP said in an AMA that he was trying to move Wyze away from Cloud dependency and toward a more local-based model. I hope they really push toward this. I don't mind having cloud stuff optional for added features, but nothing should be cloud dependent and I'm glad the VP has seen the light about the downsides of cloud dependency. I'm optimistic that they'll allow more things to have local priority like many of us want. 👍"", 'SSSTREDDD: I appreciate the detailed clarification.

But to me, those aren't a big deal, especially since nobody could do anything unless they were already on your local network, and if that's the case then the camera would be the least of your concerns anyway... So in the end, it wasn't much to care about especially since accessing the SD card through a secured router was actually one of the most requested features on the wishlist we've been asking Wyze to do on purpose.\n\nBut yes, I totally agree with you about hoping for a more solid solution in the future. 👍""]"

Terrible Experience",OkCantaloupe3496,9,zz4jse,wyzecam,https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/zz4jse/wyze_nohassle_returns_terrible_experience/,"Hello - I thought I would post this to the community to get a different perspective and see if I'm off base or not.

Around Black Friday I had place an order for a number of wyze products, at the time they were running a deal that if you had spent greater than $150 on an order you would be eligible for Free Shipping.  My order was close to $200 so it shipped to me for free. Flash forward a few weeks I decided   I needed to return a few of the cams.  I then went through the return process and noted that a $5.99 shipping fee was being deducted from my refund amount.  I thought wyze had free return shipping so I pulled up the return policy on the site:

## No-Hassle Returns!

^(You can return a product purchased from wyze.com\* for any reason up to 30 days from purchase. Please contact our support team to initiate a return.)

* ^(\*Only items that have been purchased directly from Wyze Labs through the Wyze Store can be returned to Wyze Labs. Items purchased through Wyze Labs’ authorized resellers and distributors must be returned in accordance with their respective returns and refunds policy.)
* ^(You must provide your Wyze Store order number to initiate a return. For items received as a gift, you will need to provide the order number received by the purchaser. Wyze Labs is only able to issue a refund to the original payment method used by the purchaser.)
* ^(Items must be returned with all included accessories and packaging. Please make sure that the item you are returning is repackaged with all the cords, adapters and documentation that were included when you received it.)
* ^(If the items you decide to return were originally purchased as a bundle, you must return all of the items that you originally received in that bundle in order to be refunded the full purchase price of the bundle.)
* ^(If you received a free item with your original purchase, you must return that free item with your returned Product(s); if you do not return a free item you received, your refund will be reduced by the prorated value of the free item.)
* ***Wyze Labs will provide a pre-paid return shipping label that you can use to ship your return to us. You will not be charged for the return shipping cost. However, the shipping charge associated with your original purchase will not be refunded.***

After reading that last bullet I was a bit confused so I reached out to support.  I was told that under normal circumstances there is usually a $5.99 shipping fee for most orders and when a refund is issued the wyze system will auto refund the full amount including the original shipping cost.   As wyze policy states they do not refund the original shipping charge and so they deduct $5.99 from orders during the refund process to reclaim the original shipping fee.  

I then tried to explain to them that I did not have an original shipping charge because I had free shipping therefore I didn't think the $5.99 fee should be deducted.  I was then told that shipping fee would remain regardless if I had received free shipping or not during the original order. 

 I referred them to the last bullet in their own return policy where it clearly states that they will provide a pre-paid return label and that they do not charge for return shipping costs.  They are now more or less giving me the run around stating that they are sorry I am confused and that the shipping fee will remain.  Its a bit frustrating that they seem to be going against what is very clearly posted on the site as their own policy.   

Am I out of line here and what are my options moving forward?

Just frustrating that I feel I am ultimately being charged for return shipping when they have a policy that would make you believe otherwise.  I guess the lesson learned here is if you ever need to make a return, you'll be out $5.99 by purchasing through wyze even if you get a free shipping promotion.  I would take a venture to say if you had a promo that wasnt based on purchase price and did a return the same thing would happen too. I feel a bit slighted as this wasn't something that I could have predicted prior - at least based on the policy stated on the site.

This fact is not clearly spelled out in the policy.  I also believe this would still be the case if you paid $300 dollars and returned say $50.

They confirmed that that’s true and suggested “the best way to get ideas on our official Wishlist is through our forums where users can post and vote for feature requests.”

The fact that a WiFi cam/home security company still doesn’t support the most up-to-date WiFi security protocol that’s been around for more then 4 years, and instead forces users to rely on a significantly less secure protocol (WPA2) from 2004, is really concerning. 

The fact that they’d suggest customers go promote the idea on their wishlist forum is mind blowing. Implementing support for current security standards should be standard practice. 

It really makes me question whether Wyze is at all serious about security and privacy. But I guess I shouldn’t be surprised after [they were recently caught](https://www.cnet.com/home/security/your-home-security-camera-could-be-hacked-so-treat-it-that-way/) failing to alert users about or patch a serious vulnerability for nearly three years.",4,"['CorporateTrainerCO: It\'s a $30 (more or less) device.

Compared to WPA2, it enhances Wi-Fi password protection, secures open networks, and simplifies device configuration. WPA3 devices are backward compatible with devices that use WPA2, but legacy Wi-Fi devices do not detect WPA3 and support only WPA2.\n\nThe Wi-Fi Alliance requires WPA3 security certification for Wi-Fi 6E devices that will operate in the 6 GHz band. However, there is no backward compatibility support for WPA2 security.\n\nWPA3 Personal is the newest, most secure protocol currently available for Wi-Fi devices. It works with all devices that support Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), and some older devices.\n\nWindows 10: Version 1903 or later supports WPA3, device driver support varies. macOS supports WPA3 starting with version 10.15 (Catalina). iOS and iPadOS: WPA3 support with version 13 or later. Android: WPA3 was introduced with Android 10.\n\nLinux software “wpa_supplicant” is a cross-platform supplicant with support for WPA, WPA2 and WPA3 (IEEE 802.11i). It is suitable for desktops, laptops and embedded systems. It is the IEEE 802.1X/WPA component that is used in the “client stations” (pc computer, phone, tablet, watch, camera, doorbell, lock, switch, lights, alarm, TV streaming stick, all smart home devices).\n\nAssuming Wyze Cam v3 (and all Wyze smart devices) runs on the Linux kernel, and uses “wpa_supplicant” for its encrypted WiFi data connection to our home routers, it should be possible for Wyze engineers to enable WPA3 WiFi security by producing a firmware update which would have the “wpa_supplicant” enable the new WPA3 protocol."", 'DAMAGEDatheCORE: Ah yes, the void that is the WYZE Wishlist.

## Friends,

Wow, what a year it has been.

Over the last 5 years building Wyze, we have felt the highest of highs and some of the lowest of lows. This year, in particular, it seems we have had moments on both sides.

We’ve felt some effects of a slowing economy. We could have been better at balancing resources across the business. Our inventory levels have been way too high after the supply chain bullwhips of last year and we have had to run deep discounts to reduce overstock. Hopefully, you snagged some extra Wyze gear through the correction 

Despite the challenges, we have so much to celebrate at Wyze.

The Wyze family has now grown to over 10 million users! Over 1 Million users are Cam Plus users!

There are 20 million Wyze devices out in the wild!

Wyze AI detected 67 billion events!

These numbers are unfathomable to us.

We launched several products that have received great customer reviews, including Cam Protect, Wyze Air Purifier, Wyze Lock Bolt, Wyze Garage Door Controller, Wyze Gun Safe, Wyze Cam v3 Pro, and Wyze Mesh Router. We also revamped our website, warehouse, and shipping capabilities, making huge improvements to shipping speed and removing preorders for a better customer experience.

We are still a founder-run company. The same 3 of us who started this company when we had 10 users are the same people running it with 10 million. We’ve had a lot of learning to do as we’ve had to manage a much bigger business, but the startup mentality and focus on users will never leave us. We are here for you just as we were on day one.

That day-one startup mentality will be ultra-focused in 2023, because this year, much like our first year in business, will be the year of the CAMERA. With your help, we will revisit everything about the Wyze Cam experience. We will focus hard on hearing all your feedback and making the best camera hardware and software in existence. Product launches in 2023 will also be focused on cameras, with few exceptions. Get ready for some big camera announcements in just a few weeks! And we will of course continue to support and update all Wyze products.

Can’t wait for another year together with you. THANK YOU for being Wyze users. THANK YOU for your loyalty.

Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and Happy New Year!

Wyze Founders,

Yun Zhang

There are security protocols in place, but the second you connect to the open public network (the internet), you no longer have a private network. \n\nA closed private network is one that doesn’t require any connection to an internet service provider. You can create a Wi-Fi network in your home with no internet. Many businesses have closed private networks to maintain true privacy and security.\n\nEvery piece of equipment should never once demand to connect to a public network with your network password for basic functionality. A “Wi-Fi” camera or robot vac should have full Wi-Fi functionality within your closed private Wi-Fi network via an approved IP address. It should never have to communicate with the public network just to function. \n\nThis is where companies really skirt the lines though, and they more or less get away with spyware.

I wouldn\'t try to drill through the siding from the inside of the house. From the inside, I would drill through everything but the siding, remove the bit from the drill and poke it into the hole you just made to push the siding out a little. Then I would go outside and mark the point on the siding that is pushed out by the drill bit. I would then drill through the siding from the outside of the house. Try not to spin the drill bit too much while it is in the wall cavity.

I just did that mistake when I was ""fixing"" the incorrectly drilled holes on my bed\'s headboard because the holes didn\'t line up and I had to drill through the fabric. It had some kind of insulation type material and it just wrapped around the bit and kinda caused weird pattern on fabric on other side, but luckily that part was under the bed.  Live and learn! Or read Reddit before attempting.\n\nSo, once I do that, it\'s OK to push the USB through right? I am planning to route at least 2 per hole  so I don\'t have to drill too many places. I might use help from piece of conduit type of pipe and then seal around it so it\'s clean and not jagged on USB cord. I used to have 20ft USB cables power my old V2 cams, hopefully it will be OK with V3. Sad that they eliminated daisy chain from V3.', '90TigerWW2K: You have to take the outlet plate off. The ""poking around"" is done in an area that will be covered by the plate when you re-install it. Unless your house was built by meticulous craftsman, there will likely be a gap between the edge of the drywall (where the hole for the outlet was cut) and the electrical box that you can insert a screwdriver into to poke around. \n\nThe hole you drill to run the USB cable(s) through should be \\~1/2 to 1"" away from the outlet plate after you re-install the plate. If you would rather not put a hole in the drywall, you can drill the hole right next to the electrical box so it is covered by the plate but you would need to modify the plate so the wire could then be plugged into the outlet. If you don\'t want to alter your nicer metal plate, you could pull it off and use a plastic one from HD or Lowes. You might be able to paint the plastic plate to look reasonably close to the metal one so it isn\'t as noticeable.  I mean, who really looks at someone else\'s outlet plates?\n\nI think  you should be able to re-use the 20ft USB cables. Outside your house, you can probably tuck the wires behind the siding. Most vinyl siding is 2 ""rows"" tall so there is a crack between pieces that you can push the usb wires up into....but the wires may be difficult to remove once you push then behind the siding so do that last.', ""_0x0_: I will be sure to share the pictures with you so you can laugh at my work :) This is exciting, all those V3 cams sitting around while waiting for me to figure out how to mount them outside. :)  Plus got several V2's and enclosures, I'll make use of those with this method.

Finding no help on the Wyze forums I turn to you in my hour of desperation.  
  
I just set up an Echo Show 8 that I got my wife for Christmas. Our Eufy doorbell camera shows up flawlessly. Our four Wyze cams do not. (3x V3 and 1x V2, all with up to date firmware.)
I was really hoping my wife would be able to view the cameras in our newborn and toddler’s bedrooms from the Show while she’s in the kitchen.   
   
At the moment, every time I give it a command to show a Wyze cam, it simply says “Okay” and then shows “Waiting for Wyze” for about 15 seconds and then goes back to the home screen. No errors or any indication as to why it can’t show them.  
To make matters more confusing, all of the Wyze cams show up perfectly in the Alexa app on my Android. The skill is enabled, linked and working fine. Just not on my brand new Echo Show.  
  
I’ve checked to make sure I’m on the right account, devices are discovered and on the same network. I’ve reset my account credentials, disabled, re-enabled the skill, and relinked the account.  
Not sure what else to try at this point. But it’s very frustrating. This was the whole purpose for puchasing this device as a gift. And as mentioned, my Eufy camera doorbell is working flawlessly.

Just bought my first Wyze product, the Floodlight V3 camera. It works really well for 2 months and now that it's rainy season, every time it rains, the system seems to go a little bonkers.  It would randomly disconnect, last night it rained harder and it  literally went offline.  Thank God it was  hooked up to a light switch from the inside and I didn't have to bring out a ladder to hit reset. So I just power cycled it and it went fine.   Why does this happen when it rains?  Is it because it's NOT under an eave? Is  something getting wet on the inside making it disconnect? What solutions do I have so this doesn't happen as often?  I got pretty annoyed that I couldn't access the cam to see if we're being flooded from the rain.. and yep it sure was flooded when I physically went to go check.",3,"['None: Not sure but just for safes when you get the change try and go back up their and make sure the gasket is flushed with the junction box and that the center screw is tight and once again make sure the gasket is flushed with the junction box .

anybody have any idea why that happens ?

We have a bunch of people out on PTO for family time and holiday observation. We don’t expect a lot of progress on these for a couple of weeks but we’ll keep you in the know! Here’s our Fix-It Friday follow-up:

**Reddit -  No motion detection notifications on Wyze Cam v3 Pro when a custom detection zone is set**

We’re still looking for logs on this! We’ve been going through them and are working on resolving this problem. Here’s how to do to give us logs:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what’s happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it here as a reply so we can get it to the right folks.

**Core - Videos are not uploading to the cloud**

The firmware we recently released has significantly improved the success rate for video uploads. If you’re still having difficulty with videos not uploading to the cloud, please speak up now! Otherwise, we’ll remove this from the update list in the upcoming weeks.

**Discord - Wyze Cam Outdoor image is not saving the rotate 180 degrees setting and it must be reapplied when entering the live stream**

We have beta firmware currently in testing that seems to have fully resolved this issue. We’re keeping an eye on the beta feedback! If you’re testing the beta firmware and still experiencing this issue, please let us know now!

**Forum - Wyze Cam v3 Pro is not live streaming in the app properly during the day but works properly at night even without night vision enabled**

We are still on track for 2.39!

**Let’s Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions**

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

No further update here. Our hunt for microSD card logs continues! We have some and are taking a look at them. Thank you so much for the help! If you’re experiencing this and have a microSD card and a computer that can read the card, please send us a log to look at. Here’s how: 

When the device shows offline, please take out the microSD card and wait a second before re-inserting the card (or inserting a new microSD card). The camera will then make two ""ding"" sounds usually within 30 seconds. On your microSD card, there will be a root or log folder with the device log that you can access with a computer. The files are named as xxxxx\_log.txt. If there are multiple logs, select the most recent log file.

When you have the log, please email it along with a description of the issue and the date, time, and time zone that it occurred to:

[microsdcardlogs@wyze.com](mailto:microsdcardlogs@wyze.com)

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn’t auto-unlock when the “Disable during hours” schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again***

We’re planning to start releasing beta firmware for this next week or the week after. Thank you for your patience!

***Forum - Wyze Air Purifier Insights graph is not updating when expected***

The 2.38 app has been released to the public! We’re waiting on the air purifier firmware to be released and expect that to happen in the upcoming weeks.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

This changes in the recent firmware update were pretty significant so we moved this one to the next update build to make sure QA could do a full regression test on schedule. Thank you for your patience!

***Reddit - Wyze Outdoor Cam gets stuck at 1/3 without reset of the base station***

We have a new firmware build for beta expected to release either next week or shortly after the new year.

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

We’ll be working on this issue after our folks come back from the holiday break. We’ll let you know about the progress after the new year!

***Discord - Cameras that are subscribed to Cam Plus Lite cannot enable person detection when a camera is in Wyze Home Monitoring***

We don’t have a further update on this one so here’s the info from before: This actually was by previous design but we’re talking to the team about timelines for adjusting this. We think the earliest will be the 2.41 app since we’re still working on resolving issues with the Security Camera feature so it doesn’t make a lot of sense to fix this bug first.

And that does it for this update! Thank you for your time. We’ll chat with you next week!

All of the existing ones record the 12 second clips to the cloud and also do person detection (only person detection). I was grandfathered into this (or whatever) when they offered ""pay what you want"" per month.

 I can access their SD cards via the app and see everything they recorded. They detect motion and sound and tag the videos with ""person"" when detected. So far so good.

Enter the 2 new Cam Pan v2. 

I understand if they have a limit in the number of cameras that will have person detection. I did not expect this to go on for an unlimited number of my cameras.
Say for argument's sake that I reached that limit. I'm OK with that.

BUT, when these 2 cameras detect motion they give me a notice that I can't play back! When I hit play I get directed to a subscription screen!

Is it true that my new cameras will upload to the cloud but I can't watch the 12 second clips unless I pay?!?!!!

What use is that?

EDIT: What I wrote underneath does not mean I feel scammed by Wyze. In view of some down votes, please read again, it is not what I'm saying at all!
