It is not the wheel spinning issue as there is movement and will actually move off the dock when I put a white piece of paper just and the end of the dock before the floor transition leading me to believe that it is a cliff sensor issue. 

Basically what will happen is that the M6 will move forward about an inch, back up, and repeat until it errors out with an undocking issue. 

I've tried to clean the sensors, cover the sensors with foil, cover the sensors with white paper, cover the sensor with white paper with some regular packing tape to make it glossy, hot glue to create a ""light bridge.""

Anyone have any other suggestions that I can try?"	0	[]

Odd_Educator7309	6	1387mmx	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/1387mmx/which_roomba_model_for_a_carpetfree_apartment/	"Hi! With mother's day coming up, I'd like to order a Roomba for my mom, but I'm not really sure which one to go for. My parents live in an apartment that is: 

* One floor with 5 rooms, including living room/kitchen (there are ledges in front of the bedrooms, each around 1in tall)
* Floor is marble tiles and hardwood (no carpets)
* No pets
* Typical furniture (tables, chairs, etc), but not any other freestanding objects. 

My budget is around $459. It seems to me like a more basic model like the i3 would be fine, but there are so many choices that I'm not sure if I'm missing something. Also, are there certain models that have better build quality?  Any advice is appreciated!"	1	['Matt_NZ: 5 rooms might be a bit complicated for an i3. With specials, you might be able to find a J7+ within your budget or at the very least the J7 without the clean base (she could add that later if she wants that functionality)']

I don't remember what model it is. It just runs around the house randomly, constantly gets stuck and almost never returns to the charging station. But despite all of this it appeared to be very useful and I do not regret buying it. I am actually thinking about buying another one for the second floor ( all carpet ) , and leaving this one on the first ( all ceramic tile).

My main requirement: It should not have a mop feature. We tried a robotic mop once and were less than impressed. I think it is a gimmick at least on tile. You need a bucket of water to wash the floor properly. Robotic mops with their tiny sprinklers just move the dirt from the tile into the grout, from where it is much more difficult to clean later.

So I discarded most higher end robotic vacuums only because they have mops.

I am left with a few choices. Would S9 work for me ? I've read that it does the best carpet cleaning but there are complains about reliability.  I do not care much about the mapping perfection. Anything better than my random Roomba will be better and it already does a good job.

So S9+? or  J8+ from Costco ? Anything else ?"	4	"['VinvinVR: Yup. J8', 'ReginaldGupta: One left in stock. https://amzn.to/3p9xLUV', ""Matt_NZ: The S9 is the best robot vac for carpet, especially if you have a pet that moults.

You can't get direct access to the Roomba's onboard controller, so directly adding smart mapping and cameras is right out. However, the serial port on top does give you access to all the sensors and full control of the drive motors. There are various projects to hook up an ESP8266 or similar to give Wi-Fi access. iRobot haven't released the code because it's a selling point for new Roombas, so you'd have to write your own. You could either use a Pi directly on top with a camera attached, or use the ESP to stream sensor data to an external machine and have it drive the Roomba via Wi-Fi.

The battery it came with was a dud so I bought a replacement battery. There’s two main problems I’ve noticed so far. Now it moves and vacuums at least, but only for a couple seconds. I’ve had it charging all day, I start it then a few seconds later the light turns yellow and it tries to return to dock. I’m sure I could put the dock in a sturdier spot, but regardless of where I put it, the robot doesn’t seem to be able to dock itself. It just bumps into it and pushes it around, like its spinning to try to line up the metal charging connector things. It charges just fine when I put it on the dock myself. 

1. Acts like its on low battery and returns to dock 8 seconds after I start it, even though its been charging all day.
2. Can’t mount itself onto the dock. Just backs up and tries again and again. Earlier today I let it keep trying for half an hour. 

I hope my explanation is enough info, I tried to post this with a video but it wouldn’t post. The robot has successfully vacuumed 2 square feet of my carpet. Any advice would be appreciated, but I won’t be too torn up if it’s just garbage. Thanks!"	1	['Away-Ad-8053: Well I’m not at all familiar with this type of Robovac/ model, , But first off did you make sure the contact points were clean on the charging base and also on the bottom of the vacuum or whatever it makes contact? And the replacement battery was it a factory battery from The manufacturer,I can’t tell you how many counterfeit Roomba batteries I’ve come across! Also is there a reset procedure after you replace the battery on this particular unit? Try removing the battery and holding down the power on button or whatever controls the device to vacuum. Usually that will discharge any capacitors and the like. And that works on a number of different types of electronics. A.k.a. did you try unplugging it and plugging it back in? LOL “ from the IT crowd “ But basically today’s day stuff like that actually still works.']

Here is one of the service repair kits I have been working on.

One of the issues many Roomba owners contend with is charging problems.

This is often caused by the charging contacts on the Roomba over time getting scratched and worn. The scratches retain oils, acids, and dust, which interferes with electrical connectivity.

To solve this, repeated cleaning of the contacts is necessitated. But eventually, over time, the contacts reduce or lose their ability to conduct electricity.  And usually, the contacts on the Roomba need replacing, which is about a 1.5-plus hour job. Used and New contacts are available on eBay, pricing from 20.00 to over 60.00 for the pair.

Owners can see the results of the contacts beginning to fail as the Roomba slides back and forth on the base trying to make a connection. Sometimes the vacuum backs up off the dock and tries multiple times to charge.

To easily solve these types of charging errors, I created pure nickel conducting covers that fit right over the top of the defective contacts on the Roomba.

To install, the person removes the black bottom cover and pops these covers overtop of the defective contacts of the Roomba. When the bottom plate is installed, the new covers form fit and are held on by the bottom cover of the Roomba.

It takes about 10 minutes for virtually anyone to fix their Roomba charging issue. And if these covers ever wear out, they can be popped off and a new set installed. The main contacts of the Roomba always remain in their original condition.

I chose nickel as it is highly resistant to wear and corrosion (so they will last a long time.) This metal is reasonably hard and is an excellent conductor of electricity.

Here is the YouTube link [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pen-\_p426ZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pen-_p426ZE)

More details are below the video

For the past year or so the only way to connect to it from the app was to -after initially opening the app- disconnect my mobile device from WiFi and then reconnect. After that the app would connect to the S9. Super strange!

But it seems like I just fixed it by adding a WIFI extender. It just serves the Roomba. I have a laptop that's in the garage twice as far that don't need no stinking extender.

So it has a wimpy WIFI radio or antenna.

I still don't understand why the magic sequence worked and I'm not a stranger to networking. I suspect their code has really stupid timeouts. Either that or the app makes multiple connections to the vacuum and one attempt to connect blocks another. It's interesting that when ""we can't connect right now"" we can still show the battery level just fine.

I just got a Braava after using different Roombas for years and so far I’m pretty happy with it.

I live in a penthouse surrounded by a tiled and partially covered terrace. It’s 800 sq ft and mopping it can be a nightmare. 

My question is, is it ok to put the Braava outside to mop? 

It does get quite a bit dirtier than the floors, but I would use a separate wet mopping pad for it."	3	"[""Miata_GT: As long as you don't leave it, or the base, in the elements I don't see why not."", 'Matt_NZ: If the area is covered then it will probably be ok...but if  all it sees with its camera is open sky then that may present issues with navigation', 'michellllllllllle: Turns out you were right, dud a half arsed job and the app kept giving me “Reading the room.

I’m a long term iRobot user, but I’m curious about the s9’s reliability in 2023.	19	"['Zestyclose_Thanks_10: I originally purchased the S9+ December 2020. It was having issues and was replaced March 2021 and has ran flawlessly since then. I have no complaints.', ""Ennkey: Just bought a new battery to extend the life! Honestly the only problem that I have, which is not unique to the s9, is that the rollers get torn up very easy and need constant replacement. I wish there was a 'permanent' roller like with my standup vac"", 'BQuest911: I’ve had intermittent issues for past year+. Semi resolved with placing tape over the cliff sensors. Probably 3 years old. Replaced rollers 2x and battery 1x.', ""Matt_NZ: I've had mine since the end of 2020 and it's been great. The only complaint I'd have is that the OEM wheel tread wore out really quick and that it goes through side brushes a lot quicker than the i7 I had previously. \n\nMine usually runs while we're all out at work so it has no problems cleaning my house unattended."", 'draxula16: Great to hear!', 'Away-Ad-8053: You have to clean the caster wheel regularly on all of the models also it can cause all kinds of issues!', 'draxula16: Wow, I’m assuming you’ve had it for a few years now?\n\nDo you buy third party rollers by chance? While they may look similar, from my experience the rubber compound just isn’t “right” compared to the original iRobot ones.  \n\nHow does the noise level differ with the various modes?', 'Away-Ad-8053: Those are issues that can be attributed to the tread on the tires being worn down also. i’m not gonna let the tread on my s9 get that worn down as bad as I did originally after the tread is 50% gone I’m going to replace the tread again. Plus it’s much simpler after you already done it once!', 'draxula16: Great to hear! How’s the noise level? I have a Neato (RIP) that’s still going strong, but it sounds like a leaf blower. It cleans incredibly well, but that’s been my only gripe.', 'Away-Ad-8053: Yeah I’ve had wheel tread issues with mine also. But you can buy aftermarket wheel tread like from AliExpress. I find if you remove the spring from the Roomba tire module it makes replacing the tread easier I fumbled around with it for about 10 minutes trying to see if I can slip it on the rim of the module and it seemed A lot simpler after I removed the spring. I do recommend having some hemostats if you’re going to do the spring removal , But before you do that. Take an X-Acto or one of those little disposable ones you get at the craft stores for like $1.99 make a slice on the old tread and take your hemostats or whatever and start peeling it back and cut the little rubber tabs that are on the rim until you get to the last tab and then make sure the surface is completely smooth and clean of any little rubber dimples you might have missed And then you simply slip the New ones You don’t need to add any kind of adhesive or anything they fit pretty snuggly, at least the ones I bought. And if you have a 3-D printer you can find the software online, and apparently make your own. I think I bought four sets of tread for $11 and that included shipping, But shipping is slow it usually takes over a month for me Using AliExpress. I did a little research after the fact and I could’ve gotten them a little cheaper but I’m pretty happy with my aftermarket tread. And roomba’s 500 through the 900 series they all seem to be the same size anyway I’m pretty happy with the S9 it does a better job suction wise than my other units. And I’ve owned them all except for the latest one The “ j7 combo “ The mechanics of it looks kind of delicate to me and might possibly start breaking down faster than other models. Plus the bin on the combo doesn’t have as much space in it for dirt since it Has to give up some of that space up for Water. And if you decide to go with the S9 definitely get the Automatic dirt disposal system it’s absolutely worth the extra money in my opinion the lid on top of the S9 it’s pretty flimsy .Another thing when you wear down the tread on the S9 it affects a bunch of other stuff also like docking and can also damage The side brush and brush motor and slows down The efficiency and causes undue wear and tear on other parts also.', 'Ennkey: I have indeed, first run of them i believe. I had to warranty it twice, but they extended it after the second time and it didn’t have an issue after that. \n\nI’ve bought third party ones and the original ones, the third parties shred faster but the roomba ones are twice as expensive and don’t last significantly longer in my house', 'Away-Ad-8053: The S9 automatic dirt disposal charging base sounds like a jet engine at full throttle, but after a couple of months my cat got used to it and stop sticking on the roof of my home LOL! But you can also trigger it with the app if you have a cat and I’ve used it as a warning device when she starts getting into stuff like going behind the TV LOL!', 'Matt_NZ: Tbh, if you want good cleaning from something the size of a robot vac then the trade off is noise. The S9 is the loudest Roomba, but it does also have multiple suction levels so you can quiten it down.', 'draxula16: Haha I’m not to worried about the noise emitted from the bin considering it doesn’t last too long!', 'draxula16: Eh it’s honestly not a deal breaker considering I typically run the Neato when we’re away from home.', 'Away-Ad-8053: Well I definitely wouldn’t be running it in the middle of the night if you live in an apartment LOL!', 'draxula16: Haha, fortunately not! I’m grateful that the base uses bags (the superior filtration system) unlike the dreaded shark IQ. \n\nWould you say you’re happy with your s9’s cleaning performance and reliability?', 'Away-Ad-8053: Yeah for the most part, it gets corners a lot better than my j7+ and has better CFM and I like the careful drive feature. It’s a tossup between my S9+ and my J7+ I had an older dog and he was going blind I he would do his business inside the house sometimes missing the pee pads, plus he was  senile I finally had to have him put to sleep at 18 years old. And my i7+ would pick up shit and smear it around the house, not only that but when it would go back to the base it would suck it up into it , And you would have to disassemble that little tube on the bottom of it and clean everything. Usually about one and ahalf hours for the base and Roomba to clean up! LOL So basically now I use the J7+ and the j9 and I hate these model numbers they are all too similar, and when you’re dyslexic you have to really think about it LOL So if I mixed up some of the model numbers I’m sorry. PS I’ve got a very hairy dog and a cat and I live in a very rural area with tons of mud leaves and debris LOL And I gave the i7 to my son and he’s very happy with it, Before that unit he had a Roomba 675 I gave him when he was a kid.']"

Almost every time, if I pick up the roomba, put it back on the base, and then start the job again, it works. Absolutely nothing changed, I just started the job again.

I have replaced the filter. Twice. No change in behavior.

I cleaned the bin. No change in behavior.

I cleaned the contacts/sensors in the bin. No change in behavior.

I have cleared the brushes. No change in behavior.

I cleaned the filter I replaced. No change in behavior.

I opened the base to check for clogs. No clogs. No change in behavior.

I opened the roomba to check for clogs in the vacuum. There were none. No change in behavior.

I cleaned every sensor with a microfiber cloth. No change in behavior.

I replaced the bag in the base, because maybe it's full or something. No change in behavior.

Hey guys. I've researched more than I'd like to admit and still confused on what to get. My house is 60% hard floor, 40% carpet. Own 1 small dog. (never poops/pees in house. Just sheds a little)

Features I'd like to have:

1. Be able to spot clean a section of the house from the app. For example, if kitchen bar needs clean, I can spot clean a specific part of the map from the app.
2. robot avoid objects in floor. IE underwear/clothes, shoes, etc. Also want to identify on the map areas that robot can't go/bump into.
3. auto dispose bin would be great but not absolutely essential.
4. built to last. They are expensive and I expect it to last 10 years+. Only plan to buy extra brushes and battery replacement etc. down the line.

Roomba J7 pros:

1. better carpet cleaning, object detection for small objects like cords. Apparently roborock isn't as good as J7 bc it doesn't have camera. Easier to get replacement parts?

Roomba cons:

1. for price of q5+, doesn't have feature #3. Supposedly still has horrible mapping (bumps into objects all the time like the old school roomba did/do?). Doesn't use lidar.

Roborock Q5+ pros:

1. better mapping, more features. value for price (feature #3)

Robo cons:

1. doesn't clean carpet as good due to dual brush.

I'm leaning towards the roborock. Seems like most people agree it's significantly better overall. I think the only reason I'd go roomba is for better carpet clean and maybe easier to get parts down the road. I'm torn and would love some help.

It helps with with picking up little things but cant really handle the big room and misses a lot stuff. I know it was never designed for a big classroom. Trying to find something with better navigation/mapping. Way too many options. I thought about refurbished and marketplaces. J7 series are too new for big discounts and there are a lot of i series ones like the i1, i3, or i7. Not sure how important map retention affects  navigation. Maybe even the 900 series since I cant use the app anyway.

The 2nd reason I want to upgrade is the the brush rolls to the rubber ones. Brush rolls get too much hair stuck.

I guess I am limiting my options to 980, i3, i6, i7 versions.

Update: Ended up getting a 980 on offer up for $80. Going to be running tests to make sure it works.

Update #2: Loving it and the price feels like a steal. It was used, which to me is evidence of its hard work. I didn't replace anything, just cleaned the filter, it was dirty. Had to wipe it down. Rollers seem good. Surface did have some grime but I was able to clean most of it with wet wipes. Set it up through hotspot (schools dont like roombas on network).

* Replaced filters

Problem:

My robot will start cleaning, get a full bin, then go back to it's home base and just pause the job. It wont even attempt to empty the bin, then sends me a message saying to empty it. 

The empty bin button is not present in the app and since I have a toddler the child lock is on... so I either have to cancel the job, hit the empty bin button, then create a new job OR manually empty the bin.

A while ago i downloaded the Irobot app on my andriod, works fine. Now I tried it on my iphone 13 pro, IOS16. Did everything according to the steps. Now the problem is;

On my iphone 13 pro, it is flickering between ""We cant connect now""  and what is says when it is connect, so it is connected. To make it even more clear, on my andriod phone it says ""Ready to clean"". So it flickers on my iphone between; ""We cant connect now"" and  ""Ready to clean"". And when my Roomba is cleaning, it flickers between the text ""We cant connect now"" and the text is says on my Andriod... And it just keeps flickering, giving me options and then the options are gone... While on my andriod it just works fine..

&#x200B;

Note: I already did those steps, no need to mention it;

1. Hold 10 sec on my robot to restart.
2. Restart router
3. Restart phone
4. Reinstalling the app
5. Reboot the robot

Solved: The problem was a date/time issue. On my iphone the date/time wasn't set on automatically. I had it set on manually. I changed this to automatically in ""**Settings > General > Date & Time**"". Now it works fine, atleast for now.

Also to notice, I hope this was the cause of another bug and that this is solved too. The time difference on my iphone was without my knowing, +8 hours. It just showed on thhe left corner the time i was in, so i thought it was fine, but somehow it wasn't.. However the difference was +8 hours.

I've accepted the fact that I'll have to clean the sensors on both the charging base EVRY TIME IT RUNS other it won't charge. Which, if you ask me, completely defeats the purpose of an robot vacuum. Additionally, after cleaning the sensors, I physically have to adjust the vacuum on the base so it charges. After doing so, it will show as charging on both the robot and in the app. Problem is, after a minute or two, the robot will adjust itself as of it's not comfortable, then I'll get the solid red ring and the message in the app saying the battery is too low.

It happened the first time today on a dark floor mat, so I moved it to the wood floor away from the mat.

It still got the error, so I cleaned the cliff sensors.

It still got the error but then said it needed the bin emptied (likely because debris shifted when I moved it and made the bin sensors react).

I went ahead and put it on the base to empty.

I then tried sending it to a different room, which has no mats, just open wood floors.  It made it to the room, then stopped in the middle of cleaning with the cliff sensors error again.

Currently using a Shark Rocket upright, and it's not uncommon to have to empty that thing 2 or 3 times during a vacuum session covering 800sq ft of hard surface floors, and no carpet anywhere. No indoor pets. 

I live in the rural desert,  and having a house that gets heavily dusty fast is just a fact of life out here.   The 2nd problem is that a LOT of tiny pebbles are constantly getting tracked in from getting caught in shoe tread. It's like a daily Lego minefield despite a kid having never stepped foot in this house 😅

Given that I can fill up the Rocket bin so quick, and I presume that thing is considerably larger than the bins in these robots, I was thinking I should probably get one that has the self empty dock bin, but then I'm also wondering if it gets largely negated by just letting the robot do its thing daily rather than my generally bi-weekly vacuuming?"	69	"[""axisblasts: Wouldn't buy one without it.

We have a iRobot Roomba i3+ EVO (3550), Self-emptying, and are moving into a two-story house. We haven’t taken it out of the box yet so will be setting it up for the first time there. I’ve been able to confirm that since it has room mapping it can learn to clean multiple floors, but what about the emptying needs? With the self emptying base on only one story, will it stop when it needs to be moved back to the same floor as its base? I work from home and am happy to babysit it and do that as needed. We have a husky mix and cat 😄 Thank you!	5	"['drizzle_R: The i3+ is only able to store 1 map. You will not be able to use room specific cleanings on both levels.\n\nAccording the emptying : it will just stop after finishing the job and returning to the starting point.', ""Martine_V: I have a split level, so it's not ideal for robots, since they have not yet learned to go up stairs.\n\nI'm pretty sure it will stop and tell you it needs emptying.  Once you manually place it back on its base, you can use the app to empty it.  It won't automatically empty itself if you place it back on the base manually.\n\nYou might find it easier to just move the base upstairs when you are doing the upstairs floor.  Unless the floor is quite small.  This is because it will go back to recharge if the battery becomes low, recharge itself and then resumes. Even if your battery last for an entire run, as the battery life decreases, this is going to happen sooner or later.  Bringing the base along with the robot is less hands-on. And of course, it will automatically empty itself.  You could just do this on alternative days.\n\nYou would be better off eventually getting one robot per floor.  Keep your eyes on sales.  There is usually an amazing sale around Black Friday.   I got my (4th robot) last year at 50% off.  You don't have to stick to iRobot.  Lots of other companies make get robots.

With the D7 I always had to pre clean before I could send it off to clean. But with the j7 I can just send it and I never worry about it getting stuck. It’s only had an issue once with a sock. But compared to my D7, the j7 is infinitely more reliable. It also handles tasks better. If I needed to clean multiple, specific rooms, I had to wait for the d7 to complete one, return home, and then I would have to schedule the next room. And that only happened if it knew where it was. My d7 was constantly having errors where it couldn’t go to a room because it thought the base was moved and it couldn’t recognize where it was. I cement taped the base to the floor so that it absolutely never moved, and the d7 would still have that error. It reached the point where I never used targeted room cleaning because it could never leave the base. Not sure how the j7 does it, but I can move that thing around and it always knows where it is. 

Love that it self empties. Love how it avoids obstacles. Love how reliable it has been. Love the Alexa integration. 

Wish it was D shaped. Mopping works well but It’s a bummer that I have to physically refill it. Not always great at funneling debris into its rollers. 

But a lot of what I don’t like doesn’t matter because I use it all the time now. Unlike my D7. Really love it."	3	['channelsurfer61: I still have a semi working D7 and a fully working D3.

I've tested if they can detect drop offs of much greater height which they do. It seems like these cliff sensors aren't sensitive enough for 2.75 inch distance. Does anyone know what is the sensor they use?

Have an i4 that I bought years ago but just started using and it is perpetually telling me to empty the bin after every use because the dirt/dust skips right past the bin and gets clogged in the vacuum itself. Often times, there is more dirt in the vacuum than the bin.

The kitchen  and dining room are separated by a baby gate that is rarely left open. When we vacuum, I just place the Shark where I want it and it is no big deal.

I'm looking for a robot vacuum for a small duplex house with 2 floors (around 60 square metres per floor) and would like it to be a Roomba. My local store is currently having an outlet sale for a Roomba 976 for less than 300€.. Is 976 still a good buy in 2023 or are there any other models in similar price range which would be a better buy? And since it's an old model - any danger of Roomba 976 being discontinued in the next few months/years and me being locked out of potential replacement parts or even Roomba stopped working altogether? What are your past experiences with discontinued Roombas?

Would I need to move the rug, run a mapping job, and then run a separate mopping job to get it to mop that area? Or is there a better way to tell/force it to do so?

Mostly trims the edges in/out a little each run. There is no need for a mapping run. If you permanently moved a rug, the bot will delete it off the map given a few passes over the area.

The reason this is happening in virtually all cases is that your Roomba's fan motor (due to too much resistance) is not able to spin the fan blades. In numerous repairs, I found that the electrical motor usually works fine. But the motor simply cannot overcome the start-up resistance of the rotating shaft and mini-flywheel that spin the fan. 

 The object of this service kit is to reduce the fan motor's start-up ""friction"" by installing a new “high-speed micro bronze bearing --- this replaces a plastic washer"" and adding “two - new low-resistance mini washers” onto the metal fan motor shaft.

Our downstairs level is approximately 1800 square feet and I will attempt to list all the issues this unit has had since new.  Keep in mind I'm very handy and can usually work through technology or mechanical problems.  Luckily replacing parts for me, which has been a constant with this thing, isn't hard.  I can't imagine somehow that isn't even slightly mechanically inclined ever having the patience to continually fix this thing.

1. Unit constantly misses finding the dock and instead stops in the middle of the room running it self out of battery trying to dock.  I've tried different dock locations, I cleaned the charging sensors, I've cleaned the eyesight on the unit, I've cleaned the plastic that collects dust on the dock that aids in guidance, I've rebooted and on and on. 

2. Lots of parts replacements.  Look, I get it, parts wear out, but for over 2 months I was having issues with the robot just stopping in the middle of a job and refusing to restart.  It gave me error codes and I contact Irobot multiple times for a fix, only for them after 4 phone calls to tell me the vacuum motor/fan module needed replacement.  Two years and a $60 part failed.  This is in addition to all the other consumables it needs.

3. It refuses to listent to keep out zones, which leads to it getting stuck under furniture, and scratching the hell out of its top surface.  Why the hell are keep out zones a thing if it doesn't listen?!

4. Spent over $50 trying to find the best bumper system so it won't get stuck under furniture...  Why doesn't Irobot offer a fix for this?  Well, my guess is they would tell you to set up keep out zones... HA!

Their app is full of bugs and is always slow to connect.  At least 3 times a week I'm dealing with a new and or existing issue that rears its ugly head after I thought I had it fixed.

I can't believe they sell these for $700 and are so god damn unreliable.

Anyone else deal with this many issues?  I just can't comprehend that the average homeowner would continue to put up with the constant headache that is the i7."	5	"[""OGbugsy: I bought the flagship S9 bundle back in 2021 and they've had to replace 4 times.

If it's a few years old then it is worth following a guide to remove the bumper off the Roomba as they can build up a lot of dust in there behind there that can interfere with the docking process.\n2. How many hours have you built up on it? At the end of the day it's a vacuum that bumps around into things. Parts are going to need to be replaced. I think the better thing to look at is that they provide parts to replace - most other robot vac companies do not provide parts other than the consumables.\n3. What lighting conditions are you running it in? How does the tread on its wheels look like? If they're starting to look like slicks then this can have an impact on it being able to locate itself.\n4. What did you spend that on?"", 'HiCZoK: It’s really bad. I especially hate that you can’t make a zone to map out. You always need to Marie a new map if you change something.

They built up significant name recognition, which is a good thing for them, because as the years have passed, they have gotten more and more over their heads and that name recognition is all they really have left. As time goes on and quality continues to suffer, that name recognition will turn more negative and eventually they'll have nothing left and one of their competitors will buy them out for pennies on the dollar in a bankruptcy settlement."", 'aaron4mvp: I’ll take a look at the wheels and front bumper. Don’t remember seeing any info about those two items online. I’ve read a ton on the iRobot website for troubleshooting. Lighting conditions seem fine, it’s in a room with plenty of windows, but the issue now is, it doesn’t finish cleaning it’s assigned zones until after it’s dark out. Maybe I start it earlier in the day, but my wife works from home in the mornings so it’s a balance. \n\nUnit has 800 hours on it.']"

Or does price really mean quality?	gamecat89	7	12hzdyt	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/12hzdyt/do_i_just_have_a_defective_unit_or_does_price/	"I read about Roombas and decided to take the plunge last year. I think I just purchased a poor unit - but before I decide on the next steps (buying a new one or a regular vacuum), I wanted to check-in. 

I have the Roomba i2 - which I believe is an Amazon-specific one. The issue is that it is just dumb. It has probably not finished a job in months. I have cleaned it, replaced parts, etc. It always says it needs to be emptied when nothing is blocking the sensors or dirt. It regularly gets stuck - running into bar stools, refrigerators, etc. 

It will sometimes just stop in the middle of a room and sit there, saying it is stuck when nothing is around it. It has issues finding its base - even when in the same room. 

It has become such a pain that I just want to trash it. I mean, if I am at home and can essentially lead it to room to room - open floor plan - it is fine, but otherwise. it just leaves entire wide spaces, etc.

It loses wifi connection like once a month -even though no other smart device at my place does.

Is this a challenge with other models? or a case of you get what you pay for?"	19	"['Matt_NZ: How big is your place? The i2 is a very basic Roomba so its ability to navigate is limited and doesn\'t do well in houses/apartments with more than a few rooms.

The S9 also has a ""careful drive"" which means it will avoid touching any furniture.\n\nSo yes, the more you pay the better the experience is.

My Roomba 960's side brush motors keep failing.  
The original stopped spinning and I replaced it with another part from iRobot. Brand new, sealed in original box etc.  
Worked for about 1 month, then stopped.  


Got another one, this time a random brand, the cheapest I could get. Ran for 3 months, started spinning slower during the 1st minute of cleaning but slowly built up speed to normal, then eventually stopped when the cleaning started the next day.  


Got another one, random brand, pulled it apart and filled it with grease, put it back together with the screws just barely tightened to make sure there is minimal internal resistance. Same symptoms: 3 months later, it started spinning slower until eventually stopping.  


I took apart all of the motors, they are clean inside: no hair, or dust or anything that would explain these symptoms and it definitely isn't motor fatigue since I clean the Roomba's rollers and side-brush of hair at least once every two days, specifically to avoid having to replace the side brush motor or cause it any stress.  


Am I the only one having this issue? Could someone please recommend a side brush motor they've replaced and has worked for more than 3 months? Thank you."	2	"['Davers18: I’am not sure if they use brushless motors?

Roomba 500 series	MBmax001	1	12grow0	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/12grow0/how_to_solve_this_roomba_500_series/	Hi, I've a question. This old roomba 520 was used a lot until the grears of the brush box broke. I put the roomba in a safe place and I didn't use it for months. Later, I ordered on amazon the new brush box and some other things such as the tyres and the filters. I decided to deassemble it (not the motherboard and the sensors, I let them in the chassis) and clean and polish everyting. Everything was good. Changed battery, changed  brush box and tyres (eveything was Irobot original) and when I try to start cleaning... It didn't!!! Tried everything, even put the old brush box and old battery but nothing. No sign of moving. Here([https://youtu.be/27KuVGUu-c8](https://youtu.be/27KuVGUu-c8)) you can see the self test of the roomba and I don't know the real problem. Even the wheels don't works (I tested the pieces on a different roomba(620) and they works ). Any idea? Can I try to solve this without spend money to change sensor or mobo or the only solution is to use this as a parts changer for other roombas?

It seems the issue is that when it docks itself at the charging base, it's not getting seated in the proper position (the charge light on the base is not coming on).

If I manually push the vac to move it forward a cm or two, it will start charging.

Clean Everywhere has the vacuum deciding in what order to tackle the rooms and big shocker, it isn’t the most efficient route let alone the route most useful or least disruptive to you.', 'RTuFgerman: It should go back for recharge and continue after it.', ""Alfred_Chicken: If you select all rooms, it won't look for new areas to add to the map, but if you select clean everywhere, it will look for new areas to add.

The only problem I have with this method, however, is that Roombas don’t seem too keen on vacuuming in between or in their way to different rooms when set like this. They seem a bit “too focused” on cleaning the specific rooms individually, as opposed to cleaning every room as a part of a single floor plan. So when a Roomba happens to pick up things like a tablespoon of loose grains from the kitchen floor and crosses a threshold it has already vacuumed before (like a rug in the dining room) on its way into another room (or to empty its bin), the bump from the threshold causes it to “leak” some of those grains along the edges of said threshold. And because Roomba is so focused on traveling to and cleaning specific room individually, it will not return to clean the mess it made in between those rooms, unless you specifically tell it to clean these specific thresholds individually. Whereas when Roomba is set to clean “everywhere”, it will usually clean “everywhere” - including the areas in between the thresholds as its traveling between rooms.\n\nBut that just gives me an idea: set Roomba to clean every room, and add a “Clean Zone“ in between each room - or wherever you’ll have a threshold. Add those “Clean Zone” thresholds you’ve created to the job - maybe towards the end of the job. That way, as Roomba travels between rooms, it’ll be sure to collect whatever mess it accidentally makes while crossing those thresholds.', 'Douche_Baguette: Yep, if you\'re happy with your map and don\'t want it to get screwed up, you shouldn\'t pick ""Clean Everywhere"".', 'Alan_Smithee_: How do they map?

Since the software update on Monday the 3rd, my remaining i7+ will return to the dock, not be able to figure out how to dock and end up dying (low battery) 4-5' in front of the dock, facing the wrong direction.

Considering how widespread this issue has been, it's clear that iRobot/Amazon is doing minimal testing and not paying attention to feedback when doing their software rollouts.  It's sad to see what happens to the market leader when they sit back on their success and allow the competition to overtake them.

(and yeah, I rebooted both the robot and the docking station as well as deleted the map and the scheduled job last night, hoping that that would address the issue)

**EDIT**: So, I tried again but this time watched the robot trying to dock.  It was as if the clean base wasn't visible to the robot.  I power-cycled the clean base and the robot immediately found it and docked.

Note, I just power-cycled the clean base yesterday, so this appears to be a chronic problem with the clean base.  I think I'm going to try to swap out clean bases and see if that addresses the issue."	31	"['RTuFgerman: Mine reestablished proper docking after getting 22.52.5.

In this day and age of people ripping out all of their carpet, who wants to manually refill a tank halfway through a cleaning run?!  My S7 MaxV Ultra can do my entire first floor and still have a full tank left.\n\nOf course, none of this considers the horrible job iRobot has done over the past 12-18 months with the software updates to the platform.  It's clear that iRobot OS has been extended too far and is past due for a rewrite with modern features built into its core.\n\nUntil iRobot announces a robot that, features-wise, exceeds those being offered by their competition, I won't be buying another of their products."", ""Matt_NZ: I guess we have different priorities when it comes to a robot vac. My primary priority is its ability to clean because if that part is shit then that means I'm going to be manually vacuuming still. My S9 puts a big tick in that box. \n\nLidar mapping and real time map updates are not a concern for me - lidar means a hump on the top that prevents it getting under lower furniture. I really have had no issues with my S9s ability to navigate my house so I don't see what advantage lidar would give me.\n\nI also don't want a combo vac/mop robot. I'm waiting for a dedicated mop robot that has something like a microfibre roller that also sucks up dirty water as it goes. Something like those powered stick mops made by Bissel but in robot form.\n\nSo yeah, there are newer bots with fancier tricks than my S9 but at the end of the day, none of them can clean like my S9.""]"

Hello, I'd like to add some details that I assume may be part of your follow-up:

\-- I have read all of the documentation on the website and within the app-- All rooms are well-lit every time I have tried to create a map-- I have deleted maps multiple times, and factory reset the entire unit multiple times, including very recently.

Thanks, I hope there is some way to resolve this.

# <Mar 6, 2023, 12:51 PM>

Hello,

I thought it might help to see a video of the issue, so I posted one:[https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/11kjmmt/my\_roomba\_s9\_has\_never\_even\_been\_able\_to\_complete/](https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/11kjmmt/my_roomba_s9_has_never_even_been_able_to_complete/)

As you can see, the robot is fully capable of rolling up on to the rug from multiple angles.  It has many solutions it can choose, and it often does.  However, during all full mapping runs, it always finds a way to get stuck in this exact manner.  As the video shows, VERY RARELY it'll chose to exit this ""doom loop"" of continually crashing into the wall, but often time it just goes red and fails.

Thanks for any help you can provide.

Hello, thanks for the response,

The link you shared is broken - it gives a 404 page saying ""Oops! This page was collecting dust."".  But yes, I have tried all of the suggested help file guides. Yes, I have fully cleaned the robot multiple times. This video shows the most common issue I'm having:[https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/11kjmmt/my\_roomba\_s9\_has\_never\_even\_been\_able\_to\_complete/](https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/11kjmmt/my_roomba_s9_has_never_even_been_able_to_complete/)

Once this happens, the robot will often ""loop"" in this failed action forever until the red light comes on.  If this occurs, it also seems to add bizarre ""hallways"" into the resulting map.  As a result, I've never really had a working map, nor a working Roomba, ever.

The best I've done is to literally walk behind the mapping run, as much as I can, for the 2-3 hours it takes to map my ground floor. Even then, this robot will drive head-first into walls, creating map problems.  You are correct - I can create ""keep out zones"" for those errors.  In the past, I was able to babysit a whole mapping run, then create many keep out zones, and run the Roomba.  The problem is that this forces it to skip nearly 50% of the ground floor of the house, making it a fairly useless item.

The info you requested is below:Phone number:mePicture of the bottom of your Roomba - attachedPicture of the place where the issue is happening - attached,but this problem occurs in many different rug-to-wall interfaces throughout the home.A short video of the robot experiencing the issue (as I was not able to open the one you have attached) - does the attached link work better?[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qBFJ-VRo4Ah-egf1iihqSXCj0rDknuEG/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qBFJ-VRo4Ah-egf1iihqSXCj0rDknuEG/view?usp=sharing&authuser=0)

Thank you for your response. I hope you are having a great day. 

I have investigated the situation and came to the conclusion that it is best to do a replacement of the side wheel modules with new ones. Our warranty has a coverage of 12 months, and I see on your account that you have made your purchase over a year ago, which means that you are not covered.

Here is a link to our website where you can purchase a new one, if you want:

Also, please note that the right wheel module is currently out of stock. I do not have any further information when it will be available. I suggest you to look for it in one of our Authorized Retailers:

Hello, 

Unfortunately, this suggestion does not make much sense to me.  The Roomba s9+ works fine on perfectly flat surfaces, and ALSO on carpets.  The wheels themselves have no problem performing any tasks.  

As demonstrated in the video, the problem has nothing to do with the wheel's ABILITY to traverse surfaces.  The problem occurs when the robot runs directly into a wall, over and over again, even though it is fully capable of getting ""unstuck."" The result of this syndrome is one of two options:

1. It drives itself into the wall, then backs into the rug, repeatedly, trying no other options, until the red light comes on.
2. It does this same cycle, but after several attempts, it simply does something different, and is able to continue the run.  This is what is shown in the video.  However, it will usually just re-enter the loop of #1, thus never completing a full run, ever.  

This really seems to be a logic problem with the unit, and I cannot imagine how the wheels would be involved.  Again, the wheels work fine on all surfaces in my home, that is not the problem.  

Any other ideas? 

\- <ME>

Hello <ME>,

Thank you for your response. I hope you are doing well. 

I have investigated the situation, and I came to the conclusion that since the side wheels are not causing the issue, the rare caster wheel might be. I suggest you to review the following article in order to resolve the issue:

* [Roomba® s Series: How do I clean the Rear Caster Wheel?](https://homesupport.irobot.com/kA03h0000002MPa?name=20981&language=en_US)

The URL you provided is a broken link once again: ""Oops! This page was collecting dust.""I have cleaned all the parts according to all of the help articles multiple times, in hopes that the issue could be improved on my side. I recently removed and cleaned it again, just to be sure.  Again, I have no idea why you are recommending wheel fixes.  The unit works fine on floors.  The unit works fine on rugs.  The unit simply ""gets confused"" and fails to complete its runs, every time.  The only solution is to create no-go zones for over half of the house, which is clearly not good.  However, IF I SKIP ALL of the rugs that are this exact distance from walls, the run CAN complete just fine. Once again, also, the robot is 100% capable of exiting the situation. I'll say again that I show this in the video. However, the robot will inevitably RETURN TO THE SAME SPOT and continually bash into the wall.  Or it'll exit and choose ANOTHER SPOT to continually bash itself into the wall.  Am I being unclear in my description of the problem these multiple times I'm explaining it?  It's confusing to me that we are talking about wheels... 

# <Mar 28, 2023, 6:38 AM>

Hello <ME>,

Thank you for your response. I hope this email finds you well. 

Regarding your question, I want to inform you that the issue your robot has been experiencing, means something is causing the side wheels to spin, but the robot is lifted enough that it will not move. This is the reason why I suggested you to check the wheels. 

Since none of the steps provided did not resolve the issue, the only thing I can offer is purchasing a new robot. If you decide to buy a new Roomba, please let me know, as I will be able to provide you with a Promo Code. 📷

I will be waiting for your response, in the meantime, if you have any more questions or need additional help, do not hesitate to contact me again, I would be pleased to help.

Is there any escalation option here? This is quite clearly a navigation / software issue. If you watch the video I provided, yes the wheels spin, but ONLY in that single orientation.  The robot can free itself easily.  However, the software and navigation obviously re-visit that location again and again, until failure.  Blaming the wheels seems like you are not actually looking at the video I sent?  Perhaps related, a simple online search shows that MANY users are having issues with the current firmware 22.29.6.  You have never addressed this either.  I'm honestly interested in your answer to this question:  What exactly would buying ANOTHER robot do for me?  Are you saying that a new robot might not choose to fail in the same way?  Why is that?

Hello,

Without any specific personal malice, I do not feel that this thread has even begun to address the actual issue I originally sent.  Suggesting that I either ""buy new wheels"" or ""buy a whole new unit"" implies that you didn't even look at the problem shown in the video, nor the descriptions I sent by email.

For a top-of-the-line product costing over $1,000, this level of response is quite disappointing. I'm not sure how else to express my frustration, but to state it plainly: this thread has made me feel MORE negatively motivated about this entire brand and product line than before it began.

cleaning all the sensors

factory reset (twice)

is my robot really dead?  And if the i3 is having such problems why should I believe the more expensive ones are better?

I have a Braava M6 for a couple years and have been vacuuming manually before using the M6 to mop. My master bedroom is carpeted so from day one it didn’t make the map run, I have to carry it every time if I need to have my master bathroom cleaned. 

Recently, I bought an S9+ and had it mapped my whole house including my master bathroom and I was able to share this new map to my M6. However, the S9+ was defective, it‘s bouncing up and down on my carpeted rooms, it‘s making grinding sounds when turning and it just can’t dock. So I returned it and bought another S9+, it won’t dock AGAIN but without the other issues. I’ve already done all the troubleshooting with both S9+ but nothing helped, so I returned both. My M6 can now go pass the carpet in my master bedroom and mop my master bathroom but I still want to get a robot vacuum to save myself some manual labour(Yes, I know the M6 won’t go over carpet was because it can get dirty water onto carpet). 

Aside from the issues and really noisy, the S9+ cleans really well and I like it a lot! Should I just ignore the fact that dirty water can get on carpet and possibly dealing with more defective issues but just get another S9+? Or get the J7+ Combo so I can use it to safely clean my master bathroom and the rest of the house but it might not be as clean compared to the S9+? 

Thank you in advance, I really appreciate all your advice."	10	"[""Matt_NZ: If you have carpet, the S9 is really the only Roomba that will clean it well. When you say you had docking issues, what were the issues? Where did you have the dock positioned?\n\nThe main reason the S9 is the better option for carpet is that it has high suction and dual rollers. However, the Roborock S8 is the first non-Roomba to have dual rollers with high suction. In theory, it also should do a good job with carpets but it hasn't released yet and there's been no proper reviews showing how well it actually does compared to the Roomba S9. Like the J7+ Combo, it also has a mop that retracts when dealing with carpet areas.\n\nSo yeah, if you want mopping and vacuuming, it might be worth seeing how well the new Roborock S8 works. The one thing Roombas still have over Roborocks is that they know when their bin is full and will empty mid-cycle - a Roborock will just keep vacuuming until it needs to recharge, which can mean diminished cleaning if it was full for half the time it was vacuuming."", 'jay9055: The J7+ is not a good substitute for either the S9 nor the M6.

Never had issue docking with the M6 in the same location or any location at all.\n\nThe 2nd S9+ I had was doing a great job on carpet, only thing is it won’t dock. I got both of them brand new from Amazon and I read that many people have the same issue caused by an early model defect. If I do go for the S9+ again I’ll probably buy from Harvey Norman or The Good Guys this time and cross all my fingers lol\n\nFor the Roborock, the release could take way longer for us in the southern hemisphere:(', 'Melon178: Thank you for your advice!

It's possible your Amazon ones were returns that the Amazon seller has just tidied up and sent back out again.\n\nWith the Roborock S8, I'm not sure how delayed it will be here.

I emailed them about the 2 I got from Amazon and took them 10 working days to reply😒\n\nYes, I watched that video after reading your comment, so are you looking at replacing yours with the S8 when they release it? Just curious', ""Matt_NZ: It shouldn't be any different if you got one from Harvey Norman vs the official store. When I got mine it was only sold through the online store tho.\n\nI don't intend to change to the Roborock as my S9 is great and isn't in need of replacing.

I have an infuriating problem with my Roomba i7+ whereby every 56 seconds it decides to leave its dock then redock. I know the timing is this consistent as I have logs from Home Assistant.

So far I have tried replacing the battery (this was necessary as I didn't have time to look at this for a couple of months during which time the original battery died); cleaning the contacts on the robot and home base (including machine polishing) and having iRobot push a firmware update (22.37.1). None of this has helped.

When iRobot pushed the update it wouldn't work because of the redocking behaviour. I therefore tried using speaker wire to connect the home base charging contacts to the contacts on the robot. Instead of connecting the wire to the bottom of the robot's charging plates I tucked it inside the front folded part of the plates. The robot consistently took a charge without redocking when I did this, so I suspect that the charging contacts on the robot are ultimately to blame despite all of the polishing I have done.

What's irritating me is that I'm fairly sure this started happening when 22.29.3 was pushed to my robot. I'm wondering if iRobot reduced the robot's tolerance to charging fluctuations.

All of this is a long winded way of asking if anybody else has experienced a similar problem and, if so, how you resolved it?"	10	"[""lumberjack5500: I occasionally have this issue or another similar issue where the robot is quietly driving forward on the base even though it's already docked.

I purchased a Braava M6 recently, and I have a couple of questions :

1) One of the few negatives (for me) that I've noticed so far has been the tight scraping against my painted wood doors when turning along their facing . The sounds I'm hearing sound like paint scratches , or possibly scraping .

I'm a ""do it yourself"" kinda guy, so my first thought was creating some form of soft rubber (or rubber like) bumpers for the Braava, as on it's front -- not even it's full front -- it just has a hard rubber stripe .
So I was thinking about upgrading the front with these . Thoughts & alternative suggestions ?

https://www.amazon.com/SoftTouch-Self-Stick-Non-Slip-Surface-Grip/dp/B000SL0KJC

2) My second issue is that it has a pre programmed zone around it's base that it doesn't want to clean automatically .
In a small room (where I keep it) , that makes a noticable chunk of flooring -- so what I'd like to know is if it's possible to shrink or eliminate this artificial 'no-go zone' ?
I understand why it's there, but it doesn't make sense for it to have room to fit & clean next to the base, and it just doesn't do it .

Thanks again !"	8	"['Wasaab: The foam idea would work and I did just that to all my Roombas and My Braava M6.

&#x200B;

The layout of my home is strange. I'm having issues creating accurate cleaning and keep out zones because they snap to the designated map orientation. I've attached an image to explain the situation better.

&#x200B;

How can I create zones using a different orientation than the one I set the map too? I've already tried to change the map orientation, but when I make a new zone, the orientation snaps to match the other zone orientations. I'm using a j7 and an m6, if that matters.

I've had my roomba j7+ for about a week or two and it eventually mapped my downstairs storey (where it's base/bin is) fairly well. Now I want it to map my upper level and it never gets it quite right. I find the app quite clunky and not intuitive to use, with little in the way of help or tutorials. Mapping runs of the area have not been successful in creating an accurate map, nor has the 'vacuum everywhere' function. Also it's annoying that it often runs out of battery or needs emptying mid-way through trying to map that upper storey, and then all progress is lost (it says 'job paused' but by the time it's recharged it says 'job cancelled'). Anyone know how to resolve this? Many thanks	0	[]

I have remapped everywhere, factory reset a few times too.

Essentially 40% of the time it eventually navigates to the correct room. The other 60% of the time, it travels two feet, does a weird 360 turn, then travels another two feet, completes another 360 turn and continues on to the target room.

Is anyone else experiencing this? I’ve checked the sensors and hardware. At this point i believe its a software issue.

1679811801.0	25-Mar-2023 23:23:21	After 20 years IROBOT finally lost me/no warranty on 1 month old replacement BRAAVA	ZealousidealSpite741	16	122d8ug	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/122d8ug/after_20_years_irobot_finally_lost_meno_warranty/	So we splurge on the Braava Jet a bit over a year ago.  Within very few uses (over 6 months maybe 10) it started not charging.  It would have the red light circle but no charge.  Eventually it did not charge or register the bot.  They send a new base.....same issue.   They eventually send a whole new unit to me,  minus the battery.  Within a month the EXACT same issue started happening with the new one.  Same base.  Same Unit.  Etc.  They connected to the app and said the battery was fine and elevated the issue.  In the end I was told that because it was a warranty replacement it was not covered.  The thing worked for maybe 4 washes?    These things used to be bullet proof and they stood behind them.  If one broke they sent a new one and solved the issue.  On a un related note.....       Quite a fan of our new Shark products.	26	"['airoscar: Braava is pretty useless, unable to detect carpeted areas reliably, navigation is worse than regular roomba, gets stuck a lot.

But here’s my question: They told me I needed to factory reset the old Roomba and send it back to them, and to save my smart map during the factory reset process so I could import it with the replacement. I did that, but now that I’m setting up the replacement I don’t have an option to import an old map like the support article indicated (and like the rep told me I would). 

Is it hidden somewhere? Do I have to start a mapping run for that prompt to appear? I did the factory reset via the app like suggested, but I just don’t see the option to import my old map.

So far, it has performed well, but the one issue I can see is wall edge cleaning.

The  flooring is laminate with quad or scotia along the  skirting board.  The Braava comes up to the quad and bump up to it.  No problem there.  It then reverses back and then bumps up again and mounts up on the quad,  which I would presume would trigger its threshold climbing system, and avoid the edge completely.  In the bathrooms with tiles, there is no quad there, and the Braava hugs the wall edges nicely.  
Is there anything I can do to get the Braava to get up to the wall edges to clean with the laminate flooring?  
Attached is a photo of hallway showing the quad.  Thanks

It is a normal apartment with normal activity.  Hard floors.  I have had the Roomba for about four months and I would say that I regret buying it.

Issues are as follows:

1. Most jobs it fails to dock itself after the job and needs to be reset.  Yes I have cleaned the contacts etc.
2. It is very noisy.  Yes I have cleaned the various wheels and rollers etc.
3. Sometimes the bin won't empty and this has to be done manually.
4. The various wheels, rollers and brushes are continually getting tangled with hair.  Roomba is not capable of dealing with hair.
5. It gets stuck on anything it can possibly get stuck on.  Loose cable?  Stuck.  Low hanging furniture?  Stuck.  Table and chair legs?  Hopelessly confused and stuck. 
6. It has not successfully learned the map of the apartment yet and still keeps smashing into walls etc.
7. The various consumables - bags, rollers, brushes etc., do not last long at all and are expensive.
8. It was over $500.  For this price you can buy the highest spec Miele vacuum cleaner which will outlast a nuclear attack.  Whereas everything about the roomba feels flimsy.  I very much doubt it will still be working in five years
9. It takes literally hours to complete the job.  You need to do a 2-pass job to really clean properly, and this will take about four hours including returns to base and recharging.  That is a lot of noise and disruption if you are home - and you need to be home because it needs babysitting.  Vacuuming manually takes about fifteen minutes.
10. I have my doubts about the company's ability to protect my privacy after the leaks of video taken by roombas in people's houses.

On balance, and this is the most important part, I spend more time working on fixing and resolving issues with the roomba than I would just doing the vacuuming manually every day.  I don't mind doing maintenance so long as it's significantly less than the non-automated work.  

It's not 2005 anymore, it's 2023 and this thing has gone through multiple iterations, is still expensive, and still can't do the job properly.

My question is, does the j7 need a constant wifi connecting to be able to map, or can I just hotspot from my phone to get it started and let it do its thing?"	2	"[""Zhilvi: Yes, it will work fine on a hotspot. I don't think it even needs an internet connection, just wifi. I used mine in such fashion recently. *Edit: I used it to clean as I was packing up, it already had an existing map. It will probably map but then fail to save the map for future use if its not connected to internet when the run finishes.*\n\nHowever there is one big catch with setting it up. Changing the wifi that the bot uses requires your phone to be connected to the same network or the app will error out that your phone is not on wifi. Obviously, if the phone is the hotspot, it's not on it's own wifi.\n\nSo to set up the bot you will need to set your hotspots name+pass to mimic the router the bot is already connected to(if your phone allows), or use multiple devices.\n\nI used my windows laptop to make a temporary hotspot, win 10 and up can do it straight from the wifi settings. The whole setup: the laptop was connected to my phone's hotspot for internet, sharing this connection via it's own wifi network that mimiced my old router. The bot connected right up.""]"

If your J7 Clean Base or Home Base code ever gets damaged or scratched, the J7 won't be able to find it. iRobot won't sell you a replacement sticker, and they'll only replace the docks under warranty, which is a paltry 1 year. HOWEVER....the codes are just 7x7 grids called ""[Varjo Markers](https://developer.varjo.com/docs/get-started/varjo-markers)"" AND they're very easy to reproduce in Excel or any other program where you can make a symmetrical grid and fill the squares w/ black.

I have sized it so it easily fits on old style (e/i/5xx/6xx/7xx/8xx/9xx series) docks which are available on the cheap (like the below image) simply print on regular paper and use double sided tape or print on a sticker. Placement is [as shown in video](https://youtube.com/shorts/AQP0lfeQOzY). The J7 might take a minute to figure it out but it DOES work!

This has other benefits if you have a J7 and need multiple docks for a big house or docks for multiple floors - just buy old docks and print the code.

When we first got it everything worked as expected. Didn’t ever really have issues. Now, less than three months later, I consistently have technical issues with it. I’ll push the start clean button, nothing, push it again, it’ll light up, but nothing. After a third, sometimes even fourth or fifth time pushing the button it’ll actually start and begin cleaning like normal. Can’t use my Google assistant to start it anymore, Google responds that the vacuum has started, but the i1 has literally no response. I have to manually push the button numerous times for it to go. Sometimes it’ll stop mid cleaning and just glitch out and have a spinning ring light. At this point I have to manually hard reset it to get it to work again, which takes a good 5+ minutes. Sometimes it’ll finish cleaning and doc itself on the clean base then just glitch out and leave the ring light turned on solid. I then have to force reset it yet again. Sometimes even hard resetting it doesn’t do anything. I’ve already had to contact support for a replacement side brush module, and a dust bin, again less than 3 months of owning it. Every week I have to disassemble all the rollers and bin and pull out wads of hair stuck in the rollers, otherwise when it transitions from the tiles to small rug in the living room it’ll leave behind trails of hair balls.

Just wondering if anyone else out here has one, and if they have any tips on it?

I bought it because it was cheap, and saw that it had some smart integrations, which I thought would be neat.  

Turns out the app download for it is only available for ""older Android versions"", and I don't have an iOS device, so i'm out of it's app.. and even if I were to have it, if it requires a server, the servers are probably dead.  

In any case, though, it really does seem to do much better than my many years old pair of Neato XV-21s.  I haven't tried the built in mopping function yet, but if it performs anywhere near as nicely as it does vacuuming, it'll probably take over most of the utility from my cheapo Roomba mop vac too.  

Anyway, it's really quiet, it manuevers better than my Neatos, it seems to suck up a lot more than the Neatos.  The only downside I've found after 3 days of running it throughout my house on both floors, is that the Neatos are better at getting through issues with cords/wires... which means i need to spend some more time getting my house's cabling mess fixed and get the network and other wires off the floors, or covered by a proper cover where not possible to take it off the floor

He doesn’t have potty accidents so that’s not an issue. I read the s9+ has much better suction but that it’s an unnecessary amount for hardwood. Does the j7+ have enough suction to do the job well? He also spills his water quite a bit, will this ruin the vacuum if it goes over the small puddles he makes?

Don\'t get me wrong, it still picks up hair, just not all of it, and the stuff it leaves behind is somewhat annoying.\n\nWe also have some entry mats (those heavy duty black ones with the square ridges) that it again cleans well, but leaves more than I expected it would in the crevices. Though to be fair, even our upright vacuum takes some effort to get down into those!\n\nThe j7 has other benefits over the s9, even if your dog doesn\'t have accidents (ours doesn\'t either). The j7 has obstacle avoidance using the front camera, so it can see and avoid things the s9 simply can\'t. Real examples from our experiences:\n*the rib bone our dog got out between the time we left and the time the Roomba got to the living room\n*the sock that got pushed under the bed\n*the laptop charger I thought was far away enough from where the Roomba could get, but clearly wasn\'t\n*the cables under the bed that you can\'t quite reach to fully secure to the wall\n\nThe obstacle avoidance to me is more valuable than the better section and carpet cleaning. I have wished for the increased cleaning performance of the s9 and sometimes wondered if I made the wrong choice, but then am reminded that I made the right choice every time the j7 avoids an obstacle I didn\'t realize was there.\n\nRegardless which one you get, DEFINITELY get the ""+"" version with the auto empty bin. It\'s a game changer.\n\nEdit to add: the puddles won\'t be great for any vacuum, but they also aren\'t a death sentence. If your dog is somewhat consistent with when they drink, you can try to time cleaning around that. Ours doesn\'t drink much between breakfast and the afternoon, so we normally run ours then. She is also a sloppy drinker :)\n\nI try and do a quick walk around before I start the Roomba to look for puddles like that. Especially if you have a tray that will catch most of the water, you\'ll be good. Worst case, add a keep out zone around the water bowls. You\'ll have to manually clean that small area, but almost guarantees the spilled water won\'t be an issue']"

i bought my j7+ January 18, 2023. first of all, i love it.. but when i set it up, it was running 22.29.3. it installed that on January 18, 2023. that was released October 10, 2022. 22.37 came out in November, yet the robot installed october's update.. in January. 22.52 was released March 1, 2023. it's March 21 and my j7 is still running 22.29.3 from october 2022. 

i contacted iRobot and requested they push the update to my robot. after a few back and forth emails they just want to send me a service bot. has amazon destroyed this company that much or is a whole new vacuum really necessary for a software update? kind of strange for what, an $800 machine. meanwhile hundreds of millions of iphones can all update on the same day in a few minutes. makes 0 sense. 

has anyone figured out a way to get their j7 to update beyond 22.29.3? i've seen some improvements i'm missing out on and that would help it do it's job much better.

I recently bought the j7+/m6 bundle and it does OK, each robot has its faults/bugs, but for the most part they do what they should. I'm still under the trial period and saw that the j7 Combo was on sale and has a 90 day trial, so I bought one and hoped to trial both setups side by side with the intention of keeping one over the other. Support says it might be defective and I'll have to return it and they'll ship another, but not sure I want to even spend the time/energy on it now. Anyone else have this issue on day 1 with a Combo?	24	"[""Zhilvi: What is the issue exactly? I've seen a few that prevent mopping:   \n1) does it fail to lower the mop entirely? Swings the mop in/out a few times, errors out. If so, likely a defective unit  \n2) mops a tiny area, randomly stops and moves on to only vacuum for the rest of the job? Probly a FW bug, a reboot 'fixes' it for a while. Hasn't happened since mine grabbed 1.4.8 FW.  \n3) behaves like a braava + j7 pair? This is a weird one but happened to me a few times. When starting a job, app shows 'ready to mop' instead of 'ready to vaccum and mop'. In this state, you can send it to mop but it will only vacuum, additionally it will briefly show or get stuck on 'wet mopping' status once it returns to the dock. Seems to be a bug with irobot backend corrupting the job logic. Your favorites remain corrupt, must be deleted and recreated + reboot the robot to fix.\n\nbonus 'features' I've observed:\n\nbonus 1\\*) navigation while mopping is god-f-awful. Only workaround I've found so far is to make overlapping cleanzones so that you can schedule a vacuum-only pass before mopping. This way it seems to properly pre-plan navigation around obstacles for mopping. Despite doing double the work, it still takes less time to clean my home this way.\n\nbonus 2\\*) initial mapping of the house must be done without the base, otherwise the map is pure garbage. The way it avoids going near it completely ruins the map (diagonal, misaligned, phantom walls, etc.). Throw the base in the deepest corner of your attic and only bring it back out once the map is locked in. Also never do another mapping run/use clean everywhere option as it will immediately taint the map and you'll have to start from scratch.\n\nPutting it lightly, my j7 combo was extremely quirky during the first week until it downloaded a FW update for itself and the base. After that it's been ... functional. Definitely not amazing. Took damn near a month of constant experimentation and dozens of map remakes to reverse engineer the idiosyncrasies of this thing. Now it just works...  \nDefinitely not recommened for anyone who's not into tinkering."", ""markus1028: the M6 has about an 18 month life then you can throw it away because it's impossible to get tires for it.

I did notice that the base and an extra square foot around it is avoided when it vacuums. Since I want to plug the mop next to the base when I get it, I also want to do a new mapping run. Can you explain the steps to mapping so that way they don’t avoid that corner please? After the mapping run, do I plug the base back in while it’s blue and trying to return home?\n\nAlso I’ve noticed that after a mapping run the layout is perfect with every room, corner and angle. But when I create the borders and separate rooms based on those corners and i send the unit to clean a certain room, it cleans that room but also cleans parts of others. For example, my entry way is straight then if you make a right turn you enter my bedroom and immediately to the right you enter my bedroom. The map shows that there is a wall there from the mapping run, i’ve separated my bedroom and bathroom to 2 different rooms, but when I send it to clean just the entry way it ends up coming around the corner to clean a portion of my carpet and hug the wall of my bathroom.\n\nI know this is a lot but you have some good information and tips on these products. I hope you can find time to respond. Thanks', 'wack70: I am referring to the Combo in the title which is the vacuum+mop (2-in-1) robot. I also bought the bundle deal which is the j7+ vac robot and the m6 mop robot bundled as a deal. So are you not having any issues with the caking on of dirt/debris in the brush roll housing & vacuum port? That was one of the issues I wanted to see for myself. This review mentions it:\nhttps://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxh2Wx8_jELkm8xhYT1E3eYfWVWAfQ2WzJ', ""Zhilvi: It drips the water out really slowly, the pad doesn't even get obviously wet to the touch for a while. Is yours completely dry, especially the drip nozzles?Mine takes a good half a room before the pad is damp enough to even begin leaving a few streaky marks on the floor where the drip points are located.Not saying your bot isn't DOA, just that the water flow is not even comparable to the braava."", ""Zhilvi: Mind you, these are just observations from my experience toying with the thing.   \nFirst off, you will never get it to clean right up to the base unless irobot changes something. There is a hardcoded keep-out circle around the base, presumably to avoid the bot pushing it. To me it seems like the deadzone itself is just a few inches but the robot will stop and turn around if *any* part (inc. sidebrush!) of it enters this zone. As a result, the bot will never clean roughly it's body's width around the base. If the stars align, the bot's pathing lines will bring it right along the edge of this zone without touching it and it will clean within few inches around the base instead of the foot or so. You can kinda finetune this pathing by trial and error with small cleanzones around the base but i3 doesn't have them unfortunately.\n\nRegarding the map, the bot maps the walls by doing an edge pass and following them. The fact it will pull off the wall to avoid the base seems to break the 'im following a continous edge' logic, mangling the map. Alcoves or any otherwise complex geometry is mostly ignored within multiple feet around the base and get progressively more scuffed over time, generating slanted walls and ignoring doorways. Worse yet, it seems to trust its map around the base over reality and it will distort the entire rest of the map to fit its garbage in. An immediate symtom is the bot driving at a slight diagonal instead of perfectly parallel to walls, harsh bumping into furniture legs and missing wedge shaped sections in the middle of rooms (because the entire map got distorted). \n\nFrom my experience with the j7, to make a proper fresh map, hide the base completely away and unpower it. Don't start the mapping run from the base, instead place the bot on its own somewhere in the middle of a room and align it the best you can to be parallel with a wall. This initial direction seems to remain set in stone, the map forever keeps this initial alignment for the 'along' and 'across' directions. The map you see in the app seems artifically straightened out, you won't see a slight slant in the app but it seems to prevent the bot from properly cleaning or will cause the rooms to be randomly sub-divided into tiny chunks instead of being covered in long, straight passes whenever possible. Do a few mapping runs, customize your map if its good (this will mostly freeze it). Then put the base down wherever you want it, put the bot back on it and finally send it out to clean some specific area. It will simply add the base to the existing map. Using clean everywhere or doing a mapping run from the dock will start to corrupt the map by the same process as previously mentioned. However, directed cleaning of specific rooms seems to disable map updates and is the only 'safe' option once the map is good. All that said, i3 does not have a camera and I cannot guarantee it will behave the exact same:<\n\nFinally, the bot wandering a bit into other rooms while cleaning seems to be normal behavior due to how coarse the maps are. When it follows a wall during edge cleaning it really likes to cling to it. Usually it follows the edge through the doorframe and enters another room for a bit until realises it is *definitely* in the wrong area and wasn't, say, driving around a box placed by the wall. Then it just scuttles back to where it should be."", 'Chukwithak: I do get that, but it doesn’t prevent or stop anything and a Clorox wipe cleans it right up.', ""wack70: It cleaned a pretty large area and the floor behind its path is bone dry.

Sucks that I paid for expedited shipping to get it quickly so I’d have more time to trial both setups.', 'Zhilvi: I keep it on the normal flow setting. Eco might as well be dry and ultra empties the tank in a single larger room.\n\nI noticed it really likes to reverse over and suck up the water it just dripped when navigating in cluttered areas. Often it stops to think for a moment before doing a 180 or just driving backwards a bit. \n\nIt almost never behaves this way while vacuuming but does so constantly while mopping. A few times it managed to get stuck because it shoved the mopping pad under heavy objects while reversing. Once it even removed its own bin because it hit the bin eject while reversing. Have you noticed similar behavior?', ""Zhilvi: Best of luck with the replacement, but I still recommend staying away from the j7 combo if you can. It is kinda meh at mopping and, critically, it sucks up the water it drips. Most of the dust it picks up doesn't make into the bin, it gets caked on the rollers and the innards of the bot. \n\nMain reason is the awful navigation when mopping. When it bumps into  something, it tends to stop to think of a new route but keeps dripping. Then it reverses right over the puddle before driving off elsewhere. \n\nIt's a pain to clean out and, if I ignore it, this buildup just clogs the airway between brushes and the bin within days. Even with me dissassembling the bot damn near daily, the wet dust simply clogs the bin's paper filter within a few mopping runs anyway."", 'wack70: That’s really good to know because I watched a review on YT that mentioned the dirt caking issue as one of the cons of the j7 Combo. That was specifically something I was going to watch for when comparing to the j7/m6 bundle. I think you made up my mind & will just return it, and see if they’ll refund the extra shipping cost I paid.', ""wack70: So I have had the j7 Combo for a week now and have been running it while waiting on the replacement. I noticed in the app that the little water level indicator (squiggly horizontal lines) went from 3, to 2 and today it's at 1 line. I removed the bin and checked the water level in the tank and it's almost empty. So that means it definitely is dripping out the water but at a very low rate. I have 3 dogs that went outdoors this morning after it rained and they tracked in footprints. The m6 has had no problem mopping up their tracks in the past. I ran the j7 Combo on it and it actually might have mopped up some of the tracks, but nothing near what the m6 will do. Does this mean the j7 Combo is actually working fine but is terrible at mopping compared to the m6, or is it mopping as best as it can with a defect? I ran it on the high setting for mop fluid."", 'Zhilvi: That still sounds suspicious, my unit drips the water out rather quickly. Roughly 200/400/800 sq ft for ultra/normal/eco settings. Or approx 40/80/160 minutes to empty the tank from full.\nStill not even comparable to the braava though.', 'wack70: Well, the replacement arrives later today so I’ll be able to do a comparison. If that’s just how it mops, then I’m sending this thing back and sticking with the M6. At least until the Roborock S8 comes out next month.', 'wack70: Looks like the first unit was defective because the replacement one is definitely mopping, and I can see wet streaks behind it.']"

I have a ~three year old i7 with a clean base that seems like it's on its way out. (Needs manual cleaning of insides - clean base, takes hours to clean a 1000 sqft area). It's been run daily and deals with heavy duty dog fur. We're looking into parts replacement versus upgrade cost, but in the meantime:

**What's my best roomba or non-roomba upgrade if I'm buying new? Cost isn't a factor if it will save enough time/hassle.**

Needs:
- Auto emptying
- Handles medium pile rugs and hardwood
- Handles heavy duty dog fur (Great Pyrenees who sheds perpetually)

Ideally:
- Does its job quickly 
- Less easily confused by... everything
- Reusable waste bin parts for auto emptying

So, finally I found one fix that actually worked for me so I am going to share it.

First in your irobot app. My app version is 7.4.0. Press the top left button and navigate to account. Go to privacy and click on remove images from database and choose the option of entire history. You will receive an email later saying the images are removed from the database, but you don't have to wait for the email and proceed to the next step. 

Next, go back to front page of the app and scroll all the till you found product settings. Press on remove/factory reset ""you irobot name"". 

Then close the app. Go to the permission settings for the irobot app. I use android so I just hold on the app icon and press app info. Clear the cache and data for the app. Then go to permission and provide all permission. 

Next open the irobot app, sign in, pair with your robot. Then do 3 mapping run. After the first mapping run, it did request whether I want to do mapping run again. So did it for the second time. The map is already set by now, but I did it again for the third time. Then start the normal vacuum run. Now you should be able to see the obstacle review function working properly displaying images to review. I also find the mapping run to be more consistent and the dimension and shapes are better in general."	0	[]

An IR camera similar to surveillance systems for night cleaning would completely remove the need for a visible light on the newer Roombas - and greatly improve navigation in general. If they really don’t want to use LiDAR for some good reason, at least put a night-vision camera on the Roombas for better low-light performance.\n\nWhile a night-vision camera would definitely improve the low-light navigation of Roombas in general, the feature I imagine to be a real game changer would be some kind of “memory-based” navigation. Let me explain.\n\nRoombas are great and all, but sometimes the way they navigate really make you wonder just what their cameras are for (coming from i7 and, to a lesser extent, the s9, though not sure if things have improved on the j7).\nUsually they will navigate flawlessly in a pre-mapped area, but occasionally, they will, for whatever reason, take the longest route to the intended room, and then struggle to find their way back to the clean base as if they were blind - all the while messing up the perfectly fine map they already have. This is with the lights on. The thing is, even blind people tend to navigate better than Roombas. I know, “if only Roombas had LiDAR!” Problem is, iRobot seems to have some sort of reservation against using that kind of equipment, just like Tesla does with their “self-driving” cars. So we’ll work with that. If it’s a matter of cost-saving, then I think what I propose for Roombas would be even better, because theoretically, it can be implemented for all current connected Roomba models (provided that they have the necessary storage and processing power), and future Roombas may no longer need to rely on cameras so much (except for precise obstacle detection and avoidance).\n\nSo my idea is as follows: what if iRobot developed some kind of memory-based navigation to supplement the camera, where if the robot finishes a job, but doesn’t have adequate lighting or is confused about where it is on its way back to the clean  base, it can simply retrace its exact path back to the clean base? As in, “ok, I left clean base on a straight path, made a left here, and 30 seconds/10ft later at this speed, made another left and finished my job here. All I have to do now is turn around, make a right here, then continue at this speed for 10ft/30 seconds before making another right, after which I simply continue forward to clean base just up ahead. And if I happen to bump into something I can’t see, I’ll just work my way around it, but try to stick to the path I came from.” This is something humans, both blind and sighted do all the time, without relying on night vision anything. We travel into an unfamiliar location, we pay close attention to landmarks and the steps we take. If we want to return, but aren’t sure how to get back, we simply retrace our steps, using visual landmarks and our memory. If the power goes out in our house and we need to find our lights, we use a combination of the general floor plan embedded in our memories and our sense of touch to get around. I’d think robots should be more than capable of doing the same by now. If Roombas could do that and retrace their path back to the clean base down to the inch, they’d be much better at navigating in general.\n\nAt its most basic level, all a iRobot has to do is set the Roombas to create a temporary “mini-map” of the robot’s path, tracking its motion and speed the very the moment it leaves clean base to start a job. Then the robot has something to refer to when the sun goes down or someone forgets and shuts the lights off. This can eventually be expanded to remembering the exact traveling and cleaning pattern it took for specific cleaning sessions, so that if a person sets it to clean in a similar fashion but forgets to turn the lights on, the robot will have something to use as a backup and get the job done. I think something along the lines of what I’ve written would really help improving navigating in general, without the added costs of new hardware like LiDAR, or even an IR camera.', 'Revzerksies: An RC function where i can control the robot via the app. Maybe also use this function for mapping', 'Ooqu2joe: What would be the point of that?

It came brand new unopened, when i first went to clean the brushes it had the warranty sticker pre broken for me. 

It was working ok up until recently now it just gets stuck in loop where it drives a foot or two forward, starts up everything, ramps it down, and just repeats that. The app does nothing until you force reboot it. 

I’ve had robot vacuums before, i had the Electrolux Trilobite and that was miles better than this, even my S9+ is better. How did Neato mess up this badly???

I live in a country where these cleaning robots are very expensive, so I am looking for the most cost effective one that could solve my problems.

Roomba® j7 seems like the most advanced option in avoid obstacles, but it is expensive here.

Another option would be something like a Roomba i3 , but I don\`t know if it would be a big upgrade from my Ecovacs.

What you guys think? Should I pay more for the j7 to have peace of mind?

I’m new. I’ve had my iRobot i4+ since November of last year. I got it certified refurbished on eBay. 
Lately I’d been having troubles with it. The other day it wasn’t giving me the option to empty the bin, and I tried all the troubleshooting steps I could find online. 
Then I thought what harm would a factory reset really cause?
Well over 24 hours later and I’m still not connected.  I spoke with a really nice gentleman on the phone with their tech support and even with us working together to troubleshoot, I still couldn’t get connected.  My issue is now being escalated up. Hopefully they can help me get it resolved. 
Anyway, I’m not necessarily looking for any further tips (unless you have ideas I haven’t tried) but has anyone else had THIS much trouble?
I’ve made sure I was on the 2.4ghz and no random security issues. 
I restarted my router, rebooted/reset the actual vacuum several times. Reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, made sure I have the latest iOS (iPhone 14 pro max), unplugged/replugged charge station, confirmed through my Xfinity app and the tech agent that it IS actually receiving an internet signal…. Even though the app tells me otherwise. 
Oh I have not made a sacrifice yet. Maybe that’s it. 
But for real. I was this close to almost going out and buying a brand new unit today, out of sheer frustration.  
I’m sure I’m missing a handful of things I’ve tried. I’m emotionally exhausted."	9	"['AutoModerator: Hi OP! It looks like you are posting about the iRobot app not working.

That's even cheaper than their dumb (non-mapping) robots. It's never been this cheap. Also noticed in the US at Walmart there's a few hundred off the regular price too. Any thoughts that there might be a new roomba coming soon?

I've always felt that roomba's lacked behind the other brands like the S7 but now seeing the S8 I know that roomba needs to actually stop sitting on their laurels and make something innovative. The new J7 mop combo that was released last year should have been out like 8 years ago. By today's standards it's pathetic and this is coming from someone who has bought the J7 I might add. If I knew how good the roborock S7 was before buying Id' have bought that. Not only that but roomba's patent's are expiring now, so the only good thing I liked about roomba will no longer be proprietary.

1678725001.0	13-Mar-2023 09:30:01	My Roborock took a swim, looking at Roomba replacements (J7+ or S9+). Need advice	xcsdm	9	11qebzt	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/11qebzt/my_roborock_took_a_swim_looking_at_roomba/	"Due to a pipe burst and my Roborock in a puddle, I'm needing a replacement.  I wasn't thrilled with the Roborock, so I'm looking into Roomba as an option.

I really like the Select plan, especially the cost, but I'm concerned about the vacuum quality of the J7 vs the S9.

We have several cats, and they are known to vomit randomly.  I have never had an issue with robot vacuums.  I do prefer to run them at night, but I can create an automation to turn on the lights while the Roomba would be running.  The main floor is 60% hard wood and 40% carpet.

Now, for the real question.

I can do the J7+ through Select for around $1230 across 3 years, or I can do the S9+/Brava combo for $950.  I can add Protect+ to either or both and be at 1260.  The costs are pretty close.  Select includes supplies. The bundle includes mopping.

J7 with better obstacle avoidance, or S9 with better vacuuming?"	37	"['Chewysbro: If you weren’t a fan of the Roborock, your life is going to be miserable with a roomba', 'surrender0monkey: The S9+ was a horrible experience.  It shuts off for 1 month every Nov-Dec and the support guys don’t believe me.  I bought the brava mop as well.  The mop just squirts fluid and smears that goo around, never cleaning anything.  It literally just moves the dirt around and cakes the floor with scented cleaner.', 'changtse: We have Roomba i7+ and s9+. Not very happy with either (very slow mapping and vacuuming, getting lost all the time). Upgraded to Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra and we are much happier. S9 is indeed a bit better in carpet performance, but not worth the headache in navigation.\n\nIf you need good carpet performance, I would say wait for Roborock S8 with double brushes.', ""OGbugsy: My experience with the S9 has been terrible.  I've been through 3 replacements sure to software communication errors (31).  This is endemic to the series. The CEO of irobot has declared the S9 an evolutionary dead end.\n\nI would avoid right now."", 'bludstone: i own a top end roborock and a top end roomba s9+ and the roborock is leagues better. not even close.', ""jefferios: I've been using the S9 for about 2 years now. I'm happy with it. However, software development seems stagnant. I was thinking about jumping on the Roborock train this summer/fall with the new S8 coming out.  \n\n\nI wouldn't do the select plan as eventually you are throwing away money."", 'Matt_NZ: Personally, I would pick better vacuum performance over obstacle avoidance. I don\'t believe any obstacle avoidance system can detect pet vomit yet (at least, the J7 can\'t) so it\'s something you will need to be aware of no matter which bot you get. \n\nIf you have carpet, at the moment the S9 is the best robot vac you can get when it comes to vacuum performance. It\'s what I have and it\'s been doing a great job on my black carpet keeping the tan fur of my cat at bay (I run it every second weekday). \n\nMy cat has an issue with megaesophagus so he does ""vomit"" every now and then within an hour of eating, so I generally don\'t turn on the Roomba until around 2 hours after he\'s eaten. As crazy as this may sound, I also picked up a robot pet toy called ""Ebo"" that has a camera and you can remotely control from your phone. If I want to start the Roomba while I\'m away from home, I\'ll zip around the house quickly on my phone with that to check there\'s no landmines. My cat likes to play follow it around so it lets me see him while I\'m at work, too 😊 \n\nI really don\'t have any issues with my S9. I usually always start it while I\'m away at work and it\'s very rare that it fails to complete a job because it got stuck and needed assistance. It vacuums the carpet so well that I generally only need to manually vacuum around the baseboards every month or so as it can\'t get into those sufficiently. It takes it around 4 hours to complete the 160m^(2) space that it vacuums (nearly all of it carpet).', 'arafhunter: Do you really want to go from Roborock to a Roomba?

One cat, one dog, almost all hardwood, she has long hair that gets everywhere. I has an i3+. No pets, 90/10 carpet.\n\nI got her the j7 mainly for the object avoidance, but think I kinda wasted my money. We usually pickup before starting the Roomba so nothing really to avoid. Mapped the downstairs well and does a good job cleaning. Does well going over thresholds and thick rugs. She does nothing fancy with it just cleaning the ""entire space"". I do have to dig her hair out of the wheels from time to time put figure the same with all of\'m. \n\nI got an i3+ this year. Roomba complained the bag needed replaced after 3 days. It was indeed full and my cheap a$$ just emptied and reused it. I have some rugs with frilly ends that are getting frayed so I take those up before I start the vac. With that, I feel it has decent suction. I know the j7 is supposed to have better cameras and mapping features but my i3 does the job. I do wish mine had a few features like the ""no go"" zones. Irobot shouldn\'t have ""dumb down"" the software since the j7\'s big difference is the obstacle avoidance and the front camera. It could probably do the whole house (1300sqft) though I only have Roomba do a couple rooms a day. I usually move stuff like chairs, plants.\n\nI just got the machines with no special maintenance plan. Supplies and parts are cheap enough online.\n\nI think the performance between the 2 is similar.

The company sent me a new I3 but it soon starting having the same issues. I had it working pretty good but it got stuck on a shoe lace and now it often fails to connect, even after multiple reboots. Sometimes it will work but it's few and far between.

So I noticed that if you hit manual clean on the roomba it will clean and show in the app that it is cleaning?????? If it can't connect then why does that 
communication work? Often it will say it can connect but before it even moves off the charger to clean a selected room it will give a smart map error and turn red???

When roomba acts up and won't connect or gives a map error code, I now don't fool with it and it usually corrects itself in about 20 minutes. It's really odd - all of a sudden you hear that ready tone beep. I've had way less issues now. It went from being odd for it to work to now being odd for it not to work. I'm not sure if it learned something (they claim it does) after lots of cycles? I just know nonstop fooling with it didn't seem to speed up the correction process and it was super annoying. So now I just let roomba do its thing.""]"

The i4 connects to my phone  app (latest app version on iOS), and works for awhile, but repeatedly ends up in a ""unable to  connect"" state. The only resolution is for me to reboot by holding down  the clean button on the i4 for 20+ seconds. After a reboot, it will  reconnect with the app and work for a day or two before getting stuck in  a ""unable to connect"" state again. I have tried force closing the app  and reopening and also using the app on wifi an cellular. Even when the  app shows ""unable to connect"" I can still ping the i4, so it is not  losing it's connection to wifi.

I just impulse bought a used Roomba 650 for £90 (about $100) and I've had it for about a week and I really love it! I've always been terrible at keeping up with the vacuuming and the clutter and so far Albert (as I have named him)  is really helping me keep on top of it all. Very happy. 

Since it's a pretty old model, I also bought a replacement battery from a 3rd party on Amazon, but I don't actually know if the new battery needs to go in yet? It currently zips around for about 20-30 mins before returning to dock but can be run a couple of times in succession and I haven't seen a low battery warning since the first day when it presumably hadn't been used in a while and needed to do a full charge cycle. 

I'm happy with this for now, but does this sound like a more tired battery? Info online is a little unclear on this, with some confusion when you search for how long Roomba's run ambiguous about if they mean total battery life or a cleaning cycle. Also, are their other consequences to an old battery, if I put the new one in should I expect better cleaning performance for example?"	6	"['Alfred_Chicken: That Roomba estimates how long it needs to clean before returning to the dock (based on the estimated cleaning area size and amount of dirt detected). In addition, I believe that it will run for a maximum of one hour before trying to return to the dock and will try to return to the dock if the battery gets low.\n\nAs for an old vs new battery, the cleaning performance between them will be the same, but the bot might not be able to complete a cleaning cycle if the battery is too old and degraded.', 'TbonerT: I had a 650. How long it ran depended on the room. It was generally 30-45 minutes until it decided it was done.', ""MartianTea: I've had a 675 (I bought new ) for a little over 3 years. \n\nI replaced the battery about a year ago with an aftermarket battery that lasts two hours. The original battery is supposed to last over an hour, but Roomba was always lazy and would rarely clean more than 45 minutes even when new. I noticed as time went on the time went down a little so you could have lost battery life. My suggestion is to get one of the batteries that lasts longer because they cost about the same and it really makes a difference though Roomba still is too lazy to go over an hour on its own so you'll have to restart it schedule two cleans back to back. \n\nWhat could also be happening is the brush motor is going bad. I just replaced mine because I stupidly didn't realize not cleaning brushes often enough would wear it out. This was despite me hardly ever getting the error to clean out the brushes before it really broke. Then, I got the error after 5-10 minutes so it might be coming. Luckily, it was easy to replace and now Roomba is better than new thanks to the aftermarket battery. \n\nIf you have a lot of hair to pick up, I would clean out the brushes every time. You can cheaply get aftermarket brush replacements and just switch them out for a clean one if you don't have time to get the hair out right then. A lot of the aftermarket parts come with really great tools to get hair out too so totally worth the $$$ in my opinion.\n\nNB: the way I realized that brush motor needed to be replaced was contacting Roomba support. You should do this as they were so helpful even though I'm not under warranty."", ""KingOfTheHoard: Ah interesting, so a 20 minute run in a room with a bit of clutter it's bumping up against might not be unusual even on a fresh battery? Thanks!"", ""KingOfTheHoard: Thank you, that's good to hear. Sounds like my cleaning times are maybe a bit lower but nothing demanding an immediate battery swap."", 'KingOfTheHoard: Very helpful, tthanks']"

When when I place it on the charging base I get a white light on the base and the white light on the Roomba turns on and sometimes it will make the power up noise but not every time. When I go to the app it will show connecting, sometimes it will connect and show ready to vacuum and then all the lights on the base and the Roomba will turn off and I will lose connectivity almost immediately in the app. It will not stay connected long enough for me to do a factory reset via the app. I have tried rebooting it by holding down the power button for 10 seconds or so until it chimes but still seeing the same behavior. One time it connected long enough for it to say that it was uploading a map or something like that, but then it disconnected a few seconds later. Wondering if this is potentially a battery issue?

Honestly, I took a 2 or 3 month break from it because I grew tired of sticking my hand in all its holes after each run to clear out the dust bunnies. I understand that the iSeries doesn't have the suction power to not get clogged BUT I also think that the combo may have a unique problem wherein the innards get a bit wet from the mopping, which makes some dust stick to the plastic, causing the dust to further collect and jam up the system.

I've been trying to come up with ideas on how to make the underside of the rollers, and the tube that connects to the dust bin more 'slick' so that dust doesn't collect there, and moisture will not be as much of a problem/make it easier to clean out when it does eventually get clogged again.

Has anyone tried using some silicon spray/coating or something to make the under-roller area of the dust-bin tube more 'slick' and easier to clean? 

Have any other ideas on how to solve this?

FrancistheBison	2	11o0zze	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/11o0zze/roomba_j7_braava_jet_m6_bundle_vs_roomba_combo_j7/	"Hey all - I have 2 cats, dust allergies and a mix of hardwood, lino  and carpet.

I'm pretty sure I'm interested in the j7+ at this point but would also like mopping capabilities so I'm trying to decide between the combo j7+ vs a dedicated mopping unit. Right now the j7+and m6 is only $50 more than the standalone combo so price diff is negligible at this point.

Does anyone have any pros/cons to either set up? Are the mopping capabilities better on the m6? Is it able to identify carpeting reliably?

Any suggestions would be welcome.

Also wondering if it's worth it to purchased an add on warranty or if that's just money down the drain"	2	"['jdcoffman15: The problem you may run into with the M6 is that is avoids anything carpet at all cost -- so if there is a rug or carpet \'in the way\' of it reaching the non-carpeted area...it\'s just not going to work at all for you. Additionally, the M6\'s mapping is super old at this point so it does the old-school \'bump around and into things\' approach, and even if a rug/carpet isn\'t fully blocking its course - in my experience the mapping and obstacle avoidance isn\'t good enough to find that 12"" or whatever path that it theoretically *could* take.\n\nI Previously owned the S9+ and an M6. The S9+ is a great vacuum, especially on rugs and carpeting. Any I-series Roomba will leave dust bunnies on rugs and carpet because the suction isn\'t good enough \\[searching this sub will find a bunch of pictures of rolled up dust/debris that Roombas leave behind. People claim that if you run your robot 2x/day it will eventually stop leaving those rolled up dust bunnies, but who wants to listen to the vacuum constantly twice a day? Not me. \n\nthat said, I\'ve been reasonably happy with the J7+ Combo, just wish that it had the carpet/rug suction power of the S9. The mopping is fairly superficial but it definitely makes the my hardwood floors and tile look nice. It\'s just a bit more maintenance than I had hoped given the small water reservoir and the need to clean out dust clogs every or every-other time it runs.', ""FrancistheBison: Thanks for this info! Definitely lots of good points to consider. The majority of our house is hardwood with a few area rugs so all of the non-carpet areas are connected, and there's not that much carpet for me to be super concerned if I have to deal with the dust rolls. I'm way more concerned about the dust and debris and cat hair build up on the wood/lino floors. \n\nThe main reason I was shying away from the s9+ was the noise factor which it seems most people mention. We're home pretty much all the time so not something we could avoid by scheduling cleanings while were away. Also since we don't have a ton of carpeting I'm hoping that the j7+ is enough suction for our needs. I'm not necessarily trying to get something to replace vacuuming and mopping altogether, but really to keep things at a minimal level of dirt until we can do a real cleaning.  Gonna put it to the test and worst comes to worst we'll send it back and try something else. Thanks again for the insight it's super helpful.""]"

It then came back to an area it had already cleaned, and spent another 2-3 minutes cleaning it.  Map was unaltered after cleaning other than showing it skipped that hallway.

It appears while I was setting up a skeeball table thing yesterday roomba ran over a piece of styrofoam and there's bits around but he's no where to be found...  so the search continues. 

Is there some feature so when it gets stuck it saves the last location on the map? Why is it that I get a notification that he's stuck but it somehow drains all the batteries overnight so in the morning I can't connect and have it ring or something?

Map 1 is the main area where its home base is located, Map 2 is an adjacent room. When I want start a new job to clean the room in Map 2 will I have to pick it up and place it in that room then start the job in the app, or do I just place it in the room and push the Clean button on it? It's not going to be able to travel to/from the room due to the threshold so I don't see any other option. I wish that it could learn both rooms during an exploring run but it just can't get over the threshold to find the room. The thresholds feature is only good AFTER it has mapped out a room. What if I gave it a little nudge over the threshold when it's exploring?	3	"['channelsurfer61: Until I copied a smart map over from the cloud that was created by my J7, I also had separate maps for 2 rooms with transitions that stopped my M6 98% of the time.\n\nPicking up the Braava and pressing clean in those rooms worked fine.\n\nThe only benefit I found to having it use the shared smart map was that even tough I still had to pick it up and place it into either of those rooms isolated by thresholds was that I could add a zone inside the rooms that worked as the M6 knew it was in one of those rooms. Simply pressing clean led to it getting the job done, but without the benefit of zones. Once placed in the isolated room, you can start a job in your app to tell it to clean room X.... it will squawk at the end when it wishes to return to the base for recharging, but at least while cleaning in there it recognized the zone.  Getting stuck returning after the job is a  good reminder not to leave it away from home I suppose.\n\nThe alert shows as a notification on my iPhone and the Amazon devices say out loud that the M6 is stuck.\n\nOh yes, tried the nudge thing also, but in one of my rooms the wooden floor on one side of the transition is slightly lower than the tile floor on the other side.  This made it a one way trip. No really worth the efforts in my case and disabling the tilt sensor by putting a transition zone between rooms was a waste of time as the wheels are too small on the M6 so it is of no help.', ""wack70: >Once placed in the isolated room, you can start a job in your app to tell it to clean room X.... it will squawk at the end when it wishes to return to the base for recharging\n\nSo when placing it in the room and hitting the Clean button, after cleaning it will attempt to return to the base, or is it just alerting that it's done and needs to be taken back to the base?"", ""channelsurfer61: I found that when I started from the app., it meant that it used a migrated smart map; so that means it knows from that smart map the other rooms, including where its clean base or charging dock is located.\n\nIf I just carried the M6 in there and pressed clean, then it did what it could reach, didn't have any zone information, but returned to the spot where I had placed it and pressed the clean button.  That may be the preferable choice depending upon the layout and contents of the room in question.""]"

1678114053.0	06-Mar-2023 06:47:33	J7+ Combo performance	adhd_stocks	2	11k0ta9	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/11k0ta9/j7_combo_performance/	"So a couple of days ago my Neato D7 died and I decided it was time for it to retire. I did not want a Chinese vacuum with a camera in my home and while Neato did clean well, the connectivity and app problems made it hard to use it comfortably.

So I started looking for a roomba, and as I have a cat that leaves his toys out for the Neato to get stuck, I thought that the j7+ combo would be a great option. Both because it had a emptying docking station, bigger battery than the regular j7 and I thought the mop might be useful as I have about 90% hardwood floors.

But my experience so far is not that positive. I started by mapping the house, which took a really long time and the robot seem to navigate very violently and it had a lot of scratches when it was done. “Well, then it knows the floor plan really well then I suppose!”

Then I started cleaning with the robot and this was not really what I was expecting. The first real problem I found was that I set it to clean my kitchen, which it started. But then it kept going into the adjacent zone which is my living room, and did that as well. Very strange…

Well, I cancelled the job, sent it back to the base, redid the zone-lines and started the job in first the kitchen and after it returned I had it run in the living room again. When my wife came home she asked why I did not run it in the living room as there was piles of cat hair on our carpet. A bit disappointing to be honest.

Today I decided to give the robot a clean since I was very dusty on the front and around the side brush. After this I ran it once more in the living room. But afterwards I can still find cat hair along the edges of the carpet. 

Is there any settings I can use to make it clean the carpet more thoroughly?

Both times I ran the roomba on dubbed cleaning cycles."	2	"[""channelsurfer61: Besides doubling the number of passes each time it runs the only other two things to do are running it on more jobs per day and also cleaning the edges of the living room with a regular vacuum and have the Roomba maintain it.\n\nLike you, I have a Neato D7 and a D3 here and moved to Roomba due to the issues with the former. My D7 mostly works and when it does it is still an excellent cleaner with the exception of the tiny side brush that stopped working after the warranty ended. Yes, changed belts and even the motor but likely the motherboard is failing.\n\nToo many issues with some of the other brands of robotic cleaners out there, so I landed on the Roomba J7+\n\nIt actually does clean as well or better than my D7 ever could in certain ways. Sounds like it may be that your J7 combo needs a hand as mentioned and I hope that it will keep up once you have cleaned up the carpet to start it out fresh.\n\nOtherwise, people like the S9 for carpet cleaning and of course, besides increased suction it has the 'Neato' D shape with a much wider roller set possible with the design. I didn't go that route as aside from an entryway carpet mat, all is hard flooring here. Plus reports indicate that iRobot is not going to continue on with the S9 despite it being a good machine."", 'drizzle_R: your gone D7 is a more powerful vacuum robot (airflow) and in addition well designed bristle brushes are still a bit better to get hair out of carpets (the iRobot design is still very good).\n\nSo with the j7 the way to go is to do a manual deep clean of your carpets with your regular vacuum and run the j7 daily.\n\nIf the problem still occurs (this is still very hair and carpet dependend) you have to go for the iRobot s9 (but lose the camerabased obstacle avoidance) if you are searching in irobots universe only but there are only a few high airflow options available atm and the tendency looks like they are going to vanish (thanks to the mopping feature).']"

The problem presented itself as a vacuuming run that stopped after 6-10s and the roomba going from a white to a red ring light consistently and an error message in the i3 app. 
So I did some ShaininTM problem solving in which I applied a malfunction event strategy at robot to robot contrast (my in-laws have the exact same model, that was working fine). Component search with the known good i3 roomba concluded that the root root cause (RedX) lived in the main board (all electro-mechanical components from my bad robot worked well in my in laws robot while all components from my in-laws robot did not resolve the error in my robot). After putting all parts back in their original place I did do a complete reset and software update that did not fix the problem immediately that day. I sent the results to roomba in December 22 and then forgot about it for a while until a month or so later (Jan 2023) when I noticed the ring light to show green. Now it cleans like a champ (green ring light). I’m suspecting an over the air software fix did the trick. 
I never got a confirmation from roomba so I’m wondering if anyone else noticed the green ring light and knows what it means or disappearance of said error as of recent."	0	[]

There is also a permanent screen in the filter cup.  You can wash the dirt cup and screen.  Be sure you let that screen dry before you put the cup back into the Roomba.  Usually I go through 3 usage cycles (as shown on the app) with a filter before replacing it.  Typically you know it's time to replace the filter when you notice a small amount of debris left in the cup after the cup emptying.

NickHemingway	40	11h6xbv	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/11h6xbv/the_i7_just_lost_me_as_an_irobot_customer_its_sad/	"I bought the i7 Roomba for $799, that's a good chunk of money for a vacuum cleaner, but I had a 600 series for a lot of years that had worked really well, so it seemed a good investment.
 
28 months later to the day of activation the i7 died with a permanent ""stuck on cliff error"" I contacted iRobot support hoping they would be able to repair it. I am aware it conveniently died just out of warranty so am happy to pay them to fix the error.
 
Bear in mind, this Roomba only has to clean a 16ft x 20ft space that has very little foot traffic. It only fills the bag every 6 months or so. It has had almost no real use.
 
iRobot told me that the unit was unrepairable and my only choice was to buy a new one ether with a $100 coupon off or via their subscription service at full price.
 
This is an abysmal response not only from a customer service point of view but also environmental, they are expecting me to landfill a $800 vacuum cleaner that is only 2 years old & just buy a new one from them.
 
My old 600 series is still going strong & has been running daily for 10 years. I moved it out of the bedroom to replace the i7 while it was broken & the room is substantially cleaner. I hadn't realized how bad a job the i7 was doing until the old one did it properly.
 
iRobot has lost me as a customer forever. I would have considered their subscription service (until I did the maths) if the i7 had been repairable by them for 5 years. But 2 years & it's scrap is ridiculous.
 
Incidentally, the part to fix the i7 cost me $39 & took less than 10 mins to fit. So iRobot lost me as a customer for life for $39. Awesome business strategy guys. I would have happily paid $150 for them to fit on a factory repair service like other companies offer.

At work, my boss just got a Roomba j7.  It was working great, but then it stopped working one day.  We are guessing it is because corporate changes the Wi-Fi password every 48 hours or so.  This causes it to lose Wi-Fi connection and doesn't do anything.  Maybe we are wrong on our assumption.  So, my questions are:

Thanks!"	5	"['Fire_Hunter_8413: Sorry if these seem obvious, but here goes.\n\n\nWithout spending:\n\nAfter mapping out the full area, set a keep out zone in the app that stretches beyond the physical boundaries created by your 2x4s. This should allow you to remove the physical 2x4 boards.\n\nUse the app to schedule some weekly/daily routines. If you have a smart home, you can set it to clean when no one’s around, as soon as everyone leaves, or before anyone arrives. If you have smart lights and your bedroom is well isolated, you could set the lights to turn on and have the robot run before dawn, ensuring that the home is freshly cleaned for the day.\n\nUse the app to adjust settings on the robot, like suction power and none of passes (if applicable).\n\nSet up a smart assistant so that you can summon it to clean specific rooms with your voice.\n\nRegular (at least bi-weekly) cleaning of rollers and brushes to keep things in their best shape and performance.\n\n\nWith spending:\n\nGet the clean base. Band new, it’s totally worth it. Less time spent cleaning the robot, no back issues from bending down to empty the robot’s smaller bin, no dust flying around when doing the same, and its bags lasts a bit longer than iRobot’s 2-month claim.\n\nIf you are not interested in using the app, physical beacons may be a more elegant solution for your 2x4s.\n\nHope this helps!', 'dabamas: Hey there! Congrats on your i3 model. One thing you could do to make it better is to upgrade the battery. A higher capacity battery will allow for longer cleaning times and fewer interruptions to recharge.

1) is the price worth it?

Edit: thanks everyone for your comments and opinions! They're super useful!

It just vacuums according to schedule.  I would never get one without the base."", 'Fire_Hunter_8413: Totally worth it - the whole point of getting a robot vacuum is to lighten your load. Doesn’t make sense to get a robot that can vacuum on its own, but requires you to bend down and empty its bin more often than you would a traditional vacuum. Most robot vacuum bins are a third to a quarter the size of a traditional vacuum, so depending on the size of your house, you may end up spending more time cleaning the robot vacuum than you would a traditional vacuum. A self-emptying bin resolves this issue. Plus, it’s bags seem to last noticeably longer than the two-month period iRobot advertises (for me, anyways).\n\nI’d say get it if your budget permits it, but be wary of used/refurbished items.

Fire_Hunter_8413	1	11frdqr	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/11frdqr/before_i_begin_experimenting_on_my_own_has_anyone/	"I7 rollers = perfect! Hair always wraps neatly at the very ends of the rollers, making cleaning the rollers a breeze. Pull a couple of strands, and the whole bunch comes out all at once with very little effort.

S9 rollers = not bad to terrible. Hair almost always wraps tightly along the middle of the rollers, making removal quite the chore. Leave it in a little longer, and the hair begins cutting into the rollers, making removal even more difficult. At this point, I have to use a pair of scissors to cut them off and wonder if cleaning the rubber rollers on a Roomba is any better than cleaning the brush rollers on my Dyson.

But then I remember how wonderful the i7’s rollers are!

I’m thinking of experimenting with the rollers, pulling apart and switching things around to see if I can eliminate this hair tangle problem. But before I do, I was wondering, has anyone already attempted and successfully came up with a mod to the s9’s rollers that reduces or eliminates this hair tangle issue?

Can’t remember at the top of my head, but I’d say both get about the same amount of hair. The darker one with just the fins are the ones that are starting to get cut due to the soft material, but with some effort, I can slide the hair off to the sides of the rollers. The lighter-colored roller is the real chore, however due to all the little bumps in the roller’s design. Very hard to remove hair using bare hands.', ""Matt_NZ: Maybe a tool like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Kinglooyuan-LOOYUAN-Replacement-Cleaning-iRobot/dp/B00XW2XC0I/ref=psdc_510106_t3_B07D2D7K2X) might make the process easier?

Will look into it.\nYes, I guess the rollers being wider could contribute to the hair tangles on the S9. But the thing is, I have the original i7 from a little over half a year ago, and beyond the rare instances where it attempted to swallow some yarn or a piece of thread, I really don’t recall ever finding hair wrapped around the center of its rollers like the s9 - let alone to the point where it actually starts destroying the rollers themselves. And on the rare occurrence that I ever did find some hair wrapped around the roller’s center, it would be more like 3-5 strands at most, and very easy to slide off the edges.\n\nOn the s9, hair always gets stuck dead center - and very tightly.']"

It doesn’t help that they are the most used and abuse rooms in the house but it does great on the hardwood floors. 

I’ve found that the reusable Bona pads work a bit better than the softer grey Amazon MXzone ones because they have the little scrubby bits.

Any mop will need a little help with tough stuff and once you get it prepared it’s going to have a better chance of getting things done. \nMore frequent runs with the cleaning pads changed each time will always help. \nA Bissell Crosswave may be a good idea for your dog 🐕 room to use clean solution and suck it up as the M6 is only a very helpful swiffer.', 'Alfred_Chicken: One thing you can do is use clean zones to make the bot do another pass in an area; for example, you can set a clean zone in front of the counter and tell the bot to clean in this area after it has finished cleaning the room.

My upper level is a square family room, a long hallway, and two bedrooms off that hallway. I use the mapping function on the i3 to either vacuum the family room and hallway, to do just the back bedrooms, or to do everything. The whole upper floor is level and carpeted with the same carpet. There are no unusual obstructions anywhere on the upper floor.

If I start the Roomba in one of these three programs using the app,

-	Running just the family room and hallway, the job always finishes normally.
-	Running either the whole upper floor or just the back bedrooms, I almost always get a “bumper stuck” error when its in one of the two back bedrooms. There is no rhyme or reason which, where, or why.

Now, the twist is that if I start the Roomba manually in either back bedroom using the clean button, I never get a bumper stuck error.

The only thing I can think of is that something is screwy with the mapping in the two back bedrooms and I need to remap the upper floor. Before I go to that trouble, though, I wanted to know if anyone else had any other ideas or thoughts about anything I could be missing. Thanks again for your help, thoughts, and ideas."	2	"[""bwyer: Bumper stuck is exactly what it says it is.  The bumper (the front face of the Roomba) is hitting something and getting stuck.

I generally have to thump the bumper to get it to release and move freely.\n\nYou're seeing different behavior based on where you start it likely because of the path it's taking.  Find whatever obstacle is causing the bumper to get stuck and create a no-go zone there."", 'sc816: This is insightful. Thank you very much.

## Roomba® j7 Series

## Version 22.52

*Release Date: 2023.2.22*

**Keep on moving**

Roomba has always had some tricks to get itself unstuck and keep moving on so you don’t have to rescue it - like a fast **spin maneuver** you might have noticed.

Now Roomba uses its camera along with other sensors to detect more cases where it needs to spin its way out of trouble and finish the job.

**Stay charged up**

We’ve been working hard to help Roomba stay charged on its Home Base, so it’s always ready to go when you need it.

You can do your part by following these easy [Home Base care and maintenance](https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/32681) guidelines. Roomba will thank you!

**Mapping: overhauled for speed**

We went back to the drawing board and created our fastest [map-making](https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/17745) algorithm ever.

Need to take a call before mapping is complete? No problem. Roomba will pick up where it left off in the next mapping run.

**Bugs Resolved:**

* Fixed a bug that prevented Braava m6 from starting its part of a [Linked Cleaning job ](https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/21090)
* Resolved a problem that prevented the light ring from turning off in some Roomba i7s
* Fixed a map issue that would lead Roomba to try to get through a wall
* If you do a [Mapping Run](https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/17745) with an existing map, Roomba now obeys the keep-out zones
* Fixed a bug that could cause a [Mapping Run](https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/17745) to end early
* Fixed a bug which could cause Roomba to clean rooms in the wrong order during [Directed Room Cleaning](https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/64102#ImprintSmartMapsDirectedRoomCleaning)
* Fixed bug where Roomba would return to a room after it was [skipped](https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/64150)
* Addressed a case where a Clean Base communication problem was shown in the iRobot Home App, when everything was actually fine"	11	"[""Alfred_Chicken: These are far more detailed release notes than what iRobot usually puts out.

Here is an excerpt:

>The rules that governed the Roomba’s motion, the rules that were effectively its purpose for existing, had taken it far from its origins on the wooden planks of the living room charging port to a distant and exotic place of ceramic and tile. But continuing to follow its rules had now trapped it in this new and foreign place, and through the rules alone it could not be saved. I wonder, if the Roomba was given just one or two more rules would it have been able to foresee and then avoid its trapping? Or would those additional rules have just extended the Roomba’s agency into additional dimensions which too had their own self-trapping doors and one-way traversable ledges?

Months ago I moved it upstairs and decided to use it a bit differently. I just carry it to rooms I want cleaned, press the main button, and close the door. This used to work fine. It would clean the whole room. 

Lately it doesn’t do this anymore. Jobs almost always end with error 99 navigation error. The path it takes when cleaning make no sense. It used to just make straight lines back and forth. Now it starts by making a straight line, then doubling back on itself so it’s overlapping the same line but quite a bit.

I’ve done a factory reset and cleaned the various sensors. Doesn’t matter. I fear a software update did this.

The reason I carry it from room to room is that it’s much easier. I can’t declutter all the rooms upstairs at once to have them cleaned. I also tried creating a “smart map” for it but the result was awful. It didn’t identify the rooms correctly at all.

Small cut on the end of the light green one but otherwise, they have been fine. No louder than originals, clean as well, the bearing end comes out like the originals do to check for hair or debris, no resistance and the only knock against the set would be that they seem ever so slightly longer and are just the tiniest bit more fiddly to reinstall after cleaning.\n\nTL;DR\n\nOne set of replacement rollers from iRobot that I bought but haven't tried yet has a different dimple pattern on the dark green roller, but the other is the same as what came installed in my J7. The 3 different 3rd party parts kits all have that same pattern as came with my robot.\n\nThe original side brush was similarly replaced before it had to be and I've kept it as it is fit for duty. Just wanted to try out a replacement 3rd party one after pulling the original to clean up beneath it during one of this filter replacement overall cleaning jobs.  Here I found the 3rd party to have slightly stiffer arms and I notice that the brush will stall against an under counter kick plate when the J7 is cleaning up closely with it oriented so that the spring brush is right up against the kick plate. It looks the same as the OEM that came with my bot with black brush arms, but some of the other side brushes in the other kits I bought for testing and eventual use have the white arms I've seen with different models of the Roomba. \n\nIn summary, aside from filters, that are very small and get very dirty and plugged up looking after a couple of weeks, I've found the other replaceable parts have a very long life, so looking to save money by buying 3rd party is not that important.

I recall at the time wondering about China and the rise in covid cases at that period after they changed from lock down policies and tensions they create with our world stemming from their aggressive military tactics.

It will line up just fine and slowly approach but it doesn't stop and keeps wanting to running ahead, like it doesn't know that it has docked. You can see the charge indicator light up for a second when it makes contact but it just keeps on trucking. I have owned it for exactly 2 years now.

Steps I have taken:

* Cleaned contact with a magic eraser
* Cleaned cliff sensors
* Factory Reset
* Moved base to another location
* New mapping run

Called iRobot and they we're not much help. Said they could repair it for a flat $150.

Has anyone else seen this issue in their robot? Thanks in advance."	15	"['Yarri8: My old out of warranty i8+ had the same issue, ended up taking it to costco to swap it out to a j8+.

They are eBay refurbished and sold by iRobot. The first one is a roomba e6. I want to know if it’s a good buy. Does it have 2 wall barriers? I also saw the roomba 630, or 677. I want to know if they work good and is a good buy.	11	"['Yarri8: It depends on how much they cost, i would rule the 630 out because that thing doesn’t have an app or anything it just the clean button, 677 does have an app but it relies on the older cleaning system with out the brushes (this also applies to the 630) and in general the 600 series is outdated. The e6 is not bad robot it has the new cleaning system with the rubber brushes. The only downside to the e6 is that its a dumb navigation robot which means if you have a big house its not going to be that good, if you have a smaller apartment it would be acceptable. Personally i would be looking for a refurbished i3, you get the same cleaning system as the e6 but you also get smart navigation. You can select rooms and it goes in straight lines, but if its out of your price range get the e6 do to it newer less maintenance cleaning system.', 'aurora-_: I honestly highly recommend the iRobot select program, because you get a new smarter robot and if it fucking sucks, you can get rid of it and you’re only down 30 bucks. \n\nIt works really well for me because we have so many dogs, and it just puts it all into a bag that I can very easily throw out. They replaced the robot twice for us because we apparently hit them really hard? But when they’re working, they are great and I couldn’t live without them.\n\nit’s $30 a month and you get the J7+ but *not* the J7+ combo that mops. some of their plans have a contract, but the one with no contract is frequently the same exact price. So you can cancel at any time. \n\nwe need this because it’s running every day, and we go through bags really quick, and this way it actually has a really good warranty and some sort of insurance but not really? So literally everything is covered unlike if you bought it on your own new. they automatically send all of the normally replaceable things too, filters rollers brushes etc. \n\nThe only thing that sucks is subscribing to a fucking vacuum, and that if you stop paying them the robot is garbage.

Plus you end up replacing the consumables (bag, rollers, filter, etc) on a more regular schedule instead of trying to stretch before buying them yourself.

You'll have to split out a separate SSID with 2.4ghz only for the device to connect.

Then if your phone is too new of an Android, the Bluetooth just won't connect for some reason. Luckily had an iPhone 8 handy which worked OK until I ran into the Wifi issue.

Then after that, I get it started vacuuming. I have a 1500 SQ FT home. I made sure there we're not wires or anything on the floor. It's been running now for almost 90 minutes and now has to recharge. It missed tons of stuff in the living room, only did part of the kitchen and didn't do under the cabinets very well. It struggled to get out of a corner for awhile. I went to the store and came back and found it was still vacuuming, and hadn't even gotten close to the bedrooms.

I've recently started reengineering my smart-home devices through HomeKit and want to take advantage of some automations. 

One problem I'm running up against is with my Roomba i7+. When I first installed my Amplifi HD system, I could not get the Roomba to connect to the wifi. The Roomba will actually connect to the wifi, but it won't connect to iRobot's cloud server. I tried some port forwarding (albeit I don't really know what I'm doing) to see if it would allow the connection, but I was unsuccessful. I threw a hail mary and enabled the IoT SSID to see if it would connect to that. Low and behold, it worked. 

My problem is now I have a Rasp Pi running HomeBridge connected to my network via ethernet, and it will not communicate locally with the Roomba since the Roomba is on the IoT SSID. Has anyone had any luck getting their Roomba to connect normally to the Amplifi HD, or does anyone have any suggestions to troubleshoot/solve?

However, tonight, it cleaned part of my house, partially charged for about 90 minutes, resumed for a few seconds, then returned home. I’m wondering if maybe it’s because it got dark outside while it was charging and I didn’t have the lights on in the room where Roomba docks? However, it’s already created a smart map of my house so idk if darkness should be an issue. And even if it was, shouldn’t the app tell me it’s having navigation issues instead of just returning home with no explanation?

Tl;dr Roomba doesn’t complete job after pausing to charge"	6	"[""Matt_NZ: If it was dark then yes, that's probably the reason it gave up.

How do I connect the maps and let the roomba realize its all just one house

This is an S7+"	1	['Fire_Hunter_8413: Same thing happened with my s9. I’ve learned that the best way to teach a Roomba to recognize a new room is to block its path to rooms it already knows, and have it clean “everywhere”. Picking it up and placing it in a room it doesn’t recognize results in the creation of a new, disconnected map.\n\nUse some boxes or similar objects to block the robot’s path to the rooms it already recognizes, and set it to clean everywhere. If needed, guide it with your feet so that it’s forced to take the path towards the new room. Once it’s in the new room, it’ll start learning it and add it to its existing map.\n\nHope this helps!']

Often doesn't say anything and complains about a low battery the next day.\n\nI clean the contacts with a melamine sponge as suggested, but it doesn't help very much. At most, it'll go a week between cleanings. Much more often, it requires daily cleaning. Sometimes the first cleaning is insufficient and it'll take a second round to make good contact.\n\nI can't help but notice that one of the robot's contacts is FAR more scratched than the other, and i can't for the life of me figure out why, let alone how to rectify it.\n\nIt's hard to see in a picture, but I think the posted one does justice. This is post-melamine scrub. The top (Left) still has a mirror finish and light scratches, but the bottom (Right) looks like it bottomed out driving over a speed bump.\n\nI've done the melamine plenty.

Is the point-of-contact smaller or larger now? Know why it worked, or was success enough to get it out of mind?\n\nI'm wondering if maybe the base's contacts are much harder than the robot's. If you soldered a bit onto the base's contacts, that's probably softer. Then the solder would be getting scuffed instead, but it's probably just gradually wearing back down towards the base contact. Like the finish on wood flooring.\n\nIdk about welding material though. Maybe same concept?"", ""tiny_nova: Interesting...\n\nThat is the correct side. But the edge brush doesn't reach most of the contact, only glancing the nearest corner. I suppose its purpose is to move all the dust right into line with the contact for pickup, but the contact isn't dragging along the ground.

Space__Monkey__	5	115yh0s	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/115yh0s/how_is_roomba_at_vacuuming_long_human_hair/	So we are thinking about getting a Roomba, but 3 of us have long hair (around 20 inch or so).

Read this before purchasing the Protect+ plan on a new ROOMBA	Loving_Life_71	4	114oc0a	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/114oc0a/beware_read_this_before_purchasing_the_protect/	"So, after many years I bought my first Roomba i3+ unit. I purchased it on Jan 15 2023. I really loved it and then I got a message that I could by an extended warranty plan and I had 30 days to do it from when I registered the robot on the app. I had an option for a 2 year or 4 year extended warranty.  I felt if I spent the extra $100 it would be worth it and this Roomba would be good and functional for 3 years. I then received the contract and it said my coverage term was from Jan 15, 2023 to Jan 15, 2025. I immediately questioned this, because as it is an EXTENDED warranty and the Roomba has a manufacturer warranty for 1 year, the coverage term should have been from Jan 15, 2024 to Jan 15 2026. I called customer service and was assured it was for the 2 years AFTER the manufacturer warranty expired. I loved the Roomba so much I bought another one for my upstairs and then called to get a extended warranty on the new one as well.  I pulled up my first plan and still questioned the dates of coverage because i read the protection plan in full and it said the protection plan started at the time you purchased it. Why would i spend money for a Protect+ plan for the first year when I didn;t need it?  So, a very nice customer service rep helped me and said yes the 2 year plan starts when you purchase it. So basically, they send you a message in the app right away saying you can purchase the extended warranty within 30 days and you think it is an extended warranty after the initial period BUT IT IS NOT!   The rep told me you have up to 10 months to purchase the extended warranty plan. I looked at the website and it does say  ""Protect plans can be purchased for an eligible product that is still covered under its included manufacturer*'*s warranty. ""  So yes, according to that you can buy it anytime up to one year \[she told me 10 months so i will stick with that\].  This being the case why would anyone buy the extended plan before 10 months or a year if you only get 1 year extended. This is very tricky and sly and deceiving in my opinion because the message to buy the plan should come after the first year is almost up, maybe at 8 or 9 months. \[you still will lose 2-3 months on a ""2 year extended warranty plan"".  You have up to 60 days to cancel the plan which i am starting the process for a refund, and i will repurchase the plan at 10 months or so. I spent the time to write this to help anyone else or hear comments because boy this has aggravated me, i feel it is so tricky and deceiving it is unbelievable!!!"	2	['vickeryj: I was curious, so I looked it up. There are two products offered, Protect, which is an extended warranty that starts after your normal warranty, and Protect+ which is an accidental damage program that starts at the date of purchase.\n\nIt seems like they tried to model the names after Apple’s plans, which are confusing, but at least with that, you get AppleCare with purchase, and you can buy AppleCare+ if you want. There’s no extended warranty alone that you can buy there.\n\nIt sounds like the people you spoke to didn’t do an effective job of explaining it to you. The good news, I suppose, is that if you wanted accidental damage protection, you got what you paid for, as even though it started during the normal warranty period, you wouldn’t have had accidental damage coverage with that. If you didn’t, someone sold you the wrong product.', 'Loving_Life_71: hey thanks-\n\nwell the only thing i was offered was Protect+ and i am looking at it now and i see what you are saying but there was no offer for a protect plan.  how can i access that now if i wanted to but just the protect to extend it so i do not have to remember it after 10 months. Call them?  i want to get my refund first but then i guess i can call. thanks']

This would pop up occasionally but I could reset and it would go away. Next it detected the entire floor was carpet, even though it’s entirely hard vinyl, and wouldn’t mop.

I called customer service almost two weeks ago (February 2). They followed up with an email asking for a video of the issue. I immediately replied with a video and more info.  After no response, I emailed asking for updates every day on 2/3 and 2/4. On 2/5, since they had not provided any sort of resolution, I requested a new robot so that this matter could be considered resolved. On 2/6 they replied asking for a video of the issue, a picture of the bottom of the robot, proof of purchase, phone number and shipping address, which I provided.

I had not heard back from them so I once again emailed asking for updates on 2/13 and 2/14. Today I received an email asking for the same stuff I provided on 2/6.

Took apart and cleaned the roller, wheels and bin.  Was excited to run it around the house for the first time today but noticed it was making some strange vibration noises. Research points to it being the cleaning head module. I then realized there were clumps of dog hair everywhere like as if the robot wasn't sucking anything into the dust bin. The rollers were just kind of collecting them together until it rolled off. I suspected there wasn't any suction happening (it's on standard mode) so I checked the new filter I put in and indeed it was very clean, not how I imagined it after cleaning several rooms. The base station barely had any dust in it even though the S9 had auto-emptied.

I checked the blower module afterwards and it looked fine. Any other idea why there might not be any suction?

NONE of the other robots I've tested get stuck like this robot does. I bought this robot on sale for $500, but I don't think it's worth over $300. This robot DESPERATELY needs Lidar.

PS I've compared it to 3 other robots. The Eufy L35 and Shark AI Ultra were better at navigating but the apps suck. The Roborock S7MaxV was 1000x better, but a little too expensive.

1676393314.0	14-Feb-2023 08:48:34	I hope the J7 successor comes standard with a camera AND lidar.	nicebrah	6	112a0hi	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/112a0hi/i_hope_the_j7_successor_comes_standard_with_a/	"At the $500-800 price point, I hope most next-gen robot vacuums come equipped with a Lidar sensor for better navigation & mapping, as well as a front facing camera for object avoidance.

I downgraded from a Roborock S7MaxV Ultra (because $1050 was too much) to a Roomba J8+ and the difference in navigation alone is night and day. My Roomba honestly seems stupid compared to the Roborock. After a few runs, it still hasn't generated a map, largely because it lacks Lidar. The standard S7MaxV (without a dock) can be had for around $600 (sale)  compared the J8+ (with dock) for $500 (sale), so I'd say the S7MaxV is in the ""high end"" category while the J8+ is in the mid range, but the S7MaxV also comes with a mop, which definitely adds to the price.

All I want is a basic robot vacuum with Lidar navigation and Camera object avoidance and a bagless self emptying bin. I don't need all the other bells and whistles which just jack up the price. Give me a $500 robot that can do the basics REALLY well, instead of a $500 robot with a lot of features done poorly.

&#x200B;

(As I'm typing this, this dumbass J8 has been vacuuming in circles for the past 30 minutes because it can't find the next room)

So I'm in the market for a new vac to replace it. I understand a Q7 is the current similar model. But I'm a Costco member, so I'm looking at the models they sell as well. At this point I think I'm hearing the J8+ is a pretty good deal at Costco, and is a pretty decent machine overall. Is that the one I should consider, or other suggestions? Hard to beat the Costco return policy, even though the J8+ is a little more than I want to spend (prefer to keep it under $500).

I have a 780 that has an inconsistent charging issue.  Roomba would throw a charging error message, which I thought was the battery so I replaced it. It worked fine for a few months then occurred again. Charging issue occurs both on dock and plugged directly in.

I've cleaned the external charging connectors on both dock and Roomba, as well as the internal battery connection points  but the problem reoccurs.   I found that if I remove the battery and reinsert it, the Roomba works again and charges off dock and direct connection until it stops again.

How do I troubleshoot this and any ideas what it could be?  I'd rather avoid having to buy replacements until I can narrow the issue down. 

Motherboard issues, bad power supply maybe?"	1	"[""Cardopusher: there should be a charging error number to identify at least whether it's battery or dock fault.""]"

With the ability to connect to the iRobot Home app, users will enjoy complete control to start, stop, and schedule cleaning jobs even when away from home. This model offers users an accessible and reasonably priced way to enjoy the smart home lifestyle.\n\nOn the other hand, the pricier iRobot Roomba s9 takes the top-of-the-line title, with features that are sure to impress even the most seasoned robotic vacuum consumers. The s9 utilizes Imprint Smart Mapping to remember and adjust to the user’s home, allowing it to clean rooms more efficiently. It also has brilliant edge-sweeping capabilities that can reach tight corners and edges, perfect for those hard-to-reach places.\n\nWhen it comes to the batteries, the s9 clearly wins out. With a run-time of up to 120 minutes, it can last twice as long as the j7+’s maximum 100 minute run-time. That said, the s9’s battery will drain faster when using some of its more advanced features or when cleaning larger spaces.\n\nThe Roomba j7+ and s9 are both extremely effective as cleaning robots, but the s9 packs a punch when it comes to its features and capabilities. Its smarter navigation, longer battery life, and edge-sweeping capabilities make it the ideal option for those who want a slightly upgraded robotic vacuum experience compared to the j7+. However, those on a tighter budget may still want to consider the j7+, which still offers impressive features at a more affordable price point.”', 'MuchPresentation809: S9 plus', 'aurora-_: >\tWith a run-time of up to 120 minutes, it can last twice as long as the j7+’s maximum 100 minute run-time.\n\nLOL']

The latter one just beeps and blinks while charging and some research revealed most likely the battery is dead/broken. I opened it and it has a NiMH battery. However, the form factor and pins between the two are identical.

&#x200B;

Initially I was pretty sure they are not compatible; LiION charging circuits are different than NiMH. However, I found multiple roomba replacment batteries (both LiION and NiMH) that are compatible with both of the roombas (600 and 900 series).

&#x200B;

I have an i7 and it randomly, but frequently just pauses a job. I took it apart and cleaned the dust bin sensors and it didn't fix it. Then I saw someone said to try disabling the ""Clean"" button by enabling the child controls in the app and it ran for a little while without pausing, but then decided it wanted to reboot on me.

I've deleted the maps several times, and I've tried factory resetting it and nothing seems to be helping.

I'm tempted to buy a replacement motherboard off ebay just to see if that works, but I figured I'd ask if anyone had any ideas here.

Thanks!"	0	[]

1. Remove the Roomba's battery: Locate the battery cover on the bottom of your Roomba, press the release button, and lift the cover off to remove the battery.
2. Wait for one minute: After removing the battery, wait for at least one minute. This will allow the Roomba to discharge any residual power and complete the reset process.
3. Replace the battery: After waiting for one minute, replace the battery by aligning the contacts and snapping the cover back in place.
4. Power on the Roomba: Once the battery is replaced, press the ""Clean"" button to power on the Roomba. The Roomba will go through its startup sequence and should be reset.

**Note:** The exact process of [resetting a Roomba](https://irobotroomba.site/how-to-reset-roomba/) may vary slightly depending on the model, so it's recommended to consult the user manual or contact iRobot customer support for specific instructions for your Roomba."	1	[]

I clean the brushes, even using an upright vacuum hose to clean out the brushes. It will work for a few minutes then need cleaning again. Brushes are about a week old, as is the filter and front 3 prong brush. 

My hypothesis is the brush sensor is too sensitive or has something in it. Yesterday, I took about the roomba apart and cleaned various internal parts including the fan inside the trash compartment with the filter, the trash compartment, the brushes, inside the brush cage, and removed the cleaning head and cleaned all the dust inside. After putting everything back together the vacuum worked for 4 minutes, then I get error 2 again.

I’m considering purchasing a new cleaning head from roomba so I’ll get a new sensor. The cleaning head costs $50. However a new to me refurbished roomba E6 (6199) is on sale at Amazon for $150. I’m physically handicapped, and on disability so I’m on a fixed income but really need a vacuum robot.

Which would you suggest, buying the new cleaning head or buying a refurbished older roomba?"	6	"['MartianTea: I was getting that same notification with my 675 and then it stopped after 10 mins. Like you, I\'d replaced brushes and thoroughly cleaned it and it doesn\'t help at all. \n\nI contacted Roomba support and they told me to replace the brush cage housing (I think that\'s what it\'s called). Doing that had it working better than ever except now the dust collection bin has randomly started to come off while vacuuming. It\'s supposedly an ""upgraded"" one that was originally for a different series so I dunno if that\'s the problem. \n\nLuckily, I got the part on Amazon so I can likely return it, and Roomba assured me I could return it if I got it from them too (but I wasn\'t as sure about it). \n\nThrough my research, I found out not cleaning the brushes out often enough (though I never got an error before it started to go buggy and they were clean) likely caused this. I bought extra brushes to switch out in case I couldn\'t clean after every use (I have a dog that sheds a lot). \n\nHow old is your Roomba? I think it\'s in iRobot\'s website, but somewhere I found that my model\'s lifespan is 4 years and mine is about 3. You may want to look at that before making your decision.', 'PsychologicalHead241: The new cleaning head arrived and it seems to be doing the trick.', 'PsychologicalHead241: Mine was originally manufactured in 2007.', ""MartianTea: That's really old for any vacuum these days. Despite that, it might be worth it to talk to Roomba support, but I bet you need the same $40-$50 brush cage I got. If it doesn't work, you can send it back free through Amazon at least.\n\nAlso, does the refurb come with a warranty?"", 'PsychologicalHead241: I ended up ordering the brush cage, which is under warranty.

It worked fine for the first 4-5 months but grew crazier and crazier with time.

Here is behavior it exhibits now:

* Cleans indefinitely in a single carpeted 700 square foot room despite being set to 1-pass (last two cleanings were over 6 hours before I canceling the job)
* NOT following a discernible pattern, returning to the same spots and bumping into things in a confused manner, zig-zagging all over the place, not cleaning in rows at all
* Pausing the job to recharge multiple times and return to its base, despite having >50% charge remaining, sometimes only after a minute or two of cleaning, other times after an hour

I did a second full disassembly and cleaning of my i2 for the second day in a row, including:

1. cleaning all of the sensors, drive housing, filter/brush replacement
2. factory reset including pulling the battery for a long time - reconnecting
3. deleting and reinstalling the app

I'm not sure what else to do. There should be an option on the i2 model to completely disable the ""smart cleaning"" and return to ""drunken sailor"" method with a time limit or returning when the battery is getting low.

I would flip that toggle in a second. The software is perplexing and bug ridden. When I reinstall the app, there's a second ""clean everywhere"" favorite that shouldn't exist. It gets progressively worse with time, not better - and it's clearly downloading phantom data from the last app from iRobot despite wiping the software. You would think a factory reset on the robot itself would fix software issues, but no. I'm wondering if its hardware related, but it is not throwing an error.

Do yourself a favor and stick to older model roombas that actually work. My 600 series is still running without issue after over 3 years of daily cleanings. I literally forget its there, minus emptying the bin/knocking out the filter daily, and cleaning dog hair out of the brushes once a month.

The i2 requires constant attention and must be canceled and sent home every day, or it will literally clean indefinitely!

Edit: update - after removing the battery for a long time (10 minutes or so), cleaning the drive housing, and removing furniture the indefinite cleaning behavior stopped. It cleaned the room in 47 minutes without issue like it used to ages ago.

There are so many changing variables it's tough to know for sure, but when the indefinite cleaning returns, I'll try one or the other to see what is causing the issue."	1	['c0stlytech: This is exactly why I’m loving my 980’s.\n\nNothing but problems from the i’s I’ve bought.']

My 1 year old loves to follow it around and give it a pat on the butt to encourage it to keep going 😆\n\nWhat I will say is this: if you have chairs, stools, or any furniture that have “wire” legs or bases the Roomba will have some difficulty navigating around, through, under them.

The reason I decided to get the Select Membership and j7+ is because my cat sometimes will decide to poop under my bed, gross I know.

Well, I had an incident with my old bot a few months ago that had me beyond disgusted, but I actually was able to clean my bot and get it running again - however, I never wanted to deal with something like that again.


I learned the j7+ had accident avoidance and decided that this was for me!! It even is supposed to notify you of an event!


Well my cat did a dookie under the bed apparently and I hadn't noticed - until I smelt it coming from my j7+

Sadly I guess the accident avoidance is not very good =(

I tried cleaning it and taking it apart reassembling to find that it wouldn't work.

Amazingly they are sending me a brand new one!!!


I suppose I am going back to NOT using my robot on an automated schedule and always double checking before running just in case...

I am sad but thought I'd share my experience.

I'll note, maybe tmi - but the remnants of the terd were not liquid or diarrhea - it was solid, it definitely should have avoided it."	0	[]

Extra-Entrepreneur-4	1	10rsnnc	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/10rsnnc/is_it_okay_to_use_a_us_j7_with_a_travel_adapter/	As the title says because J7+ is much cheaper on Amazon US.	6	"[""Zhilvi: Short answer is no. US and EU (120V/240V) versions for the clean base are physically different internally. Afaik, there is no multi-voltage version available yet which could switch from 120 to 240V operation. Simply adapting the plug won't work and could destroy the device entirely. \n\nTo run the US version on 240V socket you'd need a stepdown transformer. The base is quite a powerful device (>>1kW when emptying), so the expect the transformer to be the size of a shoebox. Additionally, any 240-120V stepdown unit this powerful and of decent enough quality to safely run unattended will bite heavily into the price difference.\n\nLastly, most of the price difference between US/EU J7s are import duties and EU taxes. If you are in EU and just buy it off US amazon, you'll likely drop a few extra hundos to EU customs during shipping anyway. Unless you (or someone else) are in US and bring it back on-person, you'll likely end up with a final price the same as the EU versions anyway. And be stuck with 120V version on top of it all."", ""kmc307: iRobot specs aren't published to this level of detail that I can see on their website.  You'd need to check the power supply to see if it's 100-120v or 100-240v like a laptop power supply.  If nobody else has an answer I can peak at my base station later today to see if the voltage is printed on it."", 'Matt_NZ: The only way to do this would be to buy the robot from the US and get the clean base on its own from the UK iRobot store', ""ThatMechEGuy: The input voltage of the clean base is 100-127 V, frequency of 50-60 Hz, and a 12 A draw.\n\nYou'd be able to get away with the frequency of the European grid, but you'd need to step down the voltage. If your adapter can handle a 12 A load with a high startup current that the clean base vacuum needs, then it should work. You'll want to be careful though, not all adapters will do the voltage conversion or be able to handle the current requirements.\n\nIf you're willing to use the space to bring the Roomba and clean base, I'm guessing you'll be wherever you're going for a while.

I took the whole thing apart and was able to see that I'll need a new IR sensor as well as a new front bumper since the bracket that holds the IR sensor is broken. 

Does anyone know if the 700 / 800 / 900 series front bumpers and IR sensors are all compatible? I've seen filters, roller brushes, and wheel modules that seem to be compatible with all these models, so I assume that the front bumper and IR sensors are also the same exact parts. Ideally, I'd want to pick up an entire front bumper with IR sensor assembly to swap out. I've found a 770 local to me for $15 that I can use as parts. There's also an 800 series bumper on ebay. I asked the seller if it's compatible, but he said no.

I have had my j7 since April and in the last few months it seems to have gotten increasingly problematic. So much so that 2 weeks ago when it became unresponsive and stuck and I had to reset the entire robot again I renamed it “dumb thing”. Well a few days ago dumb thing hit a new low and stopped a cleaning job because of a full bin and since that event the robot will not charge and is completely dead. 
Long story short I have done every robot and cleaning hack I know of and to no avail my thousand dollar robot vacuum is dead and non responsive. For context my home base lights up briefly when I remove the bag so home base is not the issue. I just wanted to see if anyone has had similar experiences with customer service. To be honest I was hoping for a replacement since this is not the first problem I’ve had with this vacuum. Instead I had to go through all the cleaning steps and removing the battery etc. on the phone which ended with the customer service rep telling me it was my fault the robot is having issues because I didn’t keep the charging contacts clean enough!

I also heavily scrubbed the base's charging contacts with a Magic Eraser then melted a layer of ChipQuik solder to the top to fill in the microscopic gaps and bridge the charging materials. It helped a little.\n\nOf course this requires you to have a soldering iron and soldering skill. I expect there's a better way to disassemble the charging base and replace its contacts with aftermarket ones, but I haven't looked into that yet.

The answer is yes. 

I tried it with beacons to protect the bird cage area, and a new map registered a rectangular protrusion in the room where beacons are. 

I had to move the bird cages and beacons and let the Roomba get to the corner for the Smart Map to get an accurate room shape. It's much easier to size and register a Keep-out Zone this way.

Original post:
My i7+ (i8+) thinks it's discovered Narnia in a closet and won't give up on this other dimension on the map, even after 2+ full-cleans each day for over a week. (I didn't realize I could revert to a previous map from a previous run until it was too late.)

I'm ready to delete the map and start over, but I'm concerned about a corner where I have bird cages (3' x 4' area), which I don't want the Roomba to bump. My current map has a Keep-out Zone there, but i f I delete the current map start fresh using virtual walls (physical beacons) blocking off the corner, will the new map show the adjacent walls meeting at the real corner (so I can then add a Keep-out Zone on an accurate map), or will it show a protrusion as if the virtual walls are actual drywall?"	3	"['AutoModerator: Hi OP!

Got a new tank, there's a visible difference from new to old, suspect age/tightening/drying.

New tank works, really wish they sold the 2$ cap vs having to buy the 35$ tank :(

https://preview.redd.it/ac3vwlgvxrga1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b94539bf1b9ae2689199749f8b399625f8f03ed8

&#x200B;

Got one used from ebay, I thought it was spraying at first, but it only sprays correctly about 2-3 times when putting the tank in the machine.

This is because when you put the tank in the machine, it squirts a little bit of water to fill up the filter/gasket area. Then after those squirts are done, you lift the water tank up, and the filter/gasket area below it is empty.

So out of curiosity, I heated a pin, put a hole in the top of the water tank for a breather, lo and behold, the sprayer worked amazingly well. And the unit started to leak of course around the filter/gasket below the water tank, since it isn't a waterproof coupler to the tubing that leads to the pump....

So duct taping the hole, I'm back to the cap not allowing air into the water tank, though I've checked it and nothing seems stuck or wrong with it.

&#x200B;

I'm assuming either:

the tubing in the peristaltic pump is worn, and not providing enough suction to pull air through the water tank cap, but it sprays quite a bit, which wouldn't match a loosey goosey peristaltic (it would just kinda dribble I would think)

or

the cap is defective and somehow the rubber air inlet inside the cap has perhaps shrunk and causing too much pressure to allow air in

or

I have no idea.. I've taken the thing apart, inspected everything, seems like a great design except the darn cap is on the side of the tank vs on the top so they have to have a funky breather design. I see most people's issue is the oring on the cap which I don't seem to be having an issue with."	8	"['kaz911-uk: 1.

How do I test just the suction capability of the robot? Is there a test mode where I can flip the thing upside down and ""turn on suction"" and put my hand up to the brush area to see if it's pulling in air?

I bought a Roomba i3+ with a cleaning base back in November. Tuesday is the last return date. I have deep carpet everywhere, but in the kitchen and bathroom. Sadly. there is no possibility to place the robot there, so the base is on carpet.I really like the cleaning it does so far.

HOWEVER, For two months the robot didn't manage to empy its bin  on its own. It finds its base, connects, starts the emptying process but never in two months managed it to empty it. I would always get notification like ""sealing problem"" or ""there is a clog"" or bla bla bla.The only times it worked, was when I would shove the robot like another quarter of an inch into the cleaning base. Then I would hear the flap on the lower side open and the dust would get emptied. I couldn't find anything online or on the roomba help portal. Has anyone ever experienced this?

EDIT: Words"	1	"[""dillonmouton: clean the cliff detection sensors, clean them WELL.. especially the ones behind the bumper. jam a q-tip in there and get all the shit off of them. clean the contacts on the base and the bottom of the vacuum. reboot the robot after, place it at least 8 feet from home base. start a job. pause it. send it home. my J7+ was refusing to auto empty (it wouldn't even give me the option to manually empty it) and this fixed it.""]"

- says a job is completed when it’s clearly not or misses huge swaths of space
- can’t seemingly figure out how to get back to the base despite just coming from there so it just wanders hoping to find it.
- cleans in the most random pattern I’ve ever seen. It knows the room - why doesn’t it just go in straight lines??
- it spends forever in a specific areas for no reason (furnace grates, around furniture)

- lots of light in the areas it’s cleaning
- always make sure sensors are clean
- pick up anything on the floor or objects that could get in it’s way
- used a schedule so it only cleaning specific rooms to save battery
- rebooted it

I have a J7 combo (fw 1.4.8) and it seems to have a phobia for a specific chair from IKEA.  
([https://www.ikea.com/es/en/p/volfgang-chair-chrome-plated-gunnared-medium-grey-80404672/](https://www.ikea.com/es/en/p/volfgang-chair-chrome-plated-gunnared-medium-grey-80404672/))  
The lil' chicken keeps sending me pictures of it from every conceivable angle or whenever anything about its appearance changes (i.e. lighting) and almost never cleans anywhere near it.

I keep marking it as ok in the image review and the bot cleans up fine during the post review 'tidy up'. Only to get immediately startled the very next run once it catches a glimpse of the chair from a slightly different angle. As silly and wholesome as it may sound, comforting the robot to finish each job gets annoying. 

Other objects are fine - the bot learnt to correctly avoid or ignore them after 1-2 'reviews'. But this chair keeps haunting its dreams. Any ideas how to speed up the learning process? Obviously, I have the option to disable obstacle avoidance altogether but that defeats the purpose of J7 and it works great otherwise."	8	"['brizzodaizzo: Everyone has a problem with these chairs.

So now I have the house split into 2 maps, with a 3rd one coming (bedrooms section of house). Is this the best method or is having a single large map of the entire house better? How can I get one large map if the j7 won’t fully map every room in one run?	12	"['Stone_The_Rock: I certainly would not recommend multiple maps for a single floor. It will build its map over time.\n\nI would recommend deleting and starting with a fresh map, and leave all your doors open. If it can’t complete it’s initial mapping run, it will auto charge and resume.\n\nThe more subsequent runs you make, the better the map will get (should it have missed any areas)', ""Zhilvi: You should have one map per floor and let the bot learn it over multiple runs.\n\nNow, the part that is confusing to people is *how* the visual navigation bots learn and discover new areas. The camera is not really used to directly make the map. The camera is used to figure out where the bot is *within* the map. Roughly, the bot remembers what it saw when it made the map and compares that to what it sees now to guess where it is. The actual map is made when the bot follows the perimeter (i.e. bumping into things). \n\nWith this in mind, mapping run / clean a room / clean everywhere work differently:\n\n* In a mapping run, the robot tries to find the extreme edges of the space. Once it finds *enough* continuous edges to sensibly draw a perimeter, it is done. This search is coarse: if you leave an object in the middle of the room and the bot hits it, it might conclude there's a wall spanning the entire room! It also might not find passages that are relatively narrow compared to dimensions of the room.\n* In a room cleaning run, the robot prioritizes its map over the physical perimeter. It will not cross its map boundaries and will never explore new areas.\n* In a 'clean everywhere run' the robot prioritizes the physical perimeter and will hug walls into new areas. It will follow the edges 'off the map'. That's when it actually discovers new areas. The map grows from its edge, with each run the bot will discover new differences between what perimeter it expected and where it could actually drive.\n\nIf the space is wide open, you could retry the mapping run after making sure there are minimal obstructions. If the space has narrow passages (i.e. a narrow door leading out of a large room) run a few 'clean everywhere' jobs.  When doing the edge pass the bot will find that there's actually a gap where it expected a solid wall and go and explore. That's why visual nav bots sometimes require multiple runs to 'feel out' the map."", 'wack70: That’s what I read in the [Imprint Guide](https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/64102?name=64102#E) but why would it head back to the dock when the battery wasn’t low yet? I read that it’ll go back to the dock when it needs charging then resume to complete the job (and mapping), but it said the job was finished.', 'wack70: Great explanation. So if I plan to start over, would you suggest a mapping run followed by a few “clean everywhere” jobs?', ""Allsunshine6: I'm considerering buying a j7+ also, but saw the max area for an imprint map is 1600 sq ft. We have a ranch style house which will exceed this area. Would it make sense to use multiple maps for this case?  Can you schedule jobs from the base station for different maps? Appreciate any insights :)"", 'Stone_The_Rock: If you run into a scenario like that (curious, I didn’t) use the “vacuum everywhere” option ***before*** you start adding room dividers and finish setting up the map—after it finishes the job it should say something like “new area found”.\n\nThe mapping run functionality is quite curious to me—it really seems to be hit-or-miss!', ""Zhilvi: Yup. \n\nIf it takes too long to discover other areas, you can also pick it up from the base, carry it to an adjacent unmapped room and start it via the physical button. It will map out the new room, then it should connect it to the existing map once the bot finds its way out and back into previously mapped areas.\n\nAs a last resort, you can babysit a bit during a clean everywhere job. Keep following it and use your feet or hands give it an obstacle to bump into, steering it into a new area. Just do not push it or lift it!   \nForce it to drive a few bodylengths into the new area and that should register it. The bot will likely immediately return to where it was before your intrusion, don't be alarmed. It will explore the new area once its done with rooms it knows currently. That's how I got mine to learn a narrow passage between two areas.\n\nThese devices are actually very simple and predictable, just iRobot (and others) do a terrible job explaining the basics to keep up the 'mystique' of smart robot. It's literally counting steps and feeling walls through bumps. The camera is just there to recover position estimate if wheels slip."", 'wack70: Yes, I think I discovered that in the guide as well. Once you start customizing the map, it pretty much locks it down. So I’m going to have to wipe everything I’ve tried and start over, but I’ll know to not customize the map until I know all the areas have been saved.', 'wack70: So I tried what you suggested and picked the unit up, placed it in an unmapped room, then hit the button on it. I let it run pretty much all day long. It got to every room so I was really hopeful. Once it finished, it just created a new map. So I’m back to having two maps again.\n\nWhen I view the original map (already deleted the new one it created today) it says “Missing key rooms? Start a mapping run. These non-cleaning runs focus on adding unexplored areas to your map.” and then it has a “Start mapping run” link below it. I’ll give that a try tomorrow.', ""Zhilvi: That is interesting...  \nDid you inspect the new map it created before deleting it? Was it more complete than the original? Any reason you decided to keep the original vs the new map?\n\nAlso, I forgot you can keep sending it out on repeated mapping runs, my mistake. At least on iOS it's hidden in the same menu as deleting a map. I'd assume Android is similar."", 'wack70: The new map was hard to recognize & was much smaller than the original. With the amount of area it had to cover it should have been much bigger too. It should have had hard floors + carpets, and rooms on both ends of the house. Instead it was just carpet (the grainy texture on map) and I couldn’t make out which room it was, like it didn’t fully map out what it discovered.\n\nI’ll try the mapping run link to see it that actually expands the original map.', 'wack70: OK, with some poking around in the app I am understanding more how it works with gradually updating maps. So I clicked the ""Start mapping run"" from the existing map, assuming it would go out and do some more exploring. Well it did so for over 2 hours, then drove itself back to the dock. I opened the app and it showed ""*Saving Smart Map*"" as its status. Then I checked the Map and it still showed the old original map, no change. I gave it another 30 minutes just in case, but still no change. Then I went to the history and I finally see what it discovered on today\'s 2 hour run. It got through about 90% of my entire house, including what it had already mapped originally, which sounds great. All it says below the map is ""*Mapping run complete!*"" with some stats like times, events, area ft covered, etc. I click the triple dots at the top right and see ""*Update my Smart Map*"". When I click that, it alerts ""*Update Smart Map? Your current Smart Map will be replaced by this map. This action cannot be undone.*"" I click Update and now it shows ""*Something\'s not quite right. This Clean Map could be damaged or outdated, or your Smart Map could still be learning and unavailable for updates.*""\n\nI\'m about to box it up and send it back.']"

However, being that it’s software controlled, I decided to see if I could update the firmware after all these years.

Everything I read says that it can be updated, but then quickly descends into unfathomable talk about mystical devices called OSMO’s which cannot be bought or acquired in any other way, which leaves me totally baffled!

Does anyone here have any idea how the 880 can be updated and where I can buy whatever is needed to achieve this?

Thank you in advance!"	4	"[""ccpersonwhas: So yes, osmo update kits had been sent out by iRobot many years ago for manually updating any non WiFi connected models.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, the most significant reason for the osmo updates was to allow early model 500 series to be compatible with the new style auto virtual walls, to implement the (new at the time) NiCad battery 16.hr refresh charge cycle and had some very minor changes to pathing behavior. These are all features that were already present in base 700 and 800 firmware.\n\nAt some point, there was an osmo available for 700/800 series, but the changes seem so minor that there isn't even really info online about what changed.\n\nTLDR; really there isn't a need to update the firmware on your 800 series robot. If you were to get your hands on an osmo, and update it, you likely would notice no difference."", ""CheapDocument: Curious, and slightly off-topic but related to the Roomba 880:\n\nDoes your 880 bump and turn along walls or edges of furniture? Instead of sensing the wall and gliding continuously and fluidly along, it instead turns-in slightly, bumps, rotates to go straight, drives and then turns-in again, bumps, and repeats this ad nauseum/battery/time wasteum until the wall ends, or it passes the furniture.\n\nI bought my 880 used, and it has sucked horribly compared to a version that I bought at Costco about 3-4 years ago. Unfortunately the previous one ran over cat shit, fortunately on a tile floor, but the Roomba went straight to the trash (but I did keep the battery). I don't recall the model #, and I assume it was the club-warehouse-specific model of the 880. It did, however, NOT do the repeated bump-the-wall issue. It seems much faster than the retail 880, for sure, and much more efficient.\n\nCould have been a later, firmware upgrade to be more efficient.

After a couple of years the tread has simply worn down and this is a maintenance item which is cheap and easy to replace to keep the Roomba functioning properly.

Some Roomba's have a cover to remove the battery and some don't.  The battery for the latter resides under the main cover.

Note all of the dirt that collects in the unit even with general maintenance regularly conducted.  this is a great opportunity to clean out the device while were in there.  

The wheel packs come out separately with the old tires pulled off and replaced, with each item removed, more dirt found to clean out.  Also as shown in the video I found a way to clean up the rollers like new, as they get really nasty.

The Roomba would back up, scan left and right a few times, then return to the dock. It usually doesn't show ring, but sometimes (about 5% of the time) shows either a charging (cycling red) or charged (solid white) ring.

I went on the iRobot website and followed their directions. I turned off and turned it back on, I removed the battery and reinstalled it after letting it sit for an hour, I moved the dock to a different outlet, and I even bought a brand new battery. Nothing seems to help. I cleaned all sensors with a moist rag, I cleaned the charging contacts with alcohol, and I even swapped out the power cord incase the old one was defective.

Currently the Roomba sits dead on the dock and I get no feedback from neither the dock or the rooma. It'll stay like that for 18+ hours until the Roomba randomly wakes up and starts undocking and redocking until I take it off and let it sit upside down.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to diagnose this further? I bought this Roomba back in late 2020 so it's out of warranty, but I ended up retiring from my old job and started a new career where I initially traveled a *lot*, so the Roomba just sat in a box for a few years. I'd say the robot has maybe a dozen jobs on it, so it kind of sucks that I paid over a grand for something that didn't last that long.

edit: I measured the contacts on the base and the recess for the contacts on the Roomba, I believe that they make good contact. The base measured at 2.5v and the Roomba did not indicate anything, though I wouldn't be surprised if it did. Not sure if any of this helps."	9	"['Matt_NZ: Usually if a Roomba undocks and tries redocking again it\'s because it thinks that it doesn\'t have a good connection with the charging contacts.

Things have gone way downhill since Amazon bought Roomba.

The 690:

\* has better battery life, and the ability to accept batteries with far higher watt hours than the i2.

\* brushes work better on hardwood

\* ""drunken sailor"" vacuuming method doesn't have software issues (more on this below)

\* filter has far, far more surface area and doesn't clog up/require replacement as often

\* once you get obstructions out of the way, it just works

&#x200B;

The i2:

\* New rubber brushes do a better job on carpet but NOT on hardwood.

\* The brushes do a better job of keeping pet hair out of the machinery

\* The cleaning pattern is better... when it works, which is increasingly less often

\* The filter clogs up too easily and impairs the robot's ability to clean even after thoroughly tapping it out and vacuuming it daily. The filter is tiny. It feels like they designed it this way like a replacement razor, forcing you to spend more money buying filters, but to the user it's just another i-series annoyance.

\* Makes you feel like you are beta testing buggy software that doesn't have the issues ironed out - issues are tricky to resolve, and return 

\* No patch notes or communication from Roomba that they are even working on these issues (at all)

&#x200B;

When we first got the i-2 it did a phenomenal job for about 4 months cleaning a single large room with shag carpeting.

Suddenly the following issues appeared out of now where:

&#x200B;

\* Losing cleaning power despite cleaning filters daily - they clog up permanently after about 3-4 months, where the 690 you can clean the filters and use them indefinitely

\* over cleaning despite being set to 1-pass, continually returning to base to recharge and continue cleaning for hours and hours 

\* randomly returning to base to recharge, even though the battery is over 50% on the app, cleaning for 2 minutes, returning to base to recharge, and repeating this cycle, prolonging the cleaning for hours (incredibly obnoxious when you work from home, and if you don't, wearing and tearing your robot up for no good reason)

&#x200B;

Cleaning the sensors, wheels, removing and cleaning the transmission thoroughly, replacing filters, brushes, deleting and reinstalling the app, removing the battery to reset, replacing the battery, reboots and factory resets... these provide \*temporary\* relief, but the i2 seems to re-adopt undesired behavior after a few cleanings no matter what I do.

&#x200B;

The cost of ownership of the i2 is way, way higher than the 690 - especially the amount of time you have to spend troubleshooting it vs the 690. The i2 under performs the 690 on hardwood, outperforms it on carpet. The 690 is bombproof and ""just works"" where the i2 is finicky with buggy software.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure if Amazon is putting all of their energy into using these robots to spy on customers instead of fixing their buggy software, but they need to do something. I'm going to buy a different brand for my next robot vacuum if they don't do something about this.

I have sent it on a few mapping and cleaning runs, and am now prompted to set up dividers and labels for the rooms. But for some reason, the app doesn’t want to allow me to use a divider to create a hallway. It insists on the divider line running through the entire house, bisecting what is my main bathroom. I tried re-labeling the bathroom, but don’t see an option to delete the room entirely. 

The main part of my house is open concept, and there are no thresholds that the Roomba goes over (which is why I guess it’s having a hard time identifying rooms, but when I created my initial map a year ago I was able to create new dividers without this issue. Not sure why now a divider has to run the length of the entire house? I’ve added a screenshot to show what I see when I’m adding dividers. In this example, I’m trying to note a hallway (this is a small hallway but collects a lot of pet fur so it’s important I can label it for localized vacuuming) that i had no trouble setting up before. 

The part of the screenshot I highlighted in red is the hallway, but the Roomba app insists on bisecting the bathroom and won’t allow me to simply block off the left side of the hallway.

&#x200B;

**Problem**:

Every time I make the roomba vacuum the whole downstairs using the smart map (as opposed to vacuum everywhere), it cleans for a while, then goes back to the base to recharge, then cleans some more, then runs out of battery in a random area of the house (not always the same)  and says error 15.

This does not happen when I make it vacuum everywhere (which I think doesn't use the smart map). It also doesn't happen when I make it clean very few rooms (1-3), but it still happens when I make it clean half the rooms.

**What I've tried**:

\-Rebooting 2-3 times, then testing again (done this several times)

\-Replacement roomba

\-Multiple factory resets

\-Deleting smart map and remapping several times

\-Moving home base and remapping

&#x200B;

**What might be causing it**:

\-Software is buggy when cleaning too many rooms? I have 13 rooms programmed.

\-Something to do with square footage. It's about 2,700 square feet downstairs.

\-Bad battery?

&#x200B;

Any other ideas?

Thank you for your time.

As the title says, I've got an i3 and since like two weeks ago whenever my Roomba has to go back to charge mid-cycle, it will return to the base, start charging and then lose connectivity in the app, upon checking it, the ring is solid red, making no sounds at all when pressing it and the app will say no connection and to check that it's charging, which it seems to be.

I have to reset it and when I do it will have to start the cycle again, so there are two rooms that never get cleaned, unless i set it up to send it there specifically.

Still, it's annoying, any ideas?

I have just been gifted a Roomba Combo (RVF-Y1)  as it wasn't fully working, and as I'm fairly technically minded, with the words ""if you can fix it, you can keep it"".

I've already given it a quick teardown and clean, and got almost everything working fully, with the exception of the two front sweeping brushes. Gently rotating the brushes by hand, I can feel the motor spindles rotating, suggesting the gearbox isn't the issue, but they're a bit stiffer than I'd expect from this kind of tech (though I have no reference as to how stiff they're supposed to be).

I've already had a Google around, and can't obviously see either any specific information on this problem, nor can I find any technical documentation for this model - be that service manuals, or data on the PCB to know what I can probe for.

Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated - I've already opened a ticket with support, but I'm keen to get the little bot rolling as my weekend project."	5	"[""Matt_NZ: The Combo shares parts with Ecovacs Ozmo 900, as it's a result of iRobot having a partnership with Ecovacs.

My family and I recently bought a Roomba s9+ and downloaded the respective iRobot Home App for the iPhone to remote control the device, and also track and edit maps.

Once a mapping or cleaning run is over, the App will state that it is saving the current map, but once it is done, when we open the map menu, none are there. The list is empty. We do not touch the device while it is operating, we do not manipulate it while it is at work, so that could not be the cause.. Could you please help us with this issue?

I got my kid a Root RT1 robot with the hope of making it more fun to learn programming. He wasn't very interested initially, and we haven't used it that much. I wanted to reintroduce the robot to him, but discovered that it had developed some sort of asynchrony with the wheels.  If it is programmed to go straight, one wheel sometimes stops or goes backwards. 

I wanted to check if that is a firmware issue, as the wheel is rotating backwards sometimes. So I thought, maybe someone knows how to do that? The issue is completely random and unpredictable.

The first day:

I mapped the first(all wood ) and second(all carpet) floor and was impressed.

Then it cleaned the first floor and I was happy.

Then .......the carpet . We have 4 cats so I set the J7+ for two passes. It took more than 2 hours, it had to recharge 4 times and  was left with lumps of cat hair everywhere. I removed the bigger lumps, recharge the Roomba and send it to clean for another 2 passes (multiple hours, multiple recharge). It was still dirty so I VACUUM myself.

The second day: 

I set it to clean the first floor again , it took an hour then could not get unto the charging station.In it went, jiggle and back out.We tried all the internet troubleshooting like cleaning the port and sensor, moving the base, rebooting everything, check all the cables. 

It did not work and so the batterie completely died.We manually place it on the base but it never recharged, there is no light, no sound no nothing.

I’d like to stick with a big brand, I’m staying away from Eufy and Roborock because of the Chinese connection.. not sure I trust my data would remain private etc and I read poor things about Eufy longevity.

Anyway in the UK, iRobot sell an i5 model. There seems to be little about this online besides UK sites; is it just an i3 with another feature enabled? It looks similar. Right now they’re selling an i7 for £350, this also appears to be discontinued in the USA and is an older model? I read that it has some sensors that enable it to slow down before bumping objects.. does the i5 have this?


Bit concerned about the robots beating up my furniture, anyone have any experience with that? If I get one I’d be tempted to stick some foam around the body.

Thanks all."	2	['BMANN2: I stuck a felt pad strip across my bumper.  Seems to work fine still', 'Ch1huahuaDaddy: I think the S9 (ceiling camera) is the one that slows before bumping objects.

But it then proceeds to hump the base for about 30 seconds making ba ton of noise. That's about the only way I can explain it. It's like it's trying to drive through the base and it's an obstacle. WTF is wrong with this thing?

I've also had it where it won't empy the bin and turn on the vacuum in the middle of a job. I don't get alerts but if I go into the app it says to empty the bin & check the sensor. If I cancel the job I can only then click ""empty bin"" . After that it's business as usual and everything's fine. 

Is there some update they ran on the stupid thing that's causing all these problems?"	6	"[""rootshirt: usually if it's backing off the dock its to reposition because it's not making a connection with the base. clean the connects/sensors"", 'Seth_space: and do not forget to clean the frontwheel.\n\nIf this does not works properly the bot fails to see its speed and that can cause problems.', ""QueenArtie: Also going to add if you have issues with the bag autoempty-ing and bought non-roomba bags check the bag.

Combo J7+, or J7+ and Braava Jet m6 bundle?	tylerwarnecke	1	10cuxvw	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/10cuxvw/what_roomba_to_get_combo_j7_or_j7_and_braava_jet/	"Hello, we recently bought a 105 year old house that has either vinyl or original wood floors throughout the home, we have a few area rugs, 

so we bought an older home that has a concrete basement; Main floor: vinyl (kitchen, living room), tile (half bath) , and original hardwood floor (dining room, den, front entrance); and 2nd story is all original hardwood flooring. our house is just under 1,500 square feet in size. Between the floors with the original wood and the vinyl there are those little divider things.

I'm not so interested in using the Roomba in the basement as that's completely unfinished and concrete. but I am interested in using it on the main floor and upstairs. We have some small area rugs in  the kitchen, and one bedroom, and a large area rug in the living room.

Currently it's just my girlfriend and I that live here and we currently do not have any pets or children, but on occasion there will be a pet that comes if we ever need to watch her sister's dog.

The Roombas I'm considering are the following for the following reasons:

**Roomba Combo J7+:** because it's an all in one and wouldn't need two different different machines.

**Roomba J7+ & Braava Jet m6 Bundle:** because while it's more devices, the separate vacuum and mop but it is currently cheaper than the Combo J7+, and I like that the separate jet mop has the precision jet spay, and it can also be used as a mop and a broom.

&#x200B;

**Some Questions I have:**

How does the roombas work if I manual move it from the main floor to upstairs to clean the bedrooms? Our one large rug (I believe it's 8' X 12') in the living room has a small fringe along 2 ends of the rug that are probably a ½ inch or less in length.

&#x200B;

I'm currently leaning towards getting the bundle currently but please let me know any recommendations!"	4	"['LifeChanceDance: I have the bundle, and while the braava isn’t perfect, it does a really good job at general upkeep, I’ve found it does a better job and doesn’t leave streaks if I turn the water spray level up to ultra.

It does take a bit more time to run both, but the braava is so quiet, plus I usually set the J7 to clean the back of the house, than the braava does that area while the roomba cleans the front of the house, and the braava is usually only a room or two behind. \n\nI do think of the braava more as a maintenance mop vs a real elbow grease type clean, but since I got mine in September, I mopped really well, and have let it run every other day. I’ve had to wipe up a few drops of coffee that dried a couple times, but it really does a decent job of keeping it clean.

I spent a lot of money getting the best one I can afford, and it's still causing him to lose his mind every day. I have until Jan 31 to return it, sonI hope to get this resolved before hundreds of dollars are wasted. 

His complaints are: 
* When told to clean a specific area, it will go to that area for about 10 minutes wandering around, going to a location that it was not to told to go to (ie, told to go to the living room then goes to kitchen). It will not vacuum during this time, and then will go home and empty. The house is mapped out according to the app. 
*Sometimes it makes a weird sound like it is stuck on something, but it is not. 

Please give me a hand. I've tried looking through the articles but I can't find one specific one listing out our problems. If you do know one, I'll definitely go off that if linked. Or if you know any reasons why it's doing this can help."	0	[]

I am interested in getting the J7+ but I am trying to decide between buying it upfront or going the irobot select route. Doing some quick math in my head, the J7+ is $600 and the accessory replenishment kit is $80. I am assuming I need one accessory kit every year, so if I keep the roomba for 3 years before switching it out with a new one (that's just being conservative, I assume it can last a few years longer). So this puts my expenses over the 3 years at $840. On the other hand with the select membership it would be $150 activitation (for the no commitment option) and then $29 for 3 years would come down to $1194. So it seems like unless I need more than 1 kit per year it would be a lot more cost effective to not do the membership option. Our household has 1 cat that sheds quite a bit, and the house is two stories with carpet upstairs and hard floors downstairs (around 2000 sqft total). Can anyone advice whether one replenishment kit per year would be sufficient for my purposes? Thanks in advance!	4	"['elviorion: That\'s not even considering that after your 2 year commitment (if you went the commitment route) you\'ve sent them $700 and unless you continue to send them that $29 a month your roomba is useless as it wont do a thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\niRobot Select is the worst subscription decision I\'ve ever made.

My router is through Spectrum and is the type that switches between 5 and 2.4 automatically.  So maybe my cell phone is connected to wifi using 5GHz?

I understand internet access is required for software updates, but constant internet access just to edit settings like schedules and maps just seems like an unnecessary barrier to me. I also understand that some data such as maps may be stored and processed on external servers, but I see no reason why a solution incorporating both server & client storage/processing can't be implemented.

If there are settings that \*absolutely\* require internet access to function, can't they just be disabled in the app when you aren't connected to the internet? Currently, the entire app gets disabled.

I really think Bluetooth is the best solution here, as an additional method of connectivity to what currently exists, as well as combining server-side functions with the client.

Hopefully Bluetooth is added alongside Wi-Fi as an option for connectivity in newer models. I've seen this solution in other products such as smart LED lights, which can be operated by smartphone via Bluetooth OR Wi-Fi connection, along-side physical controls. The smartphone app that controls them doesn't require any internet connectivity to function. It offers the option for control through the internet, but doesn't force it upon the user. I think this is a good example of how Roomba & other smart home products should operate.

It's really as simple as giving people choices.

As another example, the Cozmo robot from Digital Dream Labs features remote camera access & control through a smartphone app, but does not require direct access to the internet for this functionality. The Cozmo robot creates its own Wi-Fi network for the smartphone app to connect to, likely for its stability over a Bluetooth connection. You can edit settings and apply them to the product without accessing the internet. When the smartphone is connected to the internet, external servers are used to serve updates to the smartphone app, which then pushes them to the product. The product still offers all functions even without these updates or internet access.

Why can't a similar solution be implemented into Roomba products?

I'm surprised this hasn't at least been addressed by Roomba engineers (that I'm aware of).

It's an issue (in my view) that plagues many smart home products. The internet-connected functionality they offer is great, but they often aren't much other than a paperweight when the internet becomes unavailable. It's understandable when the product solely offers an internet-based service, but in the case of Roomba's, which still have a purpose when the internet goes down, it makes little sense.

Some other smart home products that lose functionality when servers aren't accessible:

Smart bulbs - Can lose colour-changing ability, on/off control, schedules, all things which shouldn't require server access.

Amazon Echo - loses basic functions like voice time, timers, alarms, reminders, all things which shouldn't require server access.

I guess the subtext of this is really: Why isn't there a non-internet smart home solution that's as widely-supported as internet-connected solutions? And: Why isn't the (probably) leading automated home vacuum company, now owned by Amazon, contributing to it? AND: Why can't we just combine internet & non-internet smart home solutions into one, giving users the choice between them?

I think smart home solutions are a great concept but right now they're so messy to implement into the average home.

Please let me know your thoughts on the issue and why it is/isn't a concern of yours. Also, correct me on things I got wrong because I'm sure there are some.

Thank you.

My i3 was never finishing a job. It would just keep cleaning forever until it eventually found some obscure place to get stuck.  In my 900 ft^2 house. My Roomba would run for over 6 hours before I got fed up and ended the job.  It would act like it didn’t know where it was or spend an exorbitant amount of time in one room. Sometimes it would drive around like it was drunk. 

I assumed that my base had moved enough that I needed to do a fresh mapping run. So I picked up all the chairs, dog beds, rugs, and anything that I didn’t want in the way of a full map. Off I sent Roomba to map, and each time it would come back with some funky lines or openings to rooms that didn’t exist. I would scrub every inch to make sure all the sensors were working as expected and the wheels were moving without issues. Still map after map it would not turn out correct. 

I killed my PiHole thinking it might be blocked from something that it needed.  I started to look at software update history thinking I had got a bad update. I scoured Reddit thinking surely someone had my exact experience.  I found plenty of posts that seemed to line up but nothing was offered that I hadn’t tried except for a factory reset which was the last thing I planned on doing.

Here I was at my last option. The factory reset which would clear all my historical data.  As I opened the app and navigated to the page for the factory reset I see the reboot option. I, being an ashamed IT professional, never thought about turning it off and back on.  I began to wonder, when was the last time it was rebooted. Sure, sometimes it would run out of battery in the middle of a clean but it always has some power left to respond to the locate ping so I assumed it didn’t power off completely when that happens. Maybe it’s never been rebooted. 

So I rebooted it…twice for good measure and ran a mapping job. I hoped for the best but was prepared for the worst.  The mapping run completed in an hour which was significantly less time than the ones before the reboot. As I opened the app, I was again prepared to see missing rooms because there was no way it was done in that little time.

To my wonderment and surprise, I was greeted with a near perfect map of my house.  I happily set the room barriers and names and sent Roomba on its way to clean.

I have a Roomba i6+ which came with the Clean Base.  The whole setup was purchased in July 2021.  It's been great up until the past month or so where the robot has really struggled with docking and bin emptying.  It's very random.  Sometimes it finds the base and docks and empties the bin fine.  Other times it struggles to even find the base.  And then sometimes it docks and then overshoots and keeps trying to going forward and finally has an ""unknown base error"" and doesn't empty the bin.

I've followed other tips like cleaning behind the robot bumper or the charging contacts on both components.  I've moved the base to another room.

I even went to the extent of disassembling the clean base and removing the IR window.  I've also removed the IR window on the robot bumper.  So at this point the IR sensors have nothing at all blocking them.

Still the robot randomly has issues.  I've contacted support and after troubleshooting they've come to the conclusion that the base needs to be replaced.

It's easy to say that since they expect I'll just buy a replacement base.

But it’s also just generally disappointing with navigation and an app that’s about 2 generations behind the competition. I have put up with it and persisted, but I have never really been satisfied. Especially given the cost, it’s one of the most disappointing purchases I’ve ever made. 

However today it started moving around as if it was cleaning, but I could hear something was not working as it was too quiet. After a minute it stops and says that it it’s stuck and “Clear Roomba's debris extractors.” This is in the middle of a clear floor space just after starting. I have removed the rollers and cleaned every thing about 10 times, but the problem persists. Seems there is a fault. 

Thankfully Amazon are going to refund me, and I can’t wait to get my hands on the new Roborock S8. 

There is no way I would buy an iRobot product ever again either. I also won’t be using the subreddit again. The votebot’s trying to bury negative comments and passive aggressive company shills have done nothing to help, just telling me I’m wrong and the problems aren’t actually problems, the competition is rubbish (one guy says having LiDAR doesn’t help and even suggested it’s worse than just camera based navigation).

I have deleted and rebuilt my maps, told it to clean a space with no carpeting or rugs,  done a factory reset, tried different water settings, pass settings, took literally everything apart, checked all moving parts for free movement and debris and cleaned everything thoroughly, but every time it goes to a hard floor space, when it tries to deploy the mop, it seems to get stuck and won't deploy it more than an inch or so behind itself before giving up. It tries this three times, moving a few feet each time, as is it thinks something is in the way of putting the mop down, but then gives up and just goes home.  It won't even vacuum any hard floor without the mop down either. 

This is weird because fresh out of the box, it worked just fine and successfully mapped my first floor and vacuumed the rugs in my kitchen, then mopped the rest of the kitchen (which it did a great job of, too). Ever since I took it upstairs to map and clean there,  it has stopped being able to mop. I don't think it managed to mop the upstairs bathrooms either. 

The mop is not physically stuck,  as I was able to retract the mop arms back and underneath manually while it is powered off. If I start it up with the mop down, it throws a 1008 error,  which clears after I put the mop back up and it returns home. But it does not report any error whatsoever when it fails to deploy the mop, it just goes home and tells me the job is done. 

I haven't been able to find anyone else having this issue or any support articles about it here or on their website. I put in a ticket on the irobot website and have been waiting two days for a reply now. I am starting to think there is some kind of hardware issue making it think the arms are stuck and I may need to send it back for a replacement,  but I am worried because I bought it ""like new"" from Amazon, but it looked like it had been run through a drywall factory with a lot of fine dust embedded in it and already had a ton of scuffs and scrapes out of the box (which does not match the Amazon description of ""like new"") so I am worried it won't be accepted or that the standard warranty doesn't apply or something.  I've only had it for 3 days. It looked like the previous owner had used it for about 4 hours according to the remaining life and previous job history that I could see when I set it up.

Currently I have a Roomba S9, so I am partial to try something without silicone rollers (the issue of performance degradation as they wear out is kind of annoying), but I will consider any suggestions. Thanks.

I am aware the Roomba J7 is usually recommended for this, but I suspect other brands might do object avoidance better."	1	"[""channelsurfer61: When I looked to purchase a new robot vacuum I also was interested in object avoidance and looked therefore mainly at models with cameras that used AI to make the best decisions as to avoid wires, messes etc.\n\nMopping was a factor also, but ended up getting a J7+ based on the object detection, cleaning of my mostly hard floors and repairability. The Roborock S7+ was high on my list,  but lurking on their forums alerted me to potential problems. It also uses a single foam type of roller, although many owners have bought a brush style for a different model to help with carpet cleaning.\n\nMy J7+ handles my entryway carpet very well. It has no mopping ability as the S7+ does, or the more expensive and elaborate MaxVUltra. Here in Canada the Roborock stuff is priced a little bit on the crazy high side imho. If I felt that their product would stand the test of time then 'd be happy to pay more, but, for a fraction of the money the J7+ here at Black Friday prices was too hard to turn down.\n\nAdded an M6 for mopping that is better suited to my needs than my 240 braava jet. For better cleaning of larger messes and a deeper clean we have a Bissell Crosswave X7 Pet Pro.  That machine is better suited to that stuff while the M6 is great for maintenance several times a week and is good at that. No object avoidance with that, but I run it when I am here and know the condition of things.\n\nThe J7 has never gotten stuck on anything or ever sucked up shoes laces, sock, wires or anything else. Parts are readily available and the construction is modular so you can likely plan on having the machine around long past the warranty expires and have to clean away for you.""]"

This is my first Roomba, and overall, I think I'm happy with it. The vacuuming portion of the robot is wonderful, very satisfied with that part. I'm having a bit of difficulties with the robot respecting keep out zones, but I think I've resolved that issue. The main issues I have is with the mopping feature. When it runs a mopping job, I feel like it doesn't dispense any water/cleaner. The pad remains dry, and I never see fluid on the floor. I get that it may be trying to be conservative, but I feel this is beyond that. I have seen the top of the ""spoiler"" that holds the mop pad get a little wet, but that feels like it's more of a slight drip from the tank due to movement.

While this may seem excessive... I live way out in the country with 4 indoor/outdoor pets (2 large dogs and 2 cats). I absolutely love my furbabies but my floors are always a mess.

I'm neurodivergent and have some health problems I absolutely love my furbabies but it's a constant battle to keep my floors remotely clean (clean is not an expectation in this house)

Luckily it's small, I usually vacuum 2x a day and mop 3x a week. It's sooooo much to keep up with but even still there will always be some level of dirt and pet hair that gets stuck to the bottom of your socks...

I'd love to be able to walk barefoot in my house but sensory issues from the pet hair make it impossible.

I brush all my furbabies 2x a week it's really not that it's excessive it's just that it's constant if that makes sense.

Anyway, my house being small I love the idea of a 2in 1!!! Less space sounds amazing to me

Also!! The fact that the J7 can avoid pet accidents makes it the only option in my book.... Because I do have 1 older dog that sometimes has accidents.

Regardless what I choose this is theoretically a major splurge for me (and realistically out of my budget) but If it's going to drastically improve my quality of life like I know it could... Then it's worth it ++ I can manage low interest affirm payments

It also doesn’t clean in the “neat rows” like it’s advertised to do, and instead alternates between going in straight lines and randomly changing direction. 

It’ll hug the edge of rooms and completely avoid the open areas. It’ll end jobs after a few minutes sometimes and struggle to find it’s dock, and other times it’s diligently cleaned a whole room for an hour and went back home flawlessly.

Previously, I was completely reconnecting it using the iOS app as though it was new, but discovered this morning that if I simply pressed the home button while it was in the docking station, it would “wake up” and immediately reconnect.

I have done multiple things in my router to try to stop the disconnecting:

* I changed the i3 to use a static ip address.
* I gave it a high-priority status so it always has sufficient bandwidth
* I made sure the base station sees plenty of Wi-Fi signal strength (says “strong” in my router app)
* I set guest network to “always on” so it doesn’t time-out

Router is tp-link Deco x55 and is only 30’ from the dock - on same floor.

Try moving the base to another room and see if you get different behavior.  Keep in mind the Roomba depends on infrared light for most of its functions.

They do not perform well in complete darkness.  Try playing with the lighting in the room where the clean base is.  Keep in mind, too, that direct sunlight is a strong IR source.

1673097685.0	07-Jan-2023 05:21:25	Am I the problem? (960 bin issue)	JanTheHesitator	2	105owlb	roomba	https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/105owlb/am_i_the_problem_960_bin_issue/	"Spoiler: probably. 

TLDR: how does one fix a bin fan that one may or may not have broken through one being a clever idiot?

I've had my 960 a few years, error 11 has required 1 new bin (free under warranty) and 1 new bin paid for (out of warranty).  

I just did my usual clean-out of the bin (maybe 6mo old) using my big hoover to suck out debris, when I realised I had an attachment the same size as the roomba's vac opening. So I popped it over, and thought myself VERY clever.

I turned the big hoover up to 11, and heard the roomba bin fan go *wheeeeeeeeeeeeee* and enjoyed the fun noise before thinking: ""Maybe it's not loving having a full-strength hoover pull this much air through it"". Popped the bin back in the robot (which had just completed a clean no problem) and hey presto.... *error 11, check your app, install a new bin you glittering bufoon*

When I bought the 2nd new bin (in about 4 years of ownership) I actually bought two, in order to get free P&P. Which obviously makes no real sense but also makes complete sense. 

So I do still have a functioning roomba, having given it the 3rd new bin. The pampered bastard is whirring around as we speak. 

I prefer hoovering out roomba's bin to tapping into the trash because dust. But now I'm wondering if this extremely clever lifehack is actually what's wrecked the previous two bins.

Has anyone managed an error 11 by taking the bin apart and fixing something inside/making sincere apologies to the abused parts?"	6	"[""bwyer: Keep in mind that a motor is also a generator.  In other words, it's a motor when you feed it electricity and that causes the shaft to spin.  If, on the other hand, you spin the shaft fast enough yourself, it puts out electricity.\n\nDo you see where I'm going with this?  There are (were) probably a few electronic components attached to the fan..."", ""Yomo42: Using airflow to spin a fan very fast for a prolonged time like that is a sure way to break it.\n\nThis is why, when using canned air to clean out a computer, you have to do it in short bursts rather than all at once: you don't want to spin the fans too fast and you have to let it stop spinning before starting the next burst of air.\n\nHowever, rather than attempting to hoover out the roomba in short bursts, it'd probably be best to just not hoover out your roomba at all :P"", ""JanTheHesitator: Sadly the technical/mechanical part of my brain is about the size of a pea. In that regard I'm less clever than the roomba.\n\nBut whilst I don't *understand* what you're saying, I do see where you're going with it (I think) ...\n\n... It's possible I blew some electrics inside the bin by attaching it to something that, from the roomba's pov, was the size and power of a tornado...?\n\nTIL that the motor for the roomba is in the bin."", ""JanTheHesitator: Thank you so much for the explanation. I will certainly be using alternative methods to clean out roombas bin from now on. \n\nThis all feels like more solid evidence as to why I do 'need' to 'invest' in a self-emptying model  :D \n\nWill noodle through this sub and see if I can find out the best one reccomended!"", 'bwyer: Spot on.

When you did its job for it, power was fed back from the motor into the controller and zapped it.\n\nWith regard to the presence of the actual vacuum motor in the bin, in the older ones, yes.  That\'s why the 980\'s bin is $60 vs. the i7\'s bin ""only"" being $30.\n\nNow that I\'m thinking about it, iRobot would have had to move the motor into the robot itself to allow the Clean Base to suck the debris out of the bin.  Otherwise, the same situation you encountered would occur in the i7+ and its ilk.  I\'m guessing there\'s a one-way valve in front of the vacuum fan that prevents this very thing from happening, internal to the i7.', 'JanTheHesitator: The plot thickens! \n\nI\'m just going to tell myself that sixty quid isn\'t that bad for a whole new motor/engine/powermaker.

However, it seems that the patent iRobot had on dual rollers has expired and the Roborock S8 will have dual rollers just like a Roomba. Roborocks also have increased suction over most Roomba's so this combo may dethrone the S9+, especially since the S8 also has the AI detection on top of that.

There are still things that I think iRobot does better than Roborock and I'm happy enough with my year old S9 that I won't be switching, but depending on how the real world performance is, anyone in the market for a robot vacuum for carpet is probably going to favour the Roborock over the Roomba.

The Roomba seems to be fine, but just doesn't know it's fine. It begins a run, returns to the base and empties and charges a couple of times, then cancels the job with a message saying, ""Roomba can't charge. Can you help?""

Here's the thing. IT IS CHARGING. During whatever point of the job that this happens, the charge indicator in the app is at the very lowest red level with the lightning bolt. That doesn't change until the job cancels. Once the job is cancelled, it starts moving up the green levels until it's fully charged.

I've done all the normal steps. Cleaned it, cleaned the base, cleaned the sensors, rebooted it, unplugged the base and plugged it back in, pulled the battery and let it sit for five minutes then reinstall it, everything except factory resetting the robot. Of those steps, sometimes pulling the battery will make it work for a run or two, then it starts up again. This is the original battery.

Any suggestions?"	2	"[""Miata_GT: You may want to try a factory reset. I had to do that at least once a couple of years ago with our M6 when iRobot was sending out 'corrupt' updates.

We didn't use it very much (about 30 times in total), and we've been traveling a bit. The last time the Roomba ran was in November 2021 (due to being out of town.) My S9+ technically cost me around $33 per vacuum at this point. (It costs around $1000.)

Suddenly, the S9 will not charge. I can't figure out if the Home Base is causing this or the vacuum machine itself.

Do I replace the battery? Purchase a new clean home base? 

I called iRobot customer service, and they were not helpful at all because I am out of my warranty period. I will never purchase a vacuum like this without an extended warranty.

Any suggestions on what I should try?

I've tried the following already:

* Cleaned the sensor on the vacuum and the base.
* Opened the battery compartment on the vacuum and removed the battery for about 10 minutes.
* Tried the home base in different plug ports in my home

And it still is not working.

If the light on the home base doesn't go on when the vacuum is docked, does that mean the problem is the home base? or the battery in the vacuum itself?

If it is the home base, would you spend the $250 to get it fixed? or put that money towards a different robot vacuum? 

I am including a picture of what the S9 and home base look like when it is plugged into the wall."	14	"[""anon_smithsonian: My money would be on the battery. Lithium batteries don't do great when being kept charged at 100% all of the time. \n\nI would suggest seeing if you can pick up a replacement, third-party brand (i.e., not made by iRobot) battery from Amazon.

If the light never comes on when the base powers up then there's something wrong with the base.\n\nIf the light does come on, then check the metal contacts on the base *and* the robot. They should be clean and shiny and on the base they should be springy and extended beyond their plastic housing. On the robot they should not be wiggly or springy when pressed. \n\nIf the contacts are fine, then remove the battery from the robot for an hour and then put it back in again, then place it back on the base.

Now, I am inclined to return the J7+ (vacuum only) and get the j7+ combo or I can keep the J7+ (vacuum only) and get the M6.

Questions:

**1) Is J7+ (vacuum only) and M6 better or J7+ Combo (vacuum and mop) better? I see that the Combo has obstacle avoidance and the M6 does not, so is the Combo better for mopping?**

2) **Is J7+ Combo (vacuum and mop) the best robot to vacuum and mop for now? I've also considered Roborock, but I've heard that Roomba has better cleaning power and better app in the United States.**

**3) Should I consider buying Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum and Mop (or another brand) for a better vacuuming and mopping experience?**

For the price, the price of buying both J7+ and Braava Jet M6 comparing to J7+ Combo (Vacuum and Mop) alone are about the same.

Thank you!"	6	"[""Alfred_Chicken: The M6 probably cleans better than the combo given that it has a larger pad and possibly more downforce on the pad; the M6 also has a much larger water tank.

It\'s the equivalent of rubbing a swiffer pad across the floor, and doesn\'t replace mopping. Your money is best spent just with the J7+ imo.\n\nThat being said, the J7+ combo has some pretty serious design flaws, such as a smaller water tank - awkward to fill and use, and the fact that how it sprays water gunks up your rollers really fast.\n\nThe Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra is definitely a superior experience right out of the box, especially if you import the plumbing adapter which allows for a true hands free experience.

I would never expect the M6 to scrub away jelly or stains. I use it just to touch up my floors and keep them shiny. I have no kids, but do have pets.

They should have added a forward facing camera and/or sensors as well. When learning, it takes a long time for mine to learn the edges of my rugs and carpet. Major messes, I just wipe myself.\n\niRobot seriously needs to escalate new designs this year 2023 to keep up with competition. The M6 water tank I really like, since its easy to pop the top and take it out to refill with cleaning solution. They need to make a newer M6 with more sensors and make it smarter to get around easier, like the J7+.', ""WarpedTrekker: I will also add my M6 learning it's way around, really acts strange some times. It loves to retry and go to edges of carpet over and over again, even though it already has that area in it's database map. Also at the bottom of my interior walls, it rubs up against the moulding to feel around and sometimes when it goes forward, the moulding is shaped in such a way that it sometimes makes the M6 pop-up in front, which triggers the carpet alert. This confuses the thing and then it thinks there is carpet in that area. It will spin around 360 degrees and look around and try again and again. This just slows down both the mapping runs and actual moppings. It also doesnt have any side IR sensors like the J7+ has, so the only way it knows it is up against a wall, is by actually using the bumpers. iRobot seriously needs to put more sensors in the next iteration. IR sensors are cheap, all sensors like that are cheap enough to include in these robots. I'd pay $100-200 more just to have a much more reliable and smarter robot! ...It also loves to back into walls full speed!""]"

I bought an i3 recently. I clicked the mapping run, and it did it just fine, but when it finished there was simply no map. I'm sure it was a mapping run, as it didn't clean. If I click on the map button again, it shows like it hasn't done anything and there are no maps. Is this normal and do I have to just wait? Maybe something happened during the mapping run?

It wasn't a problem of battery, it was charged the whole time.

Sorry for bad english,

Thanks!

**Update:** When I click on history, it shows a map of everything it did today during the ""mapping run"". The map still doesn't show up, however, and the history calls the mapping run a ""cleaning run"" (even though it didn't clean). I can't edit the map in history.

We are in Florida with a 1 story home with a mix of tile and laminate flooring, no carpet. My biggest complaint is that it’s not like the vacuums with floor transitions. We have very thin floor transitions but this mop does not do well if you have mixed flooring types. They claim to have done a software update where you can mark them on your map but still has trouble. We also have one spot in our kitchen from the previous owners where the plank fake wood tile has a sharp drop off edge. Not very big of a drop, just an uneven tile and it can’t even make it over that. Unless you have pretty flat flooring then look into something else that does better. It’s not like the roomba vacuums that have no trouble with floor transitions. Also agree like someone else said, this is a wet swifter is all, it won’t scrub or lift deep stains you also have to keep changing the pad and refilling the liquid so yes it’s still convenient, but no it’s not like the vacuums which you may never need another vacuum. With the robot mops there is more maintenance and work you need to do to get it going.

Their main litmus test is the floor which, thanks to my i7+ and 240 always looks like I spend my life sweeping and scrubbing. The only actual task I do have to do is sweeping things from under the cabinet bottoms because neither product is short enough to get under them. I consider my iRobots as one of the technology-driven enablers of the elderly. Now the 240 is small and cleans methodically.

If I leave it alone, it will drive around forever most of the time, and occasionally start cleaning a new area, but thinking its in the area it was previously assigned to. If I recall it to its home base, it's able to navigate back home usually effortlessly.

I've redone my map multiple times, but I haven't done a factory reset. I am concerned it may be too far around from the router, so I moved the hub to be closer and am planning on resetting.

I believe I’ve figured out why and it’s (maybe) due to a poorly aligned left wheel. If you look at the pics you can see the left wheel has no space between it and the roller housing, whereas the right one has a gap. You can also see the wheel looks like it’s been rubbing against the side as it’s worn when compared to the right. Any thoughts on what I can do to fix this?	7	"['Ch1huahuaDaddy: It’s the side brush on mine.', ""Manowar1313: Check the screws in the wheel module. It definitely looks misaligned, I wonder what's happening under the cover."", 'Trendy08: Were you able to get the squeaking to stop?', 'Ch1huahuaDaddy: I’m going to request a side brush module replacement here soon from the iRobot select program. I just got a replacement side brush. It doesn’t squeak on carpet luckily. But I hardly have any.', 'Trendy08: Sounds good. If you remember, please let me know if that did the trick after you replace it. Thanks!', 'Ch1huahuaDaddy: When it’s running grab the side brush. Does yours stop squeaking?', 'Trendy08: I did unscrew it and removed quite a bit of hair. Squeaking would stop when I grabbed it, but it was also slowing movement so hard to tell if that’s what was squeaking or the wheel (misaligned wheel is on same side). Cleaning the hair didn’t do the trick though bc it’s still squeaking a lot.']"

It takes me like 5 minutes each time. I see the slot where the little hooks are supposed to go into, but it's like I'm getting the wrong angle. The video makes it look really simple, and I can't find online where anyone else is struggling with it, so I'm guessing I'm just missing something super obvious.	1	"['matteventu: I also don\'t like how it is, to me the hook seems to ""naturally"" go a bit deeper in that part of Roomba, while it needs to be hooked into the ""thing"" a bit more externally.\n\nNot to mention that when I push the bin in, it always moves the Roomba even if just a little, and that 80% of the times causes the robot to misalign on the dock losing the connection.']"
