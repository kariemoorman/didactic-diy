Hibiscus02	1	13ideeh	AmazonPrimeVideo	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/13ideeh/why_do_some_episodes_not_have_cc/	"I've been watching Law & Order SVU recently on prime video (the later seasons that they bothered to make available in my country at least) and I'm having this issue often. I have Auditory Processing Disorder, and english also isn't my first language, so I watch with closed captions on, but some episodes will just randomly not have them available??? 

Without mentioning the fact that some of the captions are really bad even when they do work, like having two words not being spaced, skipping entire lines of dialogue and in some parts either going too slow or too fast to match what's being said. I just turn the volume up and do my best when it happens, but I can't imagine how much this would suck if you're hard of hearing or deaf. I've had to skip some episodes before where I just couldn't understand what was happening."	1	"[""o0CYV3R0o: Amazon has a affliction to putting subtitles in the content unless its newer content or their own exclusive content.\n\nAt least this seems to have been the case for the many years I've been a subscriber in my region.\n\nI suspect a part from the mentioned new and exclusive content the rest is a after thought for Amazon probably because it's part of a package which people subscribe to mainly for the free deliveries.""]"

They are not reflecting what was actually said.

For Example in ""The Walking Dead"" season 4, episode 6 at around 29:00 a character says in the context of chess pieces:

""It's a pawn""

But the subtitle said ""It's a farmer"".

And this is just one example. It's in nearly every dialogue throughout the series. I saw the same also for example in Fargo seasons 3 and 4.

It looks like the English subtitles are automatic translations of subtitles from a different language, or something like that. Which seems unlikely for such shows which are clearly made with English as the first language.

&#x200B;

Any ideas what is happening here?"	5	"['Fun-Investigator3256: The answer is because the subtitles and the dub are both translated from the same source, usually by different people. These translations end up being different as phrases can be translated in different ways, and different translators will speak differently.', 'koala7: But all those examples are not dubbed. English is the original audio language.', ""Fun-Investigator3256: It‚Äôs because the subtitler's goal is to convey the meaning of the dialogue in as few words as possible so the audience is watching the film rather than reading a long footnote. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs often paraphrased.\n\nThere are also films with word by word captions. And there are also films with both options. It depends on your preference."", ""koala7: Thanks for the reply. While I can see that happening, I really don't think this is the case here.\n\nThe replacements are neither shorter, nor easier to grasp. Often it's simply paraphrasing the content, sometimes resulting in unnatural sentences, and sometimes like in the chess example they get plain wrong/confusing.\n\nI really looks like a back and forth translation or something like that."", 'Fun-Investigator3256: Gotta file a complaint to Amazon Prime. \U0001faf6']"

Amazons FreeVee adds another level of older content in a shortened commecial format that is not irritating.

1680177689.0	30-Mar-2023 05:01:29	What up with the online interface changes?	fatesrider	2	126kvy6	AmazonPrimeVideo	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/126kvy6/what_up_with_the_online_interface_changes/	"I haven't been watching Prime Video for a while and thought I'd check in to see what new things were being offered.  For the sake of clarity, I never watch movies on any hand-held device.  This is accessing Prime Video through a web browser.  I was (at the least) dismayed by the new user interface.  Actually, it pissed me off to no end.

The number of selections was cut by 75% to make the selection boxes bigger.  There are fewer rows to see at a glance because of this.  It's now so big, I got a text from an astronaut friend on the ISS asking me to move the selection down so they could see what other movies were there as they were passing in orbit overhead.

I may be old, but I am NOT blind.  

I don't understand why they'd make each selection so huge, and not allow the user to shrink the screen down (without making EVERYTHING on Amazon microscopic by comparison).  At most, I can only see five options across, and at most, three rows.  I USED to be able to see seven rows and at least nine options per row.  It shows 15 at most now.  It used to show 63 at most.  And that ""best case"" for the new user interface makes everything else in my screen harder to read.

What's worse, the stupid options are basically billboards with whatever font of the time the graphic artist decided to use after inhaling a blunt and a significant number of the damned show titles can't be easily read, even with the placards they're displayed on four times bigger than they were.

But the stupid LIVE events category has perfectly legible titles in identical font added to them

And where is the ""free to me"" option?  I don't pay for Prime to BUY videos or shows or episodes.  Nor do I want to see ads from a streaming service I already PAY FOR.   Why the hell do they think people cut the cord in the first place?

But that  option seems to have been removed, making FINDING something to watch 1000% more difficult (both in time and selection) because I have to slog through ad-filled, paid-for and other ""not free to me"" crap to find the stuff my money should already pay to view.

I've always hated the Amazon Prime user interface.  It's bulky, useless, time-consuming and straight up aggravating.  But IMHO, they've gone and made it WORSE.

I think the user should have more options in customizing their UI so they can spend less time raking out the drek they DON'T want and more time exploring what's available. 

1.  Even with the engorged, wall to wall selections, letting the user add to or remove categories on the main Prime Video page would immensely help them.  They'd at least see things in categories they want to look at instead of having to constantly scroll past dozens of categories they don't want to look at.  
2. Standardizing a title font for each offering instead of relying on the often questionable decisions of the graphic artist who made the titling for the poster would save much aggravation, and allow the posters to be SMALLER without needing a magnifying glass to see the titles in them.
3. Dump the ""Shows we think you'll like"" option - they haven't gotten anything in there right in the more than ten years I've had Prime.
4. For the browser, make a click mandatory to activate anything, not just a cursor hover over.  There's so little room to put the mouse on the screen without some window enlarging and blocking everything else it's a horrific experience to brows titles.  The newly ginormous title windows themselves make that horrific experience completely intolerable now.

This is a service WE PAY FOR.  WE, the customers, should have some say in how that service is presented to us.  Amazon added Prime Video along the way, but I've always thought Amazon treated it like a bastard step-child with respect to providing a good user experience.  This giant leap backward is the most egregiously anti-customer step Amazon has taken recently, but it's not the only one where Prime itself has become far less attractive to continue to pay for (Fresh delivery charges anyone?).

So, Amazon, stop screwing around with things making them demonstrably worse for your customers, or you will lose a LOT of customers, and, more importantly to your sensibilities, a lot of revenue as well.  You're setting yourself up to be replaced by someone who does it better (not a high bar to clear with the tons and tons of ""delayed deliveries"" lately) and with a much more pleasant customer experience.

Given the trend Amazon has taken in removing features and making the user experience that much worse, I'm about to cancel my Prime subscription.  I don't suspect I'm alone in that thought, either.  

Two stars out of five, Amazon.  Prime has very poor service compared to how it used to be, it offers much fewer options than before, and the experience is becoming increasingly poor.  Each of those have cost you a star.  

I cancel at one star.   I highly recommend you listen to your customers instead of your accountants."	1	"['prozacgod: Noticed this today on my amazon prime in the browser,  ""Free to Me"" is missing.\n\nThey just want people to pirate videos at this point... NOBODY really wants midrolled ads.']"

I don‚Äôt use many streaming platforms, I use Disney + and in the past also Netflix and feel like the movies stayed there for years before being gone. What‚Äôs the matter with prime and the short time to watch?	7	"[""Oldandenglish: It all depends on streaming license and if deals were made elsewhere. Maybe there was only a short window they could have content for before it was booked for another platform.\n\nYou can't compare amazon to disney+, they own 99% of the content on their platform."", ""Kookiano: I prefer they have more content over the course of a year but constantly changing it. It's an incentive for staying with the platform without it getting too stale.\n\nTo me, this makes sense with movies especially. \n\nObviously having more content for longer time periods would be ideal but if the amount of movies at any time is roughly constant I rather have those change more frequently so I can watch more different movies over the course of a year."", 'Aeonon2: I think it is also a factor that Amazon is more flexible than Netflix in exclusivity terms as Amazon has a lot of other businesses.  So sometimes content will be on Amazon that is headed elsewhere after a few months, though some content can stay long term if Amazon wanted to pay for it as they do have deep pockets.', 'Seraphina_Renaldi: I like it too very much that there‚Äôs new content every day. Prime video is my favorite streaming platform. I was just curious why even if it‚Äôs the same movie it stays much longer on Netflix for example than on prime. What‚Äôs the difference they‚Äôre doing', ""Kookiano: The longer you hold the rights, the more they cost. \nSo if you have X budget, you can either get less movies but for longer duration vs more movies but for less time. Seems to me like Prime Video is going for the latter, Netflix possibly for the former? \nObviously that's not including in house production (Netflix or Amazon Originals)."", 'Seraphina_Renaldi: That makes sense, thanks']"

1. After noticing the signature their first priority should be to make the fake bills unusable in market. When you know what's the difference between the fake and original bill it would just be a matter of a small update to CT-600 software and make 12000cr useless(big defeat to crime organization). Instead, they plan to catch the person who made the notes. If it can be drawn by hand and noticed by eye, surely a software can detect it too.
2. If you (Megha) identified that the 500 note and 2000 note had the same signature and the same person designed them, then logically instead of trying to catch him in a trap through minister, she should go back to her list of 11 printing press in Mumbai and try to narrow down on them.
3. Why would they give a normal bank officer (whose only strength btw is knowing the difference between original and counterfeit) so much priority on a field mission that she gets out of the car to look for the criminal? (Her exact words, ""f\*\*\* it, I am getting out""). Are you kidding me, that too on your first field mission? Why would they even take her on the mission?? (maybe to sabotage the mission)
4. No person who is the mastermind of such a big crime organization would ever replace his right hand with a two-day-old acquaintance whose only skill is he can draw the exact replica of notes. No experience of the crime world, routes of distribution, or even holding a gun is now the right hand, talk about exponential growth.
5. The mole in Mansoor's team giving information to Bilal could easily give the names of Sunny, Firoz to Bilal too. By now everyone is calling him Sunny not ARTIST.
6. Michael and team make a mess of every mission they are on. Why wouldn't you put handcuffs on Mansoor Dalal when you caught him in Kathmandu? They are walking out with him on street like friends going out to eat momos.
7. The lady (Shaira) who intimidates Mansoor Dalal, says something along the lines of ""you hurried in this operation, you should have taken more time. Then while leaving gives him an ultimatum to get the money in market as soon as possible"" I mean, what??
8. Why is the Mansoor Dalal and team worried about media showing 12000cr counterfeit money in market, how does that hurt them? Isnt't that their goal to get the money in market. Whats the need to panic and rush things.
9. And last, who the f\*\*\* sleeps with a person without having no clue about their profession."	0	[]

I purchased Pretty Little Liars on Prime in 2020 and have not had any issues with the show until recently. When I watch the show on my television, phone, and laptop the show does not show up in my ""continue watching"" bar. I've cleared the continue watching section out, signed out/back in, deleted the app, updated my tv, everything. This so far is the only show that is having an issue. I've started episodes of The Office, The Walking Dead, Charmed, and one of the twilight movies and they show up instantly. I even made a second profile and had the same problem.

Whenever I go to ""My Stuff"" and find PLL I open the first season and it automatically jumps to episode 3 no matter where I was in the season.

I wanted to know, cause I think many of them only have monthly plans. The main one that interests me is StackTV, it includes 16 channels which you can watch live or on demand and they give one month free, then it's $12.99 per month. I don't believe StackTV has its own app and can only be accessed through Prime video or Rogers IgniteTV (which I don't have). Is there a way to get StackTV yearly bundled in with PV?

If you don't know what X-Ray is, it's the ability to display cast, character, in-scene characters, trivia, soundtrack, and store merchandise links.  This is really useful when you want to know an actor in a movie, which other films they have been in, and with a press of a button being able to launch a found movie on the fly, or simply return to the paused movie being viewed without skipping  a beat.  

Freevee, formerly IMDb TV, formerly Free Drive, owned by Amazon, does not have the X-Ray service in the Freevee app/interface.  While watching a movie (it's paused right now), I pressed the up-arrow on the remote and only saw the standard playback controls - no X-Ray feature.  Knowing the relationship between the Prime Video and Freevee app data, I suspected that if I stop the video in Freevee, switch to the Amazon Prime Video app, and then search for and resume the same movie from within Prime Video, there was a chance that being a Prime member might pay off again by providing X-Ray information, and voila! there it was -- In Scene, Cast, and Characters for this movie title.  Previous observations showed me that, like Prime Video as well, not all titles include the X-Ray feature, but this workaround for Prime members is worth the few remote clicks to watch that movie on Freevee from the Prime Video app instead.

Just wanted to share one of the little known tricks I stumbled upon, and both the Prime member and Amazon could benefit, as this may be just one more reason to become a Prime member if you've been undecided as whether to purchase Prime membership or not.  Happy viewing!"	0	[]

I wanted to watch the series everybody hates chris on prime but I noticed that you get alot of ads on prime so I searched for a way to fix that and I found a solution:

You just need to deinstall the prime app and reinstall the app. Your first startup will give you endless streams without ads. After you restarted the app you will have ads again.

When you have autologin enabled it takes less than 30 seconds to do so.

This was tested on an Android device (Android 12) with the prime app version: 3.0.339.11547

So before they fix this just get your hands on the .apk so you can perform this trick in the future aswell ;)

I watch half on Saturday night, then on Sunday morning I attempt to watch the rest of the episode. Only now it's gone to rental only.   


Was this a shady algorithmic upsell where they knew I'd have to make the purchase cuz I'm clearly an addict and wouldn't just not watch the last hour of the entire series? Or did it just so happen that their licensing for ""Included with Prime"" had come to an end on Saturday night?

I wanted to do a test to see which had more ads/ is better.

So first, I‚Äôd recommend a free app called JustWatch (also a website JustWatch.com) to find the shows you want to watch and see which service it‚Äôs on.

Okay. So Hulu‚Äôs With Ads plan in $7.99 a month where Prime‚Äôs freevee is free to everyone.

Hulu had 17 ads that were around 15-30 seconds in length normally 3-4 at a time.

Prime‚Äôs FreeVee had 8 ads around 15 seconds in length at 2 at a time.

There is things I like about the services that others don‚Äôt have, like example, Hulu has the movie for Burn Notice in the right place, at the end of Season 4. But Prime if you wanna know a person‚Äôs name in the show you can look easily.

Which is better for the with ads‚Ä¶. Prime. Not only is it free but has so much less ads. Hulu charges 8USD and has 17 ads.

Either Hulu is being really scummy with it or Prime is being really generous. I‚Äôm gonna go with Hulu being scummy. If I was the primary subscriber I‚Äôd unsubscribe from Hulu and save myself $8.

Edit for clarification:

I watched 1 episode on each service but still with that Hulu should of been better because you pay for it.

Also I like that Prime you can skip the intro and recap. Just seems more clean."	14	"['LeoIrish: I do like Freevee - and they are putting out some solid content as well.', 'ChuckNorrisOhNo: I hate both of them.

I‚Äôm not good at that but I‚Äôll do my best. Long story short, there‚Äôs 8 teenage girls from all over the US that get sent by their parents/caregivers on a retreat to take care of their mental health, because they all got issues. Along the way, their plane crashes and they land on a deserted island where they must survive. Each episode cuts between the group‚Äôs life on the island and the events that lead up to each of them being sent on the therapeutic retreat. There‚Äôs also a twist; the girls start to realize that the plane crash may not have been a horrific accident, but that it might have been orchestrated on purpose for some reason.

The show got cancelled after Season 2. I was so sad. I seriously loved this show. I thought I found this hidden gem when it first came out, and I honestly thought it was going to be lame when I first clicked to watch it. I was just bored and wanted to find something new to watch. Boy was I wrong. I got so invested in the characters. I was in my early 20‚Äôs when it first came out and wanted to see a coming-of-age kinda show. What drew me to picking it was that it was an all woman cast, which I LOVED. Plus I love survivalist kind of shows. It‚Äôs also an LGBTQIA+ show, but even though I‚Äôm straight/cis, I still liked it just for being an all woman show and for young adults and being survivalist. 

If you haven‚Äôt seen it yet, I highly recommend if that sounds like your kinda flavor. Also, apparently there‚Äôs a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/save-the-wilds) being signed by fans to bring the show back for another season, since it got dropped so abruptly. I‚Äôm just another fan and just stumbled across the petition, but if you happen to love the show, maybe we can get enough signatures for another network to pick up the show for another season?"	4	"['abroadsui1: You‚Äôd like Yellowjackets on Showtime!

Half the time it seems totally arbitrary.     \n* Your subscription to a Prime channel does not allow login to a standalone app on Firestick.    \n* Sometimes the standalone apps provide free bundled programming, while Amazon does not offer it.

HFR needs to be a feature on streaming outside YouTube/Twitch	HydraSpectre1138	4	107ky5q	AmazonPrimeVideo	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/107ky5q/annoyed_that_older_shows_are_improperly/	"So, I know Paramount+ operates on Amazon‚Äôs infrastructure.

I love watching older shows on streaming, but what always bothered me was that these old 50i/60i shows are deinterlaced with half the framerate.

Interlacing basically flickers with half-frames to somehow fit 50fps or 60fps content in a 25fps/30fps signal, and it only natively works on CRTs.

Interlaced content and signals need to be deinterlaced to be properly viewed on flat panels. Proper deinterlacing should provide a 50fps or 60fps experience. But most streaming services top out at 30fps.

This really hurts when watching sports documentaries too, since they are intended to be seen in HFR.

This is the main issue (alongside missing a handful of episodes) of why I wish the old Nick show Clarissa Explains It All gets a DVD release in the proper interlaced 60fps presentation with all episodes. Season 1 got a now-OOP DVD but it had borked colours and no later seasons. I just want the complete Clarissa series in proper 60fps HFR and no missing episodes.

But the documentary series My Life in Gaming is only 30fps on Prime Video, and has to be viewed on YouTube for the intended 60fps.

I am hoping that Avatar: The Way of Water would popularise HFR on streaming. Blu-ray doesn‚Äôt support 48fps yet but streaming can. So I hope Avatar 2‚Äôs streaming debut on Disney+ would inspire copycats for HFR features."	6	"[""o0CYV3R0o: Amazon doesn't give a @#¬£% sadly a lot of their older films have all sorts of issues another being unwatchable high contrast!\n\nMany have commented and I've even contacted them about it and was told they'd look into the issue and years later nothing has been done.\n\nAmazon Prime Video is only a after thought for them they only care about their market place."", ""Davikins: I'm with you so far as the option should exist.

If Amazon Prime would pick this up and partner up with wizards of the coast and a decent amount of budget would be involved. \n\nMagic the gathering story and lore starting from the Thran novel depicts an ancient race of technologically advanced artificers or people who specialize in inventing or creating artifacts and automatons with the use of power stones in a world where magic and advanced technology thrive. It would be cool to see constructs and floating artifacts/ornithopters and automatons powers stones and one of the main protagonist/antagonist who is a charismatic eugenicist yawgmoth who conducts morally questionable experiments to help a city being ravaged by a plague caused by power stones infection which is caused by the heavy reliance and utilization of powerstones by the thran civilization. Because of this Yawgmoth capitalizes on this and presents himself as a saviour to propel himself polictically and rise to power. This also has a great war where different races engage in and are wiped out by a device. It has lots of themes of political intrigue/plotting/advanced technology and concepts of exploitation of resources and manipulation  and war love and plague. There is also a discovery of a new plane of existence which holds a promise for treatment of those afflicted by the disease caused by power stone usage. It\'s an interesting novel for anyone who\'s interested it\'s author is J Robert King and it\'s title is the The Thran. (Plus there are cool hoover chairs and floating citadel in the Thran)\n\nAnd another TV adapation could be the sequel to this which is called the Artifact Cyle The Brothers War which is about 2 artificers prodigy urza and mishra who had a falling out which eventually led to a war with both brothers rising to power and leading opposing sides/forces that changed their continent forever ushering the Ice Age.

I've had this subscription for three years and it works fine. We are in Florida for the winter and I now cannot authorize our TV down here to watch Prime Video. Very strange because it worked last year in the same condo unit and same TV. I called Amazon support and they told me I need to upgrade to Prime ""Premium"" because the basic plan now only supports computers and tablets/phones and not TVs. I told the support person that I was watching Prime Video at home on my large screen TV just last week before coming down to Florida. Her English was not very good so I gave up trying to make sense of what she was telling me but when I got off the phone  I checked my Canadian Amazon account online and there's no mention of Prime Premium as an option. What's going on here? I then logged into my US Amazon account which doesn't have Prime and I see that a Prime subscription costs US$14.99/month (almost twice as much with exchange) and no mention of ""Premium"" there either. They're offering a 30 day free trial. Maybe I should just cancel my Canadian Prime subscription for now and take the US subscription free trial. Any insights on what's going on here?

If Amazon Prime would pick this up and partner up with wizards of the coast and a decent amount of budget would be involved. 

Magic the gathering story and lore starting from the Thran novel depicts an ancient race of technologically advanced artificers or people who specialize in inventing or creating artifacts and automatons with the use of power stones in a world where magic and advanced technology thrive. It would be cool to see constructs and floating artifacts/ornithopters and automatons powers stones and one of the main protagonist/antagonist who is a charismatic eugenicist yawgmoth who conducts morally questionable experiments to help a city being ravaged by a plague caused by power stones infection which is caused by the heavy reliance and utilization of powerstones by the thran civilization. Because of this Yawgmoth capitalizes on this and presents himself as a saviour to propel himself polictically and rise to power. This also has a great war where different races engage in and are wiped out by a device. It has lots of themes of political intrigue/plotting/advanced technology and concepts of exploitation of resources and manipulation  and war love and plague. There is also a discovery of a new plane of existence which holds a promise for treatment of those afflicted by the disease caused by power stone usage. It's an interesting novel for anyone who's interested it's author is J Robert King and it's title is the The Thran. (Plus there are cool hoover chairs and floating citadel in the Thran)

And another TV adapation could be the sequel to this which is called the Artifact Cyle The Brothers War which is about 2 artificers prodigy urza and mishra who had a falling out which eventually led to a war with both brothers rising to power and leading opposing sides/forces that changed their continent forever ushering the Ice Age. These are some amazing high concept fanstasy/sci-fi / political intrigue/drama tv series and could introduce the concept of planeswalking a power/ability of powerful planeswalkers whos ""spark"" has awakened opening up to possibilities and opening up the multiverse on developing more spin off series on the various planes and story arcs and legendary characters of Magic the Gathering."	0	[]

And since it's not on Disney Plus, Prime Video is the only service where you can watch it. And you have to buy the episodes. Not watch it freely. The show did used to be on Netflix, but it got removed from there sometime in the mid or late 2010's.

The original aspect ratio for the show is 16:9, but when it was broadcast on Playhouse Disney and Disney Junior, it was cropped to 4:3. The episodes uploaded on the official The Koala Brothers YouTube channel use the show's original 16:9 aspect ratio, but some of the episodes that are not from there are in 4:3.

But, when you watch her on Prime Video, the Season 1-3 episodes are in original 16:9 instead of 4:3 cropped. \n\nThe same also goes for Lazytown, Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! and Yo Gabba Gabba.

The Wiggles Show marked The Wiggles transition to 16:9, but Playhouse Disney cropped it to 4:3 when they aired it. \n\nEdit: Wait, The Wiggles actually switched to 16:9 in 2002 (Lights, Camera Action, Wiggles), not The Wiggles Show in 2005!\n\nOther shows that were produced in 16:9 but broadcast in 4:3 are Charlie and Lola on Playhouse Disney/Disney Junior, 3rd and Bird on Disney Junior, and Growing Up Creepie on Discovery Kids.

Every night I fall asleep to it, so the next night I need to back up an episode or so.   But amazon can't deal with that at all:

* amazon starts any episode with where the progress ended, so you always start at the end of a rewatched episode.  No way to start an episode from the beginning.
* trying to rewatch an episode already at its end will cause amazon to skip that episode.  So,  amazon will flip through ""watched"" episodes until it gets to content that hasn't been watched.
* the progress bars on ""watched"" episodes don't make sense.. why are they 2/3rds?
* there's no way to tell what episode you're watching, because when paused, it now only tells you the series title and not the episode number/title

Summary

Director Michael Grandage develops the story with sobriety, fluency and delicacy, but at the same time, without concessions and without the false modesty typical of a certain oily quality English cinema, supported by an outstanding leading sextet. A film that is also very relevant a few days before the World Cup is held in a country like Qatar, which in the middle of 2022 criminally represses homosexuality, like the England of the 50s where most of the story takes place.

FalleenFan	1	yslrc2	AmazonPrimeVideo	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/yslrc2/any_way_to_know_which_rentals_are_original_hd/	"I often look for HD versions of movies. I will see that many movies were only ever released physically on DVD with no Blu-ray release, so only Standard Definition.

Prime Video will often for those films advertise an HD rental. I *assume* that this is merely scaling the SD content to HD resolution, rather than Amazon (and other similar services) having magical access to a ""original HD"" version of the movie.

1. Can anybody verify that these situations are scaled-up versions, and
2. Is there any way at all to know when an actual HD source is feeding the HD stream versus when it's just a blown-up SD file?

Thanks all!"	1	"['Deadpool-fan-466: ""Many movies were only ever released physically on DVD"" seems like an over-exaggeration, since most of those movies are now available either on Blu-ray or streaming/rental.\n\nWhen a ""DVD-only"" movie/series shows up as ""HD"" (or higher) in streaming/rental, it usually means one of two things:\n\n* The streaming/rental service did an ""upscale"" of their own. It\'s better than the DVD version, but doesn\'t look as good as ""native"" HD.\n* The studio did the remaster & then gave it to the streaming/rental service. It\'s much better than the DVD version.\n\nTo answer your question, you can go to [blu-ray.com](https://blu-ray.com) & search for the movie.

Kyrie's quote:

""***So, that day particularly, I went home and I was on Google. Of course people love that search engine, but I wasn‚Äôt looking for any antisemitic stuff, or any thing specifically going at any other race of people. I looked up my name and what it means, and it‚Äôs a title given to Christ. Philippians 2:11. And my name translates into Hebrew language as Yahweh.***

***So I went on to Amazon Prime, and I was like ‚Äòyou know what? Let me see if there are any documentaries on Yahweh.‚Äô So, went in the search bar, typed in ‚ÄòYahweh,‚Äô that came up. Went out, shared it on my platform‚Ä¶ that was my night.""***

First, could there be anything more narcissistic than googling your own name to find something to watch? In my own investigation, I looked up ""Kyrie"" translations. It is not a Hebrew name. It's Greek, and translates to ""Lord"". I suppose that's close enough to Yahweh, but there is a distinction. In fact, Philippians 2:11 (which Kyrie referenced) highlights this distinction: ""... and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."" It's unclear to me how Kyrie could have used google to conclude that his Hebrew name is ""Yahweh"". Unless... does Kyrie think that he is God? Like actually God??

I also did some Amazon prime video searches using ""Yahweh"", ""Yhwh"", ""Yahweh documentary"", or ""Yhwh documentary"" as key words. The documentary ""Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America"" does not show up in any of these searches. What gives? Also what else do you think is on Kyrie's amazon prime video search history?"	0	[]

We purchased all 9 seasons of this show several years ago and like a normal person, bought them in order (Season 1 first, then Season 2, and so on and so on). The first issue is they now show up all jumbled rather than in purchase order (Season 5 first, then 2, then 4, then 9, etc). Additionally, only certain seasons give me the option to view the episodes. And, as I'm writing this, I've been on the phone with Amazon Customer Service for over 30 minutes.

Great, I'll be able to catch the game when I get off work awesome!

After I did everything I could find to do through searching, added to watchlist, made sure it said recording enabled, ect. Then I got off work and was pumped to watch my home team in KC play.

Got off work about 11p EDT and started watching the game and saw about the first 7 mins of game time and then the steam cut off and wouldn't let me watch anymore as the game had ended.

Reached out to support and the overall response that I got was that you can only watch the recording while the game is live and after the game ends, that's at, can't watch any more of the game.

This brings me to the point of my discussion; why caller it recording in the first place and also what is the actual point of this feature? I feel like at best it should be called enhanced playback or something along those lines and also if this is that restricted, it should be more clearly stated somewhere and not have to go through support to find out there is no actual recording going on to speak of.

TLDR: Recording feature doesn't actually record the game and allow later playback after game has ended.

It is connected to a Denon AVR, and then on to either a TV or projector via a switch, but directly connecting it to the TV HDMI port doesn't solve the issue. I suspected it might be a HDCP issue, but figured this should solve it.

No other apps have an issue, and Prime will even play trailers, just not actual TV/films. I have tried downgrading to an older version of the app, but none I have found make any difference, except version 3.* which seems to be made for a touchscreen so is almost impossible to use (no way of searching, though video plays fine at least). I have also tried connecting my Chromecast to a hotspot from my phone, in case there was somehow an issue with my router.

My old Chromecast worked fine, so no idea what's going on here, but it's very frustrating.

I could accept the snake ring with a friggin stone in it. I could accept Rand tossing his bow on the ground. I could accept Egwene being shoved off a cliff as a coming of age thingy. I could accept Moraine in pants... modern audience, creative license, film is not writing. Different medium, differences are necessary.

It got harder and harder to accept... Perrin married and owning the forge... Mat using vulgar language in town in the inn, where Nyneave or a counsel member might hear it... 

Then you cast Mat's dad as a slovenly womanizing cheater and his mom as a drunk? His sisters as dirty children wondering is mommy is sick again? 

It can't get better from here. Can't do it. Kudos on the set and the wardrobe. This was already a story, already a well established well loved story. And seeing it live action would have been a joy even if it was word for word the books. Can't do it. Won't do it. This is beyond creative license. Taking a beloved series and rewriting it to suit your own needs is just an insult to the people who would have loved it."	3	"[""turkeypants: The showrunner described it as a different turning of the wheel. You know how in the books they say there are seven ages on the wheel of time and each has its turn and passes and later comes again - well he says this is a different turning of the same age. That's just figurative and it's a cop out to basically justify all the things they're doing differently. He's trying to pre-stave off the usual inevitable changes from the source material. \n\nBut yeah, there's a lot that's different in ways that sometimes don't feel necessary. Mat was a great character, a fan favorite, and they just made him be someone else for some reason. It's a good enough character but just not the same. I think Perrin is a dope and a bad actor. Lan isn't Lan, just some nice guy with the same name and title, easily cowed by Nynaeve. Loial looks like someone's sassy great aunt who acts like retired Santa Claus. The Tuatha-an look like dirty mishmash hippies outside a music festival. The Ways don't make sense in regard to the One Power. The Tar Valon set looks like some stale soap opera piece. Some of the trolloc CGI is bad. The fight at Tarwin's Gap was silly. There's some CW dramatic love triangle stuff. Min is too old and bitter. Yadda yadda yadda.\n\nThere are upsides. Moiraine is great and very Moiraine. The main bad guy Whitecloak to date, Valda but an apparent amalgam of him and another from the books, is excellent. Thom is a more plausible Tom to be out there on the road alone than white haired wiry old man book Thom. Nynaeve is still an ass but a somewhat more believable ass than ridiculous book Nynaeve. Rand and Egwene are just fine IMO. \n\nCan't remember the rest but I'm watching it in salvage mode to get what I can get. The overall tone and approach and depth aren't what I had hoped for and that's sad, but I'll see where they take it in season 2. We won't get another shot at this so I hope it improves."", 'cassigayle: It is an absolute cop out.\n\n\nI hear that a lot about the Nynaeve character from the books and... i resonated with that character so hard. I am a stubborn strong willed know-it-all at heart and it took sooo many years to see it in myself and stop getting in my own way. \n\nI think i loved how genuinely flawed they all were.

I recently purchased season 6 of Better Call Saul when the first episode was available and have been watching each episode per week. However, I noticed today that on episodes 4 and 5 (the two most recent), it says available until 5/31 on ep 4 and 6/7 on ep 5. Since I purchased the season, I figured that means I own the entire season (as the episodes come out of course) but it seems like amazon is saying they will remove things that I purchased. Weird things is episodes 1-3 do not have this time limit marker ion them. Just wondering if someone here can help explain this issue to me. Thanks in advance.	4	"['ScottShatter: No, they are being removed from AMC+,if it was removed or gets removed, contact support.

About ""The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power"" Amazon Studios‚Äô forthcoming series brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien‚Äôs pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of N√∫menor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.

* Disabled uBlock Origin for the Amazon Prime site
* Tried logging into my account in Firefox (version 98.0.2) and can watch video in that browser
* I've searched in this Reddit sub as well as elsewhere online and on Amazon's site for a solution

I'd rather watch in Chrome but this doesn't seem possible. I keep getting an error 7031. Looking through Amazon's help page for that error, I don't think that anything that I haven't listed applies. I'm not on a VPN. My internet connection is functioning properly since I've been working from home and using my laptop for other sites.

Any ideas why Chrome won't work? I keep getting the same 7031 error.
