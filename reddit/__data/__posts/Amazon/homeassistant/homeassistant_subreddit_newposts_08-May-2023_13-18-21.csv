For example, a temperature sensor that also has humidity, displayed like so:

temp icon Temp  
humidity icon Humidity

The entities card always displays the name for each entity and I can't see any way to disable that.  Otherwise it would be perfect.  This doesn't work, especially if trying to put more than one inside a horizontal stack:

TrousersCalledDave	1	13c1syo	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13c1syo/triggering_an_automation_using_frigateevents_why/	"I've disabled all other conditions to rule anything else out (I'm used to automating in Node Red). When I also disable the value_template condition, the automation works. 

Am I supposed to be adding the values as list entries, i.e. with a ""-"" prefix?

If I wish to combine this on one line as an AND, am I right in understanding that the correct syntax here is simply ""and""? As you can probably gather, all I wish to do is turn on a floodlight in the pool area if that camera detects a person.

I've checked the trace and I have events registering in Frigate when I go outside to test the automation, so the camera is indeed detecting me as a human in the pool area. The camera name is also identical as it is in the config.YAML.

I've tried a few different combinations now but I just can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. Any ideas please?

Thanks.

It's been fun to learn more about how electricity, and our North American split phase power works. Using Home Assistant and IotaWatt for this will save me \~$15k vs upgrading to a 200 amp service, or about $8k vs installing a smart panel.

My plan is to setup this monitor so that if our usage goes above a threshold Home Assistant can turn off certain loads - so if we are using over 50 amps, turn the water heater off, if using over 60 amps, turn the car charger off, if using over 70 amps, turn the heat pump off. Doing this with Home Assistant has the added benefit of allowing these appliances to gracefully shut down - turn the AC off with the thermostat - instead of hard cutting power to them like a smart breaker panel would.

I don't yet have the electric water heater or range, so I haven't yet been able to actually trigger the overcurrent automations, but I have a good proof of concept with IotaWatt installed, and automations set up.

First time in this community, please let me know if I flaired or labelled anything wrong

I am currently working on a side project based on a raspberry pi, and it is to recreate Sox from Lightyear. This requires Sox to speak. I have gone through and tried using coqui's TTS system and managed to complete part of the training on Google Collab before it booted me, but it did not complete. What did complete takes longer to render than speak though, so I don't have high hopes for it

I stumbled across Piper for Home Assistant, which is mentioned to be faster than talking when it comes to processing/rendering (not sure proper term here)

I tried flipping my laptop to linux but it failed in bios checks, (computer is dying) and I know that it probably won't train on the pi itself due to the missing float16 data type (ran into this issue on Coqui training)

I am wondering if anyone has ideas on how I can train this, or is willing to train for me? Links to files are found here.

I have a Nortek HUSBZB-1 adapter. In general I’ve had almost zero problems with my Zigbee network for a few years. The only Aqara devices I’ve had on the network have been 4 environment sensors. A few months ago I had one that dropped and would not reconnect. I chalked it up to a device failure. 

Last week I added an Aqara door sensor and an Aqara motion sensor and created some automations with them. Best I can tell, they worked fine for almost two days. 

On Saturday morning I upgraded from 2023.4.6 to 2023.5.2. In the afternoon I noticed my new automations weren’t working and found the new Aqara sensors were unavailable. I could re-add them, but they would drop again after a few minutes. 

Now I’m having trouble getting any Aqara sensor and a few non-Aqara Zigbee sensors to stay connected. Despite enabling debug logging, I don’t see anything related to Zigbee in the logs.

&#x200B;

I have an Arduino set up with an Ethernet shield and a DHT22 sensor. The DHT22 measures temperature and humidity, and I would like to transfer the data it collects to my Home Assistant.

To do this, I have downloaded MariaDB along with phpAdmin onto my Home Assistant.

My Home Assistant is set up on a PC with an IP address of [172.16.120.15](https://172.16.120.15). I have chosen the username and password to be ""homeassistant"", and it should connect to a database named ""homeassistant"".

A while back a shared a review of a Zigbee single-clamp energy meter that you can use to monitor a single phase's energy consumption. I mentioned I was waiting on the 3-Phase version, which can be used to meter the total energy consumption of your whole home.

I've been tinkering with this version for a week now, and It works accurately and without hiccups. Reported values are correct so far, although I intend to revisit and calibrate if needed in 3 months, once I have enough data. 

Although it can be used in the US without issues (one or two clamps only), it is my understanding that a standard home in the US generally has a two phase or split single-phase connection to the grid. For reference, most EU homes have a 3-phase connection with certain exceptions in dense cities and apartment complexes. You can get it with clamps of up to 500A, so it's use case is expandable besides the standard residential home. 

So here's my teardown and review of the Tuya Zigbee 3-Phase Energy Meter labelled model PC321-Z-TY for anyone interested.

First of all I apologize to all my teachers when they (several decades ago) insisted I will need this later in life... you were right.

I have a bioclimatic pergola with roof slats that run perpendicular to the house, with the long edge of the slat facing 207 degrees SSW however for the sake of simplicity, let's say they face directly south at 180 degrees (along the x axis in the graph). I want to calculate the angle at which they need to open (from 0° - closed to 90° - vertical.. however they can go up to about 120 degrees) so that they maximize the amount of sunlight coming into the house. I started by setting the angle of the slats to the elevation of the sun (i.e. if the sun is 30° the slats will also open to 30°) however then I quickly realized this gradually stops working towards noon as at my latitude, the sun never goes above 50° of elevation so to get the correct angle, I need to somehow take into account both the elevation and the azimuth of the sun.. e.g. regardless of elevation, at 180° azimuth the slats need to be at 90° to align with the sun however also in summer when the sun is at say 90° of azimuth (and therefore shines directly perpendicular to the slats) I have to set the pergola angle to match the exact elevation of the sun at that point.

&#x200B;

Say in this example, the green vector points towards the sun, alpha (or rather 360-alpha) is azimuth and I need to figure out beta... I'm sure the solution is blatantly obvious but my brain is stuck.. thanks!

Assuming you're looking for basic image processing and notifications, you could pick literally any camera.  However keep in mind that most security cameras are not secure.\n\nEg.  I made my system using open source Shinobi and hardwired Ethernet cameras.  My only criteria were 4k or 2k (4k for 2nd floor) , and hard-wired-Ethernet because it's far less vulnerable to interferance. I purchased 6-different brands on Wish.com for $20-$45USD. Out of these, I found about 13 serious security vulnerabilities including calling home and inability to turn off services without the ability to change passwords.\n\nHowever one common thing is out of every camera I evaluated, the solution of a separate Ethernet network and placing the processing computer in the attic were sufficient countermeasures.   By denying internet access you can force any camera to behave and after that it's really about the services and processing solution.  This gives me the ability to feel comfortable with purchasing almost any camera on the market and use any services I choose.\n\nI would not recommend this solution if you plan to use wifi cameras, or if you plan to keep the cameras on your home/business LAN/Intranet, or if you don't have a way to deny them internet access.

I currently running HA and I have a few light bulbs here and there, most of them are Hue lights, and some are in light groups.

I'm wondering if there is a way to make light animations (that can be applied to light groups). And that would take all lights from the groups and play the animation on them all. Like Candle effect, Fire, rainstorm etc... (Of course, a way to create it's own effects.) - There was a similar thing on the hue app and I can't find how to do this in HA, I won't import anything from Hue App except my lights, I want this to be HA based, and that work on all light groups, no matter the light brand in it.

&#x200B;

Also, another question, there was a way to set scenes based on images, that was really cool, with a set of default images for common scenes, but a way to use our own images.   
I would like to know how to do this, I've read a few things about DeConz or something like that, if this is the way, is there any good tutorials ?  


Oh, and my goal would be to include those 2 functionality in the lights widgets (light groups) in the UI, under the color wheel. A way to select an effect and start/stop it. as well as a way to set light color from an image, that could be selected from the phone or local folder if on computer.

Anything would help, any good readings, tips, explanation, example etc...

My home ecosystem is essentially all Kasa switches and bulbs. Before I setup HA, I used the native automations that were available in the Kasa app. Such as, turn on a switch at sunset, turn off at sunrise.

However, I've found that I like the 30 minute offset that HA has to offer, so that my switches will turn on before it gets too dark.

As of now, one of my switches has an automation through HA so it will turn on before sunset, and the rest have automation through the Kasa app at sunset.

&#x200B;

My question is this: Is it better (or do you prefer) using 100% HA automations, 100% native app automations, or a mix between the two.

&#x200B;

I am thinking that I'll make all my automations through HA, but I am not sure if there are any downsides to doing so. What happens when my Wi-Fi goes out? Will HA still handle triggering the automations?

Should I setup both native app *and* HA, so at least the native app will trigger the automation even if HA wont?"	5	"[""ChipBeef2354: Multiple apps are the bane of home automation. They should all be in one place unless it's not capable of it.\n\nOn a side note why not get a lux sensor and spend a few days discovering at what light level you would like your lights to kick on. That way on a cloudy overcast day your lights won't need to wait till your desired offset sunset time to turn on, they will just kick in when It's too dark.\n\nIf you get automated window coverings it's an amazing energy saver. Blocking the sun in the hot summer and letting it in during the cold winter. Its all based on direct sunlight.  A quick example with lux reading that probably ront make much sense. I couldnt believe the power of direct sunlight. Anyways my livingroom is lit by 4 or 5 60w equalavent bulbs. The lux reading from Phillips Hue sensor is around 120ish. That's plenty to read in. During the day my southern windows receive a reading of up to 150,000 from that same sensor pointed outside. Now imagine the energy behind that light.\n\nPersonally I found 2 lux sensors are enough. One on the east side of my house and one on the southside.  Those 2 sides account for the majority of sunlight in my house.\n\nAnyways lux sensors are a wonderful way to trigger automations, give them a try and you wont go back to sunrise/sunset."", ""id_missing: I prefer all HA mainly because I don't need to dig through multiple apps to find the automation. It's all in one place. Also the ability to combine systems from different ecosystems.\n\nThis ZigBee motion sensor can turn on this Bluetooth device is not something you can get in the native apps.\n\nAs for your WiFi question as long as the device can work with local wifi it doesn't matter if your internet goes out. I had an hour long internet outage this week and anything that didn't need to be communicate via the internet still worked."", 'Shooter_Q: I use native automations when they are inbuilt on the device or cloud stuff that I’m only setting up with temp timers via their own app, using a plug or something I don’t intend to permanently name and automate within HA. \n\nFor the first, sometimes it’s nice to have motion sensors carry their own delays for clear times rather than including offsets in every automation; or plugs that keep a default power restore preference without a server or cloud service telling them what to do. \n\nAnother example some Tasmota and ESPHome stuff that can keep carrying out simple timed actions like cycling or toggling should HA be unreachable for some reason. Depends on what it is: I can live without my lights turning on automatically, but my fish and plants might die if their pumps don’t power back on after power loss or continue cycling on time without commands from HA. \n\nFor your later questions, how will HA communicate to your wifi devices without wifi?\n\nIf you put an automation on HA and on a device/cloud, how will you prevent them from running over one another? \n\nI think it’s a question of importance and what you’re most vulnerable to, which differs for everyone. Some would rather all things be locally controlled because it’s loss of internet they worry about most, not local net, because they feel local network and WiFi are something they have far more control over maintaining.\n\n\nAnother consideration for automating via native apps with or without cloud dependence: I can pick up any tablet or sit down at any computer in my house and access HA. If my phone gets smashed, there goes my logged in apps and some of the 2FA and PWs that I need to access them until I fix things up.', ""teaganofthelizards: What lux sensors do you use? I've been looking for some for a while now."", ""ChipBeef2354: I'm in love with the Phillips Hue outdoor motion sensor. Just fyi it is Zigbee.

1683492904.0	07-May-2023 13:55:04	First Impressions so far (not great)	Area_49	0	13b2jv9	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13b2jv9/first_impressions_so_far_not_great/	"I am a long time Homeseer user , but have decided to re-evaluating which home automation system to move forward with. So I decided to test out Home Assistant because it checks a few must-haves for me:

1) 100% local with options for remote access via a reverse proxy

2) Supports z-wave

3) Supports ESXI installs

4) Good long-term viability/support


After doing quite a bit of preliminary research on the HA forum and reddit, it appeared that I would be able to use my reverse proxy to remotely access HA, and be able to use a Homeseer branded z-net radio device to connect to z-wave devices. This z-net is a spare, new-in-the-box, one that I had never used before and want to use it because my ESXI server is located far away from an optimal location for any connected z-wave or any other non-wifi radio devices. Both of these scenarios have been well documented in the forums and/or the HA documentation.


Here’s my diary of my two day journey so far, and is quite lengthy, so there is a TLDR at the end.


Day 1:

Following the HA documentation, I found the latest (as of 5/6/2023) HA ESXI install image and fired it up on my ESXI server. Worked as documented and I quickly got a working install going. Very first impression was “wow, this install was super easy, and it’s cool that it immediately found my Sonos devices, network printer, and my Jellyfin server!”

Next, I decided to follow the forum documentation (as of January 15, 2023) on how to include the z-net device (https://community.home-assistant.io/t/z-net-integration-with-ha/517268/21)

….And quickly got stuck on the step:
Navigate to Settings > Add-ons, then install and START Z-Wave JS UI. 

An error was returned after pressing the “Start” button: “Go to Configuration -  Missing required option 'device' in Z-Wave JS (core_zwave_js).”


Hmmm. That is definitely NOT what the instructions say, but Ok, lets go to configuration as it is the ONLY choice….Hmmm, nothing here that has an option to enter a network attached z-wave controller /hub like Mark’s instructions state…Just dev/tty  devices with on/of toggle settings….Oh-Oh, looks like someone updated the Z-wave JS add-on after Mark’s instructions were posted and they didn’t consider still supporting this edge case AND/OR they are just started enforcing an auto-detect for an attached hardware usb z-wave radio - and now I’m f**k’d  in being able to use anything other than an attached usb z-wave device….Ok, not the way that I really want to run HA, but maybe if I like HA after playing around with it some more, I could consider running it on a spare Raspberry pi that I have in stock and buying a recommended usb z-wave device….


So off to looking at another one of my must-have’s  - remote access via reverse proxy.  Following this documentation, it appears that support for a reverse proxy is easy to configure: (https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http). Ok, first, lets find the configuration.yml file that is referenced….Ok found documentation on where it is located….Ok, how do I edit it?....Hmm…the Studio Code Server add-on is recommended….ok, install it and fire it up…ugg, this is not a great interface, but whatever…all-right let’s see what is in the configuration.yml file…Hmm, no “HTTP: section”….Documentation implies that there would be. Well ok, let’s add the HTTP: section and add the reverse proxy information exactly how the documentation says – using my local ip address of my reverse proxy :


 http:

   use_x_forwarded_for: true

   trusted_proxies:

     - 192.168.254.209

Ok….hmm…where is the save button?…..good grief, doesn’t look like there is one…WTF?...maybe it auto-saves? Let’s test that theory….Yes, it definitely auto-saves….Note to self – this editor sucks, will need to find out how to directly edit these files using my preferred Sublime text editor at some later date….Anyway, the config file is updated per the instructions – and my reverse proxy has the appropriate host entry, so let’s test the remote access…Not working…Oh, that’s right, I had read somewhere where you may need to re-load the config files and/or reboot the system after any changes...Well that’s going to be annoying as hell moving forward, but I can see why that is the case when all the config items are stored in files that “only” run at start up….Ok, how do I reload the yaml files…search…search..search….Oh, there it is “All Yaml Configuration”. Test again and not working…Ok, lets reboot the whole system and test again. Still not working. WTF? Check yaml file and proxy server settings…They are correct! Setting up HA is not going very well at all….I can typically add a new server/service in my homelab via my reverse proxy in less than 5 minutes, and this has taken a few hours and still not working!


Ok, I’m very frustrated with getting a reverse proxy set up and working, so let’s put that aside for now and see what the mobile ios app looks like. Kind of exited because I heavily rely on my phone and the Geofency app to run a bunch of events in Homeseer when I return or leave numerous locations, and I read that the HA mobile app has geofencing built in! Ok, installed the app and ran through the setup using my local ip address of the HA server because the reverse proxy is not working AND I very much do not want to rely on any 3rd party to remotely access my system…Hmm, this is just a wrapper for the web interface so what’s the point in having an app, when one could just use safari ios?…Well that is kind of a let-down, but not the end of the world…
That’s enough for day 1. Day one summary is, that so far, this is not going very well at all and now I’m skeptical that HA is mature enough to actually be useful in the way that it claims it can be…Even though many people are raving about how good it is…


Day 2:


Ok, let’s go back to trying to get the reverse proxy to work – because if I can’t, then the decision to not migrate to HA is easily made…..


Let’s go back and check the yaml config and the reverse proxy settings with fresh eyes….Everything looks correct but it is still not working…ok, let’s delete the HTTP: section, reboot, then add it back in, then reboot again….done…still not working…Oh that’s right, I hate the Studio Code Server interface, so let’s find out how to directly edit those config files…Oh, I need to install the samba addon..ok done…Yeah, I can now use my preferred editor directly…Ok, review the HTTP section in my editor…Looks correct and exit without saving any changes..Let’s try to reboot HA and remote in again…Yea, success!  WTF? I didn’t make any changes in the yaml config file and now it works? Oh wait, I did make ONE change, which was to install the samba add-on in order to use my preferred editor…Wow! it may be that samba may be required in order for the HTTP section to work as documented for using a reverse proxy- if so, then HA maintainers should add this critical piece of information to their official documentation! 


Ok, let’s test the reverse proxy server access via the mobile app….Open the HA app and let’s find and change the server host/ip address entry…search, search, search…WTF? Oh that’s right, it’s just a wrapper for the web interface so where in the fk does one change the connection ip/host on the mobile app? Maybe in the iphone app settings? NOPE!…Man this is a huge oversight by the developers! Ok, lets delete the app and then try and re-install so I can enter the new information for using my reverse proxy…install again and it asks for everything again EXCEPT for my host/ip of my HA server. It remembered my server local ip and this is not good! Ok, let’s turn off my phone wifi and start the app again…Yes, that forces the app to go into the app settings screen where I can now see but cannot make the connection setting change…Oh, wait, there is a field for “External URL” that is currently blank. Let’s try and enter the https://subdomain.domain.net there…. Ok, so that works! So how does one get to that server config screen again without disabling wifi and cell on the phone? Try two and three finger swipes up,down,left,right – NOPE…close the app and then re-open…wait there is what looks like a “config” button for a split second…f**k, went away before I could hit it..Try closing and re-opening the app again and got it in time! Note to self – add all these quirks to your own personal wiki for future reference in case I decide to actually migrate to HA from Homeseer….


TLDR;

My very first impressions are that Home Assistant can be a major pain to configure properly for users with any edge cases. Although extensive documentation (mostly) exists, and is presented as if it is accurately detailed and thorough, I am skeptical that it is kept current as both major and minor code changes are made. Cases in point are my issues with the Z-Wave JS add on, the quirk I found in the HTTP: section of the configuration.yaml file, and the “hit it before you miss it” configuration button on the mobile ios app. 


I also think that there is a confusing mix of UI and yaml file configuration options. Case in point is the Z-Wave JS add on. It appears to be solely UI driven, so I have no idea of how to bypass the UI configuration step and try and configure it via a yaml file - assuming that this addon has documentation for the yaml file configuration items, which with a quick search doesn’t appear to exist. 


I realize that this project is open source and community driven, so I need to lower my expectations a bit.  Therefore, at the end of day two, and even with all my initial frustrations, I am still am willing to continue to play around and kick the tires for another day or two since I see some glimmers of some very good features…..maybe (and I’m using homeseer terminology here) I’ll try and create a location based event to turn a virtual switch on and off…since I currently can’t connect any actual physical z-wave devices yet…."	17	"[""erunaheru: I don't have any suggestions for your Z-Wave problem since I don't use it, but for changing the URL in the app, go to settings -> companion app -> \\[your server name\\].

The logging isn't great and they are very strict about X-Forwarded-For headers being in the format they want.

Home Assistant is a *fast* moving project, especially when compared to HomeSeer.

The Znet worked great and gave me the ability to move and go back to HomeSeer while I was migrating. The only part I was hung on was I didnt really like the dashboard of HA and wanted HSTouch so was using MQTT to use my custom HSTouch screens I had thru the house. I've since grown to like the HA dashboards and have made the full cut over. I find HA leeps and bounds ahead of Homeseer and Homeseer development moving too slow for my liking. The fact they dragged their feet on Homekit was the nail in the coffin for me. But adter moving dont feel Homekit is as desired as it was. The amount of integrations that HA has over Homeseer is mindblowing. My Homeseer server has now been shutdown and I've moved almost all my events over. Had at least a couple hundred events and close to 500 devices and was able to migrate most everything in a week.

1683490998.0	07-May-2023 13:23:18	Stuck at second Post - It seemed like it should have been easy	uk_sean	1	13b1n4j	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13b1n4j/stuck_at_second_post_it_seemed_like_it_should/	"OK - Current Situation. I have a HA instance running on Docker. I have managed to get this to access my Synology NAS, read the HDD temperature values and output this to influxdb and then graphing on grafana. It took a while, but flushed with success I thought I would go another step.

I bought a Sonoff Zigbee Bridge Pro + Sonoff Temperature and Humidity Sensor (SNZB-02) having read that they were compatible

I plugged the bridge in, configured in EWELink and then added the SNZB-02 - and I get readings (yay - see this is easy). I even have its IP address

But now what? ChatGPT witters about  installing Zigbee2MQTT and add the device by IP address - but  Zigbee2MQTT doesn't seem to exist. Another source talks about Tasmota firmware

Nevertheless - I log into HA, Select Settings, + Integration and the only Zigbee I can find I is ""Zigbee Home Automation"" but when I click that it wants the serial port - so I guess its looking for a Zigbee Radio, probably via USB which isn't really an option for a docker container

Where am I going wrong or am I just being dumb, wrong hardware or am I going to have to put HA on its own hardware? All I am trying to do is get HA to read a temp guage for a room which I can then push to InfluxDB and graph on graphana

If I need hardware I have the following available:

* HP 800 G5 Desktop Mini
* ThinkCenter MT-M
* Aliexpress Fanless Soft Router Celeron J4125
* I Might be able to find a Pi - probably not a 4 though

My HA is running (currently) on Portainer on a Debian VM running on top of TrueNAS Scale. I could move it to a Synology if I need to get access to hardware and I might have another option on the TrueNAS if I have to - HA via an IX APP, or (reluctantly) Truecharts

1683481950.0	07-May-2023 10:52:30	Can't trigger smart light dimming with Zooz Zen74 toggle dimmer	Heroes_Die_Young	1	13axluy	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13axluy/cant_trigger_smart_light_dimming_with_zooz_zen74/	"I'm new to smart home automation beyond WiFi devices controlled via Alexa, but I do have smart lights scattered around the house. I wanted to be able to have physical switches in the house for guests to not be confused, and for my wife who yells at Alexa more than asks it to actually do things. So, I setup HA on an rPI4 with z-wave and zigbee dongles and set out to implement local control.

I got the Zooz Zen74 as a test case for the smart lights in the Kitchen. I setup automations on the switch and am able to turn the lights on and off though HA (local control on the switch is disabled, relay is always on).

I can't trigger a dimming action though. The triggers that show available on the device have confusing names, I've been assuming ""Central Scene action on Endpoint 0 Scene 001"" and ""Central Scene action on Endpoint 0 Scene 2"" essentially refer to the toggle being pushed either up, or down. The ""values"" are ""KeyPressed"", ""KeyReleased"", ""KeyHeldDown"", and ""KeyPressed2x"" through ""..5x"".

So, I setup automations on those triggers for the ""KeyHeldDown"" value  with parallel blocks to increase/decrease brightness of the relevant lights. If I run this automation manually from HA I have the expected result, albeit one step of brightness whichever way at a time. I can't trigger this using the actual switch though, I never have any traces when holding the toggle on the switch.

I've also tried changing the value to ""KeyPressed2x"" and wasn't able to trigger it either. Here's the trigger yaml:

    platform: device
    device_id: 490b3221995d20b680a9dc28a23e9f56
    domain: zwave_js
    type: event.value_notification.central_scene
    property: scene
    property_key: ""001""
    endpoint: 0
    command_class: 91
    subtype: Endpoint 0 Scene 001
    value: 3

TLDR: My Zooz Zen74 switch in HomeAssistant shows a ""turned off"" and ""turned on"" pair of triggers that work as expected. The ""Central Scene action Endpoint 0 Scene00X"" triggers don't seem to ever fire, but seem like they should expose the more complicate toggle actions. How do I make multi-click or hold key actions trigger?"	3	"['peterxian: Zooz products won’t send “central scene” events unless you configure the option to turn it on. For the zen74, that’s [parameter 13](https://www.support.getzooz.com/kb/article/648-zen74-toggle-dimmer-700-advanced-settings/).', 'Heroes_Die_Young: Thanks! That setting does indeed get the scene events to fire. I guessed correctly on what those scenes meant, though I don\'t understand this ecosystem enough to know why it\'s called that way.\n\nNow after I hold the switch down for a second or so the lights tick one brighter or dimmer, but don\'t keep going. This has got to be how I\'ve set things up in HA, but I don\'t see how to make the ""action"" loop while the trigger is true? Is that how you\'d make a toggle switch held down continue a bright or dim action?', ""Heroes_Die_Young: I got an email about a follow up response that now isn't here? This single switch is the trial run for several other areas in the house that already have smart lights, so smart switch<->smart light is something I'd really like to figure out. Any advice you can share on how I can manage the dimming would be greatly appreciated.""]"

I am struggling with an issue I can just not solve. I used to have an Fibaro double switch 2 in my garden that was routed via a roller shutter node. It used to work flawlessly but then stopped for some reason I don’t know. I wanted to replace it with another one but did not manage to include it. No matter what I tried. Even tested 2 other switches. With no luck. I then tried to include the switches right next (in the same room) to the controller (Z-Wave.Me USB Stick) using the ZWave2MQTT application. Worked like a charm. I included all 3 to have them ready whenever I need them. The next day I installed the switch in the garden again but it appears dead on ZWave2MQTT. Tried another I included before. Same result…

I have no idea how to make the switches connect to the closest node. Before the first switch stopped working, it has been 100% reliable and nothing else changed.

Also tried healing the network, re-interviewing the nodes…

Both switches (one being a backup in case there really is a hardware defect) are powered and are just waiting for the controller to say “Hi”…

I want the main switch of washing machine to go off when machine stops washing.

i started early with hue integrations into my home but since then slowed down in regards to smart home due to privacy and usability concerns

time has passed, my own possibilities have changed and i am now thinking about either getting a HA Yellow or running HA on my promox machine

what is the distinct advantage of having a standalone HA Yellow vs a virtual machine? (assuming i use eg a skyconnect dongle) 

HA Yellow and a CM4 cost quickly near € 250 ... a VM would cost me nothing besides the skyconnect dongle  


is one appliance better than the other?

and what VM iso would i use? a HA OS iso or rather a docker image?

is HAY maybe the better choice if i hope to use voice assistants in the future?

and will either one of the use cases enable me to get rid of my HUE Bridge or do i still need it?"	12	"[""Matt_NZ: I personally use HA in a VM (Hyper-V rather than Proxmox tho) and over the last two years I haven't ever found myself wishing I was using a Yellow instead.

In addition to HAs native backups, I also backup the VM so if something does go wrong, all I have to do is restore the VM and everything is back again pretty quick."", ""Whatsitforanyway: If you're like me I have a proxmox running 24/7 for a number of things.

If your host is running 24/7 anyways, you don't need any extra hardware (aside from a zigbee dongle or skyconnect). The advantage is that you probably have a lot more computing power you can use for things like frigate. If you don't have it on all the time and would just do so for Home Assistant, you're probably better off getting some dedicated hardware, but again, it depends on how power hungry your server/nas is. (you could do some calculations what it costs you to run it 365 days vs. what it costs you to get dedicated hardware and run *that* 365 days plus how ever long your server is up. If it doesn't amortize within 2-3 years, I wouldn't bother)\n\nYou could also look into the Odroid N2+ (pretty much Home Assistant blue) or even the newly supported Odroid M1, they're both around $100 and unlike the RP4 or even CM4, they're available.\n\n>and will either one of the use cases enable me to get rid of my HUE Bridge or do i still need it?\n\nYes. If you don't use the entertainment functionality/hue sync, you don't need the bridge (in both cases). It's as easy as removing them from the hue app, adding them to your dongle and just renaming them to what they were called before.\n\nI just recently moved all my hue bulbs and switches to Z2M and was done in about half an hour for 8 bulbs, 4 dimmers and 2 motion sensors.

At this point I've tried

&#x200B;

1. Reloading the configuration
2. Restart HA
3. unplugging and replugging in the skyconnect then restart HA
4. trying skyconnect in alternate USB port then restart HA
5. removing the Bluetooth range extender (sena, HA approved list) then restart HA
6. navigated to official skyconnect flash page and reflashed skyconnect to zigbee only
7. Repeat 1 - 5

&#x200B;

I have not been able to get it working since the update.

&#x200B;

I would just revert back to the backup it made prior to the update, but I've ignored it thinking I just needed to restart the system or it's something I could troubleshoot along the way and unrelated to the update.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure at this point but I've been on a binge of creating helpers, automations, and the like. I'd really love to not have to restore to that backup.

&#x200B;

Has anyone else had these two errors? Any solutions or possible advice?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance!

Light and exhaust fan. Motion/human sensor would turn off both automatically.

Is the most effective way of automating light turn on and light turn off/exhaust fan turn off being the combination of two smart switches and an independent motion sensor (aqara)?

I have an existing, small ZigBee network and am targeting ZigBee switches and motion sensors. Ideally, I'd like two dedicated switches as I already have a 2 gang opening in both of the bathrooms. 

Any recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thank you!"	9	"[""crispycornpops: I've found it much more reliable to use a contact sensor on the door. For a bathroom the door is (hopefully!) always closed when someone's on the toilet or in the shower. So lights turn on when bathroom door is closed and turn off (with 15 second transition) when bathroom door is opened. Simple and effective. I recommend the Aqara contact sensors.\n\nYou shouldn't rely solely on a motion sensor in the bathroom cause if you're in the shower it's hard to detect, and if someone is sitting on the toilet without making much motion the lights can turn off unexpectedly, that's a big no-no.\n\nAs for the exhaust fan I also use an Aqara temp/humidity sensor and it works well to turn on the fan when showering. In addition to that, if the bathroom door is closed for >3m I also run the fan for 2 mins to remove any odors."", 'beers-on-me: I have an aqara temp/humi in both bathrooms. They update pretty well on change.  When the difference in humidity is more than 8 the automation kicks the fan on if it’s not already on. When it drops back to within, the fan turns off. Works well, and seems to keep the moisture down. I don’t bother with motion, too easy to just hit the switch for lights.', ""dkode80: Using a contact sensor, isn't there a chance that the state of the sensor doesn't match if someone is or isn't in the room? I'm trying to understand how you wouldn't get into bad state (ha thinking there's someone in there when there isn't)"", 'dkode80: I see. That clever to use humidity instead of motion. Is it reliable enough that a person left the room when humidity falls. Both of these bathrooms are a room with just ta toilet or toilet with small sink. I think that may be good fit for humidity', ""crispycornpops: With our house we always close the bathroom door when it's occupied (for privacy) and leave it open when unoccupied so people know it's available for use. If your usage patterns are similar a contact sensor on the door will work near perfectly and be simple to automate (Door Closed = Lights On / Door Opened = Lights Off).\n\nThere's only two scenarios where a door contact sensor could be in a wrong state:\n\n1. If you close the bathroom door behind you after leaving, the bathroom lights will turn back on despite nobody being in there. I don't consider this a big deal: it's better to have lights on in an empty room than lights turning off unexpectedly when it's occupied.\n2. If someone uses the bathroom without closing the door (say to wash their hands, brush their teeth or whatever) the lights will not turn on automatically. I have a motion sensor above the bathroom door to handle this scenario - as soon as people walk through the door it turns on the bathroom lights for five minutes. If they're on the toilet or in the shower the door would most likely be closed and the door contact sensor would keep the lights on until the door opened again.\n\nIf your usage patterns are different you might have to experiment some more, but hopefully this is a good starting point."", ""LifeBandit666: Motion sensor inside the bathroom. Before it turns off for no motion check the door to see if it's closed. If it's closed there's someone in there."", 'beers-on-me: Fairly reliable. Depends on the sensors you have and the speed at which they update. However…\n\nNot sure if this would be a good use case for you…I have mine come on because the shower has created steam and I’m trying to make sure that’s vented for mildew prevention. It goes off automagically some time after the occupant has left simply because it needs to get some of the humidity out still. \n\nI doubt you’ll find a sensor that’s sensitive enough to react to the tiny humidity change a human causes in a room, if at all. You probably wanna stick with your first idea. \n\nFWIW, I’ve been in bathrooms that had auto lights and they went off on me. Pretty dang annoying, especially before cell phones were a thing. 🤣\n\nGood luck!', 'LifeBandit666: I\'ve had a button to turn my lights on in the bathroom since I added smart lights. \n\nI added the contact sensor later on the door, allowing me to say ""turn the lights off after a minute unless the door is shut, then just wait for it to open again, give it a minute and turn the lights off, unless the door closes again, then start the loop again"" \n\nThis week I\'ve added a motion sensor because I suddenly had some spare cash (redundancy money) and its simplified the automation greatly. \n\n""If there\'s motion turn the lights on. Count to 3 minutes and turn them off again. If there\'s more motion, start the count again. If the door is shut when you finish counting, wait until it\'s open."" \n\nI\'m planning on repurposing the button but just waiting until everyone gets used to the motion sensor first. We have a Eurovision party this weekend so I can clue all my friends in at the same time.', ""dkode80: Yeah I'm not sure I'll automate the lights turning off but definitely the fan.

I have just bought my first house, which is much bigger than what I have rented. Right now, I have an assortment of a few Hue bulbs, a few Kauf, and a few Tuya (non-Tasmota). 

I want to have every bulb RGB and the same brand, so I can keep hues consistent. The Hue bulbs are okay, but the price to fill the entire house is just too much for me right now. I want something entirely local. I would be open to WiFi, Zigbee, or Z-Wave.

What’s the best bang for the buck right now that will give me a good experience and not break the bank?

The only thing I've found that Inovelli does not support is cross fading from color to color... so there's no smooth transition when going from blue to red.  They are cheap for ZWave and super reliable though.  I've owned LIFX, Hue, Wiz, Kasa, Wyze, and a few others along with the mentioned three above.

So, i live in a fairly wifi congestion neighborhood already, to the point that i have to run 'wifi optimizer' every other months and the tp link mesh router app would suggest another channel. So...

+ mesh via mesh wifi technology

+ esphome directly integrated into HA

- slightly higher power consumption

- setup can be difficult (although i dont mind)

- routers might have a limited number of devices


Zigbee:

+ mesh natively

+ less power consumption

- somewhat depends on a non-HA backed zigbee2mqtt (i am concerned that one day the dev no longer has time to maintain or etc)

- can cause wifi interference

I want to switch my home automation to HA (that I test since several days with a VM). For this, I have a dedicated (overkill) computer with Ryzen 7 5800H CPU and RX 6600M GPU (that will serve to other projets too).

\- I think the GPU could be useful for Frigate: I have five cameras, two of those serve H265/HEVC files that the actual computer (which already have a Frigate instance since months) struggles with. For detection, I have a Google Coral (USB).  
\- I want HA to be as simple as possible so I want it to have the Add-ons store and don't want to configure myself all docker containers.

&#x200B;

I first thought to install HA OS directly on the computer with Frigate as add-on but I discovered that ""AMD GPUs are not supported because HA OS does not include the mesa driver""...  
So I thought about installing esxi/proxmox (because headless computer, simpler to have a web interface) and have HA OS VM + A VM for Docker containers but GPU passthrough seems to be complicated and disable some features like snapshots.

When I touch the two wires as a test, the fireplace turns on as expected.

How can I automate this?

It'll have to be something that's battery powered itself. So I think it'll have to be Zigbee rather than wifi. Is there any battery powered Zigbee switch that just makes a connection? When I google for battery powered Zigbee switches I just get all those scene control switches.

Any ideas appreciated!

In this case, the wall switch acts as a simple dry contact, completing the circuit. \n\nI replaced a dumb thermostat that came with my fireplace with a battery operated programmable Hunter thermostat. When on battery power, the thermostat provides a dry contact with the fireplace control wired to R and W/B. \n\nThe problem is, for a smarter thermostat, you need more power (than a few 1.5vdc batteries) due to the communications requirements. You could run 24vac to your thermostat, but for most thermostats this would have to land on the R terminal and fry your fireplace controls. This is because conventional thermostats were designed with minimal wiring (e.g., just two wires in many cases), and the wetting voltage from the furnace was also used to power the device. \n\nBut if you find a smart thermostat (compatible with your home automation system) with separate Rc and  Rh terminals, you could land a 24vac source on Rc and wire the fireplace across Rh and W/B. They do make thermostats like this, designed to run off 24vac provided by the furnace, and you can easily find 24vac power supplies on line. Make sure you verify the thermostat is not sending 24vac to your fireplace, as this will likely fry the controls. \n\nUnfortunately, the smart thermostat I bought did not have a separate Rc and Rh terminals, so I purchased a small 24vac relay with a pair of NC (normally closed) and NO (normally open) contacts. The thermostat energized the relay, which closed the NO contact, which was wired to the fireplace controls.

I just need to be able to manage and update the permanent list manually, and the temporary list through homeassistat (for example, on gate open, if a plate was recognized in the last 30 seconds, add to temporary authorization list with expiration of now + x time) and then use those lists in conditions, ie if recognized plate is in permanent or temporary list, open gate.

The tricky part I'm imagining is making sure the temporary list used only includes plates that are not expired.

CleverestEU	2	139txtn	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/139txtn/better_daily_lighting_rhythm_automation_plugintool/	"First, I have basically all my home lighting controlled by Home Assistant. They're all RGBW-controllable lights provided by ""WiZ"" (I'm not sure if this is an official manufacturer or simply a retail brand) but HA has had a native integration for these lights for ... about a year now, I think.

However... Originally when I installed the lights, the control was through ""WiZ app"", which allowed me to create a ""lighting rhythm"" which became one of the preset scenes HA is able to trigger. The thing is ... it only had a few specific times I was able to set a new color configuration for the bulbs ... and basically all the bulbs would switch to the same setting at the exact given time. This has recently started feeling a bit tedious :-/

Now I'm wondering if there are better plugins and/or tools to use with HA that would allow more/better options for the rhythm lighting? For example...

- Different rhythms for different days of the week? I don't need the ""wake up light"" to trigger on weekends when I'm not in a hurry to get to work :)
- Custom triggers for various zones (e.g. ""doorbell rings"" => ""lights in zones x & y make a few flashes and return to previous setting"")
- I would love if the lights could transition from one state to the next gradually ... instead of ""worktime lights"" clock hits 5PM ""off-work lights"" :-p

Any suggestions for existing plugins and/or tools? Or ... should I start making one of my own? The requirements aren't too difficult, but ... building it with the vanilla HA system seems to be somewhat - complicated.

We are pleased to introduce our second product, which is an environmental sensor, it contains a light sensor (BH1750) as well as a temperature and humidity sensor (SHT30), the core processor is Lexin's ESP32-C3. it is all integrated together, so it looks like a beautiful DIY electronic hardware, the shell has been carefully designed, it becomes a whole, without the use of screws It is the best part of it.

I think this is one of the biggest concerns, how they look like as shown in Home Assistant, here's how it looks on the interface, it has all this information, integrated together, and we can't find anything more rare. Because it is WIFI-powered, it can be very capricious to give feedback in very real time, without worrying about the battery products that do not update for a long time because of voltage and power consumption problems, and only have updates when changes happen.

As a price, you need to find a suitable installation location and method for the USB cable. Fortunately, we are using the current very popular TYPE-C interface and it is easy to find a cable that fits it.

This is the inside of it, you can see the three modules combined together, we didn't make a separate PCB, but we bought dozens of modules and chips and combined them with each other to find inspiration, we found this beautiful combination, after a long time of testing, it was considered stable, we liked the combination and we designed the shell for it. Then it became a gadget for ESPHome combination.

Let us show you this bottom structure, it's really delicate, CSZ's clever design makes the module and structure lie nicely inside, it's kind of amazing inside and makes the whole PCB completely different.

I've been playing with the Open AI integration in the Assist integration and it got me thinking on applicable uses for it.

Would there be a way to utilize it in Home Assistant without the Assist integration?  An example use case would be  a weather service which gives a very blunt, non conversational update of the weather, converted to something more conversational. (certainly not limited here though)

    Default: Today. Mainly sunny. Wind becoming northwest 20 km/h this morning then becoming north 20 gusting to 40 this afternoon. High 16. UV index 6 or high.

&#x200B;

    Open AI: ""Could you convert this to a more friendly weather report, limiting to 250 characters if possible?""
    It's sunny today with a high of 16°C. Expect the wind to shift from the northwest to the north with speeds of 20 km/h in the morning, gusting to  40 km/h in the afternoon. The UV index will be 6 or high. 

Are there any existing tools to have Home Assistant accomplish this task and have it saved in an input\_text field or similar?"	0	[]

I've seen various posts about flashing these devices; ESPHome seems to be a common reference.  My question is - if I flash my devices (assuming they can all be flashed..), does that mean I will no longer have this six monthly tuya issue?

My Philips dimmer switch is appallingly unreliable. Half the time instead of sending a command, the dimmer switch will just show some colourful LEDs then do nothing. I've tried relocating the hue bridge to see if this could help but it's still just as bad. 

&#x200B;

I have an old Samsung Galaxy Note 5, specs don't matter apart from two things... it has an OLED display and a front-facing camera. 

So here's my idea for a solution: Wall mounting it to replace the dimmer switch

When the screen is tapped or motion (with the front-facing camera) is detected, the screen wakes up to show a set of light controls. Alternatively, it could be always-on since the phone has an OLED display (and would always be connected to power). 

These light controls could match the Philips dimmer switch's functionality, which is as follows:

4 buttons:

1. ON - Cycles scenes when pressed repeatedly
2. Brighten
3. Dim
4. OFF

I picked up a Smart Säkring/Smart Fuse from Tempiro to monitor power via my fuse box for those things I can't use a smart plug for. (Oven, Hob etc). It is found by HA as you expect and looks like it should be properly connected but i'm not getting the power tracking data updates I should. I can control the fuse, on/off and I get this info in ZHA

As you can see, Summation Delivered is at 11kWh, but has been at that since I connected the fuse and has not changed. I've tried in a few different fuse slots with high and low-power use items, so I'm confident it's not updating as it's been connected for approx 24h now.

Any ideas what could be the issue? I've re-added it a couple of times, but it seems well connected and the pathway on visualisation is green.

At the moment my setup is like this: 

\-Raspi with HA connected to switch with fixed IP

\-wifi network 1 (router&wap) connected to switch

\-wifi network 2 (wap) to switch with different ssid to network1

&#x200B;

I need the ssid to be separate form each other. but the problem is when i acces Ha via the companion app on my phone on network 1 all is working fine, but if my phone is connected to network 2 the app can't connect. 

&#x200B;

Any idea how to solve this? This makes using the companion app very cumbersome.

I don't want to use the cloud service, and have tailscale setup already for outdoor acces, but would like to use the wifi most of the time because tailscale is very data hungry.

&#x200B;

Any input would be welcome!"	6	"['ge33ek: It’s hard to say without more information, but it sounds like you’ve tried to air gap SSID one and SSID two which both route through the same core network router, but essentially operate on different IP ranges.\n\nThe problem you have in this scenario is cross network routing. \n\nLet’s assume your first SSID offers range 192.168.0.1/24 and your second SSID offers range 192.168.1.1/24 - I presume you’ve designed the network with the intent of not allowing the first to connect to the second and vice versa. \n\nThe problem here is that your HA instance is in the first range and so won’t be able to get over to the other. \n\nTo remedy this, there are two things you could do, one is to create a bridge that allows traffic from your second SSID to your HA instance in your first SSID thereby create a tunnel or path through, or, when you’re on your second SSID you’ll need to use your VPN as it’s essentially a different network from your primary SSID as there is no crossover. \n\nI’m my scenario, I had the same issue I created a external way in via DuckDNS so when external it can get in if I’m on the mobile network, or other wifi networks other than the primary - no VPN. I did this because I didn’t want to bridge my two networks. \n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit: spelling, more context', 'Shooter_Q: I don’t know how it works with tailscale, but with wireguard VPN and iOS, I have it set to automatically connect to the tunnel home if disconnected from a particular SSID; in your case, SSID exception would be your primary network with all other networks going through VPN, no need to be strictly on cellular. \n\nYou might also consider setting up an external domain with a tunnel instead; I know some here don’t like that method, but it’s free and then your HA app is what will determine what address to use based on internal WiFi 1 connection or external, including WiFi 2', ""crabe919: Ok, thanks for the info, it's a bit more clear now.\n\nNo option in HA to implement a second network?\n\nHow do i bridge 2 networks together?"", 'crabe919: Thanks for the additional info!', 'ge33ek: Sure, if you wanted, you could add another network device to your HA device, cable or wireless and then you’d be able to access it on both networks, but you’d likely need to have two setups for each IP range in the HA companion app and switch between them. \n\nIt’s worth noting, that if both networks have the same IP ranges, this will likely create conflict issues, especially if you have wifi devices you’re controlling - then you need to get into static routes and that becomes far more complex\n\nIn terms of bridging the networks, this is more complex as it depends on your router, config etc.\n\n\nEdit: more context', 'crabe919: Food for tought...']"

I want to keep it local, but the built-in lacks some flexibility. For example, for Russian language it's not possible to handle word endings: for an entity alias ""теплица"" you can't create a sentence that would handle ""Какая температура в теплице?"" query, so you have to add all word cases to aliases. I can't see how I can do ""open the gate / close the gate"" queries having two different momentary switches for doing it (I use ""turn on the gate opening/closing"" for now). 

So it's not that bad, but it takes a lot to make it work properly. In Rhasspy's docs I found some intent recognition methods like RasaNLU or Flair: they use some natural language recognition that would make life much easier. Anyway I can't find a way to use Rhasspy as a conversation agent for Assist. 

Are there any other conversation agents?

Also I'm interested in local TTS engines for Assist other than Piper which doesn't support Russian."	0	[]

I'm trying to create an automation that sends a notification to my phone 20min before my upcoming Alexa reminder triggers.

This is what I see in Developer Tools:

    sensor.teiji_s_echo_spot_next_reminder
    State: 
    2023-05-06T00:34:00+00:00

    Attributes:
    reminder: Wash some clothes
    device_class: timestamp
    icon: mdi:reminder
    friendly_name: Teiji's Echo Spot next Reminder


The reminder time is 7:34PM (when converted to a readable format), and I want the notification to be sent out to my phone at 7:14PM. How can put this into a workable automation?

Edit: Figured it out thanks to ChatGPT! (Insane AI!) Now I just to test it, but I think it's correct.

Trigger template:

    {% set next_reminder = states('sensor.teiji_s_echo_spot_next_reminder') %} {% if next_reminder not in ['None', 'unknown', 'unavailable'] %}
      {% set next_reminder_datetime = as_datetime(next_reminder) %}
      {% set new_datetime = next_reminder_datetime - timedelta(minutes=20) %}
      {% set new_time = new_datetime.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S+00:00') %}
      {{ utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S+00:00') == new_time }}
    {% else %}
      false
    {% endif %}

Action:

    service: notify.mobile_notification_group
    data:

All has been well until just recently Alexa no longer is able to communicate with my Insteon devices. 

They still work within home assistant though just fine. 

I’ve disabled the home assistant skill within Alexa and relinked my nabu casa account.  

Nabu casa seems to be working fine as I can still control these devices via home assistant from my phone when I’m not connected to my home network.

I have things setup, and images are successfully being sent to the API, and some of them are even recognized.

However, it's only sending the lowest resolution image from the camera (640x360), whereas I'd really like to send the highest (3840x2160).

I have updates the settings on the camera (g4 pro) and checked the box for the highest resolution RTSPS stream only. It seems that the camera entity now uses this higher resolution when I look at the entity in HA.

However, it's still sending a 640x360 image to the Platerecognizer API, and I can't find any settings for this.

Any ideas?

Thanks!"	2	"['zlanlic: I\'m having the same problem. It was fine before, but now the images are in a low resolution since updating to Unifi OS 3.0.20 and Unifi Protect 2.7.34. The live streams in HA are still in the highest resolution because they are using RTSP, but still images (or the live streams if RTSP is disabled) are only in 640x360 for some reason. I guess the Unifi Protect API changed in 2.7.x, but I\'m not sure. In the meantime, you can try to log in to the camera directly (it has a webinterface you can access by going to the cameras ip adress in your browser), use username ""ubnt"" and as a password you can use the ""Recovery code"" you can find in the Unifi Protect settings. There should be a toggle ""Enable anonymous snapshot"". You can download the image from the cameras ip /snap.jpeg. (for example: ""192.168.x.x/snap.jpeg"").  \nMaybe you can try to send the snapshot image from the camera to the Platerecognizer API? If not, you can add the generic camera integration to Home Assistant and use the snap.jpeg URL as a still image source.  \nIt\'s not a good solution, but it\'s the only solution that worked for me. I tried to add the RTSP stream to HA as a camera, but it did not even play the video for some reason. I also found a solution somewhere that uses ffmpeg to get stillframes from the RTSP stream, but I\'m not sure if HA can even do that. The best solution would probably be an update to the Unifi Protect integration in HA to be able to receive high resolution images from newer versions of Unifi Protect.', 'omglolz: I got things working using go2rtc: https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc\n\nI setup the stream in go2rtc using the rtsp stream from protect under advanced camera settings, and then setup the camera like this:\n\nstream:\ncamera:\n  - platform: mjpeg\n    name: HiRes Gate Forward\n    still_image_url: ""http://localhost:1984/api/frame.jpeg?src=gate_plate""\n    mjpeg_url: ""http://localhost:1984/api/stream.mjpeg?src=gate_plate""\n\nI had some help from a friend soight not are to help much more, but these were the critical learnings.']"

My old, Watts brand recirculation pump didn’t have enough flow to kick on the tankless unit, so I had to buy another pump. This model gets installed not at the heater itself, but out at the farthest bathroom. And there is no thermostatic valve placed inline to shut off the flow when the hot water reaches that location. Instead, there is a thermocouple that shits the pump off when a certain temp is reached at the pump (I think that’s 100F). 

The way that the user is SUPPOSED to use the system is by hitting a momentary button that starts the pump again, which will again automatically shut off when the hot water arrives there. There are also wireless transmitters and a receiver available, and finally motion sensors. 

I’m sure I can wire up an ESP32 or z-wave dry contact relay, and if necessary I can override or replace the thermocouple with a Dallas one-wire temp sensor… but my real question is - what is the best user experience?

Since the pump will be in temp controlled space, the temp at the pump will probably drop at a predictable rate once it goes off. I can probably just actuate that contact every X number of minutes during the “peak” times of hot water use. Or I could rig up some proportional valve and get a magnetically coupled pump on a timer for those peak times. Off peak could be satisfied with a voice command.

Thoughts?"	4	"['50racer: Just some thoughts but depends time of how long the pump will take... How big your house is. \nIf using for shower or bath stuff.

Meaning... Hit the button once. I would assume the water is comfortably warm for the next hour.', 'MyloFiore: Great idea. I can definitely trigger the pump based off of the bathroom lights - and maybe the ""cooking"" or ""eating"" lighting scenes - if they fall outside the normal ""peak"" hot water times.', 'MyloFiore: Well, there are a number of negative factors that are starting to present themselves with this design. \n\n1) This pump costs $600. 2) It gets installed under the farthest sink (kid\'s bathroom) that does not have an outlet. 3) Pump will be ""non-silent"" in that location (near their bedrooms), 4) I would either have to run a bunch of wires in the attic to other parts in the house that benefit from the recirc (other 1/2 bath, kitchen, master bath) - or buy the wireless receiver and several transmitters.\n\nI\'m now thinking that I can repurpose a pump from my home brewery. It will be installed in the garage, near the unit, and I will have to buy a proportional flow valve to install under the kid\'s sink. I can buy that valve (and upgrade my home brewery pump) for less that $600, and less running new outlets and LV wires. \n\nI can then do all the automations in home assistant w/ESPHome and have instant hot water at any location in the house with minimal user interaction.']"

Genuine question here because even with my Cisco and Unifi gear my goal is to have as few smart home/IoT devices using WiFi as possible."", 'yvxalhxj: As a first step I would reduce the polling/push intervals of the devices where possible. This is certainly possible with Tasmota devices.', ""junkdumper: Move away from residential/consumer grade wifi hardware and you'll get much better stability.\n\nI use old enterprise gear off eBay and it can easily handle the 100 devices.   Also have multiple SSID setup to split everything up.   All my IoT stuff is on its own SSID, locked to to the 2.4ghz band.  It's also on its own VLAN, but that will be step 2 in your journey I bet."", ""PeterHaban: I've got one Fritzbox 7590 which handles the broadband uplink aided by two 7530s in Mesh mode to extend WiFi range. All connected via cat6 wired on the backend (TL-SG116E with a couple of 8 port switches on the edge). Runs very well including Fritzbox integration back to HA. I've got Hue lights but most other things via Wifi, homepods in most rooms, Plex distributing TV from HDTV/Sat/streaming and quite a few ESPHome devices (25-30). Total of WiFi devices is around 100 and all running well. My suggestions would be to look into ways to find the best place for access points, check how loaded up 2.4 is around you (many things like ESP32 don't do 5.0 yet), try to connect the mesh via a wired backend and avoid cheap kit. Anything you can offload to wired or other frequencies (ZigBee & friends) will make life easier and document as you install any new kit."", ""TabooRaver: Unifi access points and network segmentation are good options. You can get decent models for 100-150$ from when I last checked. Also make sure to enable client segregation and block devices that should be local only from phoning back home if that's a concern.\n\nBut it's important to note that there is an upper limit with wifi. For ongoing purchases, I would shift off of Wi-Fi and focus on hardwired devices first and zigbee/zwave if it needs to be wireless devices to mitigate the problem from getting worse. All wireless technologies are a shared media by design, so wired technologies will be best. Unfortunately you can't really implement some wired systems in a finished home."", 'BadMadScientist: Simple naivety when I started. I started with a google home speaker. Then one lamp. Then another.

Etc etc. had I known about zigbee etc I would have gone a different route for sure. And probably will going forward and when replacing old defective stuff but that’s a long term project unless I simply replace it all.', 'BadMadScientist: This is interesting and something I’ve not thought of. About two thirds of my devices are tuya or derivatives thereof. I’m not aware of any ability to change this but then again I’ve not looked.

Then I replaced the few smart plugs I had at the time with Zigbee plugs and then just kept adding Zigbee stuff. I have like 4 WiFi plugs left that need to be replaced.', 'Neapolitan_pizza: Yea depending on your devices,  this is something I have adopted just as a good practice even though I was never having wifi utilization issues,  more to get ahead of them.  With my esp32 or esphome,  I adopted the use of filtering sensors,  and using deltas for changes in values.  That way I can still set update intervals very frequently on the device itself but they wont bother to send any updates over wifi unless the delta filters change by a certain amount.   \n\nI reflashed my shelly 2.5 devices with esphome just so that I could use the filtering/delta features and not pollute wifi if not needed.\n\nRegarding wifi,  my 2.4 ghz band is dedicated to the dumb IOT devices that dont support better.  Anything capable of high bandwidth 5ghz I have a separate ssid for.  I separate ssids for 2 and 5 on purpose so the device cant accidentally fall back from 5 to 2ghz if it thinks it has a weak connection at the time, and pollute the 2.4ghz channel.  Essentially hard codes them to 5 this way.  My wifi is a tplink eap 670,  so pretty enterprise grade anyhow.

Apart from bulbs and sockets, what Zigbee products do you use?

A friend is building a new home and he asked me to do all the home automation. For the lamps I'll use Shelly 2.5. I would have preferred to use all Zigbee (and avoid using WiFi!), but I've never used any of these and I'm not comfortable using products that I don't know and from unknown/Chinese brands for important things.  
I'll use some Aqara temperature/humidity sensors (any other suggestion?), Aqara 2/4/6 buttons all around the house, a SMLIGHT SLZB-06 PoE ethernet coordinator and Ikea socket/USB charger as repeaters.

Any general suggestion? Any cool Zigbee products that I need to have a look at?

I am planning to keep an Aquara Zigbee temp sensor in each of my cars. My plan is when the car is out of the range my HA can't get any data from the temp sensor, else it will display the temperature.

What do you think? Is it a good idea or there might be issues with it?

Do you know any wifi, z-vawe, zigbee capable proximity sensor what I can use outside and can be integrated into HA?

My goal is just display the dashboard, the car is at home or not. The temp will be also fine, I can see the car temperature as well. 

Thank you!"	13	"[""kunigit: Not a bad idea. I'm not sure how well it would work with Zigbee, since they tend to transmit infrequently to save battery. \n\n433MHz temperature/humidity sensors (e.g. Acurite add-on sensors) transmit every 16 seconds, get better signal propagation than 2.4GHz, and the battery life is typically 12-18 months. It would require setting up an RTL-SDR dongle and running RTL_433 and an MQTT broker, but I think it's better suited for a temperature/humidity sensor network."", ""VaguelyFuzzy: Aqara sensors sometimes have trouble reconnecting to the network if they drop out (at least mine occasionally need a reset to reappear.) Also, the refresh interval can be fairly long, so they're not good for real time updates.\n\nI would personally use a bluetooth tracker for this application. For example, Ruuvitag should work great. It sends out an update every second, has pretty good range and can tolerate very high temperatures.

I've posted recently regarding problems I've been having with zigbee2mqtt.  I've been on their discord, posted in here and have completely uninstalled and reinstalled, new hardware etc. It just won't work. I also restored a backup from when it was working....still won't work. Never had a single issue prior to this (with z2m).  I went ahead and started a new VM of HA and setup z2m and it worked fine. So it's got to be something in my HA setup that isn't necessarily tied specifically to z2m and possibly more of a config conflict or something along those line. I have so many custom cards, intricate integrations etc. I can't fathom starting over just to get my zigbee working. Is there a way to migrate over little at a time opposed to restoring a previous backup?  If my concern is that it's a problem within home assistant, I'd like to import partials, check to make sure z2m is still working, add a little more etc. Is that possible? Or any other suggestion to try to nail down my issue to get up and going again? I even gave access to my server to one of the z2m mods and they couldn't figure it out either.

I am looking for some good waste reminder examples.
I imported the waste pickup calendar and at the moment, have a card which is showing how many days left on pick up of various waste types. 
Right now I have something like this in my mind: setup a reminder everyday at certain time to check if ""day left"" is one and keep reminding until I scan an NFC (NFC is not the focus of my post I can deal with it later). 
I am looking for some alternative ideas and/or suggestions on how to do my idea. I am struggling a bit on the automation condition, when I try to set up, I put everyday certain time as trigger and condition as if the state of any of the ""waste pickup day left""s is on 1 as state but when I try to set the condition on automation it only gives 2 options (unknown and unavailable)

It looks very similar to this:
https://www.manualslib.com/manual/2454005/Sprsun-Cgk-C-12.html#manual
There is zero documentation for my off-brand pump (off- and online), but looking at the display and its connector, I suspect it is using RS485 and Modbus. It has 4 wires in a RJ22 4C4P plug.
Does anyone know of any HA projects, preferably with accompanying Modbus accessories (RS485 over WiFi or similar)?
I could dive into reverse engineering it myself, but it may take quite some effort to figure out if the controlling logic (cut-off temperature switching, timer switching etc) is in the display or on the pump itself, and if there is an existing HA project, I'd much rather want to utilize that instead."	1	['Lectere: Google m5stickc with daikin']

I am hoping someone can help me.  I am quite new to Home Assistant and wanted to add my Supermicro server's IPMI sensor readings into Home Assistant.  

I have got the Sensors I want to be polled in a script that Cron executes every 1 minute, and then pushes to my HA vm.  All of the sensors I added have appeared in HA, but they do not update.  Cron executes the script every minute successfully, and when I manually run the script I get no failures, yet the sensors do not update in HA.  

My HA config files looks like this:

`mqtt:`

  `sensor:`

`- name: CPU Temp`

`state_topic: server_cpu_temp`

`unit_of_measurement: °C`

`unique_id: sensor.cputemperature`

`- name: PCH Temp`

`state_topic: server_pch_temp`

`unit_of_measurement: °C`

`unique_id: sensor.pchtemp`

`- name: System Temp`

`state_topic: server_system_temp`

`unit_of_measurement: °C`

`unique_id: sensor.systemtemp`

`- name: CPU Fan Speed`

`state_topic: server_cpu_speed`

`unit_of_measurement: RPM`

`unique_id: sensor.cpufanspeed`

`- name: Front Fan1 Speed`

`state_topic: server_front_fan1_speed`

`unit_of_measurement: RPM`

`unique_id: sensor.fan1speed`

`- name: Front Fan2 Speed`

`state_topic: server_front_fan2_speed`

`unit_of_measurement: RPM`

`unique_id: sensor.fan2speed`

My script looks like this:

`#!/bin/bash`

`SHELL=/bin/sh PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin`

`MQTT_IP='`[`10.0.1.150`](https://10.0.1.150)`' #HA VM`

`MQTT_USER='username'`

`MQTT_PW=""password""`

`IPMI_IP='`[`10.0.1.51`](https://10.0.1.51)`' #IPMI static IP`

`IPMI_USER='suppy'`

`IPMI_PW='plugsplugs'`

`NUMBER_OF_SENSORS='6'`

`CUT_COLUMN='5'`

`TOPIC[1]='server_cpu_temp'`

`TOPIC[2]='server_pch_temp'`

`TOPIC[3]='server_system_temp'`

`TOPIC[4]='server_cpu_speed'`

`TOPIC[5]='server_front_fan1_speed'`

`TOPIC[6]='server_front_fan2_speed'`

`SDR[1]='3.1'`

`SDR[2]='7.3'`

`SDR[3]='7.1'`

`SDR[4]='29.1'`

`SDR[5]='29.3'`

`SDR[6]='29.6'`

`for i in $(eval echo ""{1..$NUMBER_OF_SENSORS}"")`

`do`

   `PAYLOAD=$(ipmitool -I lanplus -H ""$IPMI_IP"" -U ""$IPMI_USER"" -P ""$IPMI_PW"" sdr entity ""${SDR[$i]}""|cut -d '|' -f$CUT_COLUMN|awk '{>   mosquitto_pub -r -t ""${TOPIC[$i]}"" -m ""$PAYLOAD"" -h ""$MQTT_IP"" -u ""$MQTT_USER"" -P ""$MQTT_PW""`

`done`

Here is my Cron job

`*/1 * * * * cd /zfs/docker/ipmi/ &&` [`script.sh`](https://script.sh)

So, if I restart the MQTT broker in HA, the sensors start updating for a few minutes then they stop.  Currently my cpu temp sensor (the one I care the most about) updated over 18 hours ago, and that is with manual executions of the script.  

All of this is quite new to me, so I am not really sure where to start troubleshooting.  Thank you for any help"	2	['itsaride: Use MQTT explorer or an MQTT phone app to see if messages are actually being sent to those topics.', 'fusrohdann: Thank you, I’ll read into them tonight']

I am trying to control my Endless Pool swim system with Home Assistant.  There is no integration.  I'm an avid Home Assistant user with modest skills but I'd like to take a crack at figuring out how to communicate with this wifi-connected swim system without going through their buggy/clunky app.  I've gone down the YouTube rabbit hole that put me on to Wireshark and Mitmproxy but am struggling to see the iPhone app send data to this swim system device on my network.  Could be mistaken, but I don't believe that the app is sending data to the cloud but rather communicating with the device directly on the network.  Any similar 'how to' examples out there?	8	"['imanze: There’s definitely no one set guide to doing this but a few questions/pointers that may help.\nI am not familiar with your device but just a basic google search, is this what you are trying to control? https://www.allswimltd.com/pdf/WiFi-Fit-At-Home-App-Installation-Guide.pdf\n\nReason I ask is because you are saying you are fairly sure the phone sends commands directly to the device vs the cloud. Typically with wi-fi devices this is not the case and the phone would actually be sending commands to the cloud which would send them back to the device. That device in question seems to have an option for direct communication by connecting to its wi-fi broadcasted ap. I would set the device into that mode and then switch over to a laptop. Connect to that access point on a laptop and see what you can detect. Typically in a setup like that the device will assign an ip address on its specific AP network range, it should be pretty easy to discover the IP address of the device. Using nmap should show you open ports and servers that it’s running. My guess there’s some api server and not much more.. \n\nSeeing often times this will give you some very good hardcoded information, i’d proceed to looking at the app they provide. Even if you don’t have an android device go and grab the android apk, typically can find any app on google. Run it though the android decompiler and click around. Most of the package is going to be dependencies and other random libraries, chances are their actual code will be in a very specific area. You can use some of the things discovered from the network scan to help your search, maybe a hardcoded port and local ip.\n\nIf this all works chances are you’ll see a very simple rest api.. \n\nA lot of this is hypothetical mostly because their design and implementation can be one of a million setups.', 'thereddevil20: This mostly involves reverse engineering the api and seeing what is being sent to the machine.\n\nSince it’s on your network maybe you can check out resources for your router to see what endpoints are being hit when you send commands.

Resources I am finding online show examples targeting iOS apps sending data to cloud.', 'thereddevil20: From some additional reading it seems wireshark can sniff the data on the network.\n\nMaybe isolate all the data being sent to the up address of your device and see what’s happening there? There are some caveats to this approach but it’s a good start.', ""aquaboy1: >6689 (IIRC) - Tuya, use minituya (or whatever it's called)  \n>  \n>80/8xxx/443 - probably http based, have a poke with a browser  \n>  \n>there will be more, but that's off the top of my head\n\nI appreciate the additional info!"", 'thereddevil20: Wireshark should help you figure out what data is going to the pool device, from what I’ve read.

For really annoying reasons, the float switches that normally turn these kinds of pumps on and off don't always work in my setup and I've burned out a few pumps because they end up running dry.

When the pump runs dry, I can audibly hear the difference and I'm betting that there's a sharp drop in current draw.  I'm wondering if I can use a smart plug + home assistant to monitor the current draw of my pump, and automatically turn it off if the current drops below a threshold.

I configured that outlet to come back ON in the event of a power outage instead of staying off.  Well one day, the power went out and that outlet stayed off when the power came back on.  This would be the only time I’ve ever had water come up from the sump well and onto the floor.  \n\nSince then, I  have removed that smart outlet.

I thought you, the community, might also be looking for a more optimized experience focused on your needs. However, it doesn't feel right for me to make all the decisions; who am I to say what is or isn't important to you? So, I'd love to involve you in the process directly, give you a platform to make some decisions and guide the direction of the store.

I've created an anonymous survey to help with this. I would be immensely grateful if you could take the time to respond, it will only take 10 minutes. If you'd prefer to leave comments here, that is 100% okay too. The survey just makes it easier for me to parse the data.

[Click here for the survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=iNVNjADKOEO0rRBxnxVZjTTjpYSnVtdMljE01XJOlphUQUIxU0dJOVpRSFdGN05aWlZBSUVSSllSTC4u)

If you know anyone else who might be interested in providing their thoughts, feel free to share the link with them. The more input I receive, the more certain I will be that my decisions are in the interest of the community :)

Transparency:

1. It will not be feasible for me to ship outside of Canada and the US at launch, but I consider this a top priority. I welcome input from anywhere in the world, since the ultimate goal is to serve the global community.
2. Not everything mentioned in the survey will be possible immediately after launch (I'm bootstrapping this project). Your choices will let me focus on the most important things first, and I will aim to offer as much as possible at launch.
3. The store will likely not launch for a few more months (thinking late Summer/early Fall)."	6	"['_Rand_: May I suggest you avoid readily available things as much as possible?\n\nLike, commodity items like cables and switches, I can get those easily from a number of locations and they will probably be for better prices than you can afford to stock as a small business.\n\nSell me stuff that is hard to find/relatively unique.\n\nLike say parts for ESPhome projects that don’t take 3 months to arrive (like from aliexpress) or is marked up by 50x (like amazon).', 'litemostlikely: Canadian here.

I've removed that question from the survey.\n\nI am definitely keeping enthusiasts/DIYers top of mind! Custom devices are admittedly not my forte, so I will pull together a component list over the coming months based on survey responses, and will seek more community input. Quick question on this topic: are DIYers only looking at functionality/compatibility of components, or does the manufacturer also factor in?\n\nFull transparency on pricing for these components: It will likely not be realistic to match AliExpress (I need to factor in customs and shipping costs that are not incurred by sellers in China), but I also wouldn't scam you like some Amazon sellers. My hope is that much faster shipping might offset moderately higher prices?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother goal that I should have mentioned is making it easier for beginners to transition. In that sense, off-the-shelf devices from recognizable brands will be necessary. Further, the majority of survey responses (\\~80%) up to now have indicated that they would expect some of these brands. The focus will certainly be on devices that are confirmed HA-compatible, with particular emphasis on those with local connectivity, MQTT support, and the like.\n\nI'd like to reach a point where people don't need to buy from three or four different websites to accomplish their goals, regardless of which category the devices fall into."", '_Rand_: For DIY stuff I find brand doesn’t matter that much for most things, it basic enough that it doesn’t matter much I guess.

If by buying in bulk you can get me somewhere between the two but not take 3 months to get it to me, even if you have some sort of minimum order amount, I’d consider that a win.\n\nAnd yeah I expect a variety of off the shelf stuff of course, I just don’t think cables, networking gear etc. is a good place to focus.  Its home automation adjacent at best and when you consider the wide availability and cheap pricing from Amazon, infinite cables, prime cables, ubiquiti etc. I think you’ll only get customers buying it because its an addon to other items.  \n\nJust doesn’t seem like something that will be beneficial for a small business like yours to bother with when there are a number of other categories that are directly in the market that feel underserved.', 'JustAutomation: Good to know regarding manufacturer.

I have a ""dumb"" ceiling fan that is connected to HA via an ESP32 (running ESPhome) that pilots the buttons of the fan remote. 

Each button of the remote is mapped to a switch in HA. Toggling a HA switch results in pressing the corresponding remote button. The switches are configured as momentary in ESPhome (the return off after 10ms).

The whole hack works well, but the obvious limitation is that I don't know the status of the fan and I can't set a specific fan speed: I can only increase or decrease the speed.

I am now trying to wrap these 9 buttons with a template fan but I need some help with set\_percentage.

The logic I need to implement should be able to derive how many times to toggle the speed\_up switch or the speed\_down switch, depending on the current speed and the percentage provided.

I think there is just no fool proof way to get the percentage detection right easily. \n\n I have done a similar set up for my kitchen hood. I tried using energy monitoring with those close clamp current detector in the main circuit breaker. It does work but detection is delay since it takes about 30 second for current to settle so quickly changing the fan speed will defeat this detection. It’s not a resistive load so the steady state changes all the time. I run calibration everyday at night but it’s still unreliable. \n\nAlso not sure what you fan behave if just getting powered on, does it start at the previous speed or does it go to a set speed. After my failed attempt at power monitoring (really not a big deal but partner gets super irritated if hood gets turned to max).  I also resort to counting the button press cycles. Issue is that it can be defeated by a person manually setting the speed then you don’t know where you are. Again to over come this whenever I change speed I have to do a few clicks to make sure fan is at lowest speed then click back up to appropriate speed. \n\nThe other is to get an idea of how your fan changes soeed, is it based on potentiometer, in the case of my hood it has a few wires each is triggered depending on fan speed, you can probably put a clamp across each wire to find which is triggered but it was a bit over kill for me so I didn’t set it up that way.', 'Rudd-X: Mod the fan directly using your ESP device bro.

Idk what I'm overlooking here but how can Home assistant tell if the Ecobee3 lite's fan is running? The native integration has over 2-3 minute delay for the fan attribute to change. The Homekit Controller integration updates instantly but cannot seem to determine if the fan is on explicitly.

Fan is set to run minimum 5 minutes every hour. I got this partially working indirectly by checking the ""fan\_mode"" and ""hvac\_action"" attributes which works if I manually set a fan hold or if the fan turns on during heating or cooling. This doesn't work when the fan runs as part of the min fan time because those attributes stay as ""auto"" and ""idle"" respectively.

Can't find a clear answer about this online and I definitely don't want to hook up an ESP based sensor to the fan to detect it directly...

In short, that's usually not the way you want to go.\n\nHere's a pretty [good UK-specific resource](https://youtu.be/9u_kQ9gW9Cg?t=167) if you're trying to get started. His personal preference was for Zigbee switches, but he's going over some considerations that apply to Wi-Fi switches as well.\n\nIn terms of low cost, once you throw in dimming capability, I think you'll find there's not too much cost difference between switches of comparable quality."", ""voiceoverguyuk: That's awesome, thank you, will take a look.""]"

I started looking into Home Assistant and thought how cool is this and wanted to create my own with some spare tablets I found lying around the house. I tried reading some info and found all this very confusing. As you can see, I'm very new to this and I have a lot of smart home devices around the house and just tired of all the multiple apps i have to use on my phone for each one.

I downloaded the HASS app on my tablet but seems like that's as far as i can get. I went on the website, but the downloads page has like 3 of everything so I'm not sure what to get. From what I can see, i have to set my dashboard online, but do I need to download anything to my PC?I don't even know where to go to create an account.

Can someone provide me a clear step by step on how to set HASS up using a tablet please? I'm not even sure where to start or what i need or what to download on my tablet. I'm sure there's a lot of these posts around, but it's quite a bit to search as everyone has their own opion. Guys on YouTube don't help either with their comidic videos or ""I just built a dash but won't show you how to install the app"" videos.

Thank you kindly,"	12	"['sleekelite: You’re confused.  You need to install HA on a real proper computer - from a PC to a raspberry pi.

*Short question:*  
Does anyone know of a Zigbee device that plays a (predefined) sound when triggering it?

*Long story with context:*  
I'm looking into smart doorbells **without** a camera or microphone. I have a 30 year old loud doorbell that I can't easily turn on or off. But I also have a baby that I would very much like not to be woken up by the doorbell. And people definitely ignore notes on the door not to ring so I need a foolproof solution.

So my requirements:

* Smart doorbell, that will send me a persistent notification when someone is at the door.
* Item that plays a sound when someone is at the door that I can turn on or off. Bonus points if it's portable.
* I don't need or want to be able to talk to people at the door or see them.
* For privacy reasons, I'd prefer not to use some external service for notifications. But because there's no video or audio, I guess that is less important.

There's very limited options, the only affordable one I could find was the Aeotec Doorbell 6 Z-Wave Plus (€75). Now, I have everything in my home using Zigbee, not Z-Wave, so I'm thinking I can either go three ways:

* Cave and get a Z-Wave connector for my Home Assistant and use the Aeotec doorbell. Guesstimate for the total solution: €100 ish.
* Play a sound through the Sonos speakers I have. Cheap (because I already have them), but likely too slow. So not really an option.
* Buy or build a small sound device that plays a simple sound when triggered by a zigbee signal through Home Assistant. I'd use one of my spare Ikea buttons I have lying around. Total price: hopefully cheaper than a 100 bucks.

Now I'm thinking I could probably build something with a little microcontroller, but maybe there are some out of the box solutions I could use for this? My searches have so far not resulted in anything useful.

Any help or ideas are much appreciated!"	9	"[""sejoki_: Does it **have** to be zigbee? You can get a [DFplayer mini](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU_DFR0299).

I have templates like this:

`template:`

  `- sensor:`

  `- name: Downstairs Temperature`

`device_class: Temperature`

`icon: mid:home-thermometer` 

`state: >`

`{%- if state_attr('climate.downstairs', 'current_temperature') != None %}`

`{{state_attr('climate.downstairs','current_temperature') | float }}`

`{%- endif %}`

I end up with a graph that looks like this on a regular basis.

Believe it or not my house didn't magically jump up 11 degrees and back down in the space of 15 minutes :-) Does anyone have any suggestions on how to throw out the anomalies?

FYI my logs are full of messages like these, which based on my understanding of the Kumo Cloud system, is pretty typical.

`SELECT`

  `COUNT(*) AS cnt,`

  `COUNT(*) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM states) AS cnt_pct,`

  `SUM(LENGTH(attributes)) AS bytes,`

  `SUM(LENGTH(attributes)) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(LENGTH(attributes))  FROM states) AS bytes_pct,`

  `entity_id`

`FROM states`

`GROUP BY entity_id`

`ORDER BY cnt DESC`

It was a nice way to see if I had something that was consuming way more of the database than was necessary (e.g. a Shelly power measurement I wasn't using).

I'm guessing that 2023.4 broke this query with the database updates. I'm pretty good at modifying a query, but not great. Before I start trying to recreate this with the new schema has anyone already solved this?"	0	[]

Just tested the new whisper add-on and it lags pretty badly on my RPi4 and the only sensible model option that actually runs, tiny-int8, has about 40% WER (word error rate) in my language (Polish) which is basically unusable for anything. I wanted to run whisper on an external, beefier server, I made this docker-compose:
```
services:
  whisper:
    image: homeassistant/amd64-addon-whisper:latest
    container_name: whisper
    ports:
      - 10300:10300

volumes:
  whisper-data:
```
which in theory runs the same command as the official add-on does. Then I add the wyoming integration in HA with the IP of my docker host 192.168.10.22 and 10300 port. It adds successfully, I can select it as the speech to text option, but when I try to use it in the conversation window it just hangs on listening indefinitely and never do anything.

Nothing in HA logs, whisper docker logs says it's running fine:
```
INFO:__main__:Downloading FasterWhisperModel.TINY_INT8 to /data
INFO:__main__:Ready
```

and doesn't output anything when I try to dictate commands. When I run the whisper server health check  command:
```
echo '{ ""type"": ""describe"" }' | nc -w 1 192.168.10.22 10300
```
from the homeassistant container I get this response from the whisper server:
```
{""type"": ""info"", ""data"": {""asr"": [{""name"": ""faster-whisper"", ""attribution"": {""name"": ""Guillaume Klein"", ""url"": ""https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper/""}, ""installed"": true, ""models"": [{""name"": ""tiny-int8"", ""attribution"": {""name"": ""rhasspy"", ""url"": ""https://github.com/rhasspy/models/""}, ""installed"": true, ""languages"": [""pl""]}]}], ""tts"": [], ""handle"": []}}

which indicates that HA conatiner communicates with whisper server just fine.

Playing with HA for a long time now, I struggle to migrate a full backup over a fresh install on a M.2 Sata SSD....

Here's my setup:
- Raspi 4B, 3A power supply
- HassOS currently running on SD card
- An M.2 Sata 240Gb SSD
- 2 different external USB 3 M.2 external cases for tests. 
- Latest HassOS install (10.1) and 2023.5. (also tried in 2023.4.x). 
- SSD boot sequence made via Raspi Imager: Done. 

My issue is I cannot restore any backup previously made on the SSD, with or without encryption (aka password protected). 

a fresh HA install on the SSD works every time, But as I attempt to restore a previous backup, nothing happens but some few activity LEDs blinking from time to time, even after a few hours...

What I've tried so far:
- fresh install on the SSD with Raspi imager
- Runs it ony Raspi 4 : works. I can provide my credentials then land on the dashboard. 
- Then try a full restore via the system tab:: Fails every time. 
- Tried a Direct restore via the onboarding page, without filling credentials: fails every time.

1683190473.0	04-May-2023 01:54:33	FP2 Honest Review	Xorfee069	5	137esrz	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/137esrz/fp2_honest_review/	"This is a follow up review from this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/135x4ea/fp2\_integrated\_into\_ikea\_ceiling\_lamp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/135x4ea/fp2_integrated_into_ikea_ceiling_lamp/)  


I got a few questions about the usability of the Aqara FP2, and this is my honest answer after testing it for almost one week.

&#x200B;

So, where do I start now? Prior to that, the Aqara FP2 can be used offline. You just need to set it up once with the Aqara app. After that, you can restrict it from your router to access the internet and integrate it later via HomeKit controller to your home assistant. I have bought a few FP2s now and mostly placed or hid them in the ceiling because most of the rooms I go to are not that big that I need zones. However, for those rooms (e.g., bathroom, office, bedroom), the Aqara FP2 works pretty well with no issues so far. The downside is that there are no specific configurable zones, such as when you move on the right or left side of the room, or you can't even mark anything on the map of the Aqara app. I wish there would be a detection just for entrance or leaving zones. At this point, there are no real issues here, and lamps on and off schedule work pretty well, even when you are staying still.

&#x200B;

Now, here is the downside: 

&#x200B;

Mounted: Wall 

Room: Living room 

&#x200B;

In my previous post (see above), I set up different zones for my living room, especially to coordinate specific routines (e.g., sitting at the dining table will turn on the lights from that table) and also what happens when, for example, my wife is sitting at the table and I am watching TV. I can even control my TV behavior like stopping when someone is leaving the couch and the next place on the couch is occupied. At first glance, it worked pretty well, but after a while, the automation messed up, especially when my cats moved more than expected in my living room.

&#x200B;

What I also mentioned was that sitting far away from the sensor (5 meters and upwards), the zone detection does not work well, especially when you sit/stand still for a few minutes (10 minutes or so). In my setup, the recognition of my couch zones is not that precise, so some of my couch automation (like leaving the couch will stop playing my Apple TV when I watch movies or so) often falsely triggers those automations. I was pretty sure that sitting next to the sensor, like my dining table, wouldn't have some false triggering since the detection should be clear because the dining table is like 1-3 meters away from the sensor. However, this is also wrong. When you are sitting still and not moving for a few minutes, or someone approaches next to you and leaves, the sensor thinks (or operates) so that your detection goes over to the person, or sometimes you just disappear from the detection. Imagine sitting at the table after sunset, and someone approaches you and leaves the room, leading you to sit in the darkness again.

&#x200B;

After all, I see no difference between my FP1 and FP2, which operates in the same way. Also, the response time is pretty much the same for the ""Presence\_event"" of my FP1.  
I thought the WIFI Version will increase the Bandwidth and make the Presence Zone Detection better, but I can't really see a difference to my Zigbee FP2 (with ""Presence\_event"").

I am not sure, how the EPS1 acts in terms of ""being present"" for a long time, but my FP1 and Motion Sensor T1 works pretty flawless even better then the FP2.

&#x200B;

Also, for your information, I always use a power bank first to position the FP2s in the correct place, as I did with the FP1s. It helped me a lot to get the right detection for the specific room.

&#x200B;

Anyways, do you guys have the same issues?"	10	"['windark776: the problem you met shall be fixed in 2 month. we will update the firmware to fix it.', 'Mysterious-Bowler15: The same experience on my site, I also noted that my FP1 is working much better and the cost of the FP1 is half the price of a FP2. I bought the FP2 to set up fall detection in my mothers apartment she is 84 and has some problems to walk so i thought with this device we can monitor her. But so far no luck we installed the FP2 on the ceiling set up for fall detection. After setup we let our kids do some fall simulations but we did not see any reaction of the sensor.', 'windark776: why the issue that  the moving one take over the still guy, is that we have strict rules for the create of the second target，like：\n\n1. in 1 meter, no other target can be created. \n2. if some one is moving， the target will same angle can not be created.\n\netc.\n\nwe will share the rules later so that you can manage the sensor more.\n\nwe are really sorry for the hard setting and fault recognition, and sure, we have power to fix these issues.', 'Xorfee069: Where did u get the information from ?', 'Xorfee069: Wow didn’t expect that some of you guys are reading actively :) nice to see . Can you also add some ceiling location coordination.

I don't have an FP2 yet but this makes me way more likely to get one in the near future. \n\nIt's an innovative product and as a software engineer I can only imagine the complexities involved. Best of luck!"", 'windark776: Really  appreciate，thanks.\n\nwe will keep on working for it.', 'Xorfee069: Also feel free to ask in this subreddit for improvements.. using aqara products on daily basis for clients also.

The 2 bulbs I have are turning themselves on once each morning, but not at the same time (i.e today 1 turned on at 08:37 whereas yesterday the same light turned on at 07:56). Each bulb also turns on at a different time.

As far as I can see the call isn't coming from HA as the logbook just shows ""\[light name\] turned on"" and I don't have any automations running when the problem occurs.The bulbs are both connected to HA via ZHA using the Sonoff USB Coordinator and I don't have any ikea remotes that I've seen have caused similar problems for others.

The only slightly unusual thing about my setup is that the lights in question are wired to Sonoff mini relays behind the light switches. When wiring the relays up I put the live wire going to the bulb into the same connector as the ""live in"" so that the bulb would always have power and I then use an automation to toggle the bulb state when the light switch changes state. HA doesn't show anything happening with the switch so I don't believe this should cause the issue.

I know these bulbs default to on when there is a power cut, but both bulbs seem to turn on at different times, and also I have a UPS on a server at home which isn't showing any power anomalies so I don't think the power is cutting out. Also, both bulbs are on different lighting circuits.

Essentially, this is what I did: [https://smarthomescene.com/guides/how-to-install-home-assistant-on-proxmox-the-easy-way/](https://smarthomescene.com/guides/how-to-install-home-assistant-on-proxmox-the-easy-way/)

So, VM loads up, I get to the point where it displays the Home Assistant's IP address and port number. So, I go to that address, and it instructs me to wait \~20 minutes.

So I wait, and all is well so far after I come back \~20 minutes later, and I am prompted to create an account. 

So I follow through the prompts...

Right after it asks me about data collection / transmission (send error reports or not, etc.) and I click Next, I get this:

So, I figure, well, better wait for it to finish doing whatever it's doing.

So I wait... and wait some more... 5 hours later, still at this screen.

Tried refreshing... I get the login screen, which accepts the login credentials I created in the first step of the wizard.

But then right back to that screen which just shows ""Home Assistant"" at the top.

I wait a few more hours... no change. 

Tried loading up in a different browser... nope, same thing.

&#x200B;

Here's what the VM's display shows:

Now, I just got the ESPHome ESP32 Bluetooth Proxy up and running, and the devices all showed up after a couple of minutes, and I was prompted to install the ThermoPro integration, and all 4 were added to HA with only one issue: I have no idea which one is which!

&#x200B;

[How do I figure out which one is which?](https://preview.redd.it/mzn6obysorxa1.png?width=307&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=48eed606364a599a04373b51a1fa31b22aea3833)

&#x200B;

I assume that the 4 hex digits are some kind of unique ID for each device, but it's not printed anywhere on the device itself, and the names I gave them in the ThermoPro Android app don't seem to propagate anywhere beyond that app. The app also doesn't show any sort of serial number, etc., for the devices.

Short of placing each one, individually, outside in the sun, and checking the readings, is there any sensible way to identify which device is which? I'll resort to that if I have to, but it seems like I must be missing something obvious.

Any help?

I'm currently trying to set up HA in docker with Authelia SSO. Everything is directed on SWAG, and with its NGINX, it is routed. I'm using this setup since I have multiple containers in docker that do not have authentication, and I want to do SSO for all of them. So far, I have it all running, but I need help using the mobile HA app. I believe that my issue is with SSL certificates generated by Let's Encrypt.

Here are the relevant parts from my docker file in this paste bin. [https://pastebin.com/8iQpg3kP](https://pastebin.com/8iQpg3kP)

My Authelia config is configured so it can handle the app. The Authelia leaves bypassed the default domain, and then all subdomains need to be verified by Authelia service except the app (which is dumb, but I think that it is the only current workaround)

    access_control:
      default_policy: deny
      rules:
        - domain:
          - alsyko.duckdns.org
          policy: bypass
        - domain:
          - ""*.alsyko.duckdns.org""
          policy: one_factor
        - domain: ""homeassistant.duckdns.org""
          policy: bypass
          resources:
            - ""^/api.*""
            - ""^/auth/token.*""
            - ""^/.external_auth=.""
            - ""^/service_worker.js""
            - ""^/static.*""
            - ""^/local.*""
            - ""^/hacsfiles.*""
            - ""^/frontend_latest.*""

When I try to log in with the app, it will log in after it says that the mobile authentication is not enabled and proceeds to the dashboard.

\* http//ha.domain.duckdns.org:8123 - I need to use this URL.

Can I somehow use Authelia for verification? How do I fix SSL so I can log in with HTTPS instead of HTTP? In the ideal scenario, I would remove HA authentication and use Authelia for mobile and web. Is it possible?

Also, I wanted to ask how I can make Authelia protect \`localhost:8123\`/IP. Currently, it just directs to a home assistant or any other docker container."	2	"[""alex3305: AFAIK this is currently not really possible. What you really want is that Home Assistant can act like a OAuth2/OpenID Connect client, but that is simply not implemented. Home Assistant only acts like a OAuth2 server, which you don't want.\n\nHowever, what you could do is [skip authentication](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/providers/#skip-login-page-examples), but than you are unable to utilize users in Home Assistant. Another option is to create something to use the [Command Line Authentication Provider](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/providers/#command-line) but IMHO that's a real hassle to get working with OAuth2.\n\nHaving those exceptions you've listed is IMHO pretty dumb too. It just defeats the purpose of having another authentication layer. \n\nI would love to see that Home Assistant has a separate authentication and security layer instead of being built-in. That would IMHO even be more secure, because it can be updated independently, just like Supervisor. However I get that such a thing isn't exactly a priority."", ""Luppo_: Yeah it's not ideal but I need an authentication for other services anyway so I'll just keep it with home assistant expeditions and I'll keep the exceptions.""]"

Love it. Now I've just gotten my hands on another server and am looking to build another Proxmox server and  set up a cluster for high availability, fun, etc.

All of my devices connect either via wifi or my Zooz 800 USB stick through Z-Wave JS. Is there a way for both of those Proxmox servers to be able to access that USB stick, in case one of them goes down either for repairs/upgrades or any other reasons? I'm looking at some USB-over-ethernet extenders, and the ones I'm seeing that aren't over $100 say they support only USB 1/1.1 speeds. I'm also not 100% sure how Proxmox would handle a USB device that it accessed over IP, though it would allow multiple devices to connect to it.

Running a mosquitto server is something I've considered, running Zwave via mqtt, but the problem is kinda still the same. Either I run that off a completely different box (frankly, introducing another something that needs updating and attention), or my mqtt servers are also running on the Proxmox boxes which presents the exact same issues. 

Anyone else run across this and have any suggestions to offer?"	5	"['CorvetteCole: Fyi, Proxmox clustering with two servers is a bad idea. You need at least 3 to form quorum. If a server goes down, the other two will attempt to communicate with each other to achieve ""quorum"" which is basically defining the definitive state of the cluster.  With only two servers, when one goes down or is disconnected from the LAN the other will have no way to know if it is the problem or if the other server is so it will refuse to perform any operations.', 'username_taken0001: As other mentioned, running only two proxmox nodes is not going to work (on default settings disabling one node is going to disable another too, because there will be no quorum). You can force the querum to work, basically disabling it, but it is also going to break the High Availability. I think a better solution, with two server,s will be to run the home assistance on one server, and the use the second one for backups. Backup it regularly on the other server running proxmox along with the proxmox backaup server. That way when your first servers fails, you should be able to manually start another instance from the backup. You can either bring the dongle, or buy another one (at least with the sonoff one, I had no problems starting from backups using another dongle).', 'DrClawski: so .. is there a way to cheaply add a third node, for example using a raspberry pi 4running Pimox?\n\nI currently have a cluster of 2 nodes, originally 3 but I decommissioned a node a while back.

I recently conducted an experiment to compare the different sensor options and capabilities available when using a Fire Tablet with Home Assistant. For reference, my HASS install is on a Synology NAS using the VM Supervisor option. I tested three different installation methods/access points to display it on our wall panel:

1. Fully Kiosk Browser
2. Home Assistant (HASS) App from Amazon App Store
3. Home Assistant (HASS) App from Google Play Store (Requires jailbreaking Fire Tablet)

Here's a summary of my findings:

**Fully Kiosk Browser** provides the least number of sensor options, but it offers excellent control for managing the device when running in kiosk mode. With this option, you can control screen brightness, screensaver settings, device orientation, and remotely send commands to the browser. It also includes sensors related to battery status, memory, and internal storage; and is the **only option** that offers motion detection and local capture of both audio and video through the device. However, it lacks many of the sensors related to audio, Bluetooth, location, notifications, and device settings that the other two options provide. I also found the fully\_kiosk.load\_url to be much clunkier than the notify.mobile\_app option of changing screens; the former requires a full UI reload that displays the logo and the navigation elements until the page fully loads.

Some of the unique service calls available through the Fully Kiosk Browser include:

* Bring the browser to the foreground
* Load the start URL
* Send the browser to the background
* Restart the browser
* Reboot the device

**HASS App from Amazon App Store** offers a middle-of-the-road option in terms of available sensors. It provides a similar set of sensors as the Google Play Store version, covering aspects such as audio, Bluetooth, device settings, and network status. However, due to Amazon's restrictions or modifications, some location-related sensors like ""sensor.kiosk\_goog\_geocoded\_location,"" ""binary\_sensor.kiosk\_goog\_android\_auto,"" and ""sensor.kiosk\_goog\_detected\_activity"" are not available in this version.

Both the Amazon App Store and Google Play Store versions of the HASS App offer similar service calls, which primarily focus on device settings and sensor updates. Some of these include:

* Setting the screen brightness
* Setting the screen off timeout
* Setting the volume level for various audio channels
* Updating the sensor values

**HASS App from Google Play Store** provides the most comprehensive list of sensors and controls. It includes sensors related to audio, Bluetooth, location, notifications, and device settings, along with extensive information about device status, battery health, storage, network, and Wi-Fi. This option offers the greatest amount of detail and control over the Fire Tablet by leveraging the companion app's [notification commands](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/notification-commands/) (also available to the Amazon version). However, to access the Google Play Store version, you will need to perform some [workarounds](https://www.howtogeek.com/232726/how-to-install-the-google-play-store-on-your-amazon-fire-tablet/) or otherwise jailbreak your Fire Tablet to bypass Amazon's restrictions.

**So, which one wins?!**

If you're looking for one app to rule them all, the Google Play Store version of the HASS app offers the most sensor options and detailed information. However, if your aim is to achieve maximum control over your device, then a combination of the Google Play Store app and Fully Kiosk truly gives you everything. FWIW this is where I'm headed, and I haven't yet decided which will serve as my primary screen and which will be running in the background. In any case, combining the Fully Kiosk Browser and the HASS App from the Google Play Store will provide a solid foundation for controlling various aspects of the device. 

**What are others using?** Have you experimented with more than one of these apps? Check out my screenshots of the different sensors each option provides, and chime in if you have any questions or different perspective on the topic!"	3	"['tarzan_nojane: WallPanel app for Android by [TheTimeWalker](https://github.com/TheTimeWalker/wallpanel-android)', 'uuberr: What would you say are the primary benefits of WallPanel over FullyKiosk? The latter has a strong community of support and a pre-built home assistant integration.', 'tarzan_nojane: Designed to be an Android launcher, using the camera as a ""proximity"" sensor.  Works well with built-in light sensing and other screen saver tech.']"

If you're like me and thought the ""[world's most private voice assistant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YJzLIMrnGk)"" announcement was super cool, but want to use a VoIP phone instead of an analog phone, here's how to set everything up. This guide discusses the HA Asterisk configuration steps, but does not cover how to configure your specific VoIP phone or the new HA assist settings.

I'm brand new to VoIP and Asterisk; This guide is designed to help other newbies.

​

Prerequisites: Your phone must support SIP and the OPUS codec.

​

**Step 1:**

Install and set up Asterisk following [this tutorial](https://tech7fox.github.io/sip-hass-docs/docs/tutorial/add-on) (only the linked page, subsequent steps not required).

**Step 2:**

Navigate to /config/asterisk/custom in your file manager and create a file called `pjsip_custom.conf`.

This creates the ""user entry"" for your phone. Stolen form [this tutorial page](https://tech7fox.github.io/sip-hass-docs/docs/add-on/guides/doorbell). The `assist` entry sets the assist endpoint settings and will be used in the next step.

In `pjsip_custom.conf`, include the following...

    [1000]
    type = endpoint
    context = default
    disallow = all
    allow = opus,alaw,ulaw    ; Audio codecs
    allow=h264                 ; Video codecs
    direct_media_method=invite
    dtmf_mode=info
    callerid=""VoIP Phone"" <1000>
    force_rport=no
    aors= 1000
    auth = auth1000
    
    [1000]
    type = aor
    max_contacts = 1
    
    [auth1000]
    type=auth
    auth_type=userpass
    password=mypassword        ; Set your password here
    username=1000
    
    [assist]
    type=endpoint
    allow=!all,opus
    direct_media=no

Note: ensure you set a password. The default is ""mypassword"" which is also fine. This will make your VoIP phone's extension ""1000"".

**Step 3:**

Navigate to /config/asterisk/custom in your file manager and create a file called `extensions.conf`.

This is the add-on's stock `extensions.conf` file with one line added. The line tells Asterisk to route extension 1001 to a SIP server with IP ([192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1) in example) at port (5065 in example) with a 20 second timeout.

In `extensions.conf`, include the following...

    ; Note: this file has been modified from the Asterisk defaults for the add-on
    
    [general]
    static=yes
    
    [default]
    include => parkedcalls
    ;
    exten => 444,1,Park(,s)
    ;
    exten => 555,1,ParkedCall(default,701)
    ;
    exten => 1001,1,Dial(PJSIP/assist/sip:192.168.1.1:5065,20)    ; TODO replace IP:port
    ;
    exten => _X!,1,Dial(${PJSIP_DIAL_CONTACTS(${EXTEN})})
    ;
    ;extension for dialing chan_sip devices.
    ;exten => _X!,1,Dial(SIP/${EXTEN})
    
    [parkedcallstimeout]
    exten => s,1,Hangup()

Note: replace the IP address on the line `exten => 1001,1,Dial(PJSIP/assist/sip:192.168.1.1:5065,20)` with your HA IP. The HA VoIP integration by default uses port 5060 which is used by Asterisk, so ensure when you set it up you change the port. I've set mine as 5065.

**Step 4:**

Configure your VoIP phone. Use your HA IP as the SIP server address along with the username (default in example: 1000) and password (default: mypassword). See. your phone's config info on how to set this up.

**Step 5:**

Ensure you've set up Whisper and Piper, created a voice assistant in settings ([tutorial video from Smart Home Junkie](https://youtu.be/nh3jnPGAtMI?t=204)),  and configure the VoIP integration (with appropriate port).

​

Done! You should now be able to make calls from a VoIP phone through Asterisk to Assist by dialing extension 1001.

1683150749.0	03-May-2023 14:52:29	Device for running HA	rfehr613	1	1370rbe	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1370rbe/device_for_running_ha/	"I've been fiddling around with Home Assistant in a VM for a little bit now, and I think it meets the requirements I need for my current connected devices.  I was originally thinking about installing HA OS on a Nuk, but now I'm wondering if it would be better to use a spare laptop. I have an old Asus N73JQ laptop, which has an i7, Nvidia GPU, 12GB ram (DDR3 i think), and 2 SSDs. It still runs perfectly and is pretty quick.

I also just got a laptop from my parents. It was my aunt's, who passed away this summer. It is an HP Stream 14 with Celeron, 4GB DDR4, integrated UHD graphics, and 80GB SSD or nvme. 

Despite being about 10 years newer, the HP seems to be well under-spec'd compared to the Asus. Do I really need the Asus specs for a dedicated HA machine? Probably not. However, the Asus has an Ethernet port, while the HP does not. The HP only has usb-a & hdmi ports.  So Im thinking the HP is not a great option. But what about just buying a Nuk instead of using the Asus? I'm inclined to run HA OS in a VM no matter which device I choose, because I like the snapshots and versatility of using VMs. Not sure if that's practical on a Nuk.

Thoughts?"	13	"['dudenell: The hp stream 14 might be okay, best way to find out is to try it.', 't3as: It will be a device running 24/7 and if it\'s ""only"" running HAOS (and no other services requiring specific hardware, like PLEX), I\'d look for the cheapest and most power efficient device.\n\nThe Asus specs I found say it runs between 30W (idle) and 170W (full). A simple NUC can run at 10-30W. While a laptop can run Home Assistant without a problem, it is not designed to run 24/7.\n\nI run HAOS in a VM on a Synology NAS. Without any problems.', ""hirscheyyaltern: You don't need a lot to run home assistant. I would recommend giving the device a shot, worse comes to worst take it back up and switch devices. The backups are seamless when we're restoring to another device"", ""rfehr613: Yeah it's just the lack of Ethernet that i really don't like. I'd much rather have it hard wired."", ""rfehr613: Fair point about the laptop not being designed to run 24/7. It's a pretty beastly laptop, and cooling could be better on it. I cleaned the board and GPU fan not too long ago, but still.\n\nGenerally speaking power consumption isn't a concern of mine. My desktop also serves as a Plex server and surveillance server. It has 6 HDDs, 4 SSDs, and 1 nvme, on top of 12 case fans, an i7-8700, and a 2060KO. I'm not sure exactly what it's pulling, but i use a 850W power supply lol. Point is, 30W is a drop in the bucket compared to that.\n\nI was leaning more towards a Nuk or other mini computer anyway. I just hate not having a good use for these laptops."", 'rfehr613: Give which device a shot?', ""dudenell: There are USB to Ethernet adapters, I've used them in the past for basic network troubleshooting, but I don't see why it couldn't work."", ""t3as: Since your desktop runs a plex and surveillance server anyways (so i guess it's always on), why not run Home Assistant on it as well?"", ""hirscheyyaltern: Whichever you find more convenient. Home assistant doesn't take much in terms of power to run. You can always switch easily if a device isn't to your liking for some reason, so whichever device is easiest to use itun or makes the most sense to you, just set it up and run it on there and if you decide you want to switch to something else, it really is effortless to do. There's no sort of hard commitment to any specific machine"", 'rfehr613: I feel like that would create a lot of latency and connectivity issues', ""rfehr613: I mean i could, but i don't like having everything in one place. If my PC goes down or i need to take it out of service for a bit, then my home automation is also out of service.  And I intend on using some sensors to control HVAC components in HA, which makes the HA critical. Plex and surveillance aren't as critical. Plus, I'm basically forced to run Plex and home surveillance on my PC.  Due to my requirements for software and data redundancy, I'm currently stuck running both systems on windows.  So I don't have a choice with those two, unless I built individual servers for each, but that's a lot of money.  \n\nThe server (and I use that term loosely) was originally built to be only a surveillance server, so it's built around the i7-8700 for video processing using Quick sync.  I do plan to switch my surveillance over to DW Spectrum, which doesn't rely so heavily on QS and can be run in Linux or many other OSes, but I haven't had the chance to do this yet. \n\nI just kinda happened upon Plex one day and decided to start using it. Now I have 3 12TB WDGold Helium HDDs in raid 5 using Snapraid for all my movies, TV shows, wedding videos, audio books, etc.  I don't like the data risks associated with hardware raid or most standalone NAS like Synology."", 'dudenell: Sounds like you have your mind made up :)', ""rfehr613: I mean, I'm unlikely to want to use the HP now after finding out it has no Ethernet port. It would need to be a pretty convincing argument to use it, so i didn't want to completely shut the door on that. The whole reason i want the Ethernet port is reliability and low latency, so obviously an Ethernet workaround that might not let me achieve that is going to be an issue.\n\nThere's still the Nuk vs Asus. There were 3 devices mentioned in the OP. I really have no good use for either laptop besides occasional mobile troubleshooting or if i don't feel like sitting at my desk for some reason. This HP seems pretty laggy though now that I've been using it. It seems to struggle just handing navigating Windows 11.""]"

What's the URL path to use for snapshots for Firestick notifications? And a few other Frigate questions...	TrousersCalledDave	1	136x57p	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/136x57p/running_frigate_in_docker_successfully_linked/	"From a tutorial to send snapshots to Telegram, they use the following URL:

 'http://ccab4aaf-frigate:5000/api/events/{{trigger.payload\_json\[""after""\]\[""id""\]}}/thumbnail.jpg' 

but mentions that it should work for the Frigate addon, but I'm running Frigate in Docker and this doesn't appear to work for me.

The tutorial says I should be using the MQTT platform with the frigate/events topic for my trigger. Is there any difference in using this and using a Node Red Events state as the trigger instead and running the actions in a script? Presumably both still fire the same MQTT event, it's just that the automation requires only one placeholder whereas I'd have to set up a node for every camera and object entity in Node Red and connect them all to the same script call\_service. Is that right?

Anyway, back to the main question...

The official Frigate documentation just states that:  Frigate can save a snapshot image to 

    /media/frigate/clips

for each event named as 

    <camera>-<id>.jpg

but doesn't provide any example and I have no idea what I'm supposed to modify to point the URL to the correct image.

A third point of confusion is that my Frigate media is now showing in my Home Assistant media folder. So should I be pointing towards my HA server media and let it figure out the path, or point towards my Frigate server? Additionally, will HA now try and back up the media from Frigate to my HA install?

Another question I have is about the Frigate object motion entitles created in Home Assistant, specifically people. For example, I have:

`binary_sensor.porch_motion` with just the title ""Motion"" next to it. The icon is a stick man with a line through it and a PIR overhead. 

I also have `binary_sensor.porch_person_occupancy` with a house icon and the title ""person occupancy"".

I'm assuming that `binary_sensor.porch_motion` is just to show ANY motion detected (despite the confusing stick man icon), whereas `binary_sensor.porch_person_occupancy` will only show on when a person is in frame. So I should use the person occupancy entity to trigger automations for human motion? Is that right? 

Thanks.

Tl;dr - Frigate is in Docker, what URL path do I use to display a Frigate snapshot in a Firestick notification? 

Frigate media shows in my HA media folder now. When I back up, will it try and back this up even though it's hosted on my separate Docker server? 

Should I use `binary_sensor.porch_motion` or `binary_sensor.porch_person_occupancy` to trigger a human motion event in the porch?"	2	"['nickm_27: > From a tutorial to send snapshots to Telegram, they use the following URL:\n>\n> \'http://ccab4aaf-frigate:5000/api/events/{{trigger.payload_json[""after""][""id""]}}/thumbnail.jpg\'\n>\n> but mentions that it should work for the Frigate addon, but I\'m running Frigate in Docker and this doesn\'t appear to work for me.\n\nyou need to use your ip address for the device running frigate instead of the hostname (which only works in the addon)\n\n> A third point of confusion is that my Frigate media is now showing in my Home Assistant media folder.

With LTS there is even more room to move fast and break things if LTS is the recommended version!  \n\n\nUltimately, NC are a for-profit company: we're providing market share and a captive audience for them to market their hardware to - OSS is a mechanism for them to get free development time and rapidly grow an audience by offering their product for free... it's a loss leader, freemium, whatever you wanna call it. However, I'm also not so cynical to believe that these are the only reason they chose an OSS model). The generous way to look at it is that this is a symbiotic relationship, we're not passive bystanders by the very nature of OSS.  \n\n\nSo the problem isn't OSS or whether I am allowed expectations, it's HA under-valuing or under-estimating their user's time and patience and rather focusing on building out features they can sell to us (like the aforementioned smart speaker that they're obviously building by laying this groundwork).  \n\n\nBut give it a year or to when you're using their smart speaker and they drop some breaking change which blows up your critical pipelines (e.g ZHA & Skyconnect shitting the bed) and then you'll understand that stability needs a higher priority and LTS is necessary.  \n\n\n\\> it will mean more effort on their part to maintain two type of releases when they want to press forward faster with more iterative development.  \n\n\nYes, but that is limited downside for them (maintain a known codebase across 1 extra branch). Their habit of knowingly or unknowingly releasing breaking changes together with security & stability releases has (effectively) unlimited downside on the user's side since the effort end users must put in to deal with mitigating these breaking changes scales across their user base, and that user base is growing.  \n\n\nLeaving us all to deal with instability and security issues is disrespectful and undermines their relationship everytime a user gets burned (which over time will increase as the project increases in complexity and also as the user base grows in size and uptime).  \n\n\n\\> Triggering lights on and off is the problem though? They don't need the lights on and it's a waste of power over time (yes I'm picky about this these days!).  \n\n\nFor me, I don't care - the lights stay on for a few more minutes each time motion is detected. My lights also only come on when needed (i.e if ambient lighting is low enough) and on a night they are very very dim so energy usage is negligible.  \n\n\n\\> There are simple things like having my tv switch to Plex and open up my feed based on commands, that saves me finding the remote from where I'm sitting which is just one of the better uses of voice.  \n\n\nFair enough, but if you don't want to find the remote you need to do the whole thing by voice. In my experience, voice can be quite mentally taxing, especially when the wrong command is issued, the device doesn't hear you etc.  \n\n\nI use a bit of voice in my system via Siri & HomePods - most complex thing I do is turn the TV on (which happens in HomeKit anyway), everything else is sensor driven with a couple of virtual devices for overriding things like current light brightness, turning on smart switches or disabling all automations in a room - all these are handled on device or via physical buttons in the room to which they apply."", 'joke-complainer: Ah I missed that, thank you!']"

The problem is that it seems random at what brightness they turn on.  Sometimes it is 100%, other times it may be 10%.  Is there a way in home assistant (i'm sure there is and I am just too much a noob).  To make sure that lights come back on at 100% when using the wall switch.  To add a bit more complexity, can it just resume its previous setting when triggered from wall switch?

For reference I am using Innr Zigbee Smart Bulb Smart Flood Light White BR30.

A more realistic reason is that sometimes I have people come into my house that don't know about home assistant (pet sitter, pest control, cleaner, etc.), and they are always using wall switches.  I want to make sure that the house lights up appropriately when they need to turn them on.  But also...the coffee thing is real!

Then, after some hours, it will just die on me.

Here's what it turns into.  On my dashboards, I have an entry for myself, correctly showing as Home.  My schedules using the custom scheduler card still show.  No other entities are working.  My car integration, the default weather entity, and all of my climate controls show as unavailable.  History and Logbook try to load (showing the parameters to search at the top of the page) but just spin a blue loading circle.  File editor and Terminal show an error ""Unable to load the panel source: /api/hassio/app/entrypoint.js.""  Media shows sources but won't load or play anything.

In Developer Tools, Check configuration says it can't find my config file, but when things are working, it shows my config is fine and allows me to restart at will.  When it's broken, I can only get things back by pulling the plug (remotely, through a wifi outlet), which I hate to do.

Those are the broad strokes.  What finer details can I provide to help troubleshoot?  When it's like this, rebooting my router doesn't help, nor does disabling Pi-hole (running on a different machine).  With some things working and some not, it seems like a supervisor issue or a screwy configuration somewhere.  Any help or guidance is greatly appreciated.

I've successfully configured Prometheus and Grafana. The only problem is that all of my temperature data is reported as Celsius when I've configured the unit as Fahrenheit...any idea about how to change this?

EDIT: So, to achieve this, I think I'd need to do some sort of a rewrite rule in Prometheus -- which seems way too involved for something so simple. I just ended up converting the value in Grafana (multiplied by 1.8 then added 32). I'm sort of disappointed with Prometheus so far.

With the 100m default radius for Home Assistant, ours sees us as ""Home"" when we pull in to our apartment complex.    I have a similar need, but more precise, detect when I am in a certain zone, to run an automation (front entry/back room etc), without extra devices.', ""starfishbzdf: You got it in reverse, the docs say it's only iOS, and I need it for android"", 'janonthecanon7: Yeah, yeah, i said the wrong os, but the main question is if you still need this for ios, if not, I dont think its possible', 'starfishbzdf: No, thank you though']"

ReallyNotMichaelsMom	3	136bgni	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/136bgni/ha_yellow_is_unreachable_and_not_working_any/	"TL;DR: So, my HA Yellow isn't running any automations. When I try to log in through my computer, it just says it's unreachable.

Here's what I've done:

I've rebooted the router and HA, and I'm now able to ping HA. (I wasn't able to ping it before.)

I closed my browser and tried to reopen it. It says the site can't be reached and that ""homeassistant.local refused to connect"". 

I switched to a different browser, same thing. I'm unable to connect through Nabu Casa. It just says ""Connection failed: No response from instance""

Then I figured I'd just do a factory reset and restore from my backup earlier today. 

I did the factory reset (unplug the power, plug back in, push the red reset button with a paper clip until the yellow led flashes and wait). It's still not available so I can't install from back up. 

I can see it on my router interface, and it still has the correct IP address.

My son manfully resisted the chance to say, ""Gee, if only we had something like a switch that we could use to turn on the lights."" (I did thank him for not saying it :)

My cats are swarming over me, because they know I'm stressed, but they don't believe me when I tell them they are NOT helping.

I know I should have asked for help before it got this far, but that's what I get for being stubborn. But please, if anyone has any suggestions or ideas, I'm all ears!"	6	"['Rotilho: Have you tried to access it through the IP?

Operator error (PBKAC) This should probably should be #1 on my list. I\'m thinking of starting a YouTube channel called, ""Home Assistant for Liberal Studies Majors"".\n1. Just thought of this one earlier today. I added Bluetooth to Yellow recently. \n\nSo, none of my backups were installable after I successfully did a factory reset. I\'ve successfully restored from backup before, so I\'m pretty sure I did it correctly. I\'m now getting adept at doing factory reset, reinstall. Except for Alexa Media Player. It just won\'t finish the install.\n\nI\'m keeping notes about what to install and in what order. Make sure my Yellow gateway is the same as my router. Make sure my static IP for my Yellow are the same on my router and in Yellow. Keeping better notes of my automations for when it breaks later on today, I can install my automations from my notes.

Instantly hooked.
 
So I made a monitor that will go read the NASA data feed every 15 minutes (its updated every 1 minute but I figured 15 minutes is fine enough for an alert that a solar flare is hitting the magnetosphere) and rigged it up to announce on my alexa devices.
 
First, a cron job that runs every 15 minutes. Simple python code, probably sloppy AF but here it is:
 
    import urllib.request, json, requests
    with urllib.request.urlopen('https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/json/planetary_k_index_1m.json') as url:
            data=json.load(url)
            index=data[-1]['kp_index']
            level=data[-1]['estimated_kp']
            postData={'index':index, 'level':level}
            response=requests.post('http://192.168.1.200:8123/api/webhook/MYWEBHOOKID', json=postData)
            print(str(level))

So this hits the webhook every time it checks, theres a condition in the automation that decides when the index is high enough. Full YAML for the integration:
 
    alias: Auroral Activity
    description: """"
    trigger:
      - platform: webhook
        webhook_id: ""MYWEBHOOKID""
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: ""{{ trigger.json.level > 6 }}""
        enabled: true
    action:
      - parallel:
          - service: notify.alexa_media_rob_s_echo_dot
            data:
              message: Auroral Activity Alert, KP index is at {{ trigger.json.index }}
          - service: notify.alexa_media_rob_s_2nd_echo_dot
            data:
              message: Auroral Activity Alert, KP index is at {{ trigger.json.index }}
    mode: single
    
This will make my devices both announce that Auroras are goin on & how strong they are.

Where I am at, KP index being above 6 means its time to get outside and watch. You can adjust for your latitude and expected strength requirements. The index last week hit 8, so it was a show for sure."	4	"['Personal_Track_3780: I hate to say it after you have gone to all this trouble, but there is a HA integration for Aurora status.\n\nhttps://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/aurora/', 'corptech: Cool idea thanks.

They would always capture the state of my Hue groups (or other Zigbee group) and would tell those groups to restore their state. This meant that if any light in the group was on, Home Assistant would turn the group on, causing all the lights in the group to turn on. Similarly, groups in which several lights had different colors were non-functional because the group itself would be resumed with a particular color.

I've solved this by changing `snapshot_entities` in my `scene.create` call to use this template:

```
{{
    expand(states.light)
    |rejectattr('attributes.is_hue_group')
    |selectattr('state', 'eq', 'on')
    |selectattr('entity_id', 'in', area_entities('Living Room'))
    |map(attribute='entity_id')
    |join( ',' )

```
(for snapshotting the `Living Room` lights)

Now it works great! Hopefully this helps one of y'all."	0	[]

>The Shelly i4 is a device that essentially reads mechanical switches (the switch applies mains voltage to the input terminals) and then reacts on them, for instance by publishing to a certain topic. It can be used behind old-fashioned switches to control devices actually switched on and off by an actor/relay that subscribes to the topic.

I live in an old house, and wiring is complicated. Turns out, the i4 was perfect for my needs of letting me control two lights with physical switches, without the ability to actually run wiring between them.

So now I had two input terminals left over, and I thought I'd just hook them into the circuits of the other two switches at the same place, so that I can at least get a reading of whether those circuits are currently open or closed. Like this:

*Processing img 29ybrezavixa1...*

Turns out this kinda only works in some cases, but when your load is a LED or some sensitive device, you have a problem. This is because whereas we have a 230V mains here, SW4 in the diagram above will have about 120V potential over the N terminal, i.e. the Shelly i4 actually lets electricity pass from L to SW4 and the other SWx terminals too.

So don't wire your i4 into existing circuits like I tried.

Please feel free to crosspost this where appropriate."	0	[]

1. I don't really care how secure it is honestly. I don't \_need\_ to lock the room. It's more so for keeping it latched and having a fun way to unlatch it. So cheap or crappy is fine.
2. I would prefer to be able to latch it somehow similar to something like a fence gate or the like because I'd like to be able to have the latch exposed on the inside of the room, but a normal lock in the door casing if fine too if it complies with the next item in the list...
3. I need it to not have any hardware showing when the door is closed. I have a plan if I end up with no other choice by covering the lock face with a book, but I'd really prefer to have no easily visible hardware.
4. Most important, it needs to have a manual failsafe. If my power goes out, my Home Assistant instance is down, etc, I need to know there's a way to get in to my room even if it takes a little extra effort.

1683054333.0	02-May-2023 12:05:33	FP2 integrated into IKEA ceiling lamp	Xorfee069	269	135x4ea	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/135x4ea	"I upgraded the basic ceiling lamp in my guest bathroom with a non-neutral Zigbee relay, a 5V power supply, and an FP2. The combination of these components has been perfect for my needs, and I'm absolutely in love with my FP2s. However, I've noticed that they're not as effective in larger rooms that are over 15 square meters. While they do react when mounted on the wall in my 30 square meter living room, they sometimes forget to stay detected if I'm sitting without any movement at the far end of the room.

Anyway, I use it to pause or play a movie on my Apple TV whenever either my wife or I stand up. The system allows for individual light dimming on different zones, so if my wife is sitting at the table while I'm watching a movie, the appropriate lights can be adjusted accordingly. The system is incredibly fast and reliable, with one exception being when there is no movement for an extended period, such as when reading a book on the couch or sitting around 7 meters away from the FP2.

In my case, it was the dining table, and it kept detecting me even when I stood completely still for a long period of time, around 10 minutes or so.\n\nFor distances farther than 5 meters, it still works for detecting certain zones, but you need to move a little bit to stay detected (if you stand still for a couple of minutes). The best feature is that if you mount it on the wall and mark some zones as exits, it will automatically trigger the automation once you move in that direction. When multiple people are detected and someone goes to the exit zone, it will stay detected for those zones. For example, I have stairs leading down from my living room to the second level of my condo, and when I reach the stairs, it triggers an automation that turns on the lights downstairs for 10 seconds and turns off the lights in the living room when no one is occupying the room.\n\n\nEdit:\nI mounted it on the ceiling of my bedroom to enable the lights when my wife or I are heading to bed. The automation will get disabled once we disconnect our phones via Wi-Fi.

I cannot say for sure if it works reliably while we are sleeping because I am afraid to test it out.\n\n\nFor bed sensing:\n\nGo and buy a aqara Window door contact sensor.

But I keep seeing other Redditors mention [Shelly](https://www.shelly.cloud/en-us/products/switching-and-triggering#unfiltered) devices and I have some questions on how they work:

* Are they intended to work with ""existing"" light switches (dumb switches)?

But the built-in YAML editor simply sucks. There is no code formatting at all. If the spacing is off, it just shows as broken. Sure, there's code colouring, but that's it.

Also, the aforementioned attributes. The entity hinting only hints at entities; it doesn't show you what attributes are available for an entity.

Some auto-code completion would also be nice to see. For example, as in the previous tasks, adding an attribute to an entities card, if I add `- type: attribute`, why doesn't the editor automatically add the correct structure with the required param? As I understand the docs, the attribute type requires both the entity ID and the attribute ID. So why not prepopulate that in the correct format and then give the code hint when typing both the entity name and the attribute name?!?!?!

    - type: attribute
    entity: sensor.samba_backup
    name: Backups On Local
    icon: mdi:lan
    attribute: backups_local

So after writing all that, is there anything that would either improve or even replace the default YAML editor with something that is more functional?"	20	"[""400HPMustang: I don't use it but it's possible the [VSCode add-on](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/home-assistant-community-add-on-visual-studio-code/107863) might be what you want?\n\nTHere's also this [config helpe](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=keesschollaart.vscode-home-assistant)r add on for Visual Studio itself."", ""Teras80: Dashboards are not saved in the usual config/ folder structure.

No tow trucks were available for several hours. A quick trip to Harbor Freight to pick up a cheap welder, ropes and snatch blocks we were able to pill out the vehicle, bend and weld the trailer hitch back together and slowly get home. I would not trust that weld to hold anything but it worked in a pinch and was nice to use something that was learned.']"

I've been working on an addon for task very simple household task management.

It's deeply integrated with HA using notifications for persons that are home only. It also have a quick action feature.

Here is the addon repository: https://github.com/HolyNoodle/family-companion

- fun
- not polluting my HA instance with entities to track tasks
- having stats (but I guess this could be handled with a grafana on the side)

I have an existing Home Assistant setup and a zigbee 3.0 network indoors. I have two tiny bike sheds, one is 5 meters from front door, other along house wall behind the house.

I was thinking of ordering some battery-powered motion detectors that I could place under the roof of the sheds, as a first step, but I fear this may not be very practical.

I am worried on the one hand if I can get a reliable connection. Can I rely on zigbee outdoors in close proximity to my house, or should I aim for 433 mhz or wifi instead? The second issue I have is batteries. I would prefer a solution that does not require frequent battery changes, maybe something that can take lithium aa or aaa batteries is best? Zigbee is probably the most battery-efficent solution if it works?

Another possible issue I may face is false alarms. I think if there is more than a few false alarms a month I will probalby end up ignoring this sensors, so roaming cats could for instance be an issue.

Another idea I had is to hook the bike locks through some hardpoint in the bikeshed like a metal loop and find some way to message me if vibrations/handling is detected somehow?

Does anyone have any experience or advice?"	13	"[""Hefty-System2367: No issue with using zigbee outdoors, I use several Aqara sensors outside the house, just need to be sheltered from direct rainfall. Battery life is also not an issue, all Aqara sensors have multi-year battery life if you use good quality coin cells.  \nCats will definitely be an issue if you use a simple presence sensor, one of the newer mm wave radar sensors will be more reliable. Personally as I already have a Frigate setup I would put a cheap camera in the shed and use Frigate's object detection to trigger an alarm."", ""daern2: Bit of personal experience as I had some scrotes have a go at getting some (older) bikes out of the shed one night, but they were stopped and got nothing for their troubles. They actually came around the previous night and had a good look through the windows (picked up by CCTV) and I should have been aware that they would come back, but hadn't put two and two together on this.\n\nThey came in from the back of the garden to avoid the cameras and, over a period of 30 minutes, unscrewed all of the hinge screws on the shed door before carefully removing it from the shed. It was a proper, heavy door so wouldn't have been easily or quietly forced, but the screws were a significant weak spot. In removing the door, they tripped a magnetic door contact sensor (see below) and also the PIR inside the shed. They dashed inside to grab what they could, but the bikes were chained up round some 4x2 screwed to the frame of the shed, so they just legged it instead grabbing nothing but an old strimmer which was waiting to go to the tip, so they saved me a job :-)\n\nI've made a few changes now since then, but what would stop them now is:\n\n* Coachbolts through the hinges - no more unscrewing the door. They'd need to brute force it\n* Deadlock bolt on the other side, so a decent level of physical security\n* Door contact + PIR covering the inside, both part of the main house security\n* Valuable stuff is chained up, albeit through timber frames\n* Additional CCTV covering the rear entry point\n* Better quality object detection on cameras (Frigate) with very low false positives, so it can now wake me up reliably if needed\n\nNone of these things on their own would stop a determined thief, but together they form a reasonably (IMHO) uninviting target and I suspect they'd just go next door instead. Layered security is definitely the way to go - a mix of both physical and active security systems. e.g. the bikes should probably be fastened into concrete, but in reality, if you can scare them off with a lot of noise, they're not going to stay around long enough to even chop through some timber and it'll probably be good enough. The really valuable stuff is better protected anyway, so this is good enough.\n\nOn a technical level, everything is hard-wired for me. Yes, it's a pain, but long-term it's the way to go if you can possibly swing it. The whole lot is wired back into the main system so triggering the shed security will set off the main house system, waking everyone up and causing a lot of disturbance. It also turns all of the lights on outside so it would take a pretty brave scrote to stay put with all of that noise and light going on, especially knowing that there's a lot of cameras around too. I use standard PIRs and door contactors and have had no issues, although I have the sensitivity turned down and have made sure that all orifices are well sealed against spiders which can be a nightmare in sheds and garages - one spider in a PIR can wreak havoc! \n\nMy security system is also dedicated (i.e. not HA), so runs entirely independently of it, but is orchestrated by HA (e.g. set/unset/monitored). I like this way of doing things as I know it's far, far harder for someone to interfere with, and if HA goes down, the core security is still operational.\n\nCutting down false positives to zero (or very close to zero) is vital. If it's false triggering all of the time, it's no use to anyone as you'll never hear it go off at night as it'll be muted! How did they get into your bike sheds? If it's through a door, then this is an easy, low-tech way to monitor it and should be very reliable. You can add other monitors too (e.g. vibration) but I'd avoid anything detecting movement outside unless you are prepared to be getting woken by cats and foxes every night. Cameras + Frigate work well for this task, if it's an option."", ""generalambivalence: I use 433MHz sensors outdoors. I haven't set up my PIR motion sensors yet, but I've got contact sensors on my shed. I find the range is better than Zigbee without any need for routing devices.\n\nMy choice was mostly down to convenience though. I had unused 433MHz sensors from the previous owner's old security system so I just bought an SDR dongle.\n\nAs far as batteries, it's been two years since we bought this house and I didn't change the batteries in the contact sensors before I repurposed them. They are using A123 batteries."", 'wewefe: I am out in the sticks and my main concern is tweakers stealing shit at night. I have zigbee door sensors in a shed and a detached garage.  I also have magnetic driveway sensors at the end of my driveway by the road(amazon guy pre-alert) and behind the normal part of the driveway where no one other than I should ever be.  I am far enough from a road that no one is walking on foot.  Too much wild life for motion sensors. These are all tied into an HA based alarm and I use ""arm home""  at night.  \n\nMain issue I have is in the winter on the coldest nights the coin cell batteries drop out in the zigbee sensors. They work the 95% of the time. Long term I am either going to rewire them to use larger external batteries or switch to a different sensor.', 'the_bigheavy: You could use something like a Konnected panel in your shed, and then use ""real"" security detectors like magnetic contacts for doors, and higher quality PIR detectors, most of which have a ""pet mode"" and adjustable sensitivity to avoid your cat problem. If you get the right one I think Konneted works over ethernet or WiFi.\n\nThis also allows one point of power (using a Wall Wart of POE) to power all your sensors so no battery problems. This is what I use in my detached garage/workshop/gym/man cave. It also integrates well with Home Assistant and the Alamo integration lets you have virtual keypads, zones, etc.\n\nI\'d also suggest that robbers don\'t want to draw attention to themselves. Add a motion sensor floodlight or two near your shed, and put two ""piezo screamers"" in the shed. I think Honeywell used to make one that was like 140 dB and is nearly deafening in my man cave. A couple of those would send just about anyone running for cover.\n\nFor bonus automation points, when your shed alarm is triggered, turn on all the exterior lights, blast the screamers, and then turn on an interior light or two after like 8 seconds to simulate ""someone woke up and is coming outside"" even if you have no intention of doing so.\n\nAnd last of all, get good homeowners insurance and consider a separate bicycle policy or rider. Despite being a strong advocate of an individual right to self-defense and lover of bicycles, it\'s not worth engaging in a potentially violent interaction over a bicycle and I\'m usually surprised at how cheap insurance riders can be.', ""Teras80: Let me ask you this: What will you do if there is an alarm? Run out and face possibly multiple thieves? I am not saying you shouldn't or could not,  I am just asking whether you have thought about it.\n\nAs previous commenter rightly described, thieves have all the time on planning&testing and have very little time after they have broken into actual room. It takes considerably less time for them to grab something and run, then it takes for you to wake up, understand there is an alarm, put some clothes on (or maybe not), grab a bat and get outside.  \n\nSo, as long there is SOME indication that someone might be coming (like adding a motion/activated floodlight to both outside and inside your sheds), they will not spend time to unfasten/cut the bike locks inside the room and whether or not there is an actual alarm in often doesn't matter. Or whether it is integrated to HA :)\n\n1) increase physical security: add beefy hinges, metal strips over lock connecting points etc. If possible, add another internal door -- that will 99% stop their attempt\n\n2) add PIR floodlights outside\n\n3) add the simplest/most foolproof local door contact + siren. \n\n4) add ability to lock your best stuff internally in a way that is simple for you -- chain over the rack etc\n\n5) get insurance."", 'onewheeldrive1133: Why not use a door sensor?

AimanF	8	135dytc	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/135dytc/how_to_bring_my_old_apartment_intercomdoor_buzzer/	"My building has an [AiPhone VC-K](https://www.adiglobaldistribution.us/product/aj-vck) in every unit with a paired call box at the front door. I'd love to bring this into home assistant but I'm not sure of the best way.

I'm seeing things like the [Ring Intercom](https://en-uk.ring.com/products/intercom) and [Nuki Opener](https://nuki.io/en/opener/) that look great but they're only available in Europe, not in the US (where I'm based). Would one of those work in the US if I imported it?

I also saw [this post from a Smartthings user](https://community.smartthings.com/t/controlling-ancient-4-wire-apartment-buzzer-un-lock-only/13753) who used a ZWave relay. I wouldn't mind doing something similar, especially if there was a good zigbee option as most of my devices are zigbee. But it seems like this option wouldn't allow me to get notifications or trigger automations if someone rings the buzzer?

Have you worked with something similar? Do you have recommendations on the best way to handle this? I'd love your thoughts!

[Picture of the internal wiring of the intercom.](https://i.imgur.com/awGCuQp.jpg)"	11	"[""pinguugnip: If you look at the Ring Intercom page ([https://www.amazon.co.uk/ring-intercom-by-amazon/dp/B09JB7PLB6](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ring-intercom-by-amazon/dp/B09JB7PLB6)) there is a Compatibility Checker. Running through it (guessing what your intercom can actually do, your device shows as being compatible). Given that it is battery powered, I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work if imported.\n\nObviously check the compatibility for yourself as it has questions I don't know the answer to in your case.\n\nIf you are not in any hurry for it, I would also consider waiting to buy it. I just got it on an introductory offer in Spain for €49.99 instead of its current €129.99.

With the intercom unit being inside the unit I didn't want to see the device so I simply shoved it into the wall behind the intercom unit and it is zip tied to the back.\n\nThe power was the tricky part and I doubt my solution is really the best but I am planning on reusing some security wire to provide 12vdc and use a 5v buck converter on it to deliver the tiny amount of power it needs.\n\nEdit: [I remembered that I actually started a similar thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/x3f7tu) which may be worth checking out even to just look at the medium link I referenced. I more or less did exactly that but I used the Zen17 instead as it was easier to get.\n\nI also found that I didn't need to actually make the custom pcb referenced in it for detecting the buzzing warble.

To do that, you could have a device that responds to the sound/vibration (easy, but a bit of a hack) or that senses the change in voltage that results to intercom being signaled. That could be a ESP32 device and a relay or other isolator; it could be coupled with a Zigbee door sensor (as someone suggested) with the relay simulating the reed switch.I used to have a spare intercom line that used a regular landline phone, you pressed ""9"" on the keypad to unlatch the door.

If this is possible with a battery powered contact sensor that would be perfect."", ""AimanF: Thanks for the input, I'll clarify a bit.

Assuming the way you unlock the door is by pushing a button, that can be accomplished with a relay connected via ESPhome. The sensing is a different matter. Both could be done with the same microprocessor, but you\'ll need to delve into ESPhome. I\'d be surprised if you found something ""off the shelf"" that did both. But then, I\'ve been surprised before...', ""AimanF: That makes sense! I don't mind a little bit of tinkering with ESPhome, I'm just not that familiar with relays and what types I should be looking at. Any guidance on compatible/correctly specced hardware would be helpful"", 'sblessley: You need to isolate the voltage present at the switch, from the ESP. A 5V relay would accomplish that; when the ESP pin it\'s connected to goes high, the relay engages (""picks"") and closes the circuit. An optoisolator ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opto-isolator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opto-isolator)) could do the same thing, but relay contacts are less sensitive to voltage ratings, and don\'t care whether they\'re switching AC or DC (this is an oversimplication, but is true for your application). Search YouTube for ESPHOME or Arduino applications with relays. The coding is different; ESPHome is designed for Home Assistant, but the electricity aspects will be the same.']"

1682993876.0	01-May-2023 19:17:56	Zigbee : Migrating from ZHA to Z2M, a few concerns	Don_Mici	9	1358jxn	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1358jxn/zigbee_migrating_from_zha_to_z2m_a_few_concerns/	"So! Right now I have a lot of lights in my home running on Zigbee switches and dimmers that I control with ZHA (Skyconnect dongle). The nicest automations I have are basically konami codes you can do on the switches themselves to trigger scenes. To achieve that, they listen to ZHA events reported by the switches (example below). 

Now I'm looking to switch to Zigbee2MQTT as a few devices I want are not supported by ZHA. From what I read ZHA is great at what it does, but it's a bit more limited in compatibility and flexibility. Thing is it seems listening to events instead of state changes is a bit trickier in Z2M. So here is my question : Can I reproduce these automations that rely on Zigbee Events in Z2M?

Example automation : If I press ""On"" on the lobby switch, and one second later the lobby light is off, then close all lights in the house. The event part is important because it relies on clicking ""On"" while the light is already on, so no state change is triggered. Of course, same can be done with a closed light, or multiple clicks using a ""counter""."	15	"['kctjfryihx99: I don’t think the issue is the compatibility of your automations. One issue is that SkyConnect isn’t super compatible with Z2M. You might be able to get it to work, but it’s my understanding that it’s not recommended.\n\nAnd maybe it’s just me, but I’ve had trouble getting Z2M to work. I know people have success with it but the time I tried it, I wasn’t able to get it to work. ZHA does everything I want from Zigbee, and I want SkyConnect for the thread support, so I gave up on it.', 'smarthomejunkie: Zigbee2MQTT is not fully compatible with the SkyConnect.

From other comments it appears that the SkyConnect might not be ideal to use with Z2M so my best guess is probably that.', 'Don_Mici: There are so many! But a good place to start is to search for articles like Zigbee vs Wifi or Zigbee vs Zwave, etc. \n\nJust as a very quick explanation, Zigbee and Zwave both use and ""build"" their own networks, so you will need a separate ""controller"" somewhere that kind of acts as you wifi router, but for Zigbee. The Skyconnect from HA is one, but there are many others. Ikea famously uses Zigbee.\n\nThe big difference between Zigbee and Wifi is that in Zigbee, every devices also acts kind of like a router meaning they can extend the network and even talk with each other. On Wifi every devices need to report to your Wifi router, so if you have a big house, you need a very powerful WiFi router oe event extenders. In Zigbee every lightswitch and plug will extend the network. In some cases, since most devices are routers themselves, you can even ""bind"" devices together so that a switch speaks directly to another one without passing by the controller. \n\nAlso, don\'t forget that one of the main appeal of HomeAssistant is that it\'s an orchestrator that can coordinate between basically anything, so you can have Wifi switches, Zigbee plugs, Thread whatever, and HA will insure that they talk to each other. A very clean network is nice, but not mandatory.', 'zSprawl: It’s been “experimental” since release. More and more people are having success, enough that I’d try it if I wanted to, but honestly, I’ve been happy with ZHA. There are certainly more pros to Z2M than cons, but I like the simple and working approach I get with the built in support. \n\nIt’s the same thing with automations. I know node-red is a very powerful option for Home Assistant automations. If nothing else, the visual layout approach is really helpful, but I still rather use the built in HA automation system. \n\nThe cool thing with HA and open source is options and the flexibility (and headaches) that come with it.', ""Don_Mici: Fair enough, thanks a lot for checking that. I guess I'll double check my compatibilities beforehand then!"", ""TheoSl93: Thanks for the well explained response!

TLDR: I want a Zigbee router which works on ethernet because of usb-dongle location issues but I'm not sure if it's going to work with HASS and all the devices I want to install (door, CO2 and smoke sensors). I have the feeling that I am mixing concepts, technologies and integrations.\n\nThanks again for taking time to answer!!""]"

I'm looking for a bunch of sensors & gadgets but I have some requirements & preferences:

Requirements:

1. Must work with Home Assistant
2. Must work locally
3. Sshipping must be affordable to Canada

Preferences:

1. Favourite connection is ethernet
2. Zigbee or Z-Wave connection
3. Manufacturer Hub is NOT obligatory

here's what I want to do:

* lock doors
* Fire & smoke detector
* if person recognized start conversation correct passphrase -> unlock incorrect passphrase -> alarm & record correct super secret passphrase silent alarm & record
* Low O2 detection
* lockdown - roll down storm-shutters
* Call 911 -I have to find out if 911 will accept robocalls here in Canada
* check doors & windows are closed & locked
* check fridge is closed
* Alert: maximum time windows should be open has been exceeded (based off current temp & forecast)
* check windows are closed
* reminder to take meds & supplements
* detect oven/stove is on for 2 hours. Was this a mistake?
* Open & close blinds morning & night

I would like to make a bill of materials from your suggestions.

Best regards,

CA

PS Some sensors like ones made by Zooz aren't listed under integrations but a youtuber said that it works with HA. How would I make something without a listed integration work? Would I just use a generic blueprint?"	2	['Shooter_Q: In the case of something like Zooz, you connect it via your z-wave system of choice and let it communicate via MQTT or something else.

I've got a floorplan set up using the ""Floorplan for Home Assistant"" HACS addon. It functions perfectly. However, the image is a fixed (very small) size regardless of the facts that:  
1) The image is 4k  
2) The card properly scales to fill the whole screen -- the image stays a fixed width and height within the card.

I cannot get the image to resize regardless of what I try -- I've tried the card\_mod CSS HACS addon, the layout card HACS addon, etc.

There are several Yolink devices in my home, including the speaker hub. It’s used to announce when the mailbox is opened and motion inside my outside shed, and other alerts. The device won’t announce without an internet connection. There’s a Yolink integration for HA. \n\nThe temp/humidity sensors were initially tested inside my freezer and refrigerator and they worked so well that I purchased a couple motion sensors and vibration sensors for the mailbox and shed. The range and reliability of the sensors are impressive. And I also have the main hub connected via Ethernet. \n\nWhat sold me was taking a motion sensor with me on a walk, and at a little over 1/4 mile away I pulled the sensor out of my pocket and the App on my phone went off for the motion. This device was connected to a Yolink Ethernet connected hub in my basement. I also like that they don’t interfere with the WiFi frequency spectrum. \n\nThe one major downfall is reliance on the their servers, “the cloud”, but I’m willing to use their devices for now as I have redundant internet connections and power backup for my home network.\n\nUPDATE:  I need to clarify that some functions will continue to work without an internet connection, such as activating a local Yolink smart plug or siren, but notification’s to the App require an internet connection.

The more things that communicate in the WiFi frequency range in a given area will eventually cause congestion in that frequency spectrum. Think of a lot of people at a party all trying to talk at the same time. \n\nI live in an area with dozens of nearby WiFi networks and each network has numerous devices. So I decided to use devices that operate on frequencies different than the 2.4GHz range whenever possible; my preference being z-wave. I still have WiFi devices, as well as zigbee, z-wave, LoRa, and some 433MHz sensors. \n\nThe wonderful thing is Home Assistant ties them all together in one manageable place.\n\nIt is also important to have a good WiFi network to support more devices. A cheap WiFi router will quickly become a problem and the wireless network can experience disconnects or slowness. Another reason why I prefer wired connections for high bandwidth connections such as video cameras. It also helps to move devices to the 5GHz WiFi network when possible, but the range isn’t as good as the 2.4GHz WiFi networks. \n\nI initially purchased a Yolink kit that included the wired hub and some temperature sensors, then added the speaker hub later.

I just installed several Insteon Micro Dimmers I had lying around and I think one of them is defective. Basically, anytime there is an insteon event on the network and the lights are less than 100% - they all flash. I tried 2 other Insteon micro dimmers on this same load and didnt have any issues. Accoriding to my ISY, all 3 are the same hardware and software version - so I am guessing the unit is just defective :( 

Now, this leads to need to find a replacement. Seeing as Insteon doesnt seem to be making these at the moment, I would be happy to get a Zigbee, ZWave or other replacement.. but I havent been able to find much. My requirements are pretty simple:
1. Support dimming LEDs. 
2. Be able to be grouped together into scenes. For this one, I know Home Assistant can simulate it using light groups or automations, but I don't like the delay it creates. I would prefer native grouping or scene support  

I have found some no-name Zigbee units, but I dont know if I should trust them. I have also seen the Shelly Dimmers, but I dont think they do #2. 

Thanks!"	2	['mwolczko: FYI You can find the Insteon units on eBay.', 'boojew: Thanks. I am wondering if there is no other alternative to using Insteon..']

I replaced my HVAC filter today (May 1st) after 6 months (which is what manufacturer suggests). Problem with that is it does not take into consideration how dusty it really is in the environment.

You can see the change in velocity from a dirty filter to a clean one. Now, rather than changing with a fixed time, the filter can be changed when its not allowing air to flow too freely through it.

You can see here that around 11:20am, the machine turned on to run. Because it's an average sensor, the state jumps around from idle -> on -> running -> on -> running -> idle. I want to create some sort of sensor that shows the most common state in 60 seconds (or something of the sort) to remove these blips. This would make my resultant sensor show idle -> running -> idle

But be aware that if you have a server that can run stuff, you'll tend to run stuff on it.\n\nFor example, I worked out that my i5 has a GNA (Gaussian Neural Accelerator) that's supported by Frigate via OpenVINO, so I tried running person detection on one of my cameras, and this is the result:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/762z2ktrebxa1.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cbe8928130d0d6f1845d72eec34b0de39618ce2c\n\nIt added like 5-10W of power to run Frigate.

1682956603.0	01-May-2023 08:56:43	First venture into HA, looking for a Smart Plug that can monitor energy usage	purplegreendave	2	134qcnu	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/134qcnu/first_venture_into_ha_looking_for_a_smart_plug/	"I'm looking to buy a UPS for my Plex Server, router etc. Before I do that though I wanted to get a Kill A Watt or similar to see what size UPS I actually need.

Problem with that is I'll probably never use it again after that and it would most likely just go in the junk drawer never to be seen again.

I always wanted to get into some sort of Smart Home stuff ""in the future"". Well I was thinking why not start now with the energy monitor. If I could buy an outlet that would let me monitor the usage at first and then repurpose it for something else. My plan would be:

* Set up a HASS VM on my Unraid Server
* Monitor that information and use that to decide what UPS I want to buy
* Repurpose the plug, for example running our vehicles' block heaters off it in the winter, so I can plug my truck in every night but it only runs the block heaters between 4-8am when the demp is -15C or below.

Is there a good, relatively inexpensive plug that can achieve those things? I'd prefer local (no cloud/accounts/phoning home) and I like Open Source (but it's not a 100% dealbreaker)

I've seen recommendations for something like the ""Sonoff s31 flashed with Tasmota"". I'm usually not opposed to flashing firmware etc on devices, although I've only ever done it with USB based firmware files and have never tried anything that requires soldering or jumping circuit boards. I've also seen people say you need to calibrate them with a calibrated AC Multimeter to get accurate results and I'm afraid I'll be in over my head with that. 

And lastly I'm not sure what protocol to aim for. Seems like the big 3 are WiFi, Zigbee and Z-Wave. If Z-Wave is the only one that won't interfere with my Wifi Network then I think that's what I'd prefer, but maybe it's not as big a deal as I have it made out to be in my head?

Edit: I guess I should mention I'm in Canada so a North American outlet is what I'm looking for."	15	"[""baize: The TP-Link Kasa line has energy monitoring that would not require, but can be integrated with HASS.

Almost as if they’re quickly switching off  then back on (assuming the scene was supposed to turn them off). Anyone  have any clue on how to fix this? My temporary fix is using Google Assistant SDK to send a message to turn them off at the end of the  routine but I’m trying to ween off the cloud completely and this is  obviously counterintuitive to that plan.	2	"['mini_juice: What do the logs say for those switches?

I've currently got an Rpi 4B (with a dongles for ZigBee and zwave) and have an Ubuntu VM in Hyper-V running DahuaVTO2MQTT in a container.  The setup works well except when I have to install an HA update and everything goes down.  Also not too happy with running that separate Ubuntu VM on my Windows server.

So I heard that running Proxmox or ESXi on my NUC is a good setup.  But I'm not sure what should be running in a VM vs a container.

Any input would be appreciated."	16	"['bsmith76s: Use Proxmox and setup home assistant in a VM. Works well for me.

Don't bother with ESXI, Proxmox or any other Hypervisor.\n\nIs that a waste of the power of the NUC? No, I don't think so. There are plenty of addons available for Home Assistant and it is very easy to create more. I like how little there is between Home Assistant and the bare metal.\n\nThere are a few downsides though, it would be nice to run both Plex and Matrix on this same machine. Both can be run as containers easily enough but Plex addon has severe limitations (can't mount network shares easily) and the Matrix addon has been deprecated (edit: I think entirely removed now, not sure why).\n\nThis leaves me with either SSHing directly in and running the containers I need entirely separately from Home Assistant or installing Portainer and doing the same.

Fourth option would be to redo my setup with ESXI or Proxmox.\n\nThere is perhaps the 5th option of working on a better Plex / Matrix addon but might not have the skills."", ""alex3305: I really love my unRAID setup.

I also totally agree its situational, I have a lot more probably going on with my instance than a lot of folks so its built to spec for my specific situation.  I personally like the simplicity of a bare metal install as HA is basically the central point of monitoring for my network.  I need it to be snappy and rock solid stable.  Over the years I've tried about every possible way to install HA and for me this is whats been best.  I do also have to add that with this setup, I have not ever had to deal with a bare metal restore asides from testing.  I also realize that just saying that on the internet pretty much means its going to crash and burn in some horrific fashion tonight...  lol""]"

The same HomeBridge has an addon for my Miele household devices. I can do everything with this addon in HomeKit, except switching on my devices.

As the title suggests I have an issue with casting local media.

So a bit of background info.

I previously was using the HA Let's Encrypt plug-in to enable remote access using my personal google domain, Using this method my Local Media casting worked perfectly.

Since then I have moved to using Nginx proxy Manager as I have more than one service needing to have access to the outside world and because I wanted to keep as few ports open to the external web as possible (apparently this is good practice).

So I now have a new URL for my HA. This works fine with accessing my HA and is linked to my google assistant via google actions and google works nicely with HA too...

However the only snag I have now is that my HA Local Media casting makes the sound as if It's connected, but the steam never plays.

Is there something I'm missing or does this just not work with Nginx.

1682895763.0	30-Apr-2023 16:02:43	Here is a working solution for homeassistant and iPad2 (iOS 9.3.5)	Zealousideal_Durian7	1	1345rct	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1345rct/here_is_a_working_solution_for_homeassistant_and/	"Many had the same troubles like me:

Old iPads mounted to the wall are good enough as a touchscreen BUT

Lovelace UI is incompatible with iOS 9.3.5 the latest version for old iPads.

&#x200B;

Behavior: you can connect to the homeassistant but after login you see ""initializing"" and wait forever.

&#x200B;

Reason: Lovelace UI uses Polymere Javascript framework which needs newer browsers like Safari 11

&#x200B;

Updating to the last 2 supported Browsers (Dolphin (tested), iCab (not tested €€€)) do not work because Dolphin uses iOS builtin Webkit Browserengine.

&#x200B;

What works for some people: install homeassistant app on an iphone of a family member and then on the old ipad in appstore under family sharing (de: Familienfreigabe) you can download the latest compatible version of that app.

&#x200B;

Solution: 2 steps

&#x200B;

1. the last version of homeassistant docker container that kind of works with workaround is: 2021.12

Next version 2022.1 does not, even with workaround.  2021.12 has working knx integration

&#x200B;

2) login token does still not work with 2021.12 so you need to switch to an alternatin authentication method, like trusted networks

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Here is what you need to do (in this order !!!)

&#x200B;

1. &#x200B;

&#8203;

    sudo docker pull homeassistant/home-assistant:2021.12

&#x200B;

2)

    sudo docker run -d \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     --name=homeassistant \
     -h homeassistant \
     -e PUID=1001 \
     -e PGID=1001 \
     -e TZ=CET \
     --net=host \
     -v homeassistant:/config \
    homeassistant/home-assistant:2021.12

&#x200B;

3) connect on a PC and configure a user (doesn't work with trusted networks)

[http://homeassistant.local:8123](http://homeassistant.local:8123)

&#x200B;

4) enable trusted networks in configuration.yaml (insert first 5 rows end change to your net adress)

    sudo nano /var/lib/docker/volumes/homeassistant/_data/configuration.yaml

The existing setup is all in Apple HomeKit (with Philips Hue lights, iSmartGates etc.) although I'm a little on the fence about going down that path again for a new setup... The availability of Apple Home certified gear in Australia is limited and the setup is generally just painful/limited in function. Hue also has some intricacies and is pretty expensive compared to some of the more suitable Zigbee alternatives (like Mercator Ikuu).

I made the switch to Home Assistant \~6 months ago for my place and am pretty happy with it. We've integrated way more than HomeKit allowed and I've even been building sensors with ESPHome. That said, its a bit more of an investment in time to manage, update and support...

HA will need some reasonable hardware and it must be UPS backed.  APC do a unit with normal sockets (Schneider will almost certainly have one with AUS sockets) on it for a reasonable amount - their BACKUPS range is reasonably priced.\n\nThe above is overkill just for some smart lights.

I haven't played with Home Assistant until now or any IoT devices, but I am very familiar with basic microcontrollers(Arduino, pico etc). My plans are to control all the light switches (about 6), a few led strips controlled by ESP32 (let's say 3), probably some relays for power sockets in case I leave the apartment and forget something plugged in, temperature sensors, ac unit, TV, and a locking mechanism. My question is, can the app handle that many wifi connections? Will it decrease my bandwidth consistently? Also, if my router restarts, does all the devices reconnect automatically? Wouldn't be a good ideea for some of the devices to be wired directly to the main board?"	7	"['RedditFauxGold: HA isn’t an access point so the number of Wi-Fi connections is moot as they’re just end-points on the network. You probably do have a top end for network connections but for the little bit of traffic we are talking, I can’t imagine it’s an attainable number.  \n\nWith respect to wired vs wireless, you’re not going to find hard wired wall switches as you’re mixing voltages in the box. Ie, you’d have to run Ethernet drops to the line voltage box where your lighting power is. Your exposure is that you can’t trigger jobs via TCP-IP. You should always plan to have devices keep local control where possible. This also is why I stay clear of exclusively cloud controlled things as it creates a dependency on your ISP.  \n\nAdd to this, are you sure you’re going 100% Wi-Fi connected? I just ask because the overwhelming majority of my house is zwave: robably around 40 or 45 wall switches, a few outlets, and a half dozen LED controllers. Wi-Fi I think I just have a half dozen special use Shelly relays.', 'DogTownR: If you use distributed APs (Access Points) 100+ devices on Wi-Fi won’t be a problem. HA can support 100+ IOT devices easily. You shouldn’t run into any capacity issues.

Will I be able to use it after that, or it will all become redundant?', 'RedditFauxGold: No, I have a Meraki MR42 on each floor of my house so I have no concerns for Wi-Fi congestion. I went zwave because that’s the primary protocol (or at least was when I purchased them 6 or 7 years ago) for automation control. I also like that they create their own mesh and some things like scene control can reside locally on switches.', 'RedditFauxGold: Zwave is not, in and of itself, a cloud solution. I’m sure some vendors have created cloud access capabilities for control when you’re away from home but zwave itself is a communications protocol. It’s not a single vendor thing so there won’t be someone that just decides to stop developing it. Will it eventually sunset? I’m sure it will considering it’s like 20 years old. But when you consider the sheer number of manufacturers that have included it in their switches (Leviton as an example), there will probably be a very long tail on that decision. \n\nAlso, it is added to a local switch (over simplifying a bit…) so even if you completely abandon home automation there won’t be any impact to the basic function.', 'big-ted: Z-Wave is all local, and even if the current HA developer stops, others will pick it up as has happened in the past, it is too important to the NA market for developers not to support it']"

AstonM77	21	133zrcs	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/133zrcs/8_months_later_ive_identified_the_flaw_in_the/	"I set up HA \~8 months ago and installed 2x Emporia Vue energy monitors that I reflashed to integrate with HA (great addition BTW) in addition to adding a handful of other fairly high-frequency sensors over the following months. Essentially a decent baseline to get HA experience with as I had free time to familiarize myself with it.

Flash forward 5-6 months and I notice I am starting to have to provision additional storage to my HA VM in 5-10GB chunks because I am getting low storage warnings every so many weeks.

Three things I have come to learn from this experience...

1. It is very difficult (too difficult tbh) for a relative HA novice to figure out where their storage space is being utilized.
2. ALL of the Youtube videos I've seen on setting up InfluxDB w/ HA have the same flaw... they default you to collecting everything.
3. There is very little information I can find for a relative HA novice on untangling a mess like this after the fact.

FWIW to any novice just setting up InfluxDB that might read this... This website [Optimize Your Home Assistant Database - SmartHomeScene](https://smarthomescene.com/guides/optimize-your-home-assistant-database/?unapproved=2761&moderation-hash=252b4253820f53f16b7a335e2350edf1#comment-2761) was extremely useful for some of the better configuration practices and I wish he would have gone even more into depth on post-install best practices for maintaining a clean DB or even cleaning up an existing mess.

1682870052.0	30-Apr-2023 08:54:12	Z-Wave and Zigbee both stopped working	Saturable	3	133vi1r	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/133vi1r/zwave_and_zigbee_both_stopped_working/	"I'm running HomeAssistant on a Raspberry Pi 4. Prior to yesterday, I only had Z-Wave installed using an Aeotec Z-Stick 7 Plus. All my Z-Wave devices were working normally, but I couldn't find a Z-Wave entry sensor that met my needs. I came across the Aqara entry sensor that runs on Zigbee, so I purchased the SONOFF Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle. I plugged it in yesterday, set up Zigbee, connected the sensor, and everything was working normally - including my existing Z-Wave devices.

Fast-forward a few hours. My Z-Wave network stopped working. Confused, I went to my hub and unplugged/plugged the Aeotec stick. It didn't fix the problem. Then I noticed the Zigbee network went down too.

HomeAssistant still sees the hardware. I checked the configuration files to ensure they were still using the correct USB port, which they both are. I tried removing them and re-adding them, and that didn't work.

Now, I'm at a point where I restored a backup where Zigbee wasn't installed yet. Z-Wave still isn't working, and when I attempt to add Zigbee back, it says an ""Unknown error occured.""

The error message on my Z-Wave network says, ""Driver: Failed to initialize the driver. ZWaveError: Timeout while waiting for an ACK from the controller (ZW0200).""

I've moved both sticks to different ports to no avail (and switched configs). Perhaps I'm missing something?

I have several lumen sensors, but they are affected by the light from bulbs, TVs, and other artificial sources. I want to measure the true level of natural light in the room, irrespective of any artificial sources, so that I can precisely determine when to turn on/off the lights or open/close the shutters/blinds.

I suppose one way to determine the natural brightness level of a room is to create a Node-RED script that adjusts the lux value of a custom helper based on readings from existing lumen sensors and the status of the lights (whether they are on or off). However, this method may be challenging and imprecise.

Alternatively, you can possibly use a color sensor to accurately measure the natural light level in the room. any Zigbee 3.0 and Z-Wave compatible color sensors available on the market ? which has a built-in light sensor that can differentiate between natural and artificial light sources.

Another idea is to calculate the natural light level based on the room's GPS coordinates, the orientation of the windows, and the sun's position relative to the room. However, this approach may be less accurate and more dependent on weather conditions.

\-- Saying that I wonder if the Philips Hue Sensor does that already, I have two values, perhaps the raw measured illuminance is the natural lights? (I'm probably wrong here)

Your indoor lights will have a specific spectrum which you can then subtract from the whole. This will also require you to have a power sensor on each light that let\'s you know if it\'s on or off.

I'm an happy users of HAOS on a mini pc and i'm trying undestand how different things work but there's something i still don't get about wifi devices. I'm currently using some zigbee device with m2qtt and it was pretty easy to use and understand. Now, i have few wifi devices (thermostat, plug, dishwasher, dryer) that i was using before HAOS with their apps. I obviously would like to move over and be able to use them with HAOS.   
The aim of using HA was to stop using external (most of chinese) servers around the world and have all my devices locally connected. 

So the questions is: Why do I still have to log in or create a user to the companies server to be able to connect the devices to HA? The fact they are wifi devices shouldn't be enough to be able to use them with my wifi? If I still connect the devices to HA through the brand server, that means i still have to rely on their servers and i cannot be completely offline?   
Hope anyone could help me undestand this (probably dumb) questions!

Automations run automatically when their triggers are met. You can make automations without writing any code; you just need to navigate to the ""Automations"" section of Home Assistant and press the ""Create Automation"" button.\n\nUnder Trigger, you can choose the Time option. Put in the time you want the automation to trigger.\n\nUnder Actions, select ""Device"". Start typing the name of one of the lights you want to turn on, then select it when it pops up. Then, beneath the name of the device, select what you want it to do (turn on or turn off).\n\nYou can add additional actions for additional lights.\n\nHome Assistant is a very flexible system, so there are many ways to get the same result. You could, for instance, group all the lights together, so you\'d only have to turn on or off the group. You could set a scene with all the lights at the state you want them, then call the scene instead. Or you could use the ""call service"" action to call the ""turn on"" function. But the steps above will work for the basics.\n\nNote: Before you can use any lights in an automation, you have to first *integrate* them into Home Assistant, meaning HA has found them and added them to its list of devices it can control.\n\n**Edit:** On re-reading, I see I sorta missed the mark, since you were asking for a calendar-like interface.

I know how to send it commands via RS232.

Where I am struggling is connecting the custom buttons of custom:mini-media-player to pass long the current source name over to the set\_tuner shell command so that the script can know which station to set which tuner to. For example, I'd have button labelled Z101 - and if the source is FM Tuner 1, then the script would be invoked as `./set_tuner.sh 1011 ""FM Tuner 1""`. The script will take of the heavy lifting of speaking RS232 to the ELAN Digial Dual Tuner.

My card setup is like this.

        cards:
          - type: custom:mini-media-player
            entity: media_player.zone_16
            name: Patio Speaker
            artwork: cover
            sound_mode: full
            volume: true
            source: full
            scale: 2
            shortcuts:
              columns: 4
              buttons:
                - name: Z101.1

                  id: shell_command.set_tuner

                    station: 1011
                    tuner: '{{ states.media_player.zone_16.source}}'

The intent is that my shell command would capture the two parameters that are passed along as specified in the data block - the station number and then the tuner name - which is the current source for that entity. Then over in the shell\_command definition I have this.

    shell_command: set_tuner: 
      ./set_tuner.sh {{ station }} {{ tuner }}

At the moment `{{ tuner }}` seems to come through as the literal text- `{{ states.media_player.zone_16.source}}` which is not the intention. I am wanting to capture the value of the evaluation of that. 

What am I confused about? Is there a more canonical way to do what I want to do?"	6	"[""iWQRLC590apOCyt59Xza: Can't you run the command directly, instead of via a shell script?\nHere's how the docs do it:\nhttps://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/shell_command/#automation-example\n\n\nA shell script might be able to fetch the needed values via the rest API?"", ""itsaride: Try : {{ states('media_player.zone_16.source') }}"", ""eej71: That's certainly an option.\n\n I think the additional context worth mentioning is that I have a Monoprice 6 Zone Controller.

(I have a grafana dashboard on the wall in my office.) But recently with such well-developed plugins for TrueNAS, etc., I started thinking maybe I should move some things to hass. Nice to have them in a nice format on my phone, too.\n\nHere\'s kinda what I\'ve been thinking and would love to hear your thoughts:\n\nSo there are like 5 levels of information importance, I think:\n\n1. Information critically important to everyone onsite (read: tornado warning)\n2. Information important to family/residents (read: power cut out and we\'re on battery backup, primary internet uplink is down)\n3. Information important to home system maintainers (read: main or backup storage array is degraded, VPNs are down, some server isn\'t ping available)\n4. Interesting information (read: air conditioning is running, sprinklers are running, drive time to work)\n5. Detailed information useful for analysis and study (read: troubleshooting a problem, looking for trends to figure something out, figuring out how bad the rain storms predicted later will be)\n\nMy initial thinking for targets for these:\n\n1. Display in a simple, clear format on the primary dashboard with critical color/icons/whatever to make it easy to see what\'s happening and what needs to be done. Possibly convey these out of band (e.g. turn LED lights a different color, audio alert, whatever). Send critical notifications (we\'re iOS, so they cut through settings to make noise)\n2. Display on primary hass dashboard and send non-critical alerts.\n3. Display visualizations on secondary hass dashboard and (as desired) target notifications to me only.\n4. Display on primary or secondary hass dashboard as desired.\n5. This is the interesting one that made me want to share based on your comment. The more I think about it, the more I think I wanna slap this into Zabbix and/or InfluxDB. Those with grafana give the tools to really dig in and study the data if/when I want to do that. No need for it really in hass, and with the awesome hass->Zabbix interface I have the hass data available to match up with the data I decide not to keep in hass for grafana work.\n\nEdit: I decided to start with the ""importance 3"" dashboards because it gives me both exposure to all the data I have and helps me learn the various customization tools available. I think next I\'ll crush the data even more for main dashboard display (like ""do I need an umbrella"" in context with this weather display), then adjust the main dashboard cards to link through directly to the secondary dashboard page for the underlying data if I care.', 'christopherdopp: It’s the windrose-card.

I’m trying to capitalise the work ‘Home’ as seen in the photo. And possibly, instead of not_home, display ‘Away’.

I’ve also tried many different ways to change the battery icons to red when below 20%.

Looking for guidance on how to setup RTL to rotate between meter reading and reading 433 sensors.

1682787166.0	29-Apr-2023 09:52:46	Logbook is lying to me, or I'm going insane	em0ry42	4	1330rf0	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1330rf0	"I press ""off"" on this switch, and seconds later the light comes back on. The logbook claims the ""turn on"" event was fired by the same automation that turned it off, but that automation's traces say it wasn't running at that time.

Someone is lying! And this drives me nuts. Only happens when the switch is involved, Alexa, Google, direct calls to the service, all successfully turn it off and it stays off. But if I use the off button it comes right back on.

Some details:

- light.hallway is a ZHA group consisting of four Gledopto MR16 bulbs. Yeah, I know these suck, that's why they're in the hallway.
- The switch is a Philips Hue rwl020 using [this blueprint](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zha-philips-hue-dimmer-switch-rwl020-rwl021/255048?u=ejpenney) I've modified it slightly over the years but not much.
- I'm using this same blueprint on three other ZHA groups and their corresponding switches with no issues.
- There are two traces for every event because ZHA receives a button up event as well as a down event. The blueprint simply ignores one of them...
- The switch is not bound to the ZHA group because these Hue switches can only be bound to one endpoint and I want to monitor battery levels in HA.
- ""Switch 1"" has the same details, and the same issue

If this was an issue with the blueprint I'd expect to see something in the traces.

If this was an issue with the bulbs, I'd expect them to come back on regardless of the turn off method.

If this was ZigBee congestion, or some signal issue, I would expect the message from the switch to the controller or the controller to the bulbs to never make it at all... Or the turn on event to not appear in the logs!

When I updated to 10.0, my entire system borked (shame on me for not keeping a local backup. Never again!) and I've had to recreate my HA system from scratch. Things were going well until I tried installing the Eufy Security HACS add-in and integration. Everything seemed to go OK. The Simple RTSP add-in installed and appears to run. The Eufy add-in loaded and seems to run. But when I installed the integration, the problems began. First, when I saved the integration's settings, I received a ""type error"" on the ""generate ffmpeg logs"" checkbox. Unchecking, saving then rechecking saving seemed to clear that up. Next, after a HA restart, the Integration asked for a reconfigure captcha, which is expected. When I solved the captcha, the system waited for about 30 seconds and then returned with an ""unknown error"" Trying it again returned a ""500"" error. Restarting HA and trying again yields the same result. This worked under HAOS 9.x. I verified the user and password for the Eufy login and verified that it had access to my devices.

Spin up a new VM and try to import from backup. It failed to work correctly after the backup, again, just like every other time the backup system is horrible.

I bit the bullet and swapped to home assistant. Everything just works; even started adding some new random automation from around the house that I wasn't even trying to do in homeseer because it is so slick. So easy to setup, love that I can dive into the yamls if needed. Android is great, starting to think I can actually set something up easy enough for my inlaws to use. Which was never going to happen with homeseer. No clue how they aren't charging money for this."	3	"[""Hands-On-Katie: Totally agree!

Mainly because I don't like to deep dive into another ecosystem to only find out after x-amount of weeks that it just isn't there. At that time Home Assistant developers were mainly focused on getting as much integrations as possible. But when I finally migrated my home automation to home assistant I was amazed. Everything just _worked_, and it was easy to do. Still the yaml hurdle was there though.\n\nHowever a while back (I guess about 2 years ago?) the HA devs made the very bold choice to start moving things to UI and honestly I couldn't be happier. I still think that sometimes they focus a little too much on quantity and not quality. For instance with blueprints that still leave quite a bit too be desired. Or faulty values/statistics that can be changed, but has a really hard to use interface. Or translations that aren't quite there, but are still released. But that's slowly changing and that's a good thing.\n\nI see a lot of users 'complain' on this sub about the dumbing down of the interface or system as a whole, and while I'm an advanced user, I see benefits in that. For instance when I switched from Supervised to OS in a VM I could actually focus on more on getting things done, instead of doing SysOps. And the same with the new UI elements. My wife loves them and finds them less in your face. And as an advanced user I can still create a custom UI when I want to.\n\nAnyway, nowadays I can fully recommend Home Assistant. Even for non-technical users. Just don't try to do everything all at once and you'll be fine. And it can even be done very cheap with a simple Zigbee coordinator or ESP devices. Oh yeah, also things that HA has picked up really well. Honestly I love this project, and can recommend it to anyone."", 'Normanras: Same!

I know there are projects that allow the other direction, Home Assistant to control E1.31. I'm also aware that there is E1.31 firmware for some ESP based smart devices.

A little backstory: I've recently been working on helping our private school upgrade their stage equipment on a budget. Specifically, I'm donating my time and limited finances. They've got a mix of several decades old Leviton Multiplex (MPX) light dimmer packs, which I'm currently building a converter for to interface to DMX. They've also got a handful of more modern DMX RGB stage lights. I've built a cheap ESP interface for this to allow control from E1.31, so now they can use open source software like QLC+ to orchestrate their stage lighting. So I've got a plan for most of the existing stage lighting.

One remaining item, some cheap LED strings with an IR remote, has yet to be integrated. It got me to thinking how easy doing something like that is on Home Assistant with ESPHome acting as an IR blaster. If I had a way of bridging the E1.31 protocol into Home Assistant acting as a slave device, it would be easy enough for me to set up IR blasters to control just about anything that has IR controls. Furthermore, it would open up the door to using cheaper off the shelf RGB bulbs, dimmers, and switches for stage lighting and other controls. I might even venture to build an actuator for the stage curtains. With templates in HA, translating a DMX channel value to an action would be easy enough.

I've done a bunch of searching on the topic but most of the results are, as I mentioned in the first paragraph, not really applicable to what I'm trying to do. Has anyone else done something similar?"	5	"['the012345: Check out node red it has some e.1.31 plugins', 'dsg123456789: You should be able to do this with only esphome.

Indy_Pendant	2	132e6z4	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/132e6z4/playing_nonlocal_media_through_sonos_speakers/	"Sonos question:  I'm trying to play various forms of media through the Sonos media_player entity.  

A local MP3 works.  NAS MP3 works.  

Internet radio from the HA radio browser doesn't work.  Internet radio url from a media_player.play_media service event doesn't work.  Internet MP3  doesn't work.

Before Music Assistant broke, it created its own media_player entities for my Sonos speakers and those were able to play all types of media I could throw at it.  That's gone now and I have no idea where to even start figuring this out.  Any ideas?

For example:

`media_player.play_media`

    {
    ""media_content_id"":""https://www.learningcontainer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kalimba.mp3"",
    ""media_content_type"":""music""
    }

results in a 10 second pause, a ""success"" message, and no sound.  With a `media_content_id` of `http://stream-47.zeno.fm/3u1qndyk8rhvv?zs=P6-JOvxKSIieFzzuMHV9Qg` returns the error `Call-service error. Error calling SonosMediaPlayerEntity.play_media on media_player.living_room: UPnP Error 714 received: Illegal MIME-Type from 192.168.30.32` (.30.32 is my Sonos speaker)."	26	"['No_Towels5379: Have you tried adding those service to your favorites?', 'the012345: Music Assistant 2  is worth playing with.

Honestly, it's a huge pain in the ass, and the only thing I use the app for is to set alarms, and to add something to my favorites."", 'jjlawren: If playing directly from the Radio Browser works for you, it\'s far easier to create the service call using the automation/script editor. Create a new automation and go straight to ""Add Action"". Select ""Play Media"", your Sonos speaker, and then browse to the radio station using the media browser. You now have the exact same service call that the media browser sends to the device when using the UI. Switch to ""Edit in YAML"" and you can copy/paste it as needed.\n\nThe radio browser service call you pasted _looks_ fine, but give the above a shot instead.\n\nAs for random internet radio stations, it takes a bit of patience and luck. The integration could probably be improved to make this easier, but I don\'t listen to many radio stations myself. That being said, if you can find the radio station using the native Sonos app, you can save it as a Sonos favorite and select it that way from the HA media browser. Several people in this thread have suggested that already and it\'s probably the easiest solution by far if it\'s listed that way.', ""Indy_Pendant: Creating an automation script for a Radio Browser station also works.  The event fired looks identical to the other.  Converting to yaml gives a bit richer content.  Firing that event from the Dev Tools panel does nothing so I'm concluding that the Dev Tools Events panel doesn't actually work as I expect.  As before, though, playing that event through NodeRed does work.  So at the very least I can play radio stations via HA's radio browser.  That's much better than nothing, so thanks for that!\n\n-----\n\nI'm constructing a new house and adding smart features from the ground up, including Sonos speakers throughout.  I was using Media Assistant before (in my test setup) to stream everything I could think of right to the speakers as a target and it worked great.  However, MA broke and the new one doesn't have HA integration (yet) so I would rather not rely on it.\n\nSo I'd like to contribute to this/your integration (https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/sonos).  Would you be willing to show me how to get this setup and running in an IDE where I can debug it?  If you can get me that far, I can figure the rest out.  I'd like to build out the functionality so that it is at least on-par to what MA was offering as far as playing content."", ""jjlawren: Why not use the Services tab to call the service? Calling by sending an event is adding a layer of abstraction that could be adding to the confusion here.\n\nGetting a dev environment set up is a bit outside of the scope of a reddit post. I'd suggest to take a look at https://developers.home-assistant.io and perhaps look at the `async_play_media` method in `sonos/media_player.py`once you're ready to start.\n\nSome of the work is also done by the `soco` package, so being familiar with that would also be helpful."", ""Indy_Pendant: Because I was so focused on the Events tabs that I didn't see the Services tab. Oops.\n\nThanks for that link.  I found a guide for debugging via VS code:\nhttps://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/development_environment?_highlight=debug#debugging-with-visual-studio-code\n\nNot my IDE of choice (JetBrains has my love) but I can give it a shot.\n\nI'll get that setup and who knows, maybe you'll see some PRs coming down the line.  :)  I see HA Core has some 200 PRs open against it.  In the case that I make something worth contributing for the Sonos integration, would it be worth pinging you or just open the PR and let the process take it's natural course?"", ""jjlawren: Try the Services tab and see if the behavior is different.\n\nAny PR you'd make in `core` that touches files in the `sonos/` integration directory would automatically ping me for review."", 'Indy_Pendant: Super, good to know.\n\nCalling via the Services tab does indeed work.

We primarily use these to play music, control our lights (Hue, Govee), set timers, and very rarely see camera feeds. We are also very much an Apple household: two iPhones, multiple iPads, Apple Watches, two Apple TV‘s, a Macbook, etc. Currently, I’ve been experimenting with Home Assistant on an old mini PC running Windows 10. The problem I have here is obvious.. it crashes a lot. About once a week or so.

I would very much like to switch out all of the Echo devices for HomePods and Homepod mini’s and also do a more reliable HA build on a Rasperry Pi 4. My question is: Does anyone else have a setup like this and could you tell me how your pro’s/con’s? Also, would Siri/HomePod be able to control ALL of my smart home gadgets? We have everything I mentioned above but also: Logitech Harmony for TV control, a WIFI enabled home theater receiver, Xbox, MyQ garage door openers, several Ring cameras/doorbell, a couple of Wemo smart plugs, Lutron light switches, Roku TV, Govee lights, and Hue lights. Of course, I’ll likely be adding to this in the future as well.

What do you guys think? Would this make a good setup or am I missing something? Oh, and we currently have Spotify which I know is kind of a bummer that it won’t work with HomePods, but I’m not totally opposed to switching to Apple Music too.

Thanks so much for any input you could provide!"	10	"['peterxian: I am bridging almost 100 accessories from HA to HomeKit, which we control with iPhones, HomePod minis, Apple TVs, etc. It works very, very well and is (in my opinion) the easiest and safest way to enable voice control, GPS presence, and remote access away from home. For the most part, if you can integrate it with HA you can control it with Siri. The main restriction is that HomeKit doesn\'t support the wide range of [device types](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homekit#supported-components) HA does, so you can\'t bridge your power meter or your washer/dryer for example, because HomeKit doesn\'t have a model for those things (the new ""assist"" command should make up for this, somewhat).', ""gooeyblob: I have Home Assistant running on an Intel NUC on Proxmox and have the HomeKit integration setup in HA and it works pretty well. I have a mix of WiFi devices (some bulbs, a garage opener, TVs), Bluetooth (air quality monitors) and Zigbee (bulbs, leak sensors, etc. through Zigbee2MQTT and it all works pretty well. I have some cameras running through Scrypted, but everything else is through HA.\n\nWe use HomePods and iPhones and Apple TV and the integration is nice. Pretty much nothing is missing from what I can tell. There will be some various issues where a HomePod will mysteriously disappear from the internet and was somehow also your hub at the time and all your stuff won't work, but that hasn't happened in a couple months for me since the recent architecture upgrades and it's been rock solid. You can control things with Siri or your phone while you're away from the house as well.\n\nI don't use any automations in the Apple Home app (but they work), I still run all that through HA."", '400HPMustang: I have an Apple household.

I’ve also never heard of Proxmox, so I’ll look that up. I’m getting from your post that it is more reliable than windows? I also really like the idea of not having to make yet another purchase (RP 4).   \nIf I use the Homekit integration, will all of the devices automatically show up for my wife too? And will I have to do the same amount of organizing on her account?', 'peterxian: The “assist” [command is a shortcut](https://next.home-assistant.io/docs/assist/) you can add to your phone to route voice requests directly to the HA language processor. It’s limited for now, but quickly improving. So (eventually) you can say, “hey Siri, assist” and Siri replies, “ok” and anything you say after that goes to HA, like “how much time is left on the dyer?” and HA will send the answer to Siri without the dryer needing to be aware of HomeKit. Since Apple doesn’t actually make any of their own smart home gear, it’s up to device makers to request new types. I’d expect power monitoring to be added in a future update (Eve has energy monitors and is a big HomeKit client) but the rest could take a while.', '400HPMustang: Proxmox is a base OS for virtualizing servers…so yes it’s more reliable for this task. [Here’s the guide](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/installing-home-assistant-os-using-proxmox-7/201835) I was talking about. After you set everything up and bridge all of your devices over you just have to organize them in the home app once and you and your wife will be set. You will have to specifically bridge each device from HA to the Home app but that gets easier after the first mass effort', 'dadbauld: Very cool! Excited to see this get better.']"
1682717979.0	28-Apr-2023 14:39:39	Lorex 2K Doorbell - got it working in HA	senor_peligro	9	132am32	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/132am32/lorex_2k_doorbell_got_it_working_in_ha/	"There's been a few posts about the Lorex 2K doorbell which I was going to reply to but I decided instead to create a new post for those interested in getting it to work in HA.  It was a struggle but I got button presses and motion detection working.

First step is that you have to install DahuaVTO2MQTT located here:

[https://github.com/elad-bar/DahuaVTO2MQTT](https://github.com/elad-bar/DahuaVTO2MQTT)

This represented my first problem.  There is an HA add-on that is very old and not supported so it has to be installed in a docker container (which I have never used before) and it only seems to work on AMD64 architecture.  So I wasn't able to run the docker on an RPI.  I had to create an Ubuntu VM on my always-on Windows Server and then install it there.  I won't go into great detail on setting up this docker as I am not an expert but I eventually was able to hack my way into setting it up.  But here are the contents of my docker-compose.yml file.  Note that the default username for the doorbell is admin.  The password is setup in the Lorex app when you add your doorbell.  It isn't the cloud account that you are forced to setup but the actual doorbell password.

`version: '3'`

`services:`

  `dahuavto2mqtt:`

`image: ""`[`registry.gitlab.com/elad.bar/dahuavto2mqtt:latest`](https://registry.gitlab.com/elad.bar/dahuavto2mqtt:latest)`""`

`container_name: ""dahuavto2mqtt""`

`hostname: ""dahuavto2mqtt""`

`restart: ""unless-stopped""`

`environment:`

`- DAHUA_VTO_HOST=<ip address of your doorbell<`

`- DAHUA_VTO_USERNAME=admin`

`- DAHUA_VTO_PASSWORD=<password that you setup on your doorbell>`

`- MQTT_BROKER_HOST=<ip address of your HA assuming that you installed mqtt there>`

`- MQTT_BROKER_PORT=1883`

`- MQTT_BROKER_USERNAME=<mqtt username>`

`- MQTT_BROKER_PASSWORD=<mqtt password>`

`- MQTT_BROKER_TOPIC_PREFIX=DahuaVTO`

`- MQTT_BROKER_CLIENT_ID=DahuaVTO2MQTT`

`- DEBUG=False`      

Once you've got that container running, you will need to enable the camera in HA by adding these lines to your configuration.yaml.

`allowlist_external_dirs:`

`- ""/config/tmp"" # You need this to capture pictures`

`ffmpeg:`

`camera:`

  `- platform: ffmpeg`

`name: Lorex 2K Doorbell`

`input: rtsp://admin:<password for doorbell>@<ip address for doorbell>`


You now have to reboot HA.  If not you will not be able to see the camera.

I also created a script to capture pictures from the doorbell using the camera settings above.  I added a delay of 2 seconds because I find that there is a small lag between the event trigger and the actual event.  And you will see that I always overwrite the picture in the /config/tmp/ directory.

`alias: Lorex 2K Doorbell Take Picture`

`sequence:`

  `- delay:`

`hours: 0`

`minutes: 0`

`seconds: 2`

`milliseconds: 0`

  `- service: camera.snapshot`

`data:`

`filename: /config/tmp/lorex_2k_doorbell_picture.jpg`

`target:`

`entity_id: camera.lorex_2k_doorbell`

`mode: single`

`icon: mdi:camera`


The next part took me a while to figure out.  At this point, MQTT should be able to receive messages from the doorbell and I had to figure out what was being sent.  I did this with MQTT Explorer (I am not an expert).  I eventually figured out that when you press the doorbell button, it publishes a topic ""DahuaVTO/PhoneCallDetect/Event"".  We are particularly interested in these messages where the action is ""Start"".  I saw that for each button press the doorbell sends a Start and Stop so you probably only want to trigger your automations once.  In the example automation below, I listen only for Start and then I send a message on discord with a picture.

`alias: Front door doorbell pressed (alert)`

`description: """"`

`trigger:`

  `- platform: mqtt`

`topic: DahuaVTO/PhoneCallDetect/Event`

`payload: Start`

`value_template: ""{{ value_json.Action }}""`

`condition: []`

`action:`

  `- service: script.lorex_2k_doorbell_take_picture`

`data: {}`

  `- service: notify.discord_ha_notification`

`data:`

`message: ""{{now().strftime(\""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"")}} - Front door doorbell pressed""`

`target: <this is redacted>`

`data:`

`images:`

`- /config/tmp/lorex_2k_doorbell_picture.jpg`

`mode: single`

Detecting motion is very similar except you are waiting for the topic ""DahuaVTO/VideoMotion/Event"".  And again, you probably only want the Start action.

`alias: Front door doorbell motion detected (alert)`

`description: """"`

`trigger:`

  `- platform: mqtt`

`topic: DahuaVTO/IntelliFrame/Event`

`payload: Start`

`value_template: ""{{ value_json.Data.Action }}""`

`condition: []`

`action:`

  `- service: script.lorex_2k_doorbell_take_picture`

`data: {}`

  `- service: notify.discord_ha_notification`

`data:`

`message: >-`

`{{now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"")}} - Front door doorbell motion`

`detected`

`target: <this is redacted>`

`data:`

`images:`

`- /config/tmp/lorex_2k_doorbell_picture.jpg`

`mode: single`

I think that these were all my steps but if I missed anything please let me know.

EDIT:
So after a few days of testing I ran into an issue with motion detection.  I made an automation that turns on my lights when motion is detected.  What happened was that suppose a passing car triggered motion detection.  My porch light would turn on.  The automation turns off the light after 2 minutes but when the light turns off, it triggers motion detection again.  And then when the light turns off it triggers it again.  So after studying the MQTT messages, I figured out that the doorbell has person detection which is reliable and doesn't trigger with the lights.  I've updated my code above.  Instead of using the topic ""DahuaVTO/VideoMotion/Event"", I'm now using ""DahuaVTO/IntelliFrame/Event"".  The value_template also changed slightly from ""value_json.Action"" to ""value_json.Data.Action""."	1	"[""senor_peligro: For anyone that may have seen my post,  I've updated it with new findings to fix an issue with motion detection.  The details are in the EDIT notes of my original post.""]"

If that one breaker (the red one) trips I guess all of your flat is out of electricity, which isn't great, but also not terrible. \n\nI guess your kitchen and/or bathroom have separate protection circuitry?

Basically a protection for areas with exposed metal (like stovetops, ovens) or wet areas so you are protected even if there is no direct short but for example water bridging mains power to a metal appliance which you'll eventually touch.\n\nEdit: GFCI protection is what I meant. Just looked it up."", ""AdorablePickles: The red switch is an isolation point, not a breaker that'll trip.\n\n/u/Reasonable-Low-4778 - Beyond reading your meter/adding credit etc, there's not really anything for you to _do_ here, and it would largely be illegal for you to do so. Your local DNO (the people who own the electricity network) own everything up to and including your meter, and those parts are their responsibility.\n\n\nThe part that's useful for you to know about is at the other end of those two grey cables coming out from your (red) isolation switch. They're called tails, and they head to your consumer unit (aka fuse box, breaker board, distribution board etc).\n\nOn your consumer unit, there's usually a liftable flap, behind which you'll see a row of switches, these are the breakers for the different circuits within your home. Do not unscrew or open anything to do with your consumer unit - just that flap and the row of breakers/switches are all you should be interacting with. You'll usually find your consumer unit in the back of kitchen cupboard, a closet or a hallway on the ground floor, it should be relatively close to the meter itself, as the tails are only allowed to be so long.\n\nI can understand the concern about how your meter board looks - but if it gives you any peace, that's quite a modern looking meter (especially given it's Zigbee-enabled) which means it was installed relatively recently. The DNO are responsible for that, and the electrician that installed it will have had to test it and submit photos to the DNO for their approval. If it was unsafe or unsatisfactory, they'd have sent the electrician back out to rectify it.""]"

I have a HP t620 thinclient, 4core 8 gb ram amd. I have installed home assistant OS latest version on it, i used the firmware x86-64 generic. I am very pleased with the performance, but not so with how some simple stuff can get complicated. I understand that this is for more people with experience, but these kind of things could help us noobs get experience.

I have frigate up and running for couple months now, it works nice, sometimes only some errors in the log i don't get, but they don't bother.

But now i have received my tpu first i ordered the coral dual edge tpu, knowing that most likely only 1 tpu will work but i saw there are adapters from bluesmoke for that of needed the double tpus.
But couldn't get this working. So i searched and since i had waited for 6 months for that to receive i now saw the m.2 B+M key version available with 2 days shipping.  So i immediately bought it, now i am trying to get this up and running. But i already get stuck at the point of following the steps discribed on the google coral page. Is there any of you who likes to help me or through here or through a private chat?
When i try the first echo code installing the drivers i receive an error, i tried just booting up without any installation and it seemed to recognize that it had a tpu, i saw it in the log of frigate after setting up the detectors,  but it seemed like it didn't know how to use it. If any of you could help me out i will post on the forum and here a step by step noob guide to help others with it. Because this is such a great pain in the behind. Kind regards for already reading this long story.

Edit: my goal is facial recognition, but i want to learn the steps in between and also i don't know how fast i am going to learn to use docker. I already tried it a bit but couldn't figure it out, so i started with HA OS."	9	"['nickm_27: HA OS already comes with the coral drivers included so there is no reason to worry about that.

Did you get an error? Did Frigate\'s debug page show ""coral"" as the detector and show an inference speed?

Have some questions though.

1 - I have Tailscale setup to run HA outside the home, do I need to do anything different because I’m running this?

2 - When it says host, I assume that’s just the local IP of my Pi? Does Tailscale make any difference here?

3 - It says port 3000 but I’ve heard people using different ports, which port do I choose?

4 - When it says username and password, does this mean I have to create an account initially on the AdGuard website? This is no problem I just want to know the correct process.

My most recent discoveries were [IQVIA](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/iqvia) which pulls in allergy, asthma, and flu data based on your location.  This one makes for some great visualizations and grafana dashboards. 

The other one that I found, which had serious potential but turned out to be a dud, is [OpenSky](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/opensky/).  This integration creates a radius around your house and then identifies when an aircraft is within that radius.  Unfortunately, the OpenSky integration isn't functioning properly so I wasn't able to use it.  

Does anyone else have any similar style integrations/add-ons that most people don't know about?  I'd love to hear them.

I recently moved my ecobee over from HomeKit to HomeKit Controller and I’m curious about the refresh rate or polling speed others have seen that have used HKC.

With HomeKit, the motion sensors immediately changed state on my phone and understandably the HA ecobee integration obvious has a delay from the cloud. Recently I've had a couple of instances where ecobee's room assignments for the sensors were lost and all automations went with it.  So I tried moving it to Home Assistant via HKC so I could do more customization on the automations and improve reliability.

With HomeKit controller, I expected similar performance to HomeKit on my phone but it seems like the response rate for the motion controllers is still several minutes at best.

Has anyone been able to get closer to real-time response to motion updates with HKC? In HomeKit I assume the rapid response is due to Bluetooth comms rather than via Wi-Fi and I’m guessing that’s not how HKC works behind the scenes?

Any insight or help would be appreciated.  Thanks"	4	"['jmcgeejr: Mine is a little slow by maybe 10-15 seconds but not as bad as you.', 'dxmnkd316: Ok so doing some further testing, looks like the refresh rate on my setup is five minutes.

I'm running the elgato streamdeck plugin for HA and one of the functions I want to control is my switchbot blinds.

below is the code for one of the entities,  this works (kinda) but not how I want

However the method I'm attempting it appears value of the  ""reverse\_bedroom"" variable is not retained between button presses.

so consecutive button presses result from  0 > 25 > 50 > 100  THEN  > 75 >100 >75 >100 >75 . Instead of decreasing to 0 then increasing again.

I bought one of these with the thought that's it's perfect to run as a HA Assist satellite device. I saw the M5STACK ATOM Echo is being used by the dev team and wondered if the software could be installed on the ESP-BOX too at the expense of display support, or maybe the screen could just have a static clock on it for now if detected.

Also I have a raspi with the Google AIY V1 voice kit that could also be a satellite (currently running with Mycroft/OVOS) if there was any plans for software for that."	1	"['_mineshaft_gap_: I have one as well.

The idea is that whenever a product is almost empty or finished, I can simply scan it, and the barcode scanner will forward the barcode to Home Assistant using [**https://github.com/markusressel/barcode-server**](https://github.com/markusressel/barcode-server). From there, Home Assistant would look up the barcode in an Excel list using a Python script and then add the product's name to my shopping list.

At the moment, I am stuck with establishing a connection between Home Assistant and the barcode-server. The barcode-server has a WebSocket API, but I'm not sure how to connect to it from Home Assistant. I've been searching for information on how to do this, but I can only seem to find guides on connecting to Home Assistant's WebSocket API, not the other way around (i.e., from Home Assistant to a client, in this case, the barcode-server).

Any help, guidance, or resources to help me establish this connection would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!

The inability to constrain versions of a script with the same parameters from running together. So I can specify that a script can only be run in `single`, `parallel` mode...but what I _really_ want is a script to adjust my thermostats(I have 2) but you can only run it against one thermostat at a time. \n1. The fact that you can\'t have JSON as a state value. So if you want to talk to an API for your trash company, get that data back and then display a notification on your dashboard like ""Hey trash pickup is delayed this week because it\'s St Patrick\'s day""....guess what - each field from the API has to be it\'s own sensor, which means not only do you have to re-implement a bunch of shit in each sensor to get that value, but actually building this is borderline impossible due to the fact that you can\'t do any kind of filtering logic to get the value you want in `json_attributes_path` or `json_attributes` meaning you now need to have one rest sensor to actually *GET* the data from the API, then a bunch of other template sensors to read that sensor\'s state and parse it down to something useful.\n2. ~~The inability to use templates for REST `GET` requests. Need to talk to an API that wants semi-dynamic data like your location or a timestamp? Well guess what buddy, you\'re outta luck. You can do it for `POST` requests in the body...but not get requests in the URL. Seriously why.~~ EDIT: This is all wrong. What you _actually_ can\'t do is have dynamic data in the `POST` body.\n3. The new lighting controls. Sorry. Yes, I know they look nice...but they\'re terrible to use. My wife hates them. I hate them. Surely I don\'t need to elaborate on this.\n4. Whatever coked-up mess of an algorithm dictates where things get laid out on the dashboard. I\'ve given up trying to understand this and just accepted the fact that my dashboards currently do and always will look untidy. Move something up one element and now it\'s in another column. Move it up two elements, now it\'s in the first column again but moved down 3 places. Adding a single new item to your dashboard seemingly can transform it from being a narrow two column dashboard to spanning the whole screen with 4 columns. I can only assume that this layout algorithm was the same person who designed the layout tools for images/text in Microsoft word. The only way to get any kind of sensible behavior out of it is to forcibly constrain the layout with vertical/horizontal grid cards.\n1. The inability to refer to ""people"" as a whole. As-in ""I want this automation to be triggered when everyone that the device tracker knows about are detected""\n1. Speaking of the device tracker - why do I have to refer to people\'s devices in the default notification service. Why can I not just say `service.notify_lenswipe` or have a `user` attribute to notify all of that user\'s devices. Instead I have to manually specify what device the notification goes to `like service.notify_lenswipe_pixel2` or `service.notify_lenswipe_ipad`. This means several things. Firstly it means that if my phone\'s entity id ever changes, I have to either update it to be the same as my old phone, or go and update all my automations - which is absolutely super! Secondly, it also means that it\'s very difficult at a glance to tell the difference between versions of my phone that the device tracker has from the unifi integration(to determine if I\'m on the WiFi or not - and therefore home) versus the android app on my phone. Really it should be possible to just say `notify.lenswipe` and the notification gets chucked into what ever message queue HA have running and whatever device I acknowledge it on first gets it. Whether it\'s dismissed from the others is an implementation detail. Maybe this could be tweaked so that you _can_ still specify the device (via a `device` attribute?) if you _really_ want to....', ""murran_buchstanseger: Can't believe no one has mentioned this - case sensitivity in conditions.

Looking into the [Private Voice Assistant](https://next.home-assistant.io/projects/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/#about-the-analog-phone) documentation, I realized that I would need a Grandstream HT801 for each landline, this is problematic since my only ethernet jacks are in my living room.

I got a Shelly 1 Plus for my garage door. 3D Printed a mount for it and put it on my garage door opener. I am also going to get an Aqara sensor to watch the status on the garage door. So I'd like to set these up in Home Assistant, then when the garage has been open for X amount of time, send me an alert so I can close it from HA (might set up an automation to do it automatically, but haven't decided yet).

My problem comes in when all of the tutorials show that I need a reed switch for the Shelly. I wasn't intending to use one of these. So I skipped this step and started setting up the garage door and it won't go up/down. So is the reed switch absolutely necessary then?"	9	"['simonparkis: You can create a template cover device combining the Shelly and aqara sensors into a single cover device.

A second reed switch on the door would help indicate it closed completely, and not stuck somewhere in between.\n\nYou can use the Aqara vibration sensor, but at 3x the cost of 2 reed switches. I also have this on my mailbox. It’s more complex than it needs to be I think. The reed switch is dead simple.', 'ucrbuffalo: Yeah, in theory, that’s the plan. However, when I test the Shelly using their app, it’s not opening the garage. So I’m kinda trying to trouble shoot that first.\n\nIf the template works, then that’s my plan, but I’m worried that the Shelly isn’t going to work without the reed switch.', 'ucrbuffalo: The Aqara sensor will have the same function as the reed switch would.', 'ucrbuffalo: Ok so if the reed switch isn’t strictly necessary, then that must mean my wiring is wrong. I’ll have to track down the issue when I get home. \n\nRight now, the Shelly 1 activates, then I see the arrows on the back of the garage light up (up, down, down, down) but the motor never engages.', 'DIY_CHRIS: To use without a reed switch, you’ll need to set up the Shelly as a momentary button. Typically the reed switch is placed on the input of the Shelly, but without it, the Shelly input should be configured to follow the status of the button.']"

I tried to integrate them into HA when I switched, but found it to be kind of a pain. I finally sold the plus earlier this year but since the dots are almost a spam product (for a while, you could get them bundled with almost anything from amazon), there was no point in selling them, so I ripped its brains out but kept the speaker part of it.

I still feel weird talking to tech, but if there\'s an easy solution to creating a speaker for some audio feedback, I\'m all for it.

I don\'t know for the US, but EU (or maybe just German) law requires them to hand over all data they collect upon the user\'s request and what a creepy adventure it was going through those files… I got those alexas in 2018, used them a little bit with a homebridge integration, but after a while only for spotify playback. I still had some 150 audio files, in some of them you could hear when the dishwasher was running and some parts of phone calls were ""accidentally"" recorded. \n\nIf having a local voice assistant just gets 1% of alexa users to ditch that shady ass product, it was all worth it.', ""strawberry_gin: Is there any planned support for a Piper docker container that isn't an addon?

New here, and new to reddit. I have an older navien thankless water heater. Works great when it's in recirculation mode but is basically useless otherwise. I am just dipping my toes into electronics like this but basically I would just like it to run the circulation circuit any time it senses water flow. The unit has an external controller. Where would somebody start to do such a thing?	8	"[""more-cow-bell: Are you saying when you are using hot water the unit is not turning on the burners automatically? That's a problem with the unit itself. I would suspect a flow sensor or something is not working. Without a working flow sensor it would not have the ability to control the burners properly."", 'pearlfloyd72: At the point the water turns on, the water heater is trying to get water to the faucet that has the hot turned on, so it is too late for the recirculating pump. What you could do is hook it up to a smart plug and toggle the recirculating pump before you need water, of course this would not be automated. But it only takes a couple of minutes for the pump circulate the hot water. I have done this and it works. \n\nI currently use a smart plug with my tankless water heater recirculating pump. I have it set up to start recirculating when I am home during the hours I am awake. Personally, with this set-up, my gas consumption is low. But if you want even less, you could set it up to turn on when you are likely to use hot water. So if you shower every morning at 7am, have it start recirculating at 6:45 and turn it off at 7:15.', 'primoslate: Does your Navien unit support [NaviLink](https://www.navieninc.com/accessories/navilink)?

I did replace the flow sensor and there was no improvement. It may have to do with the fact my loop line is a larger diameter then the faucets so it doesn't pull much volume of water through the system. But when the recirc pump is on it works great!"", ""rolyatrd: Yeah it does allow me to program the recirc pump at certain times. But it just ends up running a lot. Because of the way my plumbing is set up, when the recirc pump turns on, it's basically instant hot water. But no matter what I do, if it isn't recirculating, then the water just doesn't get hot. I might just end up running an external pump and then go with a smart plug."", ""rolyatrd: No, it's too old. It's a NR-210A. Too old for the hot button as well."", ""ShittyPlumber: Have you come over to r/plumbing or r/askaplumber to make sure the unit is up and running properly? When's the last time you had it flushed? More cold water passing through without heating, I'd start with getting it serviced before going through all these routes."", 'pearlfloyd72: I completely bypass the timer that came with the recirculating pump. I only use the smart switch to control it now. With a smart switch You could set up a script to turn on the recirculating pump for 5 minutes, then turn it on. You could trigger the script with a button on your phone, through a smart speaker, or even a motion detector. I am not sure how new you are to HA, but if you need some help setting any of this up, feel free to PM me. \n\nOn a separate note, I notice my recirculating pump starts running more when the instant water heater needs to be flushed.']"

Listen, what I'm trying to do should be easy. I got myself a a little Zwave outlet connected to Smart things Hub 3 which is integrated to my HomeAssistant.  


**Now here's what I want:**  
If the outlet becomes unresponsive (presumably because it lost power) then I want to perform actions. 

**Now here's la pinche problema:**    
It's really on the SmartThings side. When I unplug it it takes several minutes (up to 32 to be exact) before ST knows and passes this info along to HA. ST has this variable for ""checkinterval"" which is set at 1920 seconds. I cannot figure out how to change this or if it even can be changed.   


So, is there a way either in HA or in ST to force poll this thing every n minutes, get a response, and if no response then do something?  


Where is this ""checkinterval"" var set? Is this from the device? From ST? Can it be modified?  


Is there an abstract way to poll/ping it through HA and get a response?  


For this purpose I need better resolution than 32 minutes. I could live with 2-3.

(Or maybe I'm just stupid and bad at Googling. Literally who knows.)

First, I made an automation triggered by tapping the NFC tag on top of her food bin. It will change a Boolean toggle to ON. 

`alias: [Dog Name] Got Fed`

`description: """"`

`trigger:`

  `- platform: tag`

`tag_id: 06ac4c34-4280-46b2-9419-13d4cd56ec96`

`condition: []`

`action:`

  `- service: input_boolean.turn_on`

`data: {}`

`target:`

`entity_id: input_boolean.dogname_fed`

`mode: single`

Then, I made it so that every day at midnight and 4pm, the toggle was reset to OFF. 

`alias: Reset [Dog Name] Feed`

`description: """"`

`trigger:`

  `- platform: time`

`at: ""00:00:00""`

  `- platform: time`

`at: ""16:00:00""`

`condition: []`

`action:`

  `- service: input_boolean.turn_off`

`data: {}`

`target:`

`entity_id: input_boolean.dogname_fed`

`mode: single`

This enables the reminder automation, which I've outlined below. It's a doozy (or at least it was for me when I was first building it), so I've added some notes inline.

*Below, the automation is set to trigger every day at 11am or 7pm, the latest times she's willing to be fed.* 

`trigger:`

  `- platform: time`

`at: ""19:00:00""`

*This part is straightforward and checks if the boolean toggle to OFF. If it isn't, the rest of the automation doesn't run.* 

`condition:`

  `- condition: state`

`entity_id: input_boolean.dogname_fed`

`state: ""off""`

I have setup a cloudflare domain name and have ports running back to my instance (with router / firewall setup as well).   This has all been running fine.  No local access to HA instance, all runs via Cloudflare (with their firewall etc).

I'm trying to setup MQTT and have issues where the MQTT integration cannot connect to MQTT server (installed via HA Add on, Mosquito MQTT).  I figuring because all traffic has to run via Cloudflare, cannot just use ""core-mosquito"" as the broker name - this needs to be another URL.  User has been setup and tested.

1682603733.0	27-Apr-2023 06:55:33	Help! Issues Adding HA to Existing NGINX Reverse Proxy with SSL	LoungingLemur2	1	130myc3	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/130myc3/help_issues_adding_ha_to_existing_nginx_reverse/	"Ok so I've been going crazy over the last few weeks trying to get this to work. Here's my setup; everything runs within the same Win10 Pro PC:

\- The following ports are forwarded on my router to the Win10 machine IP:

* 80:80
* 443:443

\- HAOS 10.0 running in VirtualBox

\- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS running within WSL2

\- Docker Desktop running on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

\- NGINX docker container running within Docker Desktop

\- Nextcloud docker container running within Docker Desktp

&#x200B;

**NGINX Config Info:**

I successfully installed certbot with the duckdns plugin and obtained certificates for the following (sanitized) domains (even though wildcart certs are supposedly supported, I couldn't get anything to work with them so I just used certbot to create certs for all these domains):

* mydomain.duckdns.org
* nc.mydomain.duckdns.org
* ha.mydomain.duckdns.org

\- My Nextcloud instance is successfully proxied via SSL to its domain, so I know that my SSL certs are working correctly

 

`server {`  
    `listen 443 ssl http2;`  
    `server_name ha.mydomain.duckdns.org;`  
    `ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.duckdns.org/fullchain.pem;`  
    `ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.duckdns.org/privkey.pem;`  
    `location / {`  
        `proxy_pass http://192.168.1.B:8123$request_uri;`

`proxy_set_header Host $host;`  
        `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;`  
        `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;`  
    `}`  
`}`

I think my issue may be one of two things, let's address which IP address first:

**POSSIBLE ISSUE #1**

* 192.168.1.A: IP for Win10 host machine
* 192.168.1.B: IP for HA instance (it runs under a different IP); network adapter in VirtualBox is in bridged mode
* 172.30.32.0: HA internal IP (sounds like it's the same for every HA installation)
* 172.20.55.C: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS internal IP

For my Nextcloud NGINX server block, I need to use the command `proxy_pass http:172.20.55.C:<NC PORT>` in order for the proxy to work correctly. This makes sense as the Nextcloud instance is running within Docker, whose IP should match the IP in Ubuntu from `hostname -I`. However, **which IP address do I need to place in my proxy pass command for HA?** Obviously I've tried using all of the above IP's, as well as 127.0.0.1. Here is my current HA Config file as well (clearly I just put every IP in the trusted\_proxies section while troubleshooting this:

`# Remote access settings`  
`homeassistant:`  
 `external_url: https://ha.mydomain.duckdns.org/`  
 `internal_url: http://192.168.1.B:8123`  
`http:`  
 `use_x_forwarded_for: true`  
 `trusted_proxies:`  
    `- 192.168.1.0/24`  
    `- 172.20.0.0/24`  
    `- 172.30.55.0/24`  
    `- 172.20.55.C`  
    `- 172.30.32.0`  
    `- 127.0.0.1`  
    `- 192.168.1.A`  
    `- 192.168.1.B`

I am successfully able to login to HA via the internal URL shown in this config.

**POSSIBLE ISSUE #2**

Port 443 is forwarded to the host machine IP address (192.168.1.A). Since HA is running on 192.168.1.B instead of 192.168.1.A, is this issue preventing NGINX from proxying correctly? If so, how can I fix this without changing how I'm running the various programs (e.g. I want to keep HA within a VM, and NGINX within docker).

I do not want to use any addon's within HAOS in order to enable external access...I want to proxy via my existing NGINX reverse proxy. Thanks a lot for the help!"	8	"['sleekelite: You didn’t seem to include what “doesn’t work” means - edit the beginning to explain exactly what is happening and what you’d like to have happen instead.\n\nConceptually it’s extremely simple:\n\n1.

Instructions [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/home-assistant-400-bad-request-docker-proxy-solution/322163).\n* While troubleshooting, I was typically restarting and reloading the YAML file only (not completely rebooting HA). Once I made the above change and rebooted HA fully, everything worked (a quick reload didn\'t affect anything).\n* Also, I initially had my NGINX configs split among different files to make my life easier (i.e. common proxy\\_set\\_header statements were included in a proxy.conf file, as well as the statements to enable the web socket).

In order to run docker on a windows machine, you need to install Ubuntu in WSL2 or stand up a Hyper-Visor.

You can also access the proxy config file for each proxy. \n\nSo WSL2 is still not really production ready, its meant for development work more than anything else right now. The way it handles networking is a little wonky from what I remember. I use WSL2 + Docker for my own development work and I've had plenty of trouble with dumb things like NTP not working right across the layers. \n\nAny reason why you're running windows 10 as your host machine?

I have 3 Wyze cams, set up thru Wyze Docker Bridge and then added as Generic Cameras based on the RTSP feeds. Those then go to Frigate. Yesterday all was working fine, and no changes were made to either Frigate or the Bridge, yet today, the Bridge will show the initial snap shot when I restart but not play video

=ISSUE WYZE BRIDGE =

When I hit play it says  ""The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported ""

For the config file, not much to it but I have

To be honest I am not sure if RTSP is the right option I should use for Snapshots or if I should be utilizing any of the CAM\_OPTIONS.

&#x200B;

=ISSUE FRIGATE =

Then on the Frigate side, at least when the Docker app was up and running, I had another set of issues.  I can never get it to show a live stream (on my Amcrest cameras either). It would just show the initial snapshot and stay there. For Frigate here is my frigate.yml

=SUMMARY=

Like I mentioned, just so odd as it was at least showing the Wyze cameras live feed in Bridge app yesterday and with no changes, now not working. Wondering if I maybe had too many connection errors and now its throw codes with talking to Wyze servers?

On the Frigate side, as mentioned Ive never been able to see a live feed (maybe folks dont use this for live feed anyhow). I did see it detected a Person on 3 occasions however it gave me an error when trying to play (sorry dont hve that handy but can get if needed). 

&#x200B;

=QUESTION=

On the Frigate side, I see hardware acceleration is suggested. I am running all of this off my TS453a box with Celeron N3510. I tried using the std intel option but it gave me an error. When removing it worked (again this was last night). Not sure if there is an option that works for Celeron? And more of a VM question but for the VM I can set the CPU for it. It defaulted to Intel Core i7 Westmere however there is an option for Pass Through (celeron is not an option). Not sure if this matters but thought Id mention.

RoachForLife	1	130jy39	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/130jy39/got_integration_to_smartthings_working_but/	"Hi all, so finally got the Smartthings integration to work. After setting up my port forwarding and DuckDNS with Lets Encrypt, it ended up being such a dumb thing preventing the connection. For the external URL of HA I forgot to add the port, which the integration was using for a webhook. Anyhow...

So as a previous (well current still I suppose) ST user I have not only my zigbee and zwave devices on it but also some others like ecobee and rachio, which I now have as integrations in HA as well. 

When I brought over the connection I just brought it all over, meaning I have a good 40 devices that are on both. Now there are several ways to remove this and just seeing if the method matters?

I could

1. Remove from ST all together (not ready to do this just yet plus I like the flexibility of having in both for now)
2. I believe I can modify the token to exclude these devices at the token/access level
3. Now that they are already in HA, I see there is a 'disable' option per device. Not sure if any issues doing that way?
4. Lastly, I could just ignore them. Im thinking that means more network traffic and processing tho so probably should remove. For the time being Ive moved all the dupes to its own Area to easily distinguish. 

With that said, any thoughts on the matter are appreciated. Also would #2 and #3 effectively be the same?  Thanks all!"	5	"[""Kristopher_73: Option 1. \n\nI left ST Summer 2022 and my home was running all EDGE (Beta) drivers, but hated the road Samsung was taking the platform with 'updates' and 'new features.'\n\nYou may have your reasons for wanting to keep ST, but will tell you from a person with a purpose built and well thought out smart home....HA has no comparison and you wouldn't regret making the full switch."", ""RoachForLife: The reason, at least for now, is I don't have a zwave or zigbee dongle, so ST is powering just those devices for me.

In a different post about zwave devices it was mentioned the 700 series had a issue as of late and the 800 has even more. But the 800 sounds more future proof once things are more stable for sure. I am sure I will get to that point, maybe sooner than I think (especially considering I set HA up on a whim and after a good 40hrs invested to research and set most everything up, now Im hooked). :)', ""Kristopher_73: Yeah, doesn't take much to get hooked when you realize the power of it.\n\nI've had no issues with my 700 series stick, so could be other people's setups or not using USB extensions on them.

I'm using home assistant in combination with with tasmota on a D1 mini and this sensor (https://www.ebay.de/itm/314015465828?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=707-127634-2357-0&ssspo=_zsyyv2er9e&sssrc=2349624&ssuid=&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY) to track my energy consumption. I've recently used this site (https://tasmota-sml-parser.dicp.net/) to change my meter definition in order to get more values from my meter, which worked fine. The only problem is, that after a certain time the total meter value will be added to my home assistant energy dashboard for some reason. Does anybody have an idea why? In the first picture it seems like there is just one bar. It's not. It's just the total meter value that has been added between 7 and 8 in the morning, so the other bars are not visible. When I manually change the value, it's fine again. But it will happen again the next day. What can I do?	1	['Tenacious-D-8356: https://preview.redd.it/2gisgj7xjgwa1.png?width=1012&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47b7921a8f2d0051dfff2f41900a5fa4f45968da\n\nIn tasmota there are two unknown entities, I could delete those from the definition.

I am trying to setup one of my tablets as a wall tablet and my main device is my phone. So i have an automation, which needs to send a message to my phone when it's time for prayer. And i also have another automation for the wall tablet, because i want only the wall tablet to play the call for prayer. I tried several things and there is an blueprint, but it doesn't do exactly what i want. So i made myself the automation for the wall tablet to play the call for prayer, when between certain times because the baby is a very hard sleeper and wakes up from the smallest breath you take. So between 9 in the morning until 9 in the evening it can play and at night so after 9 to 9 it is not playing. But what happens is the prayer around 2 o clock playes fine, the prayer around 6 o clock in the evening should play but doesn't and also the notification for it is delayed to two hours later. Also around just for 9 in the evening there is also a prayer and that one is also not playing and the notification is delayed, same for the late night prayer, but the prayer around 3 o clock at night/morning i receive the notification on time but doesn't play like it should be.

  `title: PC is on`

  `message: ""command_broadcast_intent""`

  `data:`

`intent_extras: ""titan_state: on:String""`

On the Return Value Variable select I have the options for %evtprm1 to $evtprm8 (Owner, Title, Text, Subtext, Messages, Other Text Messages, Cat, and New Only, in that order).

I'm brand new to HA so bear with me.

I'm trying to trigger a TPLink Smart plug to switch on and off depending on the state of charge of a LiFePo4 battery. The MQTT message source is another Raspberry Pi on the network running Solar Assistant which receives information from the Inverter and Battery shunt. Solar Assistant sends MQTT messages which HA reads perfectly fine.

I have tried both with and without the Mosquito MQTT broker  (still not entirely sure what a broker does) and HA seems to receive the MQTT messages fine either way. All the data from the MQTT messages loads great into HA and I can create gauges and other cards with the data.

I suspect I am simply entering something incorrectly into the automation fields in HA. When listening to # in the MQTT settings, the pertinent message is formatted [as seen here.](https://imgur.com/a/8YGMZ2n) 

For this example, I want the switch to turn on when the battery SoC gets to or goes below 25%. [Here is how I've written the topic and payload.](https://imgur.com/a/DEtGC99)

Manually running the automation successfully changes the state of the switch, so the connection there is ok. The automations are enabled as well.

Thanks for any advice!"	7	"[""filmismymedium: Update: Changing the Payload value from {{ value | int <= 25 }} to simply 25 allowed the automation to run on its own.

However, I am experiencing an issue with the device. The sensor only updates the temperature and humidity readings once an hour, even though the manual states that it should update more frequently if the temperature changes by 0.6 - 0.7 degrees. I use my air conditioner every night, and the temperature in my room changes by more than this amount. As a result, I am not getting accurate readings from the sensor.

I would appreciate any help you can provide in resolving this issue. Thank you

I'm relatively new to HA, but do have some programming background. I'm trying to dip my toes in the water a little bit more and trying to setup the following scenario.

* I've integrated a TP-Link HS110 smart plug into HA. It can be controlled and monitored currently (daily usage, current consumption etc).
* I have an XBOX plugged into the HS110 and want to be able to monitor how many hours it has been used for based on time above a certain wattage e.g. > 20 watts for the day.

The main reason I need to monitor the wattage and not just whether the smart plug is 'turned on' is because the XBOX can be in standby mode and not actively in use which means that I don't want to count those hours.

What I'm trying to achieve is something along the lines of 'if the XBOX has been actively used for more than 2 hours during the day then turn off the smart plug'

I'm assuming that I'll need some form of custom entity, but just not sure where to start.

1682559405.0	26-Apr-2023 18:36:45	PSA: You can setup a second homeassistant instance just for radio interfaces for better locality and HW failback.	waka324	22	130632e	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/130632e/psa_you_can_setup_a_second_homeassistant_instance/	"So my homeassistant install is on a proxmox VM in the basement. 

I ran cat6 to an upstairs closet and setup homeassistant on a PoE powered raspberry pi 4.

From there, I added the skyconnect dongle, my zwave dongle, and 433mhz sdr to the pi and flashed the multiprotocol FW to the skyconnect. With the silabs addon installed, the zigbee coordinator is exposed via TCP, and can be added to the primary instance using the zigbee2mqtt addon with the following config:

port: tcp://ha-radios.home:9999
adapter: ezsp

This has the added benefit of exposing the openThread instance.

Then, my 433mhz devices can be added via the rtl433 addon, pushing to the primary MQTT instance, and running the RTL433 discovery addon on the primary.

Finally, zwave can be added via zwave JS UI addon, running the zwave2mqtt integration on the primary instance.

All together, it allows me to put the radios in a more central location, and allows me to failover the proxmox vm to another machine with high availability without figuring out how to swap hardware. The second homeassistant instance makes managing the secondary instance really easy too.

I eventually want to expose the bluetooth on the pi via the same way ESPHome bluetooth proxy is done. 

Figured I'd document here so that prople know this is actually doable, as i hadn't seen anyone trybthis yet. If anyone has any questions, I'd love to help."	29	"['zSprawl: Certainly an interesting option.

3. On the note of IPs and duckdns, when setting up devices, generally speaking should I still use the static IP instead of duckdns?

My question now however is how do I set up my remote access without breaking Homekit? I assume iPhone is using DNS to connect to the bridge, given that it broke after I messed with that, so then what DNS entries do I need for it to work?

&#x200B;

Hi All,

I'm really stuck with this problem.

**Home Assistant** **2023.4.6**

Supervisor 2023.04.1

Operating System 10.0

Frontend 20230411.1 - latest

I've had HA set up for a couple of years, and been using the homekit bridge that whole time, it was all working fine (other than devices frequently showing up as not responding).

I just recently set up remote access to HA. The changes I made:

1. Set up a port forward on my firewall (pfsense)
2. Added a DNS entry on pfsense so that the external hostname would resolve to the internal IP
3. In HA itself, under System > Network > Home Assistant URL, in the ""Internet"" field I put in the external URL that I set up in both my port forward and DNS entry.

After that, my homekit accessories wouldn't connect anymore, at all. I did some research and found solutions online talking about editing a config.json or mdns.interface files and but none of the solutions say where those files actually are, and my googling for those file locations didn't get me anywhere. So I just gave up on that, tried to delete and readd my HASS bridge to homekit, and ended up having to totally delete and reinstall the Homekit integration because apparently there's no option to make the QR code appear again after initial setup (wtf to that?).

I'm not at the point where I've undone all my remote access and DNS entries, rebooted my iPhone, firewall, and HA, and I still can't add the bridge. iPhone keeps telling me accessory not found. They're on the same network, I've undone all the changes I made, I don't understand why it can't find it? The System > Logs on HA aren't giving me any errors, so I'm at a loss?"	0	[]
1682520831.0	26-Apr-2023 07:53:51	Ping automation to flip a switch	Compusmurf	2	12zjx9m	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12zjx9m/ping_automation_to_flip_a_switch/	"I want to make an automation that:

Pings something reliable on the internet.  EX 8.8.8.8

If it fails to ping consistently, like once a minute for 10 minutes to flip a physical outlet switch off, then back on, clear the counter for the ping and restart the automation.

Here's my use case.

If my router reboots because of ANY reason, including a power outage, my FIOS ONT gets confused and sets the port speed to 10Gb and won't autorenegotiate the speed when the router comes up - 2.5Gb.  I have to manually reboot the ONT.  I have a switchable outlet now that the ONT plugs into.  So what I want to happen is home assistant automation that pings out on the internet once a minute and if it fails to ping for 10 times in row  (10 minutes worth) it tells that switch to power off, wait a minute, power on (thus rebooting the ONT) then to clear the automation counter and start over.   Obviously, the automation needs to reset the counter if during the ping count is successful.

I know there's devices out there like:  https://www.amazon.com/ezOutlet5-Internet-WiFi-Reboot-Switch/dp/B0861NX6H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8   That does this, but why buy another device to do it if I can use HA and the devices I already have?  :)

I have several custom sensors all around my house and it just works like a sharm. I even flashed some of my Shellys to esphome und prior connection errors I had with the Shelly Firmware are gone with esphome.

So I thought about increasing my investment in esphome by buying future devices which are esphome compatible.

But there are so many people trying to avoid wifi devices preferring ZigBee. Mostly because many wifi devices seem to slow down the Network!? Does this apply to esphome as well? Or is esphome fine since it uses the native AP and not mqtt or coiot?"	15	"[""MattHashTwo: Wifi inherently is shared resource. If you put lots of chatty devices on it, they have to wait their talk to talk.\n\nZigbee is the same, except you're also not trying to use the network at the same time so it doesn't matter, because it doesn't slow you down. \n\nI use both, it's imo overblown and probably only an issue for people using cheap crap WiFi routers provided by their ISP. **\n\n** not all are cheap crap obviously, but you get the idea."", 'hannsr: That depends on more factors than just ""many devices = bad"".

Ideally I'd like to be able to set the volume for each audio file separately. For instance if the music is playing low, and someone opens the door I'd like the chime to play more loudly without affecting the music volume.

I have a Growatt solar inverter and after long time i found a undocumented modbus command to retrieve the state of the attached Energy Meter (SMD230).  


The problem: An answer do my requst i get a 200 byte message with all the voltages, current and energy datas. Any idea how to send it to different sensors in esphome? Here what i have:

      rx_pin: 3

    sensor:
      - platform: modbus_controller
        modbus_controller_id: growatt
        name: ""total_import_energy""
        force_update: true

        custom_command: [ 0x1, 0x20, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x64, 0x81, 0xE6]
        lambda: |-
              float float_value;
              float_value = float(data[108] << 24 | data[109] << 16 | data[110] << 8 |  data[111])/10;
              ESP_LOGD(""Modbus Sensor Lambda"",""The value of sensor 108 is: %f"", float_value);
              return float_value;
        unit_of_measurement: kWh
        accuracy_decimals: 1

Esphome doesn't accept the same custom modbus request in a second sensor. So what i need is to return multiply values to different sensors in one lambda? Any suggestions?

What i tried: It seems that the inverters doesn't accept single request to only 4 registers. To 108 = 6C and a register size of 4 bytes:

    custom_command: [ 0x1, 0x20, 0x00, 0x6C, 0x00, 0x4, 0x81, 0xE6]

i get:

Modbus command to device=1 register=0xBF40 countdown=0 no response received - removed from send queue

Why 0x6C leads to a register request of 0xBF40?

No issue with my Zigbee and Z-Wave devices. But my outdoor Tuya bulbs stayed off after dark. I had done the Tuya integration with Home Assistant already, but HA couldn't turn them on because it relies on the cloud service.

Then I remembered a video about LocalTuya and decided to investigate it.

**Long story short, LocalTuya reported an error that my Tuya IoT subscription had expired.** I created it a little over a month ago when I first setup the Tuya integration. Ugh.

I requested an extension, but what if it doesn't get approved?

The [LocalTuya instructions](https://github.com/rospogrigio/localtuya) say I can manually configure the devices without a Cloud API account. So I proceeded without the API login.

The `zwave_js` integration is built on top of `zwave-js`, which is also an external open source project, but is both in active development, and more recently, sponsored by Nabu Casa to help keep it going.\n2.

The original integrations couldn't be developed any further because `openzwave` development stalled. The `zwave_js` integration has quickly surpassed the feature set of both of the earlier integrations and it does not make sense for the team to maintain multiple integrations for the protocol in the core when we feel pretty good about what we've got in `zwave_js`.

So I could track basic usage, to monitor her routine and also know who's calling to the house/when she leaves and returns to the house.\n\nMore intrusive devices would be cameras in most rooms, with movement detection and recording/logging. 2 way mic/speakers in the cameras. A pressure sensor in the bed to detect when she gets in and out of bed. Possibly sensors in favourite chairs in the living space. Emergency buttons in each room that dial me/local emergency services. I wouldn't count on using a wearable to do fall detection, as it is reliant on her remembering to wear it and charge it. Lastly, HA mobile app with high accuracy GPS tracking enabled to track movement outside of the home, in the case of getting lost or being unable to contact via phone.\n\nMost of the intrusive stuff would need consent and trust. What I've proposed is costly and very Big Brother but it is highest visibility, which is what would give me peace of mind.

Wherever you look up the SNZB-02D, it has this high quality high contrast screen shown, which is simply not the case.  In reality, the display has mediocre contrast and bad viewing angles. This is expected to a degree from an LCD screen, but this was just underwhelming.

I like the sensor and Zigbee module though, so for anyone interested I disassembled and reviewed the device:

So, for example - with one sensor, I am able to add VAT and additional costs like this:   


  `- sensor:`

`- name: epex_spot_price_ct_per_kWh_with_vat`

`unit_of_measurement: ""€/kWh""`

`availability: '{{ states(""sensor.epex_spot_nl_price"") != ""unavailable"" }}'`

`state: '{{ (states(""sensor.epex_spot_nl_price"") | float / 10 * 1.21 + 2.54)/100 }}' #add vat and extra costs, then into 0.00 cents that can be understood by threshold input`

`unique_id: ""my_unique_id_epex_spot_price_ct_per_kWh_with_vat""`

&#x200B;

However - this sensor (sensor.nl\_energy\_prices\_average\_electricity\_price\_today) is where my chart data is - and I'd quite like to add VAT and additional costs (like above) to each attribute for the hour in this sensor. - therefore so each bar int he chart is correct. 

You can see a screenshot of the attributes here: [https://ibb.co/z60cfHY](https://ibb.co/z60cfHY)

  
And the code for the chart, which uses the sensor:

`type: custom:apexcharts-card`

`graph_span: 36h`

`span:`

  `start: day`

`now:`

  `show: true`

  `label: Now`

`header:`

  `show: true`

  `title: Energy costs today (€/kwh)`

`yaxis:`

  `- decimals: 2`

`series:`

  `- entity: sensor.nl_energy_prices_average_electricity_price_today`

`stroke_width: 2`

`float_precision: 3`

`type: column`

`opacity: 1`

`color: ''`

`data_generator: |`

`return entity.attributes.prices.map((entry) => {` 

`return [new Date(entry.time), entry.price];`

`});`

&#x200B;

The end result  I would like is a chart that includes the original data but with VAT added (21%) and 2.54 euro cents.

Hi people,

for some weeks, I have an error with the Homeassistant Dashboard ""MoreInformation""-View.

I use my old Android-Tablet with the Fully Kiosk Mode App.

That all works great. But when I try to load an RSTP-Stream by clicking on the Dashboard-Card, the first image shows up but the Video-Box keeps reloading / loading.  
The max-length of the video keeps getting longer, but the current-video-position keeps being stuck at 0.

I tried to get more information by connection to the tablet via USB and try to read the Console output and the Connections via the Chrome Inspector DevTool.

But the Console keeps empty. Some request are being cancelled, but I can't figure out why and how they are cancelled.  
The cancelled request are relevant requests, so I think the cancelation is the problem. But I can't figure out why they are being cancelled.

I also tried to do the same in Chrome on the device, but it's the same problem.

In my PCs browser, there is no problem at all.  
So it might a Version Problem?"	0	[]

I am planning on buying this camera system (EU): [https://nl.annke.com/products/h800-8-kanaals-beveiligingscamera-set-met-4-bullet-cameras-4-turret-camaras?variant=42627460137216](https://nl.annke.com/products/h800-8-kanaals-beveiligingscamera-set-met-4-bullet-cameras-4-turret-camaras?variant=42627460137216)

and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with ANNKE or any other 8CH camera setup with similar price/performance. I am thinking of adding frigate to this but I'm not sure if I would need extra hardware to make it work.

Most probably I will need to move home assistant from my RBP to an intel NUC or something like that to support frigate, as I probably will not be able to run it on the included NVR."	17	"[""Tardlard: Even with an Intel NUC you'll want to opt for a Coral TPU (or more than one, never had that many cameras myself)"", 'irate_ornithologist: It seems like this includes an NVR already has human and vehicle detection. Why would you want to process those separately through frigate? Frigate (to me) seems the most compelling to use as a part of or alongside something that can store video as an alternative to a dedicated NVR unit. \n\nI would buy or build the NUC (or other mini PC, optiplex, etc), a coral, and individual cameras. Leave HA on the Pi, run frigate and the mqtt broker on the NUC.', ""daern2: I use 5 cameras through Frigate with an RPi4 and it works very acceptably, typically consuming around 50% CPU.\n\nI have to use hardware decoding and secondary streams, custom tuned to the correct resolution and framerate for Frigate to reduce the impact on the RPi, but it's very stable and works well. Obviously, object detection uses a USB Coral, and there's no way it would work without this!\n\nWhatever you do, you'll need to be sure that the NVR allows you to access individual camera streams in some sort of generic way that ffmpeg can ingest on Frigate. Without this, you're not going anywhere! Personally, I have IP cameras on an IP NVR, but I actually address the cameras directly as this gives more flexibility with secondary (and tertiary) streams."", ""kitanokikori: It's impossible to click your link outside of NL because it redirects to a generic landing page, but you probably just need the cameras, not the NVR box or other hardware. Frigate usually _replaces_ the NVR box (though you could certainly pay for the dedicated Annke NVR box as well). \n\nThe important thing to check for (these cameras do support it), is H.264 support (_not_ just H.265!). Browsers cannot natively display the newer format, so despite it being a better codec, it's actually a huge pain in the ass because your Frigate server will have to transcode this content and it will be very CPU expensive"", 'aram535: Might want to check out the ""The Hook up"" channel.

Essentially, if it can use RTSP it can be used for frigate, I think. Frigate itself runs entirely separate from the NVR and just pulls the video stream off the network."", 'viama: Are the cameras individually addressable?', ""jlboygenius: I hear this a lot. I had 4 cameras running on frigate with an sff pc. Granted this is an i5-8500.\n\n\n4 cpus assigned to frigate, it kept around 30% cpu usage (as listed by proxmox).  I added a coral and it has dropped but it's still not zero. Switching to gpu for ffmpeg decoding had a bigger impact.\n\nI'm the end, the coral is a fun toy, but. Not really necessary if you have a decent cpu. The new detection process in the latest release is supposed to be even better.\n\n\n\nFor my setup, the coral is cool but not necessary. I haven't noticed a power usage decrease at all with the coral, so it's never going to pay for itself."", ""daern2: > Frigate usually replaces the NVR box (though you could certainly pay for the dedicated Annke NVR box as well).\n\nDefinitely optional. Personally, I store all of the 4k video, 24/7 on my (hardware) NVR, and only use Frigate for alert generation and associated clips/snapshots. If I wanted to wade through a lot of footage, the NVR is quite a bit more powerful. Not sure if I'd go down this route again, but certainly I'd need a far more beefy computer than my current RPi4 if I wanted to store full-res footage using it."", 'nickm_27: Chrome browser versions released this year now support h.265 just fyi', 'nickm_27: The benefit of the coral isn’t just reduced usage, the best benefit is the incredibly low inference speeds compared to the cpu (an order of magnitude faster in many cases)', ""Tardlard: I am no expert, but followed the guidance on Frigate's website. \n\nI think there are more metrics to measure the difference your Coral has added - inference times are purportedly much better than a standard CPU.\n\nDoes it also allow for more frames to pass through?"", ""jlboygenius: yes, it is for sure faster in that way. I think I was around 80 and now it's down to 7.\n\nHas that changed anything in the way that I use it? no. It's as security camera with a wide angle of view. Nothing is moving that fast.  Coral only takes over the detect part, which is only part of the process. 50fps or 5 fps doesn't make much of a difference to let me know there's a person in my front yard."", ""jlboygenius: I'm sure it does, and i'm sure it does it faster. But, does that really matter? It's a security camera. 1 fps vs 50 won't change anything."", ""nickm_27: Sure, wasn't trying to change your mind just wanted to provide context for others that may not understand."", ""Tardlard: Well the more frames you have the better if you're trying to ID something that set off your motion detection, with more chance of a suspect being in focus/not a blur if in motion. \n\nIt's just all round more accurate really"", 'ufgrat: 50 would be silly, so would 1.

I have made an Automation to poll those switches every second (tried every 3 seconds and 5 seconds also) but the delay is still there. The delay is up to 10 seconds. Ay recommendation on how I can make those Kasa switches to react near instantly?

JamesGiesbrecht	2	12z38ct	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12z38ct/netdata_integration_not_working_when_running/	"I have a Home Assistant (VM)  and Netdata docker running on the same Unraid Host.

I added the example netdata sensor from the [HA Netdata Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/netdata/) to the `configuration.yaml` and swapped out the IP and name for my own. I also verified the data\_group and element values were correct for my netdata agent.

    sensor:
      - platform: netdata
        host: ""192.168.1.2""

When I restart Home Assistant with that integration, the logs show the following error: `Platform netdata not ready yet: None; Retrying in background in 30 seconds`. This is consistent after restarting all HA/Netdata multiple times including the host system.

None of the other logs show more detail, thats the only message I can see on HA. In the netdata container logs I can see connections continually being made from HA and closing after being idle for 60 seconds.

I tried installing Netdata on the Unraid bare metal and the integration worked perfectly! I was able to see multiple resources as I added them.  
But since Unraid is Slackware based, the app was wiped out upon restart. I tried installing it in non-volatile storage but it wasn't working. I'm no Linux master and I didn't want to mess with system stability so I left it at that.

&#x200B;

Any ideas why the bare metal install worked but not the Docker?  
I have them (VM and Docker) on the same custom bridge `br0` each with their own IP address.  
I have `Docker custom network type: macvlan` and `Host access to custom networks: Enabled` configured in Docker settings in Unraid.  
I can make api requests from the HA terminal to Netdata and can see traffic from HA in the Netdata logs.  
Is there anything I am overlooking in the networking department?"	0	[]

I’m thinking of monitor power usage of my house in HA. My house was installed with a “smart” meter, but unfortunately I couldn’t directly interfacing with it, except the LED that blinks when 1 Wh is consumed.

I am aware of the HA Glow project, but the location of the meter and the fact that I can’t modify the power board make it impossible to run the setup on mains.

So my meter has 3 requirements:
1. Ultra low power, able to run on AAs for a year
2. Cheaper than commerical alternatives
3. Running on Zigbee is a plus

What I have in mind now is a HA Glow setup and swap in a ESP-01 plus a DS1683 chip to do the counting while the ESP8266 is in deep sleep. However I want to push one step forward to use Zigbee to further reduce power usage. Any cheap and easy to dev SoC out there? Or I should stick with wifi instead? 

Thanks"	3	"[""scottydont_2488: It looks like the DS1683 would drain your AAs in around a year even before adding an ESP.

You didn't mention how often it would be waking up to send data, as that will have a big impact on power consumption too"", ""mkishere: DS1683 should be constantly draining 0.1-0.2mA when doing the counting, meanwhile ESP8266 will drain 15mA in modem-sleep mode, when the CPU is still needed for counting the flashes. Please correct me if I'm wrong, if the extra chip is not required in the design I would be happy to follow as that would save me from ordering PCB fab.\n\nHaven't heard of ESP-NOW before, does that mean I need an extra ESP to be plugged into the HA server as the receiver?\n\nedit: forgot to mention, thinking of reporting the usage to HA per 30 minutes, should be good enough for me."", ""scottydont_2488: The DS1683 is very efficient and seems to be a good choice for counting pulses, I wasn't saying it's not required but maybe your goal of 1 year on AAs is optimistic once you have that and an ESP.\nDS1683 ~200uA\nESP in sleep ~35uA\nESP awake wifi ~80mA 1.2sec\nESP awake ESP-NOW ~80mA 0.2sec\n\nRechargeable AAs are 2000-2500mAh, not sure about alkalines\n\nFrom there you can work out whether you are better off to have it or wake the ESP with an interrupt, increment, go back to sleep, then occasionally send to HA.

If the above conditions except app context is Amazon prime, the timer remains idle as child cannot launch it from their profile. HA can’t see which user profile is active. \n\nFive minutes before timer expiry, adults get an actionable notification with one more episode or one more hour options.

When the episode, or movie has reached 0 time remaining, sensor is flipped and the auto power off action is active. \n\nOne more hour sets a binary sensor which activates a one hour timer which decrements, just as the primary one does.

Must be:
* Wall mountable in some way
* Work with Pi (although I'm open to other single board computers)
* Touch enabled
* 10.1""+, I have full approval for even up to 20ish inches

with some nice to haves like
* Could power the Pi itself (has a USB port on it)
* Thin, so it could be more flush with the wall

I am trying to work up an automation to open the correct door when me or my wife (and potentially son in the future) return home.

The way it is currently, is that when ""I"" enter the zone, my door opens and same for my wife that when she enters the zone, her door opens.

However, if we swap cars for whatever reason, the wrong door opens. 

I have a few ideas of what I'm trying to do, it's just a little beyond my skillset to resolve it.

I've added a d1mini to each car and am able to see their connection. The problem with these is that if you went turned on the car, long enough for the ping to engage, and then came back in the house, HA wouldn't know if the car left or was turned off.

I could include in the logic the garage door. It's pretty reasonable to assume that the car cannot leave without the door going up. That could be part of the logic.

I am looking for advise on helpers or a rough pseudo automation to help point me in the right direction.

&#x200B;

Im building out my home assistant home and am confused about cameras and the terminology that is used when discussing them.

 My goals with cameras are as follows and #2 is most important and what i will be using the most

1. Store files locally (no cloud or paying for recordings)
2. **I want to be able to stream video to my phone when im at home AND not at home and using cellular (preferably without too much technical work with VPN's etc.)**
3. good home assistant integration.

&#x200B;

My confusion comes with the local control + streaming while im not home. Is something that WebRTC can do, or do i need to be on the same network as the camera to watch the feed?  If my main use of cameras is just viewing the feed when im not at home, is there any advantage to using something like reolink over a nest camera?

Thanks for your help and sorry if these are stupid questions!"	3	"[""angrycatmeowmeow: Reolink can do all of that for nothing more than the cost of the cameras and either an NVR (preferred) or a microsd card in each cam.

DIY your own notifications."", ""peterxian: If you want to access your camera streams, or anything inside your LAN for that matter, from outside your home (i.e. not on your local network), you need something on the public Internet. It could be a cloud provider, a secret VPN/tunnel you setup, or something more creative but it must be very, very secure. If you don't trust the camera makers' cloud services (and you absolutely shouldn't) then your choices are VPN/tunnel or a third-party service. If you're not interested in learning the technicals of how to set up the VPN/tunnel securely, I recommend a service. The best option is Nabu Casa Cloud, which provides remote access to HA for $6.50/mo. Another good option, if you have Apple stuff (HomePod/TV and iPhones), is they come with a remote access service (Apple Home) that works pretty well with Home Assistant (this is what I use).

Hey All,

I'm just getting my feet wet with more ""advanced"" configuration options and am working on my mobile dashboards. Above is the start of my mobile music dashboard, and I've hit 1 major roadblock that I can't figure out (but is probably easy). In my experience, typically a horizontal stack will self expand to take up the whole card area, but for some reason I can't make that happen now. Any ideas, other than creating additional blank cards in my horizontal stack, to get my buttons to center? I'm hoping to re-use much of what I'm working on for the mobile music dashboard for other views that will contain different amounts of buttons, so figuring this out will make that process much easier. 

I'm currently using a container template ([https://community.home-assistant.io/t/fun-with-custom-button-card/238450](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/fun-with-custom-button-card/238450?u=ayostepht)), and some inspiration from u/Smeen89's dashboard they shared recently.

Thanks in advance!

Def a good amount of work but getting things mostly to where I want them. Next to tackle are Zwave and Zigbee devices.

I was leaning towards the Zooz 800 series zwave stick as i believe its the newest and long range and whatnot. On the zigbee side I wasnt quite sure. I have seen a bunch of threads but most are 1-2years old so Im mainly posting this to see what is the best as of April 2023. Also to note was hoping for a relatively plug and play experience.

However, I am curious on how people handle this behavior and ensure the home doesn't go absolutely bonkers.

With the 5+ monthly 2023.X.Y updates , power outages, required reboot of the host (HA OS is running as a Proxmox container), etc I have been growing frustrated at having to manually juggle things when HA OS reboots. Any ideas? Currently avoiding all but the mainline monthly updates and its running behind a small UPS to handle blip outages but still running into this issue a couple of times a month or more."	15	"['Rannasha: The easiest way to reduce the number of restarts is to not install every update. I typically get the monthly one in the second half of the month, as the initial release of the month is mostly about the new features and later releases are bugfixes. So unless there\'s a must-have feature for me, I\'ll wait for a few bugfix updates to have rolled out.\n\nI\'m not sure why your Proxmox host has to restart that often. Mine doesn\'t. Most updates for Proxmox don\'t require a restart of the host. But you can always plan your HA updates to align with your Proxmox restarts, so you can do both in one go.\n\nAs for the automations, there are some ways to smooth out interruptions. The first is by reducing how long automations run. If you have an automation that first does X, then waits for 2 hours and then does Y, consider splitting it into 2 automations. Add a helper boolean that is toggled by the first automation and trigger the second automation when the helper boolean has had the right state for 2 hours, then having Y as action as well as another action to reset the helper.\n\nThis approach is still somewhat sensitive to restarts, because this trigger is reset on HA restarts. Depending on the nature of the automation this may or may not be an issue. If it is, have the first automation set a date/time variable for the time the second automation should run and check the current time against this variable.\n\nAnother tool is the ""Home Assistant"" category of triggers. You can have automations trigger upon HA starting up or shutting down. You could use these to bring things to a sensible state upon startup. Add helper variables to your automations to keep track of what the desired state should be and use startup automations to achieve this. The shutdown trigger can also be used here, but it\'s less useful as it\'ll only help when HA shuts down gracefully (e.g. not during power outages that aren\'t covered by the UPS, or crashes).', 'diabetic_debate: The way I do it is, I have seperate automations if two actions need to happen far apart in time. For example, if I want to turn on a light at sunset and turn it off at sunrise, I have two automations that will do each step on their own. \n\nSince they are independent of each other, one running or not running has no effect on the other.', '_avee_: The solution is not to have long-running automations.\n\nAutomation you use as an example can be either split in 2 or converted into a single-action automation with multiple triggers. Same applies to pretty much all automations where you have wait_for_trigger or something similar.\n\nTemplates are great at simplifying automations: with proper setup most automations don’t need to be anything more complicated than “when single condition passes, trigger an action or several”.', ""generalambivalence: You probably need to share some yaml examples of automations that are giving you problems on restarts.\n\nDepending on the trigger, it might be something like you have your automation to trigger when a light state changes to `on` but when you restart, it changes from `unknown` to `on` which would trigger the automation. If you set the trigger when the state changes from `off` to `on` the automation wouldn't trigger on restart since the state is changing from `unknown` and not `off`. This is just an example and it may not apply in your case."", 'JCHHenderson: what kind of things do you need to juggle?\n\nI have a template \\`input\\_select\\` called \\`input\\_select.light\\_scene\\_should\\` that outputs the name of the scene that should be \\`on\\` according to ambient light.

I prefer to have fewer automations with triggers that are grouped logically rather than more automations with names that are grouped logically.\n\nFor example, I have a single automation to control reading lights on and off in my kid's room. They turn on at a specific time, turn off at various times based on whether it is a school night or not, including a check to make sure they are off (they have control over turning them on and off within time windows).

Would you like to help us with our research? **We would appreciate it if you could invite your family members or roommates to participate our interviews, and help us help you set up your perfect home.** Interview will be in English. 

We fully understand that you may have some concerns about them sharing their feedback with us, but we assure you that we value your honesty and we want to improve our products based on their insights.

I want to build a weather station primarily to calculate evapotranspiration, but the raw weather data will obviously be useful too.

I have an ESP32 which I will use to provide the sensor data, say 10 minute sampling interval.  I then plan to save it to Influxdb running in HA, and display it using Grafana, also in HA.  Don't know how to do that yet either.

Where do I calculate Evapotranspiration?  I can use a python script to do it

https://soilwater.github.io/pynotes-agriscience/notebooks/evapotranspiration.html

and I could run that script on the ESP32 with some mods, but it would seem better to collect the daily data (ETo, Temp & RH min/max, total solar radiation, average windspeed) on the HA machine, not the ESP32 - if the ESP32 is turned off it will lose the calculations for that day.

How do I collect daily min/max, average, cumulative totals, on the HA machine?

How do I run the python script for ETo on the HA machine?"	19	"[""sembee2: I wouldn't use Home Assistant for this. Certainly not if you want to keep long term stats as HA as it isn't really designed for long term stats provision.  \nGrafana/InfluxDB within HA are community addons which are maintained by amateurs, therefore could stop being updated, a bad update could cause a problem etc and anything long term lost. \n\nThe sensors in an ESP32 are not sensitive enough in my experience to get anything meaningful without some serious hacking about. \n\nWhat you need is something that is designed to process weather data, running within its own system. Then look to take the results to use within HA. I would go as far as having a dedicated machine for collecting the weather information. Run it in a VM and leave the machine running 24x7. A low powered mini pc is ideal. \n\nYou also need to gather multiple weather information to do the calculation as it is a combination of elements, and trying to hack something together is going to be frustrating and may not be very accurate. \n\nWhat I would do is get a weather station off the shelf that is supported by Weather Display.

Bit of context:

I have a couple of labs i manage in two separate buildings in close proximity (100M away from each other). Each one has a variety of different things i'd like to monitor like air quality, leaks, CO2 detection, temp, humidity, etc. Currently i'm using Unifi dream machines, access hubs, UA6-Pro wireless for internet/network, security, and access control. 

I've been scratching my head a bit trying to suss out what sort of alarm system i should get (motion detection/sirens) and remembered we've been using a pi-powered home assistant setup to monitor a few of the variables mentioned in the lab with the ESP addons.

That coupled with the fact there are no off-the-shelf ""smart lab setups"" i'm thinking of getting an intel NUC and running linux on it to act as a ""smart lab"" building control system.   


There will be a lot of sensors to set up for a single lab + alarm system for the building and so I'd like to ask 

1) How easy it would be to ""clone"" what is on a NUC in one building in the other building to minimize repeating the same work i've done in one space to another?"	3	"['ElephantOrnery: 1. Super easy!', ""5yleop1m: You have two options for cloning,\n1. Clone the whole drive, you can use software like clonezilla to get a bit-by-bit copy of the fully setup NUC and restore it on the other NUC. \n\nThe down side here is initially you don't want both NUCs running at the same time since they'll be clones. You'll need to go into the cloned NUC and change things like hostnames and other unique settings so they show up as two different systems on the network. \n\nFor security you should also change all passwords so they aren't shared between the two devices. \n\nThe other option will require some manual work, you can setup both NUCs and then setup home assistant on one NUC and then use the home assistant backup addon to take a full backup of the first NUC. Then restore that backup onto the second NUC. \n\nThe down side here is you'll still need to setup most of the two NUCs, but you'd only have to do the major Home assistant setup on one NUC."", ""lastingd: Barely an inconvience.\n\nThere's also a remote HA addon https://github.com/custom-components/remote_homeassistant""]"

Since April 13 I have this weird thing when after 2 am every night, Alexa integration seems to turn on 4 lights. 1 light is in bedroom, 3 in living room.
The lights turn on with about 10’ difference.

I’ve uninstalled the Alexa Media Player integration completely from HA, restarted it.
The issue still happens.

There is no automation that runs at that time, I don’t have any Node-RED automations using Alexa nor turning on these lights (I’ve searched in Node-RED to be sure).

Any ideas what could be causing the issue?

I'm struggling a bit tonight and I am just disappointed in my own abilities to figure this all out.

TLDR; HA running in container on Ubuntu, Sonoff ZigBee dongle, attempted a passthrough to container, but I can't get anything to pair.

Last year, I purchased an HP Elite desk Mini to run HA (I needed my pi for another project). I installed Ubuntu, docker, running HA in a container. Seems simple enough. Except I came from supervised, and containers (to be transparent) a foreign concept to me.

Fast forward to today. I got the Sonoff dongle (version P). Plug it in and it is not automatically detected by HA. I figured it was the container not being able to see the hardware. So I added the '/dev/ttyUSB0' host in Portainer, relaunched.

Still could not get ZHA set up; ""Add Integration"" timed out and threw an error that said ""Error"".. I don't think it knew what device to add. 

I manually added ZHA to the configuration.yaml, and now I can click 'Add ZHA device' in HA, but I can't pair anything. I've tried a different USB port, a different extension, different devices (Sylvania bulbs, Aqara T&H sensors), etc.

I *think* the Sonoff drivers installed fine (there was no prompt). I *think* the Portainer passthrough worked fine, but how do I know? I *think* the .yaml is set up properly, but again, how do I know?

Can someone please tell it to me like I'm 5 where I'm messing up? Thanks in advance.


Edit: Solution is below!! TLDR, had to manually update windows drivers to get windows to recognize the coordinator (dongle), so I could use the TI software to update the firmware.

I'm trying to get Frigate NVR up and running by way of Home Assistant.

I keep hitting a wall because each bit of software actually requires two other bits of software to work, which in turn each require two other bits, seemingly ad infinitum.  And most of the answers/solutions I've found after extensive searching seem like some real [How to Draw an Owl](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/572/078/d6d.jpg) type shit, at least to me \[an idiot\].

I'm currently stuck trying to get an MQTT integration configured/up and running on a secure managed cloud broker.  I'm all signed up and set up on HiveMQ, but I apparently need to access and edit configuration.yaml to get the integration going and I absolutely for the life of me cannot figure out how to find/access it.  Here's what I've done so far:

1. Intel NUC mini PC
2. Fresh and fully up-to-date Ubuntu install
3. Installed Home Assistant Core via Snap
4. Created account and credentials on HiveMQ Cloud Free
5. Following the HiveMQ instructions [here](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/connect-home-assistant-to-hivemq-cloud/), \[currently stuck on step 5\]

When I pull up the system information via the method outlined [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/), it gives me a specific file path that does exist in my file system, but when I navigate there in the Ubuntu GUI, the folder is empty \[regardless of whether hidden files are shown or hidden\].

I can't use add-ons to access/edit the config file \[as most solutions suggest\], because I'm running Core.

It also says:

>*If you use Home Assistant Core, you can find* ***configuration.yaml*** *in the config folder passed to the* ***hass*** *command (default is* ***\~/.homeassistant***\*).\*

I do use Home Assistant Core, but I don't at all understand what that means.

Why is the config file not where HA says it is?

Is configuration.yaml not really an actual file in the traditional sense?

Do I need to use some other new separate piece of software to even see or access it?"	3	"['gregigk: Why are you running core? I have a mini pc running proxmox and HomeAssistant supervised.', ""hihaatje: > Is configuration.yaml not really an actual file in the traditional sense?\n\nNo, it is an actual file that can be edited in any text editor.\n\n> Do I need to use some other new separate piece of software to even see or access it?\n\nShould not be, any text editor will do.\n\n> I do use Home Assistant Core, but I don't at all understand what that means.\n\nI believe that installing the snap package *installs* the home assistant software on your system, but does not run it. To start it, you usually need to use a terminal command. This is what the ***hass*** command is refering to. As an optional parameter to this command, you can specify the directory containing the configuration file you want to use. If this doesn't exist, home assistant will make a new, empy configuration file. \n\nNow, since you're able to get the directory from home assistant itself it should already be running. But it might be that the snap install runs some containerized version of home assistant. This means that it will create a separate, walled off part of your file system that it feeds to home assistant. Then the file paths will no longer match, since the paths home assistant gets are inside the container, not your entire file system. Is [this](https://snapcraft.io/home-assistant-snap) your version? If this is the case, you first have to figure out where the snap container is running. \n\nAlways a good option to double check is to check via a terminal. If you have no experience in this, don't worry, it shouldn't be too difficult. Open up a terminal session and type\n\n```\ncd [directory given by home assistant] \n```\n\nAnd then \n\n```\nls\n```\n\nTo list the files in that directory. If the configuration file is there, you can also edit it using\n\n```\nnano configuration.yaml\n```\n\n(nano is a sort of mini text editor inside the terminal)\n\nEdit:\n\nI just looked a bit into the snap [documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/data-locations). It seems like snaps are located in\n\n```\n/home/<username>/snap/<snap name>/<revision>\n```\n\nMaybe if you do some digging there you will find the config file."", ""ohheyheyCMYK: Honestly primarily because it was the easiest way. I have a bit of prior experience with Ubuntu, and and I was able to install HA with a few clicks via snap. And since Frigate can run easily as an integration I dont (think) I really need add-ons.\n\nVery open to other approaches if I've actually just stumbled into a world of pain.""]"

No problems with the original linking, only afterwards. ""Hey Google sync my devices"" also fails but also-- only intermittently. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Bizarre!

I painstakingly went over the HASS documentation and triple-checked every item. I'm aware it's complex and long, so I really invested time into it in an effort to not be embarrassed when I finally resort to asking for help and it ends up being something super stupid. For example, everything is IP addresses no hostnames (other than the CF tunnel host of course), so no exposure to DNS shenanigans. IPv6 is disabled too. I did my homework, best I could.

I also went to Cloudflare and tried a bunch of page rules and WAF rules to eliminate caching and ensure Google is permitted to access the host. Running a mtr from outside my network I show zero packets being lost to the Cloudflare tunnel hostname. It's definitely internet-accessible, I tried with a VPN.

I also checked my LAN's firewall (a UDM Pro) just in case, although I'm using Cloudflare tunnels so no port is opened or anything. Nothing in there to account for this behavior. 

Reading through the Google cloud console action logs, it gives ""BACKEND_FAILURE_URL_ERROR"" which looks like Google can't reach my CF URL. I can't seem to figure out why!

I'm running the very latest version of HASS OS in a Proxmox VM. Config YAML is all bog-standard, nothing unusual, straight from the documentation, including the SECRET_ACCOUNT.JSON file which I also triple-checked was correct. No issues with perms either, everything is readable by root.

Are incoming webhook calls logged anywhere in HASS? I can't seem to find them. 

Anyone have any ideas, other than just paying nabu casa to do it for me? 

Happy to post any config files people need, although again they're very standard. Here's the Google actions log error:

I setup Cloudflare Access on this URL, meaning that any rando coming in from the internet would have access denied by Cloudflare. Then I allowed specific origin IPs from Google to bypass that access restriction, based on posts here on Reddit. \n\nThe problem was those posts had an incomplete list of Google origin IPs, and it looks like Google randomly switched between them, leading to my frustrating inconsistency. \n\nAnyway, my complete list of Google Assistant origin IPs now is:\n\n```\n66.249.80.0/20\n66.102.0.0/20\n108.177.0.0/17\n192.178.0.0/15\n74.125.0.0/16\n```\n\nThis may (and probably will) change and need to be fixed in the future. Only real solution to that is to use a script that allows every IP Google owns (connecting to CF via API to setup the access group), but that also includes Google Cloud so the security aspect is obviated. \n\nOr to pay Nabu Casa their $5/month, of course.

I have home assistant running on a raspberry pi in my camper and to reduce devices and power usage I thought it would be nice if I could run an airplay receiver on the raspberry pi in home assistant and output via the 3.5mm jack to the receiver in my camper. 

Do the Aircast and Airsonos add-ons only output to those devices? Or can they be configured to output locally?

TimmyViking	1	12xp8t1	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12xp8t1/how_can_i_view_the_influxdb_logs_its_causing_ha/	Running HA on a RP4 with SSD and I was having almost daily crashes and the UI would often take a long time to load or timeout. Since disabling InfluxDB that has all stopped and its working perfectly. I'm trying to get it working again but I can't seem to find out how to view the logs to try and see the cause of the crashes. Nothing useful seems to show in the HA logs. I was fairly new to HA when the crashs started so I ended up starting everything from scratch and the crashes continued even after a fresh install.	2	"[""TRDeadbeat: The cause of the problem is just literally InfluxDB.\n\nInflux will natively consume every single ounce of available memory on its host machine, and hold onto it as long as it's running. This is how Influx works, it stores the time series indexes in memory. The bigger your dataset, or the higher your cardinality, the faster it fills up the memory.\n\nThe fix is to move Influx to a different host from HomeAssistant. Alternatively you can try to tune the Influx TSI or reduce series cardinality in your collections, but that's a whole other can of worms."", ""TimmyViking: Ah!

I am using Localtuya and have the issue that the status of my devices (all lamps/lights) is not updated. 

For example: If I turn one of my lights off via wall switch (power cut), this is not always reflected on my dashboard. Same can happen the other way around, if I turn a light on.

What confuses me is that in the Tuya App (Smart Life) it updates as expected, but not in HA.

I wanted to go local with my Tuya devices through HA, get away from their cloud. But now I hit this challenge and I am not sure how to solve it.

Thank you,

This is a single rocker, no neutral switch since this one spot in my house doesn't have a neutral wire.

The switch pairs fine with ZHA, I was concerned about the cinder block wall between it and the rest of my network so I placed a SONOFF smart plug just on the other side of the wall from it and it shows it is connected through that router. The coordinator is a HUSBZB-1 connected to a USB extension cable. 

The behaviour I'm seeing is that the switch remains connected to the network but after about an hour, it becomes unresponsive via Home Assistant. The only resolution seems to be to delete and re-add it to the network where it will again respond for about an hour and then go silent again. 

I'm seeing LQI on the device ranging from 150-255 and RSSI hovering around -90.

Aside from this the rest of my zigbee network has been incredibly solid. 

Any advice would be appreciated!"	2	['techdan98: I have a few of these, routed through an aqara smart plug, which are working ok.', 'billybob476: Thanks for the feedback. It’s odd.

&#x200B;

This can happen up to 4-5 times per night.

&#x200B;

Here is what I have found thus far and my setup:

* No open/ closed read sensor has been attached. (I have ambitions to use an esp32 to control this via alternative means but for the moment no read sensor)
* This is connected to a gate (functions the same way as a garage door
* If running the native app this does not seem to occur. Tuya Smart
* The device does not seem to be disconnecting from the wifi and has plenty of signal -42 to -46 dBm
* Tried changing the ""Tuya Local"" version back as far as it goes with still no luck.
* Using this yaml file dongguan\_garage\_door\_opener.yaml
   * I note this file has this twice:
      * optional: true #BUGBUG Sometimes after power off this DP doesn't report state but will be available later

If I am correct and I have no idea if I change these two areas to ""false"" will this resolve the issue or is it something else?

Let me start by saying that I know I have my hub  in the worst place possible, which is in my basement on the complete far end from my bedroom, but I like it there.

I have had in my bedroom for some time now two Caseta switches.  One for the main lights, and another for the ceiling fan.  I have a Pico remote for each as well and they are on the Lutron 2 remote pedestal.  No problems.

Very recently I added two Hue bulbs to the night stands, and paired another Pico remote to control those two.  It was for the week just sitting loose on the night stand, again, no problem.

Yesterday I ""upgraded"" (don't judge me for overspending on the pedestal, but secretly go ahead and judge me for it) to the 3 remote pedestal.  I put the nightstand remote in the middle.  Lights aren't working.  The other two work fine.  Seems the two remotes on the outside block some of that signal from the center one (I'm sure this works fine with a properly placed hub).  I swapped the fan remote to the inside and the nightstand to the outside.  Nightstand works and fan works.  I assume all is good and move about my life.

I have an automation at night time that if I turn on the ceiling fan it'll turn off after 30 minutes.  I turned it on and went to bed.  About an hour or so later I woke up and it was still on.  I turned it off, but thought it strange.

This morning I checked the logs and it never registered the fan on at all.  I flipped the fan on and off again but from the wall switch, HA sees it.  I do it from the remote, fan turns on but nothing in HA.  I separate the remote from the stand and now HA sees the activity.

As I can gather, it seems Lutron does pair the remote directly to the switch, but for status update it relies on the remote to talk to the hub directly.  Also note that I checked the status in the Lutron app as well, not just relying on HA.  Seems weird it doesn't check the status of the actual switch when flipped, but thought I'd share this info in case it is ever useful to anyone.

I've since gone back to my old 2 pedestal and a separate 1 pedestal stand. I got a refund so now you can only judge me slightly less."	0	[]

I am working on setting up a dashboard for my home brewery and would greatly appreciate your advice. My goal is to create a dashboard that can display information from various sensors and, in the future, control automations such as pumps.

I've considered using BrewPi, but I prefer Home Assistant for its compatibility with different switches and sensors.

Before I dive into one of the three options I've identified, I would like your input on which one would be the most suitable for my needs (or maybe some fourth option I've missed):

**Option 1:** Webpage-card or Picture Element Card. This option involves creating a locally hosted HTML, CSS (and JS) webpage and embedding it in a Webpage-card or Picture Element Card. I would then use JavaScript to update the information using sensor data and control automations.

**Option 2**: External Website (Online or Local Webserver). In this approach, I would create a website (either online or locally hosted) and include it in the dashboard. I could then communicate with the website using GET and POST actions for updating information or starting automations. The advantage here is the ability to use a powerful server-side language like PHP and easily update the layout (e.g., with a MySQL database). Is it possible and advisable to update information through a REST API, for example? I could use Node-RED to easily update the actual information on the website.

**Option 3**: Picture Elements Card (Floorplan Style). The third option is to use a Picture Elements Card, similar to a floor plan. However, positioning everything is quite difficult, and certain CSS-style-options are unavailable. The main issue with this option is the very long YAML which is difficult to update for new devices (like fermenters)

Which of these options do you think would be the best for my home brewery dashboard? Are there any other options or resources that you think would be helpful? I'm open to any suggestions and tips to make this project a success. Cheers!

The automation is easy with home assistant but its the hardware I am stuck on.

Just about all of my searches returned people suggesting the various lawn irrigation controllers which seem like overkill for what I am doing. I am running 1 sprinkler head so I just need to be able to turn on/off the water supply to it. I don't need zones and have zero plans or need to add them.

For example you might have a webserver SKU with balanced specs, DB server SKU that's RAM-heavy, storage SKU with a lot of HDDs, etc. Those SKUs have to be designed to last many years, so you have to ensure all suppliers will continue to stock the parts for any repairs.

Everything has to be budgeted. It's a lot of work.\n\nSubsequently, if there's no need to replace a dead server in a rack, you're right that it'll just be left there if the capacity isn't needed, until the next hardware refresh (servers are usually specced for 3-5 years useful life).\n\nOn the other hand, companies may be either power constrained (at or near capacity for power supply at the data center) or space constrained (no free racks left), so if there's spares on hand and more processing power is needed, that dead server is definitely going to get swapped."", 'look_ima_frog: That show was brilliant on so many levels, but not too good so that they were above making a dick joke.', 'sulylunat: Dammit, now I’m torn about whether or not to stick one of these on my server pc, which happens to be located in my guest room…', 'georgkozy: Merkel wake me up at 7, and if the bedroom lights are not on by 7:05 turn on the siren!', ""bk553: It's German's fault.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77nvJuMmnC4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77nvJuMmnC4)"", ""Th3R00ST3R: I've got 99 voices but a Brit ain't one."", 'Th3R00ST3R: Yes, it was the most realistic, although monotone.', 'krakenant: I wonder if we could get enough money together to hire Paul bettany to record training set for us 😁', 'Asfalots: At some point, could we train it with our own voice?', ""ajmaonline: To set people's expectations, how many hours of voice data does it take for it to be helpful.

&#x200B;

I'm planning to use a dedicated NUC or SFF for my HA and run docker on it, in order to run frigate properly.

As there are several ways to integrate cameras as it seems, I just want to know what would be the right way forward. In some tutorials they are talking about RTSPtoWebRTC some are mentioning go2rtc and I'm a bit lost now on the ""latest/best"" combination for my cameras and how to set them up. 

I'm currently using the picam from[https://github.com/iizukanao/picam](https://github.com/iizukanao/picam) together with its node-rtsp-rtmp server on each of the cams as this provides video+audio. From what I understood the picam is also able to output to a tcp address/port. 

Is there any way that I could get rid of the node-rtsp-rtmp server on each of the cameras by providing the tcp (MPEG-TS) output to a central server (maybe go2rtc? don't know as I don't get all the functionalities of that thing yet) running on the NUC/SFF? is there some kind of addon that provides sth like a listener for the tcp MPEG-TS stream that works well with frigate? 

I hope someone can bring some light into the dark go2rtc corner in my mind :D"	19	"[""nickm_27: frigate comes with go2rtc built in, so that is definitely the recommended way from frigate's point of view to set things up. it is fully features and works with the HA webrtc card, the frigate card also supports mse / webrtc.

I have a dehumidifier in a bedroom and have three long poles suspended under the ceiling that can carry a full set of king sized bed linen, or loads of things on hangers.

This works very well for general washing drying and seems more economical than our old conventional electric tumble dryer.

I have the dehumidifier on a TP-Link Kassa smart / monitoring switched socket and using that I can manage the On/Off and the current draw and so alert for 'Tank full' etc.

Because I'm not coder I have 3 automations that seem to manage all scenarios.

The first one turns it on at 10:30 with the condition the humidity is above 70%.

The second one turns it on if the humidity goes above 70% after 10:30 and before 22:00.

The third one turns it off if the humidity drops below 65% or if the time is 22:00.

I also added a Zigbee button on the headboard that turns the 'On when above 70%' automation off and then turns the dehumidifier off, if we are say ill and want to sleep or are watching TV etc.

I have two questions. 1) I understand that the 'relative humidity' can change as a function of temperature and so I wondered if there was an automagic way of adjusting for that re my humidity setting? (I do have 'Thermal perception' on both an inside and outside temp / humidity senders but haven't made use of them other than a desktop indicator).

2) I use the 'Climate' integration to manage the electric heaters in two rooms and I wondered if that was be a better way to manage the humidity?

Open to any advice or suggestions here. ;-)"	0	[]

So this has been my wall tablet setup for several months now (2x Fire HD 10 - 2017, Fully-Kiosk, + [kiosk-mode](https://github.com/NemesisRE/kiosk-mode) \[via ?kiosk to hide sidebar/header}). I found this design originally on FB, and just changed the info to make it more applicable to me.  I'm not married to any of the information presented, though quick access to the two bedrooms (and especially turning their lights on and off) is helpful.

I may need to go with two separate views (one for each tablet) because my use case for each is different. The one near the front door I'm largely checking weather related things before I leave. With the upstairs one, besides the bedroom access, I'm also locking and unlocking the front door (on the first floor) as a last step before going to bed, particularly if that's well before my lock-for-the-night automation.

Really, looking for thoughts/suggestions/whatever on cards/integrations/etc that people think might be helpful. I'm not entirely comfortable with card-mod, because my CSS ""skills"" are woefully out of date, but I can always muddle my way through.

Things that might be helpful to know about me in terms of what could/should be presented:

* WFH
* No HAF needed
* A variety of doctor's appointments, all over the place
* Most lights are tied to motion sensors
* allergic to a stupid amount of airborne shit
* 2 cameras I can see feeds of, one (Nest Doorbell) easier to access than the other (Eufy Floodlight)
* East Coast US

Feel free to ask me questions about things I might have integrated already if you've got ideas that may be reliant on something specific.

other than the obvious “don’t do it” - is there a comprehensive guide anywhere on the steps to take if you need to change the IP of your router without wrecking your existing HA setup? (or can anyone give me some pointers please)
e.g. I want to switch from XXX.XXX.8.XXX to XXX.XXX.1.XXX

Long story Long - 
I’m running supervised HA on an rpi3 - with quite a number of Zigbee devices & automations working well… however, I have a certain AV device on my network which has an inbuilt static IP that just will not change from the default XXX.XXX.1.XXX (I have tried everything but it just will not budge and so far will not be recognised by my router, but works perfectly fine with an older (redundant) router I had lying around which has the correct LAN IP format set-up)

Currently feeling like I have £1k worth of AV hardware which I will need to hook-up to a separate network in order to operate it remotely… which kinda defeats the purpose of the integrated smart home I am trying to create.

Last resort I can see to get everything to play together is looking like updating my router IP from XXX.XXX.8.XXX to XXX.XXX.1.XXX to accommodate it… although know this will involve a load of issues to my HA setup.

IF I go down this route, how do I set myself up for success beforehand on HA so that I don’t kill the previous year of hard-work getting it sweet?
(would be lovely if I just changed the IP and everything was seamless, but know that is never quite the case with HA)

Again, I understand the base case response will be “don’t”… but please, any guidance would be massively appreciated!"	8	"[""AlTeRnAtE-PoIsOn: Does the router that is running now, support vlan?

I recently bumped into an inexpensive, still in a box, two sets of ted5000 devices. I figured I could dip my toes into the power monitoring with HA. At first the gateway device wouldn't save any settings whatsoever, but after I got firmware updated, I was finally in business. At this point I have one MTU, one gateway, and two remote displays (had to solder new rechargeable coin batteries for those)  


I'm wondering if anybody is still using those devices with HA, and if so:  


1. The built-in support gets me current power consumption in Watts, and current line voltage. Unfortunately, power consumption does not show up in the Energy tab at all. Do any of you poll the APIs directly from the device, and if so - would you mind sharing your configs?
2. I could not save any settings with System Settings Wizard until I upgraded firmware (both gateway & footprints). After upgrading to the latest version I could, but the Utility Settings Wizard still doesn't seem to save any settings, eg: I can't set actual utility rates, etc. Am I missing something obvious?  


Thanks in advance!"	0	[]

&#x200B;

I have been making some progress in getting each room set up with a sensor and identified a generic thermostat for heat and cool for each room. Now for 'remote'-steering the actual thermostat I started implementing this automation logic below. Basically when the remote room wants to cool, the main thermostat is set to cool and then its target temperature is set to one degree lower than the current temp to ensure that it's getting started. Once the remote room reaches temp, the thermostat gets turned off. Similar automation for heating but with target temp set to one degree higher.

&#x200B;

Currently I experience though that the thermostat does not update the target temperature, if I adjust it from the remote room. Is there a way I can debug the automation with logging? Is there something else wrong about the logic or the way I try to update the value?

&#x200B;

Thanks

I have a bunch of smart devices, but all are cloud based and Wi-Fi dependent (Google Homes, bulbs and plugs using Geeni App, Nest Thermostat and a handful of cameras on Wyze). I've be doing a lot of renovations, but that is now winding down and I am looking for some recommendations on security cameras/doorbell cameras. I will be looking to migrate everything to a local network utilizing Zigbee2MQTT so would want compatibility there. Any recommendations are appreciated.	3	['_Rand_: Cameras don’t have anything to do with zigbee aside from some Aqara cameras that seem to have a built in hub, which I don’t believe work with zigbee2mqtt. Any interoperability will be with zigbee2mqtt/HA being the man in the middle and with whatever cameras you chose.\n\nWhat you want are cameras that support rtsp/onvif and record them with frigate/viseron/zonemindee/blue iris etc.\n\nPersonally I’ve had good luck with Reolink cameras, but there are a bunch available from hikvison, empiretech etc.', 'beornraukar: The new Reolink Doorbell has totally local integration into home assistant through the official addon. You can then block the internet access to the camera and it still works great.', 'Flipontheradio: I second the reolink doorbell. Just be aware it does not work with your existing chime box. This was a non issue for me but something to be aware of.']

I'm fairly new to Home Assistant and I've been troubleshooting this issue for a few hours now and could use some advice from anyone familiar with migrating their HA instance from RPi to Proxmox. As soon as try restoring my RPi backup file, I lose connectivity to my Proxmox HA instance and I am unable to connect again. Both the RPi and Proxmox are running 2023.4.6 and OS 10 

I created the HA instance on Proxmox using  `bash -c ""$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/raw/main/vm/haos-vm.sh)""` with default settings

I've tried using Samba Share to see what is happening in the log file but as soon as I start restoring the backup, I get a notification saying that I need administrator permissions to access /config. I have no issues accessing /config before restoring the backup. 

I was able to get some log info with the command `core logs` from the HA CLI but I'm not seeing anything that is standing out as to why I can no longer connect. I've attached an image with the output in Proxmox:

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"	2	"[""jmcgeejr: Here's something I learned and not sure why.  Setup your base image of HA and before you do any configuration via the CLI manually set the IP to what your IP used to be on the PI for HA.  Then go through setup and restore your backup.

I am new to HA, and so I had a good look around before posting this. I am also not afraid to dive in at the deep end, and yet, I would appreciate if you could indicate to me whether the following is possible:

```
At a given time each day (e.g. 4 hours past sunset):
  Let T be the average temperature of the last 24 hours
  If it's been more than fn(T) hours since
  - either the last time it rained
  - or this automation ran
  Then:
    Turn on a device until
    - either 30 minutes have elapsed
    - or current condition changes to rain
```

And obviously, if you have tips, or a working example, I wouldn't say no ;)

Thanks,
m"	7	"[""blueshiftlabs: Absolutely doable. You'll need a few helpers:\n\n- A [statistics sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/statistics/) to compute the average temperature over the past 24 hours (`max_age = 24`). We'll call this `sensor.daily_average_temperature`.\n- A sensor that returns the time when it last stopped raining. You can do this with an automation and a date/time helper, although if templates and YAML don't scare you, I'd suggest using a triggered template sensor instead. Call this `sensor.rain_stopped_time` - if you're using the helper, that'll be `input_datetime.rain_stopped_time` instead. \n- Your function, expressed as simple math (no logarithms or anything fancy).\n- A script (not an automation!) that does the necessary service calls to turn on your sprinklers. We'll call it `script.water_lawn` below. \n\nMake an automation. Give it a time-based trigger, configured however you'd like. In the conditions block, set a template condition:\n\n    {%- set rain_stopped = as_timestamp(states('sensor.rain_stopped')) -%}\n    {%- set last_watered = as_timestamp(state_attr('script.water_lawn', 'last_triggered')) -%}\n    {%- set seconds_since_water = as_timestamp(now()) - max(rain_stopped, last_watered) -%}\n    {%- set average_temp = states('sensor.daily_average_temperature') -%}\n    {%- set water_threshold = /* some function of average_temp */ -%}\n    {{ (seconds_since_water / 3600.0) > water_threshold }}\n\nThen, in the actions block, call the service `script.water_lawn`.\n\nTo turn off the water, have a second automation with two triggers - one being the current condition becoming rain, the other being the lawn-watering device being in the 'on' state for 30 minutes."", 'cfrudolphy: Might want to have a look at this integration\n\nhttps://github.com/jeroenterheerdt/HAsmartirrigation\n\nI am pretty sure it does what you want and takes more factors into consideration than just last time it rained or is raining now.', ""CurrentlyInHiding: Just an FYI that you shouldn't be watering your yard at night.

It looks like at some point my MQTT Broker stopped running and I hadn't noticed. Yes, I am a genius. Once it was started again, everything worked. 

So, I've been having problems with my Zigbee reliability. Thanks to a whole bunch of helpful posts here, I am transferring over from a ZHA integration to Zigbee2MQTT.

For context, I have Home Assistant running on Docker on a Raspberry Pi. MQTT is installed on the main Raspberry Pi and Zigbee2MQTT is running via (sudo) Docker Compose.  I flashed the Sonoff Zigbee Dongle with the coordinator firmware.

I've hit what is probably a very silly brick wall--specifically, this error: MQTT error: connect ECONNREFUSED \*\*Raspberry Pi IP\*\*:1883

I know everything else is working because when I use [test.mosquitto.org](https://test.mosquitto.org) as the MQTT broker address Zigbee2MQTT works fine.

I know I can't use localhost because Zigbee2MQTT is running in a container. I have tried the IPs of the Raspberry Pi and docker0 but no luck.

My Mosquitto installation is set to allow anonymous access.

I'm guessing there's something simple I'm overlooking, but I'm not sure where to start. Ideas?

BeerDoctor	2	12wm3n3	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12wm3n3/multi_floor_robot_vacuum/	"I'm curious if anyone has a robot vacuum they like that they have figured out to use with multiple floors in home assistant?

I know the common advice is to buy a robot per floor, but I have a weird split level house with 6x separate areas I have to manually move the robot to.


Right now I a roborock s5 with valetudo, but things get wonky when I move floors.  Valetudo [explicitly states they will never support multiple floors](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/why-not-valetudo.html)

I'm considering dedicating my roborock to one floor and buying a 2nd newer robot to do the other 5x floors.  I have no idea which one I should be looking at though.

We like ours.', ""sloths_in_slomo: It could be possible with a bit of playing around.\n\nI had an issue where if the robot did a run and saw a closed door, later on it would refuse to clean that room thinking it was unreachable. I solved this by doing a run with all doors open, then storing the map file, and later when the robot is docked a HA automation triggers a script on the robot to copy the stored map into the active map file. This way it always starts with a clean map of the whole house with the dots open.\n\nIt would be fairly straightforward to modify this to handle multiple floors. Just record a map of each floor and store them in separate files, the use a HA automation to tell it which floor it is on. It would need to be placed in the same spot every time when doing this.\n\nI tried to bring up the issue about the closed doors with valetudo but the suggestion wasn't taken up, i guess devs think either it's not an issue or is unsolvable (neither is the case).\n\nSo it takes a bit of familiarizing with the files on the robot, but might be workable to run it on multiple floors with one robot"", 'Sure-Temperature: My Roborock S6 allows for saving two floors in the stock app', 'ImATrickyLiar: iRobot’s J7 handles multiple floors automatically.', 'BeerDoctor: Whoa this is ideal!

First i did a full run and then store the map with this:\n\n    # cat set_preferred_map\n    #!/bin/sh\n\n    cp /mnt/data/rockrobo/last_map /mnt/data/map_backup/preferred_map\n    md5sum /mnt/data/rockrobo/last_map > /root/md5check\n\nThen this script brings the stored map back up:\n\n    root@rockrobo:~# cat replacemap\n    #!/bin/sh\n\n    if md5sum -c /root/md5check\n    then\n      echo ok\n    else\n      # file has changed, replace\n      cp /mnt/data/map_backup/preferred_map /mnt/data/rockrobo/last_map\n\n      # restart controller\n      kill -9 `ps | grep RoboController | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1;}'`\n    fi\n\nI then have an automation on HA that runs `ssh robo replacemap`, and run it 1 min after it docks\n\nIt would be possible to use something like this to store multiple maps and load them again. It's a bit hacky and needs to kill the robot service to get it to bring up the stored map again, but it has been working for me.\n\nIt would be even better if something like this was included as an option with valetudo, but I'm not sure how togl get interest with it. And it' be better if there was a way to load the map without killing the robot controller, but it works. From my perspective storing a good map is much more useful than having it use the last map, eg because of the issue if it sees a closed door and then thinks it is permanent.""]"

I also have a Aeotec Z-stick 7 on firmware 7.19.2. I am coming from Smart Things after they deleted all my stuff. I am pretty good with software and electronics in general but oh my god, so far this ecosystem is a massive headache at every turn.

Anyways, how do I add zwave devices? From Smart Things, you usually just put it in pairing mode and click the button. The devices are still able to be paired/excluded using my old Smart Things hub.

I have the Zwave JS addon and the Z wave PC Controller. The z stick shows up in both. I run exlusion mode and none of my zwave devices pop up as being excluded when I trigger them. I run inclusion mode and nothing happens when I trigger devices. I do this in both Zwave JS and the PC Controller program. Nothing happens. Main devices I am trying are GE ZW1001 outlet and ZW4003 switch.

What am I doing wrong? Is there some documentation on this I am missing? Is the z stick not compatible? Is it busted? Please help!

Edit: ended up being the most obvious and simple issue. My region was set incorrectly! Changed that and everything works perfectly as expected! Thanks for the quick replies!"	5	"['daphatty: Have you excluded your devices from Smart Things? Or even better, have you factory reset your devices?', 'flaquito_: First, I\'d recommend that you uninstall the Z-Wave JS addon, and instead use the Z-Wave JS UI from the Community Add-ons section. That will give you a really nice UI that you can add to your sidebar if you want. Then, configure it with your Aeotec stick.\n\nOnce you have that configured, go to integrations and install the Z-Wave JS integration. That\'s the part that lets Home Assistant communicate with the add-on. Now that you\'ve done that, you can either add devices from the add-on or the integration. Most things can be done directly through the integration, but having the advanced UI is really nice.\n\nTo add devices from the integration, go to the integrations section and click ""Configure"" on Z-Wave JS. There will be an ""+ Add Device"" button at the bottom-right. Click that, and then do whatever you need to reset your Z-Wave device. It should automatically go into pairing mode and show up in Home Assistant.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any other questions!', 'egoalter: Before everyone keeps telling you to install this version, use my hardware and other (well meaning?) advice, Zwave is a bit different than the protocols you know for instance WiFi - it\'s more akin to Bluetooth and if you have never programmed to that device, it can be a bit hard particular the first time.\n\nI have about 20+ Zwave devices active with HASS using the very stable Zwave JS. My only \'issue\' is how HASS names devices - don\'t plan on reusing them, with a different name. That will cause headaches, although it can be done if done right (not that I\'ve found that really documented).\n\nFirst of, this is relatively easy if the device has NEVER been joined/adopted before. If it has, some devices will not negotiate with a new zwave broker.  And infortunately the procedure to hard reset a Zwave is a bit different on each device.  Usually you have to hold down the button for 10-15 seconds and hurry to hit ""delete device"" from the JS console. I\'ve seen it work automatically I\'ve seen it only manually - mostly the latter. If your system has never seen the device before, just resetting the device _should_ be enough, but it\'s not always easy to see if there\'s an existing configuration on it. Out of habit I do this now for all new devices before I adopt them.\n\nThe basic procedure requires a bit of fast touching. I advise using the mobile app, head to where you\'re plugging in the new zwave device for the first time, put that device into ""add mode"" using the procedure you laid out, and THEN hit the add device. HASS will show a menu where zwave is first - as long as it\'s done within 20-30 seconds the device should be found. If not, there may not be a signal. Plug the zwave device in very close to where to you have broker antenna that HASS is using. And this is another complication. Not all Zwave devices are created equal. You\'ll need something close to the 700 series or higher of the plus version, to get a mesh where each device will be a routing point for others. This means you can reach much longer. If the device you\'re trying is missing this, or the devices you have do not support this it\'s easy to find dead zones in a house.\n\nLastly if connectivity is noisy, you may see a partial adaptation. Using ""heal"" on the device can resolve that in most cases. \n\nI learned a lot by putting the broker into debug mode and inspecting the logs. It\'s one way to see if communication is spotty or if your HASS thinks it already knows the device under another name (if so, remove that - I even had a duplicate name once - hard to resolve). But I wouldn\'t really recommend that unless you have a fancy for IT protocols. \n\nOnce the device is adopted it\'s been rock solid. All attributes are seen, the response to state changes are fast. And I love the battery life of the sensors.', ""NapkinsOnMyAnkle: Hey thanks for this. Will definitely be asking more questions! It looks like I was already using the zwave JS UI. What's the difference if I may ask?"", 'flaquito_: Z-Wave JS UI is an implementation of Z-Wave JS that adds extra stuff. It adds a really nice control panel, the ability to connect to an MQTT broker (not necessary with Home Assistant), debugging, Z-Wave network visualization, and some other stuff.\n\nZ-Wave JS UI used to be called ZWaveJS2mqtt, so if you see references to the old name, that should help clear up some confusion.']"

I want to keep the house pressurized. Experiments with a box fan in the window with a filter duct-taped on, powered by a smart plug, seem to keep the house more comfortable, keep temperatures more even between rooms, control allergies, and clear co2 from cooking faster. (It comes on when humidity is sensed in the bathroom, when co2 goes up in the kitchen, when the dryer is on, or when the house is negatively pressurized.)

This is because by pressurizing the house, air won't seep in through random cracks and the only air coming in goes through the filter.

Currently I am using two Aqara sensors - one outside and one inside - to calculate the pressure differential;  but they only read to 1 hpa which is about 0.4 inwc; the research I have read is that you should aim for 0.05 inwc of positive pressure.

I've considered mechanical hvac switches wired to an esp32 but these are only accurate to 0.15 inwc (still better than the aqara).

Anyone else experiment with pressurization? Anyone have ideas on pre-built pressure sensors that speak zigbee or bluetooth?"	25	"['madsciencetist: You want a differential pressure sensor.

So air will seep in through cracks and crannies. Not only will that bring in allergens such as pollen, it may pick up other nasty stuff from unfinished spaces such as dead bugs, rodent droppings and mold.

I have recently received my dual tpu after 6 months of waiting and i also bought and adapter for it to fit in my t620 pcie slot. I am really not home in to pcie slots and everything around it, so please don't be harsh on this noob. I have a hp t620, it has for what i understand a pcie slot, i think it is an 1x v2 from what i can find online, but in the bios i saw a setting with pcie 4x. It is the slot where normally a wifi card would be sitting in. I don't want to use a wifi module, i use a lan cable. But what happens is when i put it in, the system starts fine, but i can't acces my home assistant anymore. When i disable the port in the bios it will work again or when i pull the tpu out. I think there is something that the system thinks it is a wifi module but doesn't know what to do with it. I want to use it for face detection with frigate and double take. I have home assistant os general x86-64 installed, it is up to date. Is there any i can do or try? Thank u in advance.	3	"[""rich33584: Most likely it wont work in that wifi card slot anyway and if it did, only 1 tpu will show.\n\nIf these will fit, get this:\n\n[https://www.makerfabs.com/search.html?&search=MBS.PCI20102.2](https://www.makerfabs.com/search.html?&search=MBS.PCI20102.2)\n\nDo the cheapest shipping and youll get it in about 10 days in the United States..

But for now i need it to work on 1. I had already seen these but where the break is at those golden pins, is in my hp the other way around. I don't know if it is a problem. I also have 1 usb 3.0 and 1 usb 2.0 free on the motherboard inside the case, is there any adapter you know of i can use there or a m2 slot. I have m2 slot for memory but i could place that m2 storage to the usb ports with an adapter"", ""sero_t: I now received the b+m key version, it was in stock for couple hours and maintained to get one, received in 2 days.

Even if you successfully pair it and it works, after some time the lock goes into some deeper sleep and can't be used with zwave unless you unlock it with the native app. And even then, it sometimes stops working and you have to exclude it and set it up again.

We recently got a couple Sonos speakers that I now have configured in HA as well, and am able to do things like play various music streams, adjust the volume, etc.

I figured it would be nice to update the ""bedtime"" automation to also turn the speakers off. So I went into the editor and added another action to this automation that looks like this:

    service: media_player.media_pause
    data: {}
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.kitchen_speaker

When I'm in the editor and run this automation it does what I expect it to do. The speaker is paused, and all the other lights in the automation turn off as well.

The trigger for this automation is just a menu button. In the editor it looks like this:

    platform: state
    entity_id:
      - input_button.bedtime

When I click that button in the menu all the actions in the automation that turn off the lights work fine, but the speaker does not get turned off. It's only when I'm editing the automation and run it that way that the speaker turns off. I don't see anything in the system logs after running the automation via the menu button.

Why would this one action work properly when invoked one way but not the other? Am I missing something somewhere?"	6	['dukemib: Have you checked the traces?

Tuya is burning cash and running up big losses. Tuya runs the iOT platform behind most of the worlds branded smart home devices."	42	"['peterxian: There\'s a lot of misinformation in this thread so I thought I\'d try to clarify a few things having read the financial statement and investor briefing.\n\nFirst, Tuya (the company) apparently makes money in two key areas: selling their Platform as a Service, which is a one-time fee paid by device makers for ready-made apps and libraries, and selling Software as a Service, which is subscription-based smart homes for businesses like hotels, commercial buildings, etc. \n\nThe PaaS revenue this quarter was WAY down, almost 50% below a year ago, while SaaS revenue was slightly up. They blame supply-chain inventory slowdowns for the drop, and expect a recovery next year in the device market. Their margins are still very strong (and growing) at 43%+ so they are making money on sales, when they get any. They ""only"" lost around $20M this quarter which for a startup is normal to good in this perspective.\n\nThere is no indication (at this time) they have any plans to charge users for their cloud service. They do mention expanding to add user fees for value-add services like push notifications and content, but not for using the web platform, which is paid for by device makers\' fees. \n\nPersonally, I found two items in this report to be somewhat surprising. One, for a company we\'ve all heard of that has ostensibly enormous reach in the Smart Home space, annual revenue of $208 million seems *incredibly* small. These are not the scale of numbers I expect from an industry heavyweight. They clearly don\'t get royalties from device sales (which is probably their selling point compared to alternative platforms).\n\nSecond, even though they\'re losing $20M a quarter, they have almost $1 BILLION in cash reserves. Presumably this is investor/seed money, and will last them many  many years at their current burn rate.', 'aprettyparrot: Why I like things I don’t need an account for. Finding them lately has been harder though', 'Grim-D: ""Total gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased by 37.6% to US$20.2 million from US$32.4 million in the same period of 2021."" \n\nSo their profits were down from the same quarter in the previous year but they still made $20 millon so don\'t think their in much trouble yet.\n\nEdit: Grammer', ""zolli07: It's sad that all people here are happy about it, yeah I agree that tuya is not a great company and their product not top notch quality, but everyone need to realize that Thier agressive pricing strategy brings down the prices in the whole IoT segment as well.

Non-GAAP net loss was US$5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to US$31.2 million in the same period of 2021. The difference between loss from operations and net loss in the fourth quarter of 2022 was primarily because of a US$10.2 million financial income achieved mainly due to well implemented treasury strategies on the Group's cash and deposits recorded as short-term investment."", 'GhettoDuk: But sales are not where they are looking to make money.

How do I set up the config.yaml?

Context:

I am building my own irrigation controller which uses a wizfi360-EVB-Pico (raspberry pi pico basically). The unit has some libraries that can be used for sending MQTT via wifi. The library expects the subscription and publishing topics to be set prior to connecting to the MQTT broker and if you want to change them you need to kill the connection, reset the topics and fully reconnect to the broker - not really what I want to do.    
To work with this set up I have set up my pi to publish a dictionary with each valve as a key and a value of 0/1. I am able to decode this on the home assistant side with the config in the image (I just added the command topic name and am not using it right now). 

But when it comes to sending a command back from home assistant I am at a loss how I would achieve this since I am only using a single topic. What I would like to do is publish the command using a dictionary just like the one I publish from the wizfi360 or send a int which I would interpret as binary on the pi side which I would then decode as flags, i.e. 2=>0010 would be the second valve.

I just got into using MQTT with home assistant so any help/reccommendations on tutorials would be greatly appreciated."	2	"['lastingd: Without a ""Why you want to do it this way"" preamble, this is an abstract request for help.\n\nCare to explain further?\n\nConvention would have each valve with it\'s own topic for status and command and these could be controlled from a single HA switch entity setup as a group.', ""Dr-LucienSanchez: I agree that this is not the ideal way to do this, and I wouldn't do it this way except that to me it looks like the mcus wifi module has an at-serial command which requires the topics to be set prior to connecting to the broker - [at commands](https://docs.wiznet.io/img/products/wizfi360/wizfi360ds/wizfi360_atset_v1118_e.pdf) - unless I am mistaken. \n\nIf I am right then my choices are, disconnect from the broker and reconnect everytime I want to send/receive for a valve from mqtt (this takes a while and I'd prefer not to do it this way), have one MCU per valve (which is an overkill and seems like a waste) or find a way to send commands for multiple valves on a single topic. I'd prefer the last since all the valves are controlled by a single MCU.\n\nDo you know if it is possible via an inbuilt or custom message type to achieve sending a single command message with multiple entries i.e. valve 0, valve 1, etc?""]"

My big x86 file server/docker host decided to call it quits, and I am considering not reviving it anymore (smells like motherboard failure), but reengineer my setup a bit.

I have a Raspberry Pi 4 with an USB SSD. I was considering just installing Docker on the base OS, mounting my existing volume and dealing with any eventual consequences from moving from x86 to arm. But then, alternatively I could install HassOS as well and have this be a bit more plug-and-play. I have not found how I can move my current config over since I never used Home Assistants backup functionality. I have always been snapshotting at the file system level. Is there any recent tutorial on that that I haven't found yet? I am comfortable on the command line.

My home assistant config goes back to the days when lovelace was the hot new thing, I am quite vested in being able to take it over to a new environment intact.

Also, how about Frigate? I have an USB Coral, would an RPI4 cope with 2 or 3 cameras in addition to HA?

Thanks"	7	"[""boxalarm: Run a full backup of HA. Install HA on the Pi4 and when's it's installed, there's an option to restore your config.

It finally filled up to the point where I couldn't do anymore updates on it. I had a Raspberry Pi 4 just running ADSB so I robbed that, put a 64GB SD card in it and installed HA.

I love plants but don't really have a green thumb and often forget to water them. So I wanted to find an automatic solution to water all the plants I have indoors in multiple small pots.

A more ""classic"" system would be great for the flower boxes on my balcony's railing but I still didn't find anything for such a small scale.

1682199626.0	22-Apr-2023 14:40:26	Howto: Change screen color temperature and brightness of Linux PC from Home Assistant	sgunb	10	12vkcw2	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12vkcw2/howto_change_screen_color_temperature_and/	"Hi all,

I found a solution to the unpleasant thing, that the screen brightness and color temperature of my Linux PC never fit to the color temperature of my lamps. (Home assistant runs on a raspberry pi.)

I want to share, how I solved it in case somebody wants to do the same:

Linux PC:

* install redshift (but don't use the automation)
* create a user 'homeassistant' on the Linux PC.
* write a script which automatically copies the .Xauthority file to the homeassistant user's home after login of your own user (e.g. by using you window managers autostart function)
   * to avoid issues with permissions, passwords, rights, ... I used scp:
      * Copy your Linux PC user's ssh public key to /home/homeassistant/.ssh/authorized\_keys so you don't need a password
      * Copy the ssh public key of your raspberry pi's homeassistant user's to the same file on your linux PC
      * the script to copy the .Xauthority is only this line:

&#x200B;

    #!/bin/bash
    scp /home/user/.Xauthority homeassistant@localhost:""

&#x200B;

* on your raspberry pi:
   * write a simple bash script ""linuxpc\_screen.sh"" to change the screen settings on your Linux PC

&#x200B;

    #!/bin/bash
    ssh homeassistant@linuxpc ""DISPLAY=:0 redshift -x"" 
    ssh homeassistant@linuxpc ""DISPLAY=:0 redshift -P -O $1 -b $2""

&#x200B;

* In home assistant
   * make helpers: two input\_text and one button
   * In your configuration.yaml add the shell\_command

&#x200B;

    shell_command:
      linuxpc_screen: /home/homeassistant/linuxpc_screen.sh {{ states('input_text.screen_colortemp') }} {{ states('input_text.screen_brightness') }}

* make an automation triggered by the button which runs the shell command as a service
* If you want to trigger it automatically by changing a scene, you can use the event trigger in further automations:

&#x200B;

    trigger:
      - event_data:
          domain: scene
          service: turn_on
          service_data:
            entity_id: scene.my_scene
        event_type: call_service
        platform: event

Voila: Now, your screen brightness and color temperature fits the to light in your room."	3	"['Wolfgang-Warner: Nice work, a major improvement to the mood of a room I bet', ""sgunb: Thanks.

Paired to the ZHA integration are standalone zigbee temperature/humidity sensors as well as zigbee motion and door/window sensors that also report temperature.  Custom ""rounded"" sensor entities take of decimal, calibration, and averaging (multiple sensors in a location) issues.  
  
For each temperature value that ""Madam A"" will report, add a ""Toggle"" helper to create an input_boolean entity, i.e. ""input_boolean.patio_temperature_tts"".  Then add a corresponding emulated_hue entry, i.e. ""TTS Patio Temperature"", which then will be discovered by Alexa as a Royal Philips Electronics light device.  
  
Create a Home Assistant automation as follows for each value that Alexa is expected to report. When the input_boolean is toggled ON, a TTS announcement is sent to the Echo device, and 5 seconds later, the input_boolean is switched OFF:  
  
    alias: Announce Patio Temperature
    description: ''
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: input_boolean.patio_temperature_tts
        from: 'off'
        to: 'on'
    condition: []
    action:
      - service: notify.alexa_media_last_called
        data_template:
          message: >-
            The temperature in the patio is 
            {{states('sensor.rounded_ts0201_06_temperature')}} degrees.
          title: Announce Patio Temperature
          data:
            type: tts
      - delay:
          hours: 0
          minutes: 0
          seconds: 5
          milliseconds: 0
      - service: input_boolean.turn_off
        data: {}
        target:
          entity_id: input_boolean.patio_temperature_tts
    mode: single  
  
Finally, in the Alexa app, create a Routine as follows:  
  
* When you say ""Alexa, patio temperature""
* Action: TTS Patio Temperature - Power: On
* Action: Wait 10 seconds
* Action: TTS Patio Temperature - Power: Off  
  
EDIT: ~~I haven't yet figured out how to direct the target for the tts announcement to be the particular Echo device that received the requested routine.  Any insight(s) or other suggestions in the comments are appreciated.~~

I'd like IOTLink on my PC to share on a new topic the result of a command I set up (actually a powershell script), so my HA can use it as a sensor (more specifically, the ""is the PC muted or not, with "" Get-AudioDevice -PlaybackMute "").

I guess I could set a HA Script that queries from HA to my pc this via the ""iotlink/workgroup/pc/commands/run"" handle, but I'd like to avoid my HA having to ask every now and then about it, and having my PC proactively delivering it!

So far, IOTLink is sharing its own predefined sensors, and I could create my own scripts on HA to send commands to my PC, but this part is the one that I'm missing.... can someone point me up in the right direction?"	5	"['PhotonArmy: Given that IOTLink is discontinued as a project, I would recommend the annoying, but relatively worthwhile migration over to HASS.Agent.

# Past Disk Space Issues

About 18 months ago I started running ***Home Assistant***, with the supervisor, in a VM running under ***VirtualBox*** on ***Windows 10***.

But roughly 2 months ago I started having issues where some of my addons would fail to start with an error of ""***no space left on device***"":

    Can’t start addon_a0d7b954_nodered: 500 Server Error for http+docker://localhost/v1.41/containers/a7b66ba697a19f694afca72eb799f6a12fd987b85b6d58a618995eb1a8cff9c6/start: Internal Server Error (“failed to open stdout fifo: error creating fifo /var/run/docker/containerd/a7b66ba697a19f694afca72eb799f6a12fd987b85b6d58a618995eb1a8cff9c6/init-stdout: no space left on device”)

At the time, I found some threads that suggested this could be due to the docker images not being properly pruned. But I wasn't able to figure it out, so I just reverted to an older saved VM image. This lasted me until I build my new ***Unraid 6.11*** server.

# Disk Usage Looks sus

Everything has been running well on Unraid, but I still think that I'm having some issues of old files not being properly cleaned up.

^(I say this because when I run the below command via the) ***^(terminal)*** ^(in) ***^(Unraid)***^(, I can see that the) ***^(virtual size)*** ^(of my VM image is) ***^(100GB)***^(, which is fine, but the) ***^(disk size)*** ^(is) ***^(83GB)***^(.)

    root@Unraid:qemu-img info home_assistant.qcow2 
    image: home_assistant.qcow2
    file format: qcow2
    virtual size: 100 GiB (107374182400 bytes)
    disk size: 83 GiB

        refcount bits: 16
        corrupt: false

Is the `disk size` actually the amount of data being stored in the image or is that something else?

&#x200B;

But when I check the disk usage in the ***Home Assistant web GUI***, it shows only `17GB` being used, which would be fine if that's the case.

This is corroborated when I run the `df` command via the ***terminal addon***, I can see that it looks like my ***disk usage*** is only `17GB`.

Muscle memory)

I recently switched from several custom generic camera entities defined in yaml to the Reolink integration for my Reolink cameras. Since then I have a rogue camera entity throwing errors in the logs and I can't find it or get rid of it. The error shows up hundreds of times a day in the logs but I cannot find the actual entity to get rid of it.

`camera.garage_inside` was the name of a previous camera I had setup in the config yaml. The base name of the camera now that it's configured in the Reolink integration is still 'Garage Inside' but the entity the integration has created is `camera.garage_inside_sub`, there is no `camera.garage_inside` entity anymore. All functions of the camera work as expected so that's another confirmation that the `camera.garage_inside` entity that's throwing errors isn't the new one via the integration.

Searches in all my HA files (even beyond the config yamls) turns up nothing. There's just some legacy stuff in the secrets file that's commented out.

I did find a lingering entity under the original name in the UI and I tried disabling and even renaming it but the errors still get thrown under the original `camera.garage_inside` name in the log. So it seems like this entity isn't even representatives of the one that's throwing the errors? I'm confused.

Here goes...

I am running HAOS in a VirtualBox VM on a Win10 machine. I have previously successfully enabled external access to Home Assistant via the duckdns addon within HA, which authenticates the certificates using letsencrypt (according to [this](https://peyanski.com/home-assistant-remote-access/) guide). I was successfully able to configure HA to use a sub-sub domain from duckdns (e.g. **ha.mydomain.duckdns.org**). My Duck DNS addon config file therefore looks like this:

`domains:`

  `- ha.mydomain.duckdns.org`

`token: <my-duckdns-token>`

`aliases:`

  `- domain: ha.mydomain.duckdns.org`

`alias: mydomain.duckdns.org`

`lets_encrypt:`

  `accept_terms: true`

  `algo: secp384r1`

  `certfile: fullchain.pem`

  `keyfile: privkey.pem`

`seconds: 300`

Recently, I am trying to stand up several other services that will be running in docker containers (on the same host machine as the HA VM). I am running docker via Ubuntu 22.04 LTS within a WSL2 environment. I would like to use NGINX reverse proxy to enable external access to those services using sub-sub domains from the same duckdns domain (lets use Nextcloud as an example). I installed certbot in my Ubuntu environment, and successfully obtained a wildcard certificate for \*.mydomain.duckdns.org. NGINX in docker is configured to point my Nextcloud instance to **nc.mydomain.duckdns.org**. However, my Home Assistant instance shows up when I navigate to each of the following URLs:

* ha.mydomain.duckdns.org (as is expected)
* nc.mydomain.duckdns.org (problem)
* mydomain.duckdns.org (problem) 

I'm starting to wonder if this configuration won't work...is there a conflict between the certificate issued via the duckdns addon in HA and the certificate issued by NGINX in docker because they both ultimately point to the same duckdns subdomain (**mydomain.duckdns.org**)? Does anyone else run HAOS in a VM, and use a reverse proxy to manage other self-hosted services? How do you avoid this conflict?"	6	"[""Lectere: Reverse proxy for one ha instance is madness and you are just relay your certificate problem.

I'm have really poor time management skills particularly in the morning and I wanted to see if you had an idea how to better approach this 

Basically I'd need a timer card that tells me how long I have to get ready and leave the house, based on the time I need to be at work by, and the commuting time with current traffic.


So the way how I think this would work:

- A dropdown where I can choose the time I need to be at work (9:30,10,10:30 etc)

- A sensor for commuting time with traffic (I already have this) 

- A sensor to get the current time

- An automation that starts a timer by passing the following variable: 10:30 (dropdown) - 00:30 (commute) - 09:20 (current time) = 00:40 min timer

- a button to start the automation 

- a timer card that lets me display this 

Am I missing something? Do you have any advice on this, as I'm quite new to all of it? 

Thank you"	3	"[""Fritz00015: Do you know the time you need to be at work based on your calendar?

HisCromulency	2	12v6fqo	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12v6fqo/how_to_mount_smb_media_shares_from_separate_nas/	"I have Home Assistant OS 10 installed bare metal on an Intel NUC. 

I can't figure out why my configuration isn't letting me access and mount SMB shares from my OpenMediaVault server. I followed [this previous Reddit thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/rm36s3/how_to_mount_an_nfs_or_smb_filesystem_on_ha/) as a guide, and as far as I know I did everything correct. 

This is what I have in my configuration.yaml:

    homeassistant:
      media_dirs:
        movies: /mnt/media/movies
        tv: /mnt/media/tv
        music: /mnt/media/music

      mount_media_movies: mkdir -p /mnt/media/movies;mount -t cifs -o username=HisCromulency,password=HisCromulencyPW //192.168.1.199/Movies /mnt/media/movies
      mount_media_tv: mkdir -p /mnt/media/tv;mount -t cifs -o username=HisCromulency,password=HisCromulencyPW //192.168.1.199/TV_Shows /mnt/media/tv

I did the step of creating the Movies, TV, and Music directories first in HA. Did a full system reboot. Made the shell commands, and validated that there were no problems. I also made the automation to run the shell commands on HA boot: 

    alias: Mount /media on HA start

      - service: shell_command.mount_media_tv

I also have ""allow guest access"" permissions on my OpenMediaVault SMB shares.

When I click on Media>Local Media, I can see the Movies, TV, and Music folders I have created https://imgur.com/7mT0z9r. But when I click on say ""movies"" folder, I just get an infinite loop of loading the movies folder over again and again.

The downloading of the projects stays at the “preparing download …” step without downloading anything. 

On esphome web, everything works fine, after installing the drivers he finds the port and installs everything. That is until I’m trying to connect to my wifi asking credentials and this step just doesn’t work since I get an error message saying “connection failed”. My credentials are good and when I try to connect it to WiFi using Arduino ide it works just fine.

I think trying to think about it as “solar left over” is where you’re going to trip up because the battery doesn’t differentiate.\n\nI think* that’s the way to think about it is a case of average purchase price - say you have a empty battery and charge it to 1kwh for 60p total, and then charge by Solar for another 1kWh. You now have 2 kwh of electric stored at a 60p per kWh.\nIf you discharge 1 kwh hour you have 1kwh at 60p per kWH, and if you then charged another 1 kwh you would have 2kwh at 30p per kWh.\n\nSo I’d have a tariff that fluctuates with the ratio of charge method and then saving is realised with the discharge.', 'DragonQ0105: If you\'re with a provider that has an API for unit price (i.e. Octopus in the UK), you can get an actual cost figure by setting your ""energy import"" and tariff correctly in the Energy dashboard.\n\nThen all you have to do is compare that to a second figure, which is basically ""home usage"" multiplied by the tariff at each interval. This is the part I\'m not entirely sure how to do and would depend on your setup.\n\nI know that before getting solar our usage was 50% peak and 50% off-peak so it\'s easy to work out, plus I know what our average bill & usage was anyway.', ""defeatedbythecat: Yeah I think that's the way to go about it.

For some time now I have been caring for my grandfather who lives 40 min away from me in the outskirts of Munich. Since I am so far away, I always worry about whether he is alright. I always looked for solutions to calm my mind. During a project at the university, I then developed intelligent adapter plugs together with other students. The aim of this plug-in is to record when a technical device in the household is used (e.g. TV, refrigerator, bedside lamp). During the first few days, it is determined how often a person in need of care uses the technical devices in the household. If there are subsequent deviations in usage behavior, this could indicate health problems. For example, if the bedside lamp comes on eight times a night instead of twice, this could indicate insomnia. If the refrigerator is opened only twice a day instead of five times, lack of appetite could be the reason. In such a case, a relative is notified directly by SMS. It is important to note that caregivers will not be able to see the daily usage behavior of the persons they care for, i.e. they will not be able to see how often the TV is used. They will only get a message once typical behavior deviates.

What do you think about this solution?"	23	"['trantoriana: Good idea, but latency of events is probably too high.

Teter09	3	12uybzz	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12uybzz/howto_turn_off_switch_but_trigger_nothing/	"I use a Zooz switch (disabled local and Zwave control) in order to turn on and off our ceiling fan light (via Bond hub). My wife was happy about this since she hated the 'useless' switches as the fan is controlled by remote (its DC powered). 

She however hates when the switch is out of sync with the light. Every night we go to bed and the switch is 'on' but we use the remote to turn the light off. Then the next day it's 'backwards' and she gets annoyed.

Does anyone have an idea how I should configure this so turning the switch on, always turns the light on (even if the switch is already in the on position)? And the same for turning it off? 

I would also be happy with some sort of way to turn the switch off at a set time in the morning without triggering the light or actually killing the power to the fan.

EDIT: 

I got it working thanks to u/InertLeaf and the examples provided for using the switch as a scene controller. My original attempts failed, but now regardless of the switch state, pressing the button performs the intended action on the light."	11	"[""Grim-D: I would say the best thing is for her to get used to the idea that you just flip the switch to change the state. My lights are all like this and everyone got used it it pritty quickly.

Typically the “out-of-sync” problem happens when you have a normal non-smart switch wired up to a smart relay hidden behind it. And those smart relays typically have a configuration option if you want to enforce turning on the relay only when the switch state goes from off to on. So if both the switch and relay are physically on and then you change the relay state to ‘off’ via z-wave, you’d have to turn the switch off then back on in order to turn the relay back on. \n\nHowever any Zooz in-wall switch I’m familiar with is a physical toggle switch and doesn’t have an ‘on’ or ‘off’ physical position. The switch sits in the neutral position and you momentarily push it up or down to change the relay state and it springs back to the neutral position.  https://www.getzooz.com/switches-and-plugs/. Therefore no such setting exists on these because it doesn’t make sense in that setup.', ""PersistentPizza: You can configure the Zooz switch so that on off both do a toggle instead of an explicit on/off.

That switch ends up being in all sorts of different configurations of up and down, but that\'s how it was before in the three way configuration anyway so my wife doesn\'t mind.

Later on you can use the existing account credentials of user in HA to login to MQTT, but I\'m prefering to set a specific user just for MQTT so in the options tab/panel of Mosquitto broker I\'ve inserted this into the **""Logins"" section** (watch out for the indentation):\n\n    - username: mqtt\n      password: yourpasswordhere\n\nI\'ve **installed Mosquitto client** for Windows which you can find on [https://mosquitto.org/download/](https://mosquitto.org/download/)\n\nI\'ve **installed AutoHotKey** and made this script:\n\n    ^Volume_Down::\n        Run ""C:\\Program Files\\mosquitto\\mosquitto_pub.exe"" -h 192.168.1.100 -t livingroom-light/brightness -m ""decrease"" -P yourpasswordhere -u mqtt,,hide\n        return\n    ^Volume_Up::\n        Run ""C:\\Program Files\\mosquitto\\mosquitto_pub.exe"" -h 192.168.1.100 -t livingroom-light/brightness -m ""increase"" -P yourpasswordhere -u mqtt,,hide\n        return\n\n**Volume\\_Up::** means the following will run with that ""keypress"", and the **\\^** in front of it meaning you also have to **hold CTRL button**.

You add a **MQTT trigger**, set the **topic** to livingroom-light/brightness (or whatever you wanna set), and **payload** to ""increase"" (and in the other automation you set payload to ""decrease"")\n\nIn the **action** section you pick your light and there are actions (at least for my light dimmer) for increasing and decreasing brightness of it. I\'m not sure if all of lights get that in Home Assistant, but my did so I didn\'t look into it further.\n\nIn the end I can recommend adding a **logbook exclusion** for the 2 automations beause you\'ll get it filled with brightness changing. To do this, modify the **configuration.yaml** file and insert this (set the entities to the automations you did), check if your configuration is valid in Developer Tools and restart the HA\n\n    - logbook:\n        exclude:\n            entities:\n                - automation.keyboard_increase\n                - automation.keyboard_decrease\n\nDisclaimer: I\'ve did this yesterday, I have no idea if it\'ll work flawlessly.

I have the switch configured by the Z-Wave parameters UI to be set to ""Normal"", but this allows the new dialogue to use the slider and set the expected brightness from 1-99%, rather than being a simple on off switch as my button is set to. If I change it to ""On/Off"", I can still control the brightness via the slider introduced in 2023.3. But on top of that, I then have issues where tapping the power button on the slider menu (or my regular old button) don't control toggling the light on and off.

For the most part they work great. I got them paired up with my Zigbee network and they're very reliable. My only issue is the bead connector which will sometimes pass through (while making a sickening sound as it makes its way) but more often than not gets stuck. Besides the strain on the motor, this introduces a whole host of problems in recalibrating my upper and lower limits, etc. Has anyone found a solution to this issue besides spending $100 on bead joining pliers I will use one time? Installing an infinity chain kind of defeats the purpose of these motors to begin with. If I was going to go through the trouble of getting up there to disassemble, etc I would have just bought tube roller units. I seem to remember when I was researching blind motors one of the more expensive companies used to send a special connector for this very problem. Someone please help!	4	"['Sporebattyl: I have the same issue. The trick is to get the tension of the beaded cord just right. No slack, but not taut. \n\n\nTwo of the three I have are calibrated just right and I don’t want to start on the third. The third works, but it makes that nightmare sound sometimes. It’s a headache to get right. You basically cut off 1-2 beads, join them back together with the connector and test it until you get it right. \n\n6ish months into it and I’m still on the fence about using this method on the other blinds in my house.', ""anthonym9387: I had mine working exactly like this for a little while and then it just eventually went to hell. It started getting stuck every time and then one of them snapped off a bead twice. I'm either going to bite the bullet and invest in the joining pliers or buy them on Alibaba and wait a month since they're about half the price. It sucks because these things are great otherwise."", 'Sporebattyl: First time I’ve heard of joining pliers. Why do you think it’ll solve the issue that the bead connector piece won’t?\n\nDo you have to use it on metal beaded chains or can you use them on plastic chains as well? \n\n\nI got my motors off AliExpress for half the cost of anything available in the US and it came with a solar panel, which made the wait worth it.', 'anthonym9387: The joining pliers eliminate the connector. They punch a hole in one of the metal beads then crimp it around the thin connecting part so it creates one seamless chain. It only works on metal I believe. Ryse has a bead connector that’s small and round that doesn’t get stuck like the regular big ones. I’m just surprised nobody has come out with a third party version of it.']"

Relevant Add-ons installed:
Moquitto broker
rtl_433
rtl_433 auto discovery
MariaDB

Dongle: Nooelec NESDR Mini USB RTL-SDR & ADS-B Receiver Set

Sensors: Acurite Fridge & freezer temp sensors

The setup seemed pretty straightforward. I installed Moquitto, installed the two rtl_433 add-ons, plugged in the dongle then rebooted. Started the rtl_433 and auto discovery add-ons. The logs for the add-ons aren't showing any errors and my Acurite sensors (fridge & freezer) are picked up by the broker and get imported as Devices/Entities. I can see the current statuses.

The problem is that a few minutes after discovery, everything goes absolutely haywire. I start seeing a bunch of DB errors in HA and nothing will load, then a reboot is required. At first I was using SQLite for my DB but switched to MariaDB since it seemed more stable and less prone to corruption. I also have limited Recorder by adding a bunch of items to the exclude list, including sensors (to debug).

It's very difficult to get valid logs because it seems like something from rtl_433 being sent to the recorder is causing corruption, then everything breaks. If I unplug the dongle and reboot, it all settles down and the errors go away. Any tips or suggestions?

Edit:
I ended up buying a 4 port powered USB 3 hub and moved my z-wave/ZigBee stick, SSD, and the 433 dongle to that (with extensions). Everything is running smoothly now!

It\'ll run a certain way if it\'s in auto mode, a different way if it\'s in manual mode or will just say ""Standby"" if it\'s not running\n\n    text_sensor:\n      - platform: template\n        name: ""$friendlyName Time Left""\n        id: time_left\n        lambda: |-\n                if (id($ic).active_valve().has_value()) \n                {\n                  if (id($ic).auto_advance()) \n                  {\n                    // auto-advance is enabled\n                    if((id($ic).total_cycle_time_enabled_incomplete_valves() + id($ic).time_remaining_active_valve().value() + 1) / 60 >1)\n                    {\n                      char buf[50];\n                      sprintf(buf,  ""%u Minutes"", (id($ic).total_cycle_time_enabled_incomplete_valves() + id($ic).time_remaining_active_valve().value() + 1) / 60);\n                      return ((std::string) buf);\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                      char buf[20];\n                      sprintf(buf,  ""%u Minute"", (id($ic).total_cycle_time_enabled_incomplete_valves() + id($ic).time_remaining_active_valve().value() + 1) / 60);\n                      return ((std::string) buf); \n                    }\n                  }\n                  else\n                  {\n                    //auto-advance is disabled\n                    if((id($ic).time_remaining_active_valve().value() + 1) / 60 >1)\n                    {\n                      char buf[50];\n                      sprintf(buf,  ""%u Minutes"", (id($ic).time_remaining_active_valve().value() + 1) / 60);\n                      return ((std::string) buf);\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                      char buf[20];\n                      sprintf(buf,  ""%u Minute"", (id($ic).time_remaining_active_valve().value() + 1) / 60);\n                      return ((std::string) buf); \n                    }\n                  }\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                  return ((std::string) ""Standby"");\n                }\n                \n        update_interval: never\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI then have this run every 5 seconds to check if the main system switch is turned on then update the time left sensor to stop it spamming the logs when the system isn\'t running.\n\n    interval:\n      - interval: 5s\n        then:\n        - if:\n            condition:\n              switch.is_on: main_switch\n            then:\n              - component.update: time_left']"
