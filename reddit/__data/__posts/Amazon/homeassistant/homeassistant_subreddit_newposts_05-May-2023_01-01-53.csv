My old, Watts brand recirculation pump didn’t have enough flow to kick on the tankless unit, so I had to buy another pump. This model gets installed not at the heater itself, but out at the farthest bathroom. And there is no thermostatic valve placed inline to shut off the flow when the hot water reaches that location. Instead, there is a thermocouple that shits the pump off when a certain temp is reached at the pump (I think that’s 100F). 

The way that the user is SUPPOSED to use the system is by hitting a momentary button that starts the pump again, which will again automatically shut off when the hot water arrives there. There are also wireless transmitters and a receiver available, and finally motion sensors. 

I’m sure I can wire up an ESP32 or z-wave dry contact relay, and if necessary I can override or replace the thermocouple with a Dallas one-wire temp sensor… but my real question is - what is the best user experience?

Since the pump will be in temp controlled space, the temp at the pump will probably drop at a predictable rate once it goes off. I can probably just actuate that contact every X number of minutes during the “peak” times of hot water use. Or I could rig up some proportional valve and get a magnetically coupled pump on a timer for those peak times. Off peak could be satisfied with a voice command.

Thoughts?"	3	"['50racer: Just some thoughts but depends time of how long the pump will take... How big your house is. \nIf using for shower or bath stuff. Put smart light switch so when you turn on bathroom light it will turn on the pump. By the time going to wash hands or turn on shower the pump might have enough time to get water hot.\nCan also have times that if the switch is turned on and only have pump run at certain times', 'Circuit_Guy: Is there actually a need? Meaning... Hit the button once. I would assume the water is comfortably warm for the next hour.', 'MyloFiore: Great idea. I can definitely trigger the pump based off of the bathroom lights - and maybe the ""cooking"" or ""eating"" lighting scenes - if they fall outside the normal ""peak"" hot water times.']"

I have more than 100 wifi devices connected to my HA system, and quite frankly my old orbis (RBK50) can no longer handle the amount of clients.

Also, do you separate the IoTs from your regular wifi clients? (Edit: and if so, how?)

I am planning to keep an Aquara Zigbee temp sensor in each of my cars. My plan is when the car is out of the range my HA can't get any data from the temp sensor, else it will display the temperature.

Do you know any wifi, z-vawe, zigbee capable proximity sensor what I can use outside and can be integrated into HA?

I've posted recently regarding problems I've been having with zigbee2mqtt.  I've been on their discord, posted in here and have completely uninstalled and reinstalled, new hardware etc. It just won't work. I also restored a backup from when it was working....still won't work. Never had a single issue prior to this (with z2m).  I went ahead and started a new VM of HA and setup z2m and it worked fine. So it's got to be something in my HA setup that isn't necessarily tied specifically to z2m and possibly more of a config conflict or something along those line. I have so many custom cards, intricate integrations etc. I can't fathom starting over just to get my zigbee working. Is there a way to migrate over little at a time opposed to restoring a previous backup?  If my concern is that it's a problem within home assistant, I'd like to import partials, check to make sure z2m is still working, add a little more etc. Is that possible? Or any other suggestion to try to nail down my issue to get up and going again? I even gave access to my server to one of the z2m mods and they couldn't figure it out either.

I'm using ZHA and a SONOFF Zigbee coordinator. I haven't updated the firmware on my coordinator or flashed it, it just worked for me out of the box. 

Anyone else have this issue or have insight into how to fix this?"	3	['BroggerNL: I experience the same.', 'Anonimo32020: What brand are your repeaters?', 'MrCuddlez69: They are the Aquara Smart Plugs, that are also repeaters']

Great. How?

To use the new assistant with voice you need a valid SSL certificate and no selfsigned. From my understanding that is only possible by connecting the device to the internet.

The Rhasspy ppl even said:""Rhasspy (ɹˈæspi) is an open source, fully offline set of voice assistant services""

So can I use HA2023.5 fully offline or is this just the start of selling stuff like their cloudservices?

It looks very similar to this:
https://www.manualslib.com/manual/2454005/Sprsun-Cgk-C-12.html#manual
There is zero documentation for my off-brand pump (off- and online), but looking at the display and its connector, I suspect it is using RS485 and Modbus. It has 4 wires in a RJ22 4C4P plug.
Does anyone know of any HA projects, preferably with accompanying Modbus accessories (RS485 over WiFi or similar)?
I could dive into reverse engineering it myself, but it may take quite some effort to figure out if the controlling logic (cut-off temperature switching, timer switching etc) is in the display or on the pump itself, and if there is an existing HA project, I'd much rather want to utilize that instead."	0	[]

I am hoping someone can help me.  I am quite new to Home Assistant and wanted to add my Supermicro server's IPMI sensor readings into Home Assistant.  

I have got the Sensors I want to be polled in a script that Cron executes every 1 minute, and then pushes to my HA vm.  All of the sensors I added have appeared in HA, but they do not update.  Cron executes the script every minute successfully, and when I manually run the script I get no failures, yet the sensors do not update in HA.  

My HA config files looks like this:

`mqtt:`

  `sensor:`

`- name: CPU Temp`

`state_topic: server_cpu_temp`

`unit_of_measurement: °C`

`unique_id: sensor.cputemperature`

`- name: PCH Temp`

`unit_of_measurement: °C`

`unique_id: sensor.pchtemp`

`- name: System Temp`

`state_topic: server_system_temp`

`unit_of_measurement: °C`

`unique_id: sensor.systemtemp`

`- name: CPU Fan Speed`

`state_topic: server_cpu_speed`

`unit_of_measurement: RPM`

`unique_id: sensor.cpufanspeed`

`- name: Front Fan1 Speed`

`state_topic: server_front_fan1_speed`

`unit_of_measurement: RPM`

`unique_id: sensor.fan1speed`

`- name: Front Fan2 Speed`

`state_topic: server_front_fan2_speed`

`unit_of_measurement: RPM`

`unique_id: sensor.fan2speed`

My script looks like this:

`#!/bin/bash`

`SHELL=/bin/sh PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin`

`MQTT_IP='`[`10.0.1.150`](https://10.0.1.150)`' #HA VM`

`SDR[2]='7.3'`

`SDR[3]='7.1'`

`SDR[4]='29.1'`

`SDR[5]='29.3'`

`SDR[6]='29.6'`

`for i in $(eval echo ""{1..$NUMBER_OF_SENSORS}"")`

`do`

   `PAYLOAD=$(ipmitool -I lanplus -H ""$IPMI_IP"" -U ""$IPMI_USER"" -P ""$IPMI_PW"" sdr entity ""${SDR[$i]}""|cut -d '|' -f$CUT_COLUMN|awk '{>   mosquitto_pub -r -t ""${TOPIC[$i]}"" -m ""$PAYLOAD"" -h ""$MQTT_IP"" -u ""$MQTT_USER"" -P ""$MQTT_PW""`

`done`

Here is my Cron job

`*/1 * * * * cd /zfs/docker/ipmi/ &&` [`script.sh`](https://script.sh)

So, if I restart the MQTT broker in HA, the sensors start updating for a few minutes then they stop.  Currently my cpu temp sensor (the one I care the most about) updated over 18 hours ago, and that is with manual executions of the script.  

All of this is quite new to me, so I am not really sure where to start troubleshooting.  Thank you for any help"	2	['itsaride: Use MQTT explorer or an MQTT phone app to see if messages are actually being sent to those topics.', 'fusrohdann: Thank you, I’ll read into them tonight']

I have a ""dumb"" ceiling fan that is connected to HA via an ESP32 (running ESPhome) that pilots the buttons of the fan remote. 

Each button of the remote is mapped to a switch in HA. Toggling a HA switch results in pressing the corresponding remote button. The switches are configured as momentary in ESPhome (the return off after 10ms).

The whole hack works well, but the obvious limitation is that I don't know the status of the fan and I can't set a specific fan speed: I can only increase or decrease the speed.

I am now trying to wrap these 9 buttons with a template fan but I need some help with set\_percentage.

The logic I need to implement should be able to derive how many times to toggle the speed\_up switch or the speed\_down switch, depending on the current speed and the percentage provided.

My code so far is:

              {{ states('input_number.loft_ceiling_fan_speed') if is_state('input_boolean.loft_ceiling_fan_on_off', 'on') else 0 }}
              
            oscillating_template: ""{{ states('input_select.loft_ceiling_fan_swing') }}""
            
            turn_on:
              - service: input_boolean.turn_on
                target:
                  entity_id: input_boolean.loft_ceiling_fan_on_off

                  entity_id: input_select.loft_ceiling_fan_swing
                data:
                  option: ""{{ oscillating }}""
              - service: switch.toggle

Thanks!"	11	"['SNKWIRED: If you combine it with an energy monitoring device you can look at watt consumption for speed. This should be quite reliable and will take into consideration if someone manually pressed a button it would get out of sync', 'clin248: Sorry not a solution but a comment. I think there is just no fool proof way to get the percentage detection right easily. \n\n I have done a similar set up for my kitchen hood. I tried using energy monitoring with those close clamp current detector in the main circuit breaker. It does work but detection is delay since it takes about 30 second for current to settle so quickly changing the fan speed will defeat this detection. It’s not a resistive load so the steady state changes all the time. I run calibration everyday at night but it’s still unreliable. \n\nAlso not sure what you fan behave if just getting powered on, does it start at the previous speed or does it go to a set speed. After my failed attempt at power monitoring (really not a big deal but partner gets super irritated if hood gets turned to max).  I also resort to counting the button press cycles. Issue is that it can be defeated by a person manually setting the speed then you don’t know where you are. Again to over come this whenever I change speed I have to do a few clicks to make sure fan is at lowest speed then click back up to appropriate speed. \n\nThe other is to get an idea of how your fan changes soeed, is it based on potentiometer, in the case of my hood it has a few wires each is triggered depending on fan speed, you can probably put a clamp across each wire to find which is triggered but it was a bit over kill for me so I didn’t set it up that way.', 'Rudd-X: Mod the fan directly using your ESP device bro.

Idk what I'm overlooking here but how can Home assistant tell if the Ecobee3 lite's fan is running? The native integration has over 2-3 minute delay for the fan attribute to change. The Homekit Controller integration updates instantly but cannot seem to determine if the fan is on explicitly.

Fan is set to run minimum 5 minutes every hour. I got this partially working indirectly by checking the ""fan\_mode"" and ""hvac\_action"" attributes which works if I manually set a fan hold or if the fan turns on during heating or cooling. This doesn't work when the fan runs as part of the min fan time because those attributes stay as ""auto"" and ""idle"" respectively.

Can't find a clear answer about this online and I definitely don't want to hook up an ESP based sensor to the fan to detect it directly...

If it makes any difference on what to get, I’m based in the UK.	2	"[""Shooter_Q: >Alternately, can normal smart light bulbs be used with a dimmer switch?\n\nSome combinations would work, but, assuming you got it right, that would leave you in an awkward position where you can control on/off via app/automation/voice so long as power is on, dimming has to be done at the switch, and it's possible to cut power to the bulbs via the switch, cutting your app/automation/voice ability until those bulbs have their power restored and have time to reconnect to the network. In short, that's usually not the way you want to go.\n\nHere's a pretty [good UK-specific resource](https://youtu.be/9u_kQ9gW9Cg?t=167) if you're trying to get started. His personal preference was for Zigbee switches, but he's going over some considerations that apply to Wi-Fi switches as well.\n\nIn terms of low cost, once you throw in dimming capability, I think you'll find there's not too much cost difference between switches of comparable quality."", ""voiceoverguyuk: That's awesome, thank you, will take a look.""]"

I'm on 2023.5, Supervised, but I'd previously been on the beta, so this shouldn't be an issue for me.

My thermostat went offline earlier, so I reset my modem (x2) and router (several times) trying to get that resolved. In the midst of that, HA announcements that had been firing with no issue via my grouped Google speakers suddenly weren't. The speakers would make the cast noise, but no sound would follow, and worse, the devices would continue to make that cast noise about every 30 seconds or so.

I tried removing the Google Cast integration, removing the Google Home integration, restarting HA several times. What ultimately stopped it was removing the entire speaker group from Google Home. I can readd the Cast integration, but as soon as I recreate the speaker group in Google Home (and HA tries to cast to it) the process begins anew.

I am relatively new to the smart home ecosystem, so new actually I still don't have a Raspberry Pi 4 lol (ugh stock issues). As I buy new products, I am planning ahead so these products can be compatible with my smart home assistant system. I really want to get a drip coffee maker that I can control from home assistant OS, mainly setting the time/day to start the coffee maker so it is ready for me to pour when I go downstairs and off to work. Does anyone have suggestions on a coffee maker to make this happen? I see a few old posts on the web, but they all seem to be highly DIY projects, by custom wiring in circuits and such to connect dumb coffee makers to HA, which I would rather avoid if possible. Any comments help, thanks!	4	"['ImpatientMaker: We just bought a basic Mr coffee and used a smart plug.

*Short question:*  
Does anyone know of a Zigbee device that plays a (predefined) sound when triggering it?

*Long story with context:*  
I'm looking into smart doorbells **without** a camera or microphone. I have a 30 year old loud doorbell that I can't easily turn on or off. But I also have a baby that I would very much like not to be woken up by the doorbell. And people definitely ignore notes on the door not to ring so I need a foolproof solution.

So my requirements:

* Smart doorbell, that will send me a persistent notification when someone is at the door.
* Item that plays a sound when someone is at the door that I can turn on or off. Bonus points if it's portable.
* I don't need or want to be able to talk to people at the door or see them.
* For privacy reasons, I'd prefer not to use some external service for notifications. But because there's no video or audio, I guess that is less important.

There's very limited options, the only affordable one I could find was the Aeotec Doorbell 6 Z-Wave Plus (€75). Now, I have everything in my home using Zigbee, not Z-Wave, so I'm thinking I can either go three ways:

* Cave and get a Z-Wave connector for my Home Assistant and use the Aeotec doorbell. Guesstimate for the total solution: €100 ish.
* Play a sound through the Sonos speakers I have. Cheap (because I already have them), but likely too slow. So not really an option.
* Buy or build a small sound device that plays a simple sound when triggered by a zigbee signal through Home Assistant. I'd use one of my spare Ikea buttons I have lying around. Total price: hopefully cheaper than a 100 bucks.

Now I'm thinking I could probably build something with a little microcontroller, but maybe there are some out of the box solutions I could use for this? My searches have so far not resulted in anything useful.

Any help or ideas are much appreciated!"	9	"[""sejoki_: Does it **have** to be zigbee? You can get a [DFplayer mini](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU_DFR0299).

Recently, all my motion automations stopped working (all of my motion sensors are zigbee). I researched, and zigbee2mqtt was stopped. I started it (or pushed ""start"") in the UI and it wouldn't start. I checked the logs, and it said it was ""started"". I click back from logs to the main page to try again, and it said ""this addon is not running"". I messed with it for quite some time without progress. I tried resorting to a backup from a couple days prior (when it was working). Same thing.  As things have progressed, I've uninstalled Zigbee2mqtt, I've gone to backups from 2 weeks ago. Uninstalled mosquito broker, replaced my sonoff usb 3.0 plus p coordinator, replaced the USB hub and extension cable. I've restarted the VM, and restarted  my unraid server. I will occasionally get it to start (turn green); and can actually get into the webui (sometimes), but when I do, all my devices are ""offline"". Sometimes only the hard-powered devices show online. If I try to ""permit to join"" it will freeze up and go offline again. I've deleted the zigbee2mqtt folder, restored the config file, started fresh with a new file, regenerated pem files, changed network keys in teh config file. It doesn't seem to matter what I do, I can't consistently get it to stay running.  At this point I'm ""ok"" with completely restarting from scratch with the Zigbee stuff, but can't fathom starting over with a new HA instance.

Just tested the new whisper add-on and it lags pretty badly on my RPi4 and the only sensible model option that actually runs, tiny-int8, has about 40% WER (word error rate) in my language (Polish) which is basically unusable for anything. I wanted to run whisper on an external, beefier server, I made this docker-compose:
```
services:
  whisper:
    image: homeassistant/amd64-addon-whisper:latest
    container_name: whisper
    ports:
      - 10300:10300
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - whisper-data:/data
    entrypoint: python3
    command: -m wyoming_faster_whisper --uri tcp://0.0.0.0:10300 --model tiny-int8 --beam-size 1 --language pl --data-dir /data --download-dir /data
volumes:
  whisper-data:
```
which in theory runs the same command as the official add-on does. Then I add the wyoming integration in HA with the IP of my docker host 192.168.10.22 and 10300 port. It adds successfully, I can select it as the speech to text option, but when I try to use it in the conversation window it just hangs on listening indefinitely and never do anything.

Nothing in HA logs, whisper docker logs says it's running fine:
```
INFO:__main__:Downloading FasterWhisperModel.TINY_INT8 to /data
INFO:__main__:Ready
```

and doesn't output anything when I try to dictate commands. When I run the whisper server health check  command:
```
echo '{ ""type"": ""describe"" }' | nc -w 1 192.168.10.22 10300
```
from the homeassistant container I get this response from the whisper server:
```
{""type"": ""info"", ""data"": {""asr"": [{""name"": ""faster-whisper"", ""attribution"": {""name"": ""Guillaume Klein"", ""url"": ""https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper/""}, ""installed"": true, ""models"": [{""name"": ""tiny-int8"", ""attribution"": {""name"": ""rhasspy"", ""url"": ""https://github.com/rhasspy/models/""}, ""installed"": true, ""languages"": [""pl""]}]}], ""tts"": [], ""handle"": []}}

which indicates that HA conatiner communicates with whisper server just fine.

Playing with HA for a long time now, I struggle to migrate a full backup over a fresh install on a M.2 Sata SSD....

Here's my setup:
- Raspi 4B, 3A power supply
- HassOS currently running on SD card
- An M.2 Sata 240Gb SSD
- 2 different external USB 3 M.2 external cases for tests. 
- Latest HassOS install (10.1) and 2023.5. (also tried in 2023.4.x). 
- SSD boot sequence made via Raspi Imager: Done. 

My issue is I cannot restore any backup previously made on the SSD, with or without encryption (aka password protected). 

a fresh HA install on the SSD works every time, But as I attempt to restore a previous backup, nothing happens but some few activity LEDs blinking from time to time, even after a few hours...

What I've tried so far:
- fresh install on the SSD with Raspi imager
- Runs it ony Raspi 4 : works. I can provide my credentials then land on the dashboard. 
- Then try a full restore via the system tab:: Fails every time.

I got a few questions about the usability of the Aqara FP2, and this is my honest answer after testing it for almost one week.

&#x200B;

So, where do I start now? Prior to that, the Aqara FP2 can be used offline. You just need to set it up once with the Aqara app. After that, you can restrict it from your router to access the internet and integrate it later via HomeKit controller to your home assistant. I have bought a few FP2s now and mostly placed or hid them in the ceiling because most of the rooms I go to are not that big that I need zones. However, for those rooms (e.g., bathroom, office, bedroom), the Aqara FP2 works pretty well with no issues so far. The downside is that there are no specific configurable zones, such as when you move on the right or left side of the room, or you can't even mark anything on the map of the Aqara app. I wish there would be a detection just for entrance or leaving zones. At this point, there are no real issues here, and lamps on and off schedule work pretty well, even when you are staying still.

&#x200B;

Now, here is the downside: 

&#x200B;

Mounted: Wall 

Room: Living room 

&#x200B;

In my previous post (see above), I set up different zones for my living room, especially to coordinate specific routines (e.g., sitting at the dining table will turn on the lights from that table) and also what happens when, for example, my wife is sitting at the table and I am watching TV. I can even control my TV behavior like stopping when someone is leaving the couch and the next place on the couch is occupied. At first glance, it worked pretty well, but after a while, the automation messed up, especially when my cats moved more than expected in my living room.

&#x200B;

What I also mentioned was that sitting far away from the sensor (5 meters and upwards), the zone detection does not work well, especially when you sit/stand still for a few minutes (10 minutes or so). In my setup, the recognition of my couch zones is not that precise, so some of my couch automation (like leaving the couch will stop playing my Apple TV when I watch movies or so) often falsely triggers those automations. I was pretty sure that sitting next to the sensor, like my dining table, wouldn't have some false triggering since the detection should be clear because the dining table is like 1-3 meters away from the sensor. However, this is also wrong. When you are sitting still and not moving for a few minutes, or someone approaches next to you and leaves, the sensor thinks (or operates) so that your detection goes over to the person, or sometimes you just disappear from the detection. Imagine sitting at the table after sunset, and someone approaches you and leaves the room, leading you to sit in the darkness again.

&#x200B;

After all, I see no difference between my FP1 and FP2, which operates in the same way. Also, the response time is pretty much the same for the ""Presence\_event"" of my FP1.  
I thought the WIFI Version will increase the Bandwidth and make the Presence Zone Detection better, but I can't really see a difference to my Zigbee FP2 (with ""Presence\_event"").

I am not sure, how the EPS1 acts in terms of ""being present"" for a long time, but my FP1 and Motion Sensor T1 works pretty flawless even better then the FP2.

&#x200B;

Also, for your information, I always use a power bank first to position the FP2s in the correct place, as I did with the FP1s. It helped me a lot to get the right detection for the specific room.

&#x200B;

The 2 bulbs I have are turning themselves on once each morning, but not at the same time (i.e today 1 turned on at 08:37 whereas yesterday the same light turned on at 07:56). Each bulb also turns on at a different time.

As far as I can see the call isn't coming from HA as the logbook just shows ""\[light name\] turned on"" and I don't have any automations running when the problem occurs.The bulbs are both connected to HA via ZHA using the Sonoff USB Coordinator and I don't have any ikea remotes that I've seen have caused similar problems for others.

The only slightly unusual thing about my setup is that the lights in question are wired to Sonoff mini relays behind the light switches. When wiring the relays up I put the live wire going to the bulb into the same connector as the ""live in"" so that the bulb would always have power and I then use an automation to toggle the bulb state when the light switch changes state. HA doesn't show anything happening with the switch so I don't believe this should cause the issue.

I know these bulbs default to on when there is a power cut, but both bulbs seem to turn on at different times, and also I have a UPS on a server at home which isn't showing any power anomalies so I don't think the power is cutting out. Also, both bulbs are on different lighting circuits.

Essentially, this is what I did: [https://smarthomescene.com/guides/how-to-install-home-assistant-on-proxmox-the-easy-way/](https://smarthomescene.com/guides/how-to-install-home-assistant-on-proxmox-the-easy-way/)

So, VM loads up, I get to the point where it displays the Home Assistant's IP address and port number. So, I go to that address, and it instructs me to wait \~20 minutes.

So I wait, and all is well so far after I come back \~20 minutes later, and I am prompted to create an account. 

So I follow through the prompts...

Right after it asks me about data collection / transmission (send error reports or not, etc.) and I click Next, I get this:

So, I figure, well, better wait for it to finish doing whatever it's doing.

So I wait... and wait some more... 5 hours later, still at this screen.

Tried refreshing... I get the login screen, which accepts the login credentials I created in the first step of the wizard.

But then right back to that screen which just shows ""Home Assistant"" at the top.

I wait a few more hours... no change. 

Tried loading up in a different browser... nope, same thing.

&#x200B;

Here's what the VM's display shows:

Now, I just got the ESPHome ESP32 Bluetooth Proxy up and running, and the devices all showed up after a couple of minutes, and I was prompted to install the ThermoPro integration, and all 4 were added to HA with only one issue: I have no idea which one is which!

Short of placing each one, individually, outside in the sun, and checking the readings, is there any sensible way to identify which device is which? I'll resort to that if I have to, but it seems like I must be missing something obvious.

I'm currently trying to set up HA in docker with Authelia SSO. Everything is directed on SWAG, and with its NGINX, it is routed. I'm using this setup since I have multiple containers in docker that do not have authentication, and I want to do SSO for all of them. So far, I have it all running, but I need help using the mobile HA app. I believe that my issue is with SSL certificates generated by Let's Encrypt.

Here are the relevant parts from my docker file in this paste bin. [https://pastebin.com/8iQpg3kP](https://pastebin.com/8iQpg3kP)

My Authelia config is configured so it can handle the app. The Authelia leaves bypassed the default domain, and then all subdomains need to be verified by Authelia service except the app (which is dumb, but I think that it is the only current workaround)

    access_control:
      default_policy: deny
      rules:
        - domain:
          - alsyko.duckdns.org
          policy: bypass
        - domain:
          - ""*.alsyko.duckdns.org""
          policy: one_factor
        - domain: ""homeassistant.duckdns.org""
          policy: bypass
          resources:
            - ""^/api.*""
            - ""^/auth/token.*""
            - ""^/.external_auth=.""
            - ""^/service_worker.js""
            - ""^/static.*""
            - ""^/local.*""
            - ""^/hacsfiles.*""
            - ""^/frontend_latest.*""

When I try to log in with the app, it will log in after it says that the mobile authentication is not enabled and proceeds to the dashboard.

\* http//ha.domain.duckdns.org:8123 - I need to use this URL.

Can I somehow use Authelia for verification? How do I fix SSL so I can log in with HTTPS instead of HTTP? In the ideal scenario, I would remove HA authentication and use Authelia for mobile and web. Is it possible?

Also, I wanted to ask how I can make Authelia protect \`localhost:8123\`/IP. Currently, it just directs to a home assistant or any other docker container."	2	"[""alex3305: AFAIK this is currently not really possible. What you really want is that Home Assistant can act like a OAuth2/OpenID Connect client, but that is simply not implemented. Home Assistant only acts like a OAuth2 server, which you don't want.\n\nHowever, what you could do is [skip authentication](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/providers/#skip-login-page-examples), but than you are unable to utilize users in Home Assistant. Another option is to create something to use the [Command Line Authentication Provider](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/providers/#command-line) but IMHO that's a real hassle to get working with OAuth2.\n\nHaving those exceptions you've listed is IMHO pretty dumb too. It just defeats the purpose of having another authentication layer. \n\nI would love to see that Home Assistant has a separate authentication and security layer instead of being built-in. That would IMHO even be more secure, because it can be updated independently, just like Supervisor.

Love it. Now I've just gotten my hands on another server and am looking to build another Proxmox server and  set up a cluster for high availability, fun, etc.

All of my devices connect either via wifi or my Zooz 800 USB stick through Z-Wave JS. Is there a way for both of those Proxmox servers to be able to access that USB stick, in case one of them goes down either for repairs/upgrades or any other reasons? I'm looking at some USB-over-ethernet extenders, and the ones I'm seeing that aren't over $100 say they support only USB 1/1.1 speeds. I'm also not 100% sure how Proxmox would handle a USB device that it accessed over IP, though it would allow multiple devices to connect to it.

Running a mosquitto server is something I've considered, running Zwave via mqtt, but the problem is kinda still the same. Either I run that off a completely different box (frankly, introducing another something that needs updating and attention), or my mqtt servers are also running on the Proxmox boxes which presents the exact same issues.

With only two servers, when one goes down or is disconnected from the LAN the other will have no way to know if it is the problem or if the other server is so it will refuse to perform any operations.', 'username_taken0001: As other mentioned, running only two proxmox nodes is not going to work (on default settings disabling one node is going to disable another too, because there will be no quorum). You can force the querum to work, basically disabling it, but it is also going to break the High Availability. I think a better solution, with two server,s will be to run the home assistance on one server, and the use the second one for backups. Backup it regularly on the other server running proxmox along with the proxmox backaup server. That way when your first servers fails, you should be able to manually start another instance from the backup.

1683153090.0	03-May-2023 15:31:30	Exploring Fire Tablet Sensor Options: Fully Kiosk Browser vs. Amazon App Store vs. Google Play Store	uuberr	5	1371su0	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1371su0/exploring_fire_tablet_sensor_options_fully_kiosk/	"Hey All,

I recently conducted an experiment to compare the different sensor options and capabilities available when using a Fire Tablet with Home Assistant. For reference, my HASS install is on a Synology NAS using the VM Supervisor option. I tested three different installation methods/access points to display it on our wall panel:

1. Fully Kiosk Browser
2. Home Assistant (HASS) App from Amazon App Store
3. Home Assistant (HASS) App from Google Play Store (Requires jailbreaking Fire Tablet)

Here's a summary of my findings:

**Fully Kiosk Browser** provides the least number of sensor options, but it offers excellent control for managing the device when running in kiosk mode. With this option, you can control screen brightness, screensaver settings, device orientation, and remotely send commands to the browser. It also includes sensors related to battery status, memory, and internal storage; and is the **only option** that offers motion detection and local capture of both audio and video through the device. However, it lacks many of the sensors related to audio, Bluetooth, location, notifications, and device settings that the other two options provide. I also found the fully\_kiosk.load\_url to be much clunkier than the notify.mobile\_app option of changing screens; the former requires a full UI reload that displays the logo and the navigation elements until the page fully loads.

Some of the unique service calls available through the Fully Kiosk Browser include:

* Bring the browser to the foreground
* Load the start URL
* Send the browser to the background
* Restart the browser
* Reboot the device

**HASS App from Amazon App Store** offers a middle-of-the-road option in terms of available sensors. It provides a similar set of sensors as the Google Play Store version, covering aspects such as audio, Bluetooth, device settings, and network status. However, due to Amazon's restrictions or modifications, some location-related sensors like ""sensor.kiosk\_goog\_geocoded\_location,"" ""binary\_sensor.kiosk\_goog\_android\_auto,"" and ""sensor.kiosk\_goog\_detected\_activity"" are not available in this version.

Both the Amazon App Store and Google Play Store versions of the HASS App offer similar service calls, which primarily focus on device settings and sensor updates. Some of these include:

* Setting the screen brightness
* Setting the screen off timeout
* Setting the volume level for various audio channels
* Updating the sensor values

**HASS App from Google Play Store** provides the most comprehensive list of sensors and controls. It includes sensors related to audio, Bluetooth, location, notifications, and device settings, along with extensive information about device status, battery health, storage, network, and Wi-Fi. This option offers the greatest amount of detail and control over the Fire Tablet by leveraging the companion app's [notification commands](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/notification-commands/) (also available to the Amazon version). However, to access the Google Play Store version, you will need to perform some [workarounds](https://www.howtogeek.com/232726/how-to-install-the-google-play-store-on-your-amazon-fire-tablet/) or otherwise jailbreak your Fire Tablet to bypass Amazon's restrictions.

**So, which one wins?!**

If you're looking for one app to rule them all, the Google Play Store version of the HASS app offers the most sensor options and detailed information. However, if your aim is to achieve maximum control over your device, then a combination of the Google Play Store app and Fully Kiosk truly gives you everything. FWIW this is where I'm headed, and I haven't yet decided which will serve as my primary screen and which will be running in the background. In any case, combining the Fully Kiosk Browser and the HASS App from the Google Play Store will provide a solid foundation for controlling various aspects of the device. 

**What are others using?** Have you experimented with more than one of these apps? Check out my screenshots of the different sensors each option provides, and chime in if you have any questions or different perspective on the topic!"	3	"['tarzan_nojane: WallPanel app for Android by [TheTimeWalker](https://github.com/TheTimeWalker/wallpanel-android)', 'uuberr: What would you say are the primary benefits of WallPanel over FullyKiosk?

If you're like me and thought the ""[world's most private voice assistant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YJzLIMrnGk)"" announcement was super cool, but want to use a VoIP phone instead of an analog phone, here's how to set everything up. This guide discusses the HA Asterisk configuration steps, but does not cover how to configure your specific VoIP phone or the new HA assist settings.

I'm brand new to VoIP and Asterisk; This guide is designed to help other newbies.

​

Prerequisites: Your phone must support SIP and the OPUS codec.

​

**Step 1:**

Install and set up Asterisk following [this tutorial](https://tech7fox.github.io/sip-hass-docs/docs/tutorial/add-on) (only the linked page, subsequent steps not required).

**Step 2:**

Navigate to /config/asterisk/custom in your file manager and create a file called `pjsip_custom.conf`.

This creates the ""user entry"" for your phone. Stolen form [this tutorial page](https://tech7fox.github.io/sip-hass-docs/docs/add-on/guides/doorbell). The `assist` entry sets the assist endpoint settings and will be used in the next step.

In `pjsip_custom.conf`, include the following...

    [1000]
    type = endpoint
    context = default
    disallow = all
    allow = opus,alaw,ulaw    ; Audio codecs
    allow=h264                 ; Video codecs
    direct_media_method=invite
    dtmf_mode=info
    callerid=""VoIP Phone"" <1000>
    force_rport=no
    aors= 1000
    auth = auth1000
    
    [1000]
    type = aor
    max_contacts = 1
    
    [auth1000]
    type=auth
    auth_type=userpass
    password=mypassword        ; Set your password here
    username=1000
    
    [assist]
    type=endpoint
    allow=!all,opus
    direct_media=no

Note: ensure you set a password. The default is ""mypassword"" which is also fine. This will make your VoIP phone's extension ""1000"".

**Step 3:**

Navigate to /config/asterisk/custom in your file manager and create a file called `extensions.conf`.

This is the add-on's stock `extensions.conf` file with one line added. The line tells Asterisk to route extension 1001 to a SIP server with IP ([192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1) in example) at port (5065 in example) with a 20 second timeout.

In `extensions.conf`, include the following...

    ; Note: this file has been modified from the Asterisk defaults for the add-on
    
    [general]
    static=yes
    
    [default]
    include => parkedcalls
    ;
    exten => 444,1,Park(,s)
    ;
    exten => 555,1,ParkedCall(default,701)
    ;
    exten => 1001,1,Dial(PJSIP/assist/sip:192.168.1.1:5065,20)    ; TODO replace IP:port
    ;
    exten => _X!,1,Dial(${PJSIP_DIAL_CONTACTS(${EXTEN})})
    ;
    ;extension for dialing chan_sip devices.
    ;exten => _X!,1,Dial(SIP/${EXTEN})
    
    [parkedcallstimeout]
    exten => s,1,Hangup()

Note: replace the IP address on the line `exten => 1001,1,Dial(PJSIP/assist/sip:192.168.1.1:5065,20)` with your HA IP. The HA VoIP integration by default uses port 5060 which is used by Asterisk, so ensure when you set it up you change the port. I've set mine as 5065.

**Step 4:**

Configure your VoIP phone. Use your HA IP as the SIP server address along with the username (default in example: 1000) and password (default: mypassword). See. your phone's config info on how to set this up.

**Step 5:**

Ensure you've set up Whisper and Piper, created a voice assistant in settings ([tutorial video from Smart Home Junkie](https://youtu.be/nh3jnPGAtMI?t=204)),  and configure the VoIP integration (with appropriate port).

​

Done! You should now be able to make calls from a VoIP phone through Asterisk to Assist by dialing extension 1001.

I was originally thinking about installing HA OS on a Nuk, but now I'm wondering if it would be better to use a spare laptop. I have an old Asus N73JQ laptop, which has an i7, Nvidia GPU, 12GB ram (DDR3 i think), and 2 SSDs. It still runs perfectly and is pretty quick.

I also just got a laptop from my parents. It was my aunt's, who passed away this summer. It is an HP Stream 14 with Celeron, 4GB DDR4, integrated UHD graphics, and 80GB SSD or nvme. 

Despite being about 10 years newer, the HP seems to be well under-spec'd compared to the Asus. Do I really need the Asus specs for a dedicated HA machine? Probably not. However, the Asus has an Ethernet port, while the HP does not. The HP only has usb-a & hdmi ports.  So Im thinking the HP is not a great option. But what about just buying a Nuk instead of using the Asus? I'm inclined to run HA OS in a VM no matter which device I choose, because I like the snapshots and versatility of using VMs. Not sure if that's practical on a Nuk.

Thoughts?"	13	"['dudenell: The hp stream 14 might be okay, best way to find out is to try it.', 't3as: It will be a device running 24/7 and if it\'s ""only"" running HAOS (and no other services requiring specific hardware, like PLEX), I\'d look for the cheapest and most power efficient device.\n\nThe Asus specs I found say it runs between 30W (idle) and 170W (full). A simple NUC can run at 10-30W. While a laptop can run Home Assistant without a problem, it is not designed to run 24/7.\n\nI run HAOS in a VM on a Synology NAS. Without any problems.', ""hirscheyyaltern: You don't need a lot to run home assistant. I would recommend giving the device a shot, worse comes to worst take it back up and switch devices. The backups are seamless when we're restoring to another device"", ""rfehr613: Yeah it's just the lack of Ethernet that i really don't like. I'd much rather have it hard wired."", ""rfehr613: Fair point about the laptop not being designed to run 24/7. It's a pretty beastly laptop, and cooling could be better on it. I cleaned the board and GPU fan not too long ago, but still.\n\nGenerally speaking power consumption isn't a concern of mine. My desktop also serves as a Plex server and surveillance server. It has 6 HDDs, 4 SSDs, and 1 nvme, on top of 12 case fans, an i7-8700, and a 2060KO. I'm not sure exactly what it's pulling, but i use a 850W power supply lol. Point is, 30W is a drop in the bucket compared to that.\n\nI was leaning more towards a Nuk or other mini computer anyway. I just hate not having a good use for these laptops."", 'rfehr613: Give which device a shot?', ""dudenell: There are USB to Ethernet adapters, I've used them in the past for basic network troubleshooting, but I don't see why it couldn't work."", ""t3as: Since your desktop runs a plex and surveillance server anyways (so i guess it's always on), why not run Home Assistant on it as well?"", ""hirscheyyaltern: Whichever you find more convenient. Home assistant doesn't take much in terms of power to run. You can always switch easily if a device isn't to your liking for some reason, so whichever device is easiest to use itun or makes the most sense to you, just set it up and run it on there and if you decide you want to switch to something else, it really is effortless to do. There's no sort of hard commitment to any specific machine"", 'rfehr613: I feel like that would create a lot of latency and connectivity issues', ""rfehr613: I mean i could, but i don't like having everything in one place. If my PC goes down or i need to take it out of service for a bit, then my home automation is also out of service.  And I intend on using some sensors to control HVAC components in HA, which makes the HA critical. Plex and surveillance aren't as critical. Plus, I'm basically forced to run Plex and home surveillance on my PC.  Due to my requirements for software and data redundancy, I'm currently stuck running both systems on windows.  So I don't have a choice with those two, unless I built individual servers for each, but that's a lot of money.  \n\nThe server (and I use that term loosely) was originally built to be only a surveillance server, so it's built around the i7-8700 for video processing using Quick sync.  I do plan to switch my surveillance over to DW Spectrum, which doesn't rely so heavily on QS and can be run in Linux or many other OSes, but I haven't had the chance to do this yet. \n\nI just kinda happened upon Plex one day and decided to start using it. Now I have 3 12TB WDGold Helium HDDs in raid 5 using Snapraid for all my movies, TV shows, wedding videos, audio books, etc.  I don't like the data risks associated with hardware raid or most standalone NAS like Synology."", 'dudenell: Sounds like you have your mind made up :)', ""rfehr613: I mean, I'm unlikely to want to use the HP now after finding out it has no Ethernet port. It would need to be a pretty convincing argument to use it, so i didn't want to completely shut the door on that. The whole reason i want the Ethernet port is reliability and low latency, so obviously an Ethernet workaround that might not let me achieve that is going to be an issue.\n\nThere's still the Nuk vs Asus. There were 3 devices mentioned in the OP. I really have no good use for either laptop besides occasional mobile troubleshooting or if i don't feel like sitting at my desk for some reason. This HP seems pretty laggy though now that I've been using it. It seems to struggle just handing navigating Windows 11.""]"

What's the URL path to use for snapshots for Firestick notifications? And a few other Frigate questions...	TrousersCalledDave	1	136x57p	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/136x57p/running_frigate_in_docker_successfully_linked/	"From a tutorial to send snapshots to Telegram, they use the following URL:

 'http://ccab4aaf-frigate:5000/api/events/{{trigger.payload\_json\[""after""\]\[""id""\]}}/thumbnail.jpg' 

but mentions that it should work for the Frigate addon, but I'm running Frigate in Docker and this doesn't appear to work for me.

The tutorial says I should be using the MQTT platform with the frigate/events topic for my trigger. Is there any difference in using this and using a Node Red Events state as the trigger instead and running the actions in a script? Presumably both still fire the same MQTT event, it's just that the automation requires only one placeholder whereas I'd have to set up a node for every camera and object entity in Node Red and connect them all to the same script call\_service. Is that right?

Anyway, back to the main question...

The official Frigate documentation just states that:  Frigate can save a snapshot image to 

    /media/frigate/clips

for each event named as 

    <camera>-<id>.jpg

but doesn't provide any example and I have no idea what I'm supposed to modify to point the URL to the correct image.

A third point of confusion is that my Frigate media is now showing in my Home Assistant media folder. So should I be pointing towards my HA server media and let it figure out the path, or point towards my Frigate server? Additionally, will HA now try and back up the media from Frigate to my HA install?

Another question I have is about the Frigate object motion entitles created in Home Assistant, specifically people. For example, I have:

`binary_sensor.porch_motion` with just the title ""Motion"" next to it. The icon is a stick man with a line through it and a PIR overhead. 

I also have `binary_sensor.porch_person_occupancy` with a house icon and the title ""person occupancy"".

I'm assuming that `binary_sensor.porch_motion` is just to show ANY motion detected (despite the confusing stick man icon), whereas `binary_sensor.porch_person_occupancy` will only show on when a person is in frame. So I should use the person occupancy entity to trigger automations for human motion? Is that right? 

Thanks.

Tl;dr - Frigate is in Docker, what URL path do I use to display a Frigate snapshot in a Firestick notification? 

Frigate media shows in my HA media folder now. When I back up, will it try and back this up even though it's hosted on my separate Docker server? 

Should I use `binary_sensor.porch_motion` or `binary_sensor.porch_person_occupancy` to trigger a human motion event in the porch?"	2	"['nickm_27: > From a tutorial to send snapshots to Telegram, they use the following URL:\n>\n> \'http://ccab4aaf-frigate:5000/api/events/{{trigger.payload_json[""after""][""id""]}}/thumbnail.jpg\'\n>\n> but mentions that it should work for the Frigate addon, but I\'m running Frigate in Docker and this doesn\'t appear to work for me.\n\nyou need to use your ip address for the device running frigate instead of the hostname (which only works in the addon)\n\n> A third point of confusion is that my Frigate media is now showing in my Home Assistant media folder.

I currently use HomeKit and Homebridge. I use Homebridge mainly for a couple of dummy switches. 

I can’t completely switch to Home Assistant because I have a Level lock+ with Home Key support. It’s a favorite feature amongst the family too. 

I have a homebridge dummy switch to switch when someone arrives home to unlock the door (the level Auto Unlock implementation is awful compared to August). 

How might I be able to add the same feature with home assistant? I struggle because I can’t add the lock to home assistant at least without losing the nfc key"	3	['peterxian: I have a HomeKit lock that I’ve chosen to leave in HomeKit. I created a “helper” ([Input Boolean](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/input_boolean/)) in home assistant which is bridged to HomeKit and toggled by HomeKit automations when the lock opens and closes, so HA knows the state of the lock, even though it can’t control it. I suppose I could go further and use device triggers to kick off shortcut automations if I wanted HA to open/close the lock, but so far I haven’t needed that because we mostly use Siri to unlock with our Apple Watches and it is very responsive, and I’m actually glad HA being online isn’t critical to getting into my home.', 'okayzac: This is exactly what I need.

With LTS there is even more room to move fast and break things if LTS is the recommended version!  \n\n\nUltimately, NC are a for-profit company: we're providing market share and a captive audience for them to market their hardware to - OSS is a mechanism for them to get free development time and rapidly grow an audience by offering their product for free... it's a loss leader, freemium, whatever you wanna call it. However, I'm also not so cynical to believe that these are the only reason they chose an OSS model). The generous way to look at it is that this is a symbiotic relationship, we're not passive bystanders by the very nature of OSS.  \n\n\nSo the problem isn't OSS or whether I am allowed expectations, it's HA under-valuing or under-estimating their user's time and patience and rather focusing on building out features they can sell to us (like the aforementioned smart speaker that they're obviously building by laying this groundwork).  \n\n\nBut give it a year or to when you're using their smart speaker and they drop some breaking change which blows up your critical pipelines (e.g ZHA & Skyconnect shitting the bed) and then you'll understand that stability needs a higher priority and LTS is necessary.  \n\n\n\\> it will mean more effort on their part to maintain two type of releases when they want to press forward faster with more iterative development.  \n\n\nYes, but that is limited downside for them (maintain a known codebase across 1 extra branch). Their habit of knowingly or unknowingly releasing breaking changes together with security & stability releases has (effectively) unlimited downside on the user's side since the effort end users must put in to deal with mitigating these breaking changes scales across their user base, and that user base is growing.  \n\n\nLeaving us all to deal with instability and security issues is disrespectful and undermines their relationship everytime a user gets burned (which over time will increase as the project increases in complexity and also as the user base grows in size and uptime).  \n\n\n\\> Triggering lights on and off is the problem though? They don't need the lights on and it's a waste of power over time (yes I'm picky about this these days!).  \n\n\nFor me, I don't care - the lights stay on for a few more minutes each time motion is detected. My lights also only come on when needed (i.e if ambient lighting is low enough) and on a night they are very very dim so energy usage is negligible.  \n\n\n\\> There are simple things like having my tv switch to Plex and open up my feed based on commands, that saves me finding the remote from where I'm sitting which is just one of the better uses of voice.  \n\n\nFair enough, but if you don't want to find the remote you need to do the whole thing by voice. In my experience, voice can be quite mentally taxing, especially when the wrong command is issued, the device doesn't hear you etc.  \n\n\nI use a bit of voice in my system via Siri & HomePods - most complex thing I do is turn the TV on (which happens in HomeKit anyway), everything else is sensor driven with a couple of virtual devices for overriding things like current light brightness, turning on smart switches or disabling all automations in a room - all these are handled on device or via physical buttons in the room to which they apply."", 'joke-complainer: Ah I missed that, thank you!']"

The problem is that it seems random at what brightness they turn on.  Sometimes it is 100%, other times it may be 10%.  Is there a way in home assistant (i'm sure there is and I am just too much a noob).  To make sure that lights come back on at 100% when using the wall switch.  To add a bit more complexity, can it just resume its previous setting when triggered from wall switch?

For reference I am using Innr Zigbee Smart Bulb Smart Flood Light White BR30.

A more realistic reason is that sometimes I have people come into my house that don't know about home assistant (pet sitter, pest control, cleaner, etc.), and they are always using wall switches.  I want to make sure that the house lights up appropriately when they need to turn them on.  But also...the coffee thing is real!

I have my HA installed on a Raspberry Pi 4 using HA OS.  It's connected directly to my router via ethernet cable.  My ""about"" shows Home Assistant 2023.4.6, Supervisor 2023.04.1, Operating System 10.1,  Frontend 20230411.1 - latest.

When everything is up and running, it's great.  I have access to all of my integrations over various dashboards, I have some automations going, some Tasker interactions, I have it running through duckdns, so the mobile app works through there and my home laptop works through [https://homeassistant:8123](https://homeassistant:8123);  all is well.  Then, after some hours, it will just die on me.

Here's what it turns into.  On my dashboards, I have an entry for myself, correctly showing as Home.  My schedules using the custom scheduler card still show.  No other entities are working.  My car integration, the default weather entity, and all of my climate controls show as unavailable.  History and Logbook try to load (showing the parameters to search at the top of the page) but just spin a blue loading circle.  File editor and Terminal show an error ""Unable to load the panel source: /api/hassio/app/entrypoint.js.""  Media shows sources but won't load or play anything.

In Developer Tools, Check configuration says it can't find my config file, but when things are working, it shows my config is fine and allows me to restart at will.  When it's broken, I can only get things back by pulling the plug (remotely, through a wifi outlet), which I hate to do.

Those are the broad strokes.  What finer details can I provide to help troubleshoot?  When it's like this, rebooting my router doesn't help, nor does disabling Pi-hole (running on a different machine).  With some things working and some not, it seems like a supervisor issue or a screwy configuration somewhere.  Any help or guidance is greatly appreciated.

I've successfully configured Prometheus and Grafana. The only problem is that all of my temperature data is reported as Celsius when I've configured the unit as Fahrenheit...any idea about how to change this?

EDIT: So, to achieve this, I think I'd need to do some sort of a rewrite rule in Prometheus -- which seems way too involved for something so simple. I just ended up converting the value in Grafana (multiplied by 1.8 then added 32). I'm sort of disappointed with Prometheus so far.

ReallyNotMichaelsMom	2	136bgni	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/136bgni/ha_yellow_is_unreachable_and_not_working_any/	"TL;DR: So, my HA Yellow isn't running any automations. When I try to log in through my computer, it just says it's unreachable.

Here's what I've done:

I've rebooted the router and HA, and I'm now able to ping HA. (I wasn't able to ping it before.)

I closed my browser and tried to reopen it. It says the site can't be reached and that ""homeassistant.local refused to connect"". 

I switched to a different browser, same thing. I'm unable to connect through Nabu Casa. It just says ""Connection failed: No response from instance""

Then I figured I'd just do a factory reset and restore from my backup earlier today. 

I did the factory reset (unplug the power, plug back in, push the red reset button with a paper clip until the yellow led flashes and wait). It's still not available so I can't install from back up. 

I can see it on my router interface, and it still has the correct IP address.

My son manfully resisted the chance to say, ""Gee, if only we had something like a switch that we could use to turn on the lights."" (I did thank him for not saying it :)

My cats are swarming over me, because they know I'm stressed, but they don't believe me when I tell them they are NOT helping.

Instantly hooked.
 
So I made a monitor that will go read the NASA data feed every 15 minutes (its updated every 1 minute but I figured 15 minutes is fine enough for an alert that a solar flare is hitting the magnetosphere) and rigged it up to announce on my alexa devices.
 
First, a cron job that runs every 15 minutes. Simple python code, probably sloppy AF but here it is:
 
    import urllib.request, json, requests
    with urllib.request.urlopen('https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/json/planetary_k_index_1m.json') as url:
            data=json.load(url)
            index=data[-1]['kp_index']
            level=data[-1]['estimated_kp']
            postData={'index':index, 'level':level}
            response=requests.post('http://192.168.1.200:8123/api/webhook/MYWEBHOOKID', json=postData)
            print(str(level))

So this hits the webhook every time it checks, theres a condition in the automation that decides when the index is high enough. Full YAML for the integration:
 
    alias: Auroral Activity
    description: """"
    trigger:
      - platform: webhook
        webhook_id: ""MYWEBHOOKID""
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: ""{{ trigger.json.level > 6 }}""
        enabled: true
    action:
      - parallel:
          - service: notify.alexa_media_rob_s_echo_dot
            data:
              message: Auroral Activity Alert, KP index is at {{ trigger.json.index }}
          - service: notify.alexa_media_rob_s_2nd_echo_dot
            data:
              message: Auroral Activity Alert, KP index is at {{ trigger.json.index }}
    mode: single
    
This will make my devices both announce that Auroras are goin on & how strong they are.

Where I am at, KP index being above 6 means its time to get outside and watch. You can adjust for your latitude and expected strength requirements. The index last week hit 8, so it was a show for sure."	4	"['Personal_Track_3780: I hate to say it after you have gone to all this trouble, but there is a HA integration for Aurora status.\n\nhttps://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/aurora/', 'corptech: Cool idea thanks.

Increase the timeout: In Home Assistant, you can try increasing the stream\\_timeout  \n parameter in your configuration.yaml file under the camera  \n component.

They would always capture the state of my Hue groups (or other Zigbee group) and would tell those groups to restore their state. This meant that if any light in the group was on, Home Assistant would turn the group on, causing all the lights in the group to turn on. Similarly, groups in which several lights had different colors were non-functional because the group itself would be resumed with a particular color.

I've solved this by changing `snapshot_entities` in my `scene.create` call to use this template:

```
{{
    expand(states.light)
    |rejectattr('attributes.is_hue_group')
    |selectattr('state', 'eq', 'on')
    |selectattr('entity_id', 'in', area_entities('Living Room'))
    |map(attribute='entity_id')
    |join( ',' )
}}
```
(for snapshotting the `Living Room` lights)

Now it works great! Hopefully this helps one of y'all."	0	[]

Having it already pre-wired is probably helpful too."", 'thatandyinhumboldt: I have a couple of thoughts on this:\n- my main concern is using this for medical purposes. Home Assistant/ESPhome is robust as far as bleeding-edge programming projects go, but not for critical services and _definitely_ not for medical devices. That\'s going to leave you on the hook for fixing whenever something goes wrong, and can also open you up to a world of HIPAA violations.\n- attempting to intercept the scale\'s Bluetooth data might work, but it is likely to be encrypted and not accessible in this way. Also, if you\'re only using the ESP for its Bluetooth radio, it might be easier to bypass ESPhome entirely and use the raspberry Pi\'s Bluetooth\n\nI feel like I\'m coming down on your idea pretty hard, but your goals feel a bit like ""I have a hammer so this looks like a nail"". I super encourage you to do projects like this because it moves your skills and the community forward, but you should be doing it for your own purposes--enterprise-grade devices require enterprise-grade testing and enterprise-grade support, and medical devices are several levels past that.', 'galian99:  First of all, I want to thank you for being so honest with me and  telling me straight up what you think. I understand that there are  multiple issues when it comes to using private medical data with  HomeAssistant since they violate several privacy laws, BUT this is  nothing more than a ""model"" or the beginning of a project. I would like  to be able to automate a process and save work for nurses or healthcare  personnel, and I know that we have to start somewhere. \n\n The reason for using an ESP32 instead of the Raspberry\'s own Bluetooth  is that if the Raspberry needs to be used as a server, it may not be in  the same space and the range may not be enough. \n\n And finally, I really appreciate your honesty. No, I don\'t feel  attacked, not at all. I think when it comes to a project, one has to be  realistic and not ""bite off more than they can chew"" and with this, I  simply want to establish or start something that, if I ever manage to  develop, can simplify the work for many people or where many data points  have to be collected (like a nursing home). That\'s why I\'m  collaborating with the university, if it works, the model will be public  and a company can collaborate with us and continue with something even  bigger.']"

>The Shelly i4 is a device that essentially reads mechanical switches (the switch applies mains voltage to the input terminals) and then reacts on them, for instance by publishing to a certain topic. It can be used behind old-fashioned switches to control devices actually switched on and off by an actor/relay that subscribes to the topic.

I live in an old house, and wiring is complicated. Turns out, the i4 was perfect for my needs of letting me control two lights with physical switches, without the ability to actually run wiring between them.

So now I had two input terminals left over, and I thought I'd just hook them into the circuits of the other two switches at the same place, so that I can at least get a reading of whether those circuits are currently open or closed. Like this:

*Processing img 29ybrezavixa1...*

Turns out this kinda only works in some cases, but when your load is a LED or some sensitive device, you have a problem. This is because whereas we have a 230V mains here, SW4 in the diagram above will have about 120V potential over the N terminal, i.e. the Shelly i4 actually lets electricity pass from L to SW4 and the other SWx terminals too.

So don't wire your i4 into existing circuits like I tried.

Please feel free to crosspost this where appropriate."	0	[]

I'm looking for a lock that I can control with Home Assistant (of course I'm going to be making an elaborate way to open it by pulling out certain books) but I need a few things from it:

1. I don't really care how secure it is honestly. I don't \_need\_ to lock the room. It's more so for keeping it latched and having a fun way to unlatch it. So cheap or crappy is fine.
2. I would prefer to be able to latch it somehow similar to something like a fence gate or the like because I'd like to be able to have the latch exposed on the inside of the room, but a normal lock in the door casing if fine too if it complies with the next item in the list...
3. I need it to not have any hardware showing when the door is closed. I have a plan if I end up with no other choice by covering the lock face with a book, but I'd really prefer to have no easily visible hardware.
4. Most important, it needs to have a manual failsafe. If my power goes out, my Home Assistant instance is down, etc, I need to know there's a way to get in to my room even if it takes a little extra effort.
5. I'm open to any other ideas outside of this!

The combination of these components has been perfect for my needs, and I'm absolutely in love with my FP2s. However, I've noticed that they're not as effective in larger rooms that are over 15 square meters. While they do react when mounted on the wall in my 30 square meter living room, they sometimes forget to stay detected if I'm sitting without any movement at the far end of the room.

Anyway, I use it to pause or play a movie on my Apple TV whenever either my wife or I stand up. The system allows for individual light dimming on different zones, so if my wife is sitting at the table while I'm watching a movie, the appropriate lights can be adjusted accordingly. The system is incredibly fast and reliable, with one exception being when there is no movement for an extended period, such as when reading a book on the couch or sitting around 7 meters away from the FP2.

In my case, it was the dining table, and it kept detecting me even when I stood completely still for a long period of time, around 10 minutes or so.\n\nFor distances farther than 5 meters, it still works for detecting certain zones, but you need to move a little bit to stay detected (if you stand still for a couple of minutes). The best feature is that if you mount it on the wall and mark some zones as exits, it will automatically trigger the automation once you move in that direction. When multiple people are detected and someone goes to the exit zone, it will stay detected for those zones. For example, I have stairs leading down from my living room to the second level of my condo, and when I reach the stairs, it triggers an automation that turns on the lights downstairs for 10 seconds and turns off the lights in the living room when no one is occupying the room.\n\n\nEdit:\nI mounted it on the ceiling of my bedroom to enable the lights when my wife or I are heading to bed. The automation will get disabled once we disconnect our phones via Wi-Fi.

* [TP-Link Kasa](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/products/smart-switches)

But I keep seeing other Redditors mention [Shelly](https://www.shelly.cloud/en-us/products/switching-and-triggering#unfiltered) devices and I have some questions on how they work:

* Are they intended to work with ""existing"" light switches (dumb switches)?

It seems that no subscription is required and I only need to acquire an API key for setup.

What I have no found is if Home Assistant takes advantage of the features of the Premium edition, or differentiates at all between the versions. Does Ecobee report things like air quality and presence well in Home Assistant, or would I be better off just buying the Light version and separate presence and air quality sensors?

Of course, these features could be added later, so any experience on how responsive and cooperative Ecobee has been to the HA community would be helpful as well.

ALHeadshots	9	135wf2o	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/135wf2o/is_there_such_a_thing_as_a_yaml_code_helper_or/	"Pretty new to HA and YAML, and I'm sure this is all just adoption pain.

Adding some cards to a page, sometimes you want to add some things like an attribute to a card rather than just the entity itself. So you have to jump into the editor and start tweaking the code.

But the built-in YAML editor simply sucks. There is no code formatting at all. If the spacing is off, it just shows as broken. Sure, there's code colouring, but that's it.

Also, the aforementioned attributes. The entity hinting only hints at entities; it doesn't show you what attributes are available for an entity.

Some auto-code completion would also be nice to see. For example, as in the previous tasks, adding an attribute to an entities card, if I add `- type: attribute`, why doesn't the editor automatically add the correct structure with the required param? As I understand the docs, the attribute type requires both the entity ID and the attribute ID. So why not prepopulate that in the correct format and then give the code hint when typing both the entity name and the attribute name?!?!?!

    - type: attribute
    entity: sensor.samba_backup
    name: Backups On Local
    icon: mdi:lan
    attribute: backups_local

I have an existing Home Assistant setup and a zigbee 3.0 network indoors. I have two tiny bike sheds, one is 5 meters from front door, other along house wall behind the house.

I was thinking of ordering some battery-powered motion detectors that I could place under the roof of the sheds, as a first step, but I fear this may not be very practical.

I am worried on the one hand if I can get a reliable connection. Can I rely on zigbee outdoors in close proximity to my house, or should I aim for 433 mhz or wifi instead? The second issue I have is batteries. I would prefer a solution that does not require frequent battery changes, maybe something that can take lithium aa or aaa batteries is best? Zigbee is probably the most battery-efficent solution if it works?

Another possible issue I may face is false alarms. I think if there is more than a few false alarms a month I will probalby end up ignoring this sensors, so roaming cats could for instance be an issue.

Another idea I had is to hook the bike locks through some hardpoint in the bikeshed like a metal loop and find some way to message me if vibrations/handling is detected somehow?

Does anyone have any experience or advice?"	13	"[""Hefty-System2367: No issue with using zigbee outdoors, I use several Aqara sensors outside the house, just need to be sheltered from direct rainfall. Battery life is also not an issue, all Aqara sensors have multi-year battery life if you use good quality coin cells.  \nCats will definitely be an issue if you use a simple presence sensor, one of the newer mm wave radar sensors will be more reliable. Personally as I already have a Frigate setup I would put a cheap camera in the shed and use Frigate's object detection to trigger an alarm."", ""daern2: Bit of personal experience as I had some scrotes have a go at getting some (older) bikes out of the shed one night, but they were stopped and got nothing for their troubles. They actually came around the previous night and had a good look through the windows (picked up by CCTV) and I should have been aware that they would come back, but hadn't put two and two together on this.\n\nThey came in from the back of the garden to avoid the cameras and, over a period of 30 minutes, unscrewed all of the hinge screws on the shed door before carefully removing it from the shed. It was a proper, heavy door so wouldn't have been easily or quietly forced, but the screws were a significant weak spot. In removing the door, they tripped a magnetic door contact sensor (see below) and also the PIR inside the shed. They dashed inside to grab what they could, but the bikes were chained up round some 4x2 screwed to the frame of the shed, so they just legged it instead grabbing nothing but an old strimmer which was waiting to go to the tip, so they saved me a job :-)\n\nI've made a few changes now since then, but what would stop them now is:\n\n* Coachbolts through the hinges - no more unscrewing the door. They'd need to brute force it\n* Deadlock bolt on the other side, so a decent level of physical security\n* Door contact + PIR covering the inside, both part of the main house security\n* Valuable stuff is chained up, albeit through timber frames\n* Additional CCTV covering the rear entry point\n* Better quality object detection on cameras (Frigate) with very low false positives, so it can now wake me up reliably if needed\n\nNone of these things on their own would stop a determined thief, but together they form a reasonably (IMHO) uninviting target and I suspect they'd just go next door instead. Layered security is definitely the way to go - a mix of both physical and active security systems. e.g. the bikes should probably be fastened into concrete, but in reality, if you can scare them off with a lot of noise, they're not going to stay around long enough to even chop through some timber and it'll probably be good enough. The really valuable stuff is better protected anyway, so this is good enough.\n\nOn a technical level, everything is hard-wired for me. Yes, it's a pain, but long-term it's the way to go if you can possibly swing it. The whole lot is wired back into the main system so triggering the shed security will set off the main house system, waking everyone up and causing a lot of disturbance. It also turns all of the lights on outside so it would take a pretty brave scrote to stay put with all of that noise and light going on, especially knowing that there's a lot of cameras around too. I use standard PIRs and door contactors and have had no issues, although I have the sensitivity turned down and have made sure that all orifices are well sealed against spiders which can be a nightmare in sheds and garages - one spider in a PIR can wreak havoc! \n\nMy security system is also dedicated (i.e. not HA), so runs entirely independently of it, but is orchestrated by HA (e.g. set/unset/monitored). I like this way of doing things as I know it's far, far harder for someone to interfere with, and if HA goes down, the core security is still operational.\n\nCutting down false positives to zero (or very close to zero) is vital. If it's false triggering all of the time, it's no use to anyone as you'll never hear it go off at night as it'll be muted! How did they get into your bike sheds? If it's through a door, then this is an easy, low-tech way to monitor it and should be very reliable. You can add other monitors too (e.g. vibration) but I'd avoid anything detecting movement outside unless you are prepared to be getting woken by cats and foxes every night. Cameras + Frigate work well for this task, if it's an option."", ""generalambivalence: I use 433MHz sensors outdoors. I haven't set up my PIR motion sensors yet, but I've got contact sensors on my shed. I find the range is better than Zigbee without any need for routing devices.\n\nMy choice was mostly down to convenience though. I had unused 433MHz sensors from the previous owner's old security system so I just bought an SDR dongle.\n\nAs far as batteries, it's been two years since we bought this house and I didn't change the batteries in the contact sensors before I repurposed them. They are using A123 batteries."", 'wewefe: I am out in the sticks and my main concern is tweakers stealing shit at night. I have zigbee door sensors in a shed and a detached garage.  I also have magnetic driveway sensors at the end of my driveway by the road(amazon guy pre-alert) and behind the normal part of the driveway where no one other than I should ever be.  I am far enough from a road that no one is walking on foot.  Too much wild life for motion sensors. These are all tied into an HA based alarm and I use ""arm home""  at night.  \n\nMain issue I have is in the winter on the coldest nights the coin cell batteries drop out in the zigbee sensors. They work the 95% of the time. Long term I am either going to rewire them to use larger external batteries or switch to a different sensor.', 'the_bigheavy: You could use something like a Konnected panel in your shed, and then use ""real"" security detectors like magnetic contacts for doors, and higher quality PIR detectors, most of which have a ""pet mode"" and adjustable sensitivity to avoid your cat problem. If you get the right one I think Konneted works over ethernet or WiFi.\n\nThis also allows one point of power (using a Wall Wart of POE) to power all your sensors so no battery problems. This is what I use in my detached garage/workshop/gym/man cave. It also integrates well with Home Assistant and the Alamo integration lets you have virtual keypads, zones, etc.\n\nI\'d also suggest that robbers don\'t want to draw attention to themselves. Add a motion sensor floodlight or two near your shed, and put two ""piezo screamers"" in the shed. I think Honeywell used to make one that was like 140 dB and is nearly deafening in my man cave. A couple of those would send just about anyone running for cover.\n\nFor bonus automation points, when your shed alarm is triggered, turn on all the exterior lights, blast the screamers, and then turn on an interior light or two after like 8 seconds to simulate ""someone woke up and is coming outside"" even if you have no intention of doing so.\n\nAnd last of all, get good homeowners insurance and consider a separate bicycle policy or rider. Despite being a strong advocate of an individual right to self-defense and lover of bicycles, it\'s not worth engaging in a potentially violent interaction over a bicycle and I\'m usually surprised at how cheap insurance riders can be.', ""Teras80: Let me ask you this: What will you do if there is an alarm? Run out and face possibly multiple thieves? I am not saying you shouldn't or could not,  I am just asking whether you have thought about it.\n\nAs previous commenter rightly described, thieves have all the time on planning&testing and have very little time after they have broken into actual room. It takes considerably less time for them to grab something and run, then it takes for you to wake up, understand there is an alarm, put some clothes on (or maybe not), grab a bat and get outside.  \n\nSo, as long there is SOME indication that someone might be coming (like adding a motion/activated floodlight to both outside and inside your sheds), they will not spend time to unfasten/cut the bike locks inside the room and whether or not there is an actual alarm in often doesn't matter. Or whether it is integrated to HA :)\n\n1) increase physical security: add beefy hinges, metal strips over lock connecting points etc. If possible, add another internal door -- that will 99% stop their attempt\n\n2) add PIR floodlights outside\n\n3) add the simplest/most foolproof local door contact + siren. \n\n4) add ability to lock your best stuff internally in a way that is simple for you -- chain over the rack etc\n\n5) get insurance."", 'onewheeldrive1133: Why not use a door sensor?

Tripping the sensor should then trigger lights and a siren. \n\nIn addition I will add an area light that triggers by movement for the approach.  \n\nThe only thing I can think of to improve further is then if I could somehow check that my son has properly locked his bike in HA, but that might be tricky.']"

You will need to check which models of camera you have and whether they can be flashed, and then decide if the flashing instructions are something you are comfortable with.  \nI have successfully done this with Wyze cameras, but Xiaomi cameras are a different story.\n  \nThe unfortunate fact is that the easiest route (which many of us go through) is to buy more open hardware (in this case, cameras that support RTSP) so that the software side of things (Home Assistant/ Frigate or something like Blue iris) can provide a better experience than closed/ cloud proprietary software. Alternatively, just buy into a more reliable albeit closed ecosystem than the one that is currently failing to meet your needs.', ""The_Mdk: Well, HA + Frigate would work to detection motion and get a video of the event, as I'm using it"", 'JanyBatista: Thanks. Do you know any alternative?', 'kenkiller: Nice. So how did you managed to get xiaomi cameras into frigate? Very interested.', 'kenkiller: Nope. Mi cameras are pretty much a closed system. There are some alternate firmwares that enable rtsp support but not many models iirc.', 'PretendsHesPissed: Replace the cameras and get Shinobi.', ""The_Mdk: Ah, my bad, I didn't use the Xiaomi cams.. well, at least not a recent one, I have a Dafang with a modded firmware that works wonders despite the low video quality"", 'kenkiller: Damn.

AimanF	7	135dytc	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/135dytc/how_to_bring_my_old_apartment_intercomdoor_buzzer/	"My building has an [AiPhone VC-K](https://www.adiglobaldistribution.us/product/aj-vck) in every unit with a paired call box at the front door. I'd love to bring this into home assistant but I'm not sure of the best way.

I'm seeing things like the [Ring Intercom](https://en-uk.ring.com/products/intercom) and [Nuki Opener](https://nuki.io/en/opener/) that look great but they're only available in Europe, not in the US (where I'm based). Would one of those work in the US if I imported it?

I also saw [this post from a Smartthings user](https://community.smartthings.com/t/controlling-ancient-4-wire-apartment-buzzer-un-lock-only/13753) who used a ZWave relay. I wouldn't mind doing something similar, especially if there was a good zigbee option as most of my devices are zigbee. But it seems like this option wouldn't allow me to get notifications or trigger automations if someone rings the buzzer?

Have you worked with something similar? Do you have recommendations on the best way to handle this? I'd love your thoughts!

[Picture of the internal wiring of the intercom.](https://i.imgur.com/awGCuQp.jpg)"	11	"[""pinguugnip: If you look at the Ring Intercom page ([https://www.amazon.co.uk/ring-intercom-by-amazon/dp/B09JB7PLB6](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ring-intercom-by-amazon/dp/B09JB7PLB6)) there is a Compatibility Checker. Running through it (guessing what your intercom can actually do, your device shows as being compatible). Given that it is battery powered, I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work if imported.\n\nObviously check the compatibility for yourself as it has questions I don't know the answer to in your case.\n\nIf you are not in any hurry for it, I would also consider waiting to buy it. I just got it on an introductory offer in Spain for €49.99 instead of its current €129.99.

With the intercom unit being inside the unit I didn't want to see the device so I simply shoved it into the wall behind the intercom unit and it is zip tied to the back.\n\nThe power was the tricky part and I doubt my solution is really the best but I am planning on reusing some security wire to provide 12vdc and use a 5v buck converter on it to deliver the tiny amount of power it needs.\n\nEdit: [I remembered that I actually started a similar thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/x3f7tu) which may be worth checking out even to just look at the medium link I referenced. I more or less did exactly that but I used the Zen17 instead as it was easier to get.\n\nI also found that I didn't need to actually make the custom pcb referenced in it for detecting the buzzing warble.

To do that, you could have a device that responds to the sound/vibration (easy, but a bit of a hack) or that senses the change in voltage that results to intercom being signaled. That could be a ESP32 device and a relay or other isolator; it could be coupled with a Zigbee door sensor (as someone suggested) with the relay simulating the reed switch.I used to have a spare intercom line that used a regular landline phone, you pressed ""9"" on the keypad to unlatch the door.

Assuming the way you unlock the door is by pushing a button, that can be accomplished with a relay connected via ESPhome. The sensing is a different matter. Both could be done with the same microprocessor, but you\'ll need to delve into ESPhome. I\'d be surprised if you found something ""off the shelf"" that did both. But then, I\'ve been surprised before...', ""AimanF: That makes sense! I don't mind a little bit of tinkering with ESPhome, I'm just not that familiar with relays and what types I should be looking at. Any guidance on compatible/correctly specced hardware would be helpful"", 'sblessley: You need to isolate the voltage present at the switch, from the ESP. A 5V relay would accomplish that; when the ESP pin it\'s connected to goes high, the relay engages (""picks"") and closes the circuit. An optoisolator ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opto-isolator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opto-isolator)) could do the same thing, but relay contacts are less sensitive to voltage ratings, and don\'t care whether they\'re switching AC or DC (this is an oversimplication, but is true for your application). Search YouTube for ESPHOME or Arduino applications with relays. The coding is different; ESPHome is designed for Home Assistant, but the electricity aspects will be the same.']"

I have removed and readded it a few times which is always successful and I do get a few triggers for a few minutes, but after that no readings from the sensor anymore. Somehow I lost 23% battery just in the 1 hour of testing!

1682993876.0	01-May-2023 19:17:56	Zigbee : Migrating from ZHA to Z2M, a few concerns	Don_Mici	9	1358jxn	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1358jxn/zigbee_migrating_from_zha_to_z2m_a_few_concerns/	"So! Right now I have a lot of lights in my home running on Zigbee switches and dimmers that I control with ZHA (Skyconnect dongle). The nicest automations I have are basically konami codes you can do on the switches themselves to trigger scenes. To achieve that, they listen to ZHA events reported by the switches (example below). 

Now I'm looking to switch to Zigbee2MQTT as a few devices I want are not supported by ZHA. From what I read ZHA is great at what it does, but it's a bit more limited in compatibility and flexibility. Thing is it seems listening to events instead of state changes is a bit trickier in Z2M. So here is my question : Can I reproduce these automations that rely on Zigbee Events in Z2M?

Example automation : If I press ""On"" on the lobby switch, and one second later the lobby light is off, then close all lights in the house. The event part is important because it relies on clicking ""On"" while the light is already on, so no state change is triggered. Of course, same can be done with a closed light, or multiple clicks using a ""counter""."	15	"['kctjfryihx99: I don’t think the issue is the compatibility of your automations. One issue is that SkyConnect isn’t super compatible with Z2M.

But a good place to start is to search for articles like Zigbee vs Wifi or Zigbee vs Zwave, etc. \n\nJust as a very quick explanation, Zigbee and Zwave both use and ""build"" their own networks, so you will need a separate ""controller"" somewhere that kind of acts as you wifi router, but for Zigbee. The Skyconnect from HA is one, but there are many others. Ikea famously uses Zigbee.\n\nThe big difference between Zigbee and Wifi is that in Zigbee, every devices also acts kind of like a router meaning they can extend the network and even talk with each other. On Wifi every devices need to report to your Wifi router, so if you have a big house, you need a very powerful WiFi router oe event extenders. In Zigbee every lightswitch and plug will extend the network. In some cases, since most devices are routers themselves, you can even ""bind"" devices together so that a switch speaks directly to another one without passing by the controller. \n\nAlso, don\'t forget that one of the main appeal of HomeAssistant is that it\'s an orchestrator that can coordinate between basically anything, so you can have Wifi switches, Zigbee plugs, Thread whatever, and HA will insure that they talk to each other. A very clean network is nice, but not mandatory.', 'Don_Mici: Thanks for that, I will take a look into it. From other comments it appears that the SkyConnect might not be ideal to use with Z2M so my best guess is probably that.', 'zSprawl: It’s been “experimental” since release. More and more people are having success, enough that I’d try it if I wanted to, but honestly, I’ve been happy with ZHA. There are certainly more pros to Z2M than cons, but I like the simple and working approach I get with the built in support. \n\nIt’s the same thing with automations. I know node-red is a very powerful option for Home Assistant automations. If nothing else, the visual layout approach is really helpful, but I still rather use the built in HA automation system. \n\nThe cool thing with HA and open source is options and the flexibility (and headaches) that come with it.', ""Don_Mici: Fair enough, thanks a lot for checking that. I guess I'll double check my compatibilities beforehand then!"", ""TheoSl93: Thanks for the well explained response!

TLDR: I want a Zigbee router which works on ethernet because of usb-dongle location issues but I'm not sure if it's going to work with HASS and all the devices I want to install (door, CO2 and smoke sensors). I have the feeling that I am mixing concepts, technologies and integrations.\n\nThanks again for taking time to answer!!""]"

I'm looking for a bunch of sensors & gadgets but I have some requirements & preferences:

Requirements:

1. Must work with Home Assistant
2. Must work locally
3. Sshipping must be affordable to Canada

Preferences:

1. Favourite connection is ethernet
2. Zigbee or Z-Wave connection
3. Manufacturer Hub is NOT obligatory

here's what I want to do:

* lock doors
* Fire & smoke detector
* if person recognized start conversation correct passphrase -> unlock incorrect passphrase -> alarm & record correct super secret passphrase silent alarm & record
* Low O2 detection
* lockdown - roll down storm-shutters
* Call 911 -I have to find out if 911 will accept robocalls here in Canada
* check doors & windows are closed & locked
* check fridge is closed
* Alert: maximum time windows should be open has been exceeded (based off current temp & forecast)
* check windows are closed
* reminder to take meds & supplements
* detect oven/stove is on for 2 hours. Was this a mistake?
* Open & close blinds morning & night

I would like to make a bill of materials from your suggestions.

Best regards,

CA

I've got a floorplan set up using the ""Floorplan for Home Assistant"" HACS addon. It functions perfectly. However, the image is a fixed (very small) size regardless of the facts that:  
1) The image is 4k  
2) The card properly scales to fill the whole screen -- the image stays a fixed width and height within the card.

I cannot get the image to resize regardless of what I try -- I've tried the card\_mod CSS HACS addon, the layout card HACS addon, etc.

There are several Yolink devices in my home, including the speaker hub. It’s used to announce when the mailbox is opened and motion inside my outside shed, and other alerts. The device won’t announce without an internet connection. There’s a Yolink integration for HA. \n\nThe temp/humidity sensors were initially tested inside my freezer and refrigerator and they worked so well that I purchased a couple motion sensors and vibration sensors for the mailbox and shed. The range and reliability of the sensors are impressive. And I also have the main hub connected via Ethernet. \n\nWhat sold me was taking a motion sensor with me on a walk, and at a little over 1/4 mile away I pulled the sensor out of my pocket and the App on my phone went off for the motion. This device was connected to a Yolink Ethernet connected hub in my basement. I also like that they don’t interfere with the WiFi frequency spectrum. \n\nThe one major downfall is reliance on the their servers, “the cloud”, but I’m willing to use their devices for now as I have redundant internet connections and power backup for my home network.\n\nUPDATE:  I need to clarify that some functions will continue to work without an internet connection, such as activating a local Yolink smart plug or siren, but notification’s to the App require an internet connection. This is assuming that all of the devices still have power.', '4reddityo: Thanks!! Have you seen other devices interfere with wifi?

The more things that communicate in the WiFi frequency range in a given area will eventually cause congestion in that frequency spectrum. Think of a lot of people at a party all trying to talk at the same time. \n\nI live in an area with dozens of nearby WiFi networks and each network has numerous devices. So I decided to use devices that operate on frequencies different than the 2.4GHz range whenever possible; my preference being z-wave. I still have WiFi devices, as well as zigbee, z-wave, LoRa, and some 433MHz sensors. \n\nThe wonderful thing is Home Assistant ties them all together in one manageable place.\n\nIt is also important to have a good WiFi network to support more devices. A cheap WiFi router will quickly become a problem and the wireless network can experience disconnects or slowness. Another reason why I prefer wired connections for high bandwidth connections such as video cameras. It also helps to move devices to the 5GHz WiFi network when possible, but the range isn’t as good as the 2.4GHz WiFi networks. \n\nI initially purchased a Yolink kit that included the wired hub and some temperature sensors, then added the speaker hub later. The Yolink temp sensor paid for the entire kit when it alerted that my large chest freezer was getting warm. The thermostat controller has failed and I was able to replace the part the next day and save the expensive meat.

I just installed several Insteon Micro Dimmers I had lying around and I think one of them is defective. Basically, anytime there is an insteon event on the network and the lights are less than 100% - they all flash. I tried 2 other Insteon micro dimmers on this same load and didnt have any issues. Accoriding to my ISY, all 3 are the same hardware and software version - so I am guessing the unit is just defective :( 

Now, this leads to need to find a replacement. Seeing as Insteon doesnt seem to be making these at the moment, I would be happy to get a Zigbee, ZWave or other replacement.. but I havent been able to find much. My requirements are pretty simple:
1. Support dimming LEDs. 
2. Be able to be grouped together into scenes. For this one, I know Home Assistant can simulate it using light groups or automations, but I don't like the delay it creates. I would prefer native grouping or scene support  

I have found some no-name Zigbee units, but I dont know if I should trust them. I have also seen the Shelly Dimmers, but I dont think they do #2. 

Thanks!"	2	['mwolczko: FYI You can find the Insteon units on eBay.', 'boojew: Thanks. I am wondering if there is no other alternative to using Insteon..']

I replaced my HVAC filter today (May 1st) after 6 months (which is what manufacturer suggests). Problem with that is it does not take into consideration how dusty it really is in the environment.

You can see the change in velocity from a dirty filter to a clean one. Now, rather than changing with a fixed time, the filter can be changed when its not allowing air to flow too freely through it.

You can see here that around 11:20am, the machine turned on to run. Because it's an average sensor, the state jumps around from idle -> on -> running -> on -> running -> idle. I want to create some sort of sensor that shows the most common state in 60 seconds (or something of the sort) to remove these blips. This would make my resultant sensor show idle -> running -> idle

But be aware that if you have a server that can run stuff, you'll tend to run stuff on it.\n\nFor example, I worked out that my i5 has a GNA (Gaussian Neural Accelerator) that's supported by Frigate via OpenVINO, so I tried running person detection on one of my cameras, and this is the result:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/762z2ktrebxa1.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cbe8928130d0d6f1845d72eec34b0de39618ce2c\n\nIt added like 5-10W of power to run Frigate.

1682956603.0	01-May-2023 08:56:43	First venture into HA, looking for a Smart Plug that can monitor energy usage	purplegreendave	2	134qcnu	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/134qcnu/first_venture_into_ha_looking_for_a_smart_plug/	"I'm looking to buy a UPS for my Plex Server, router etc. Before I do that though I wanted to get a Kill A Watt or similar to see what size UPS I actually need.

Problem with that is I'll probably never use it again after that and it would most likely just go in the junk drawer never to be seen again.

I always wanted to get into some sort of Smart Home stuff ""in the future"". Well I was thinking why not start now with the energy monitor. If I could buy an outlet that would let me monitor the usage at first and then repurpose it for something else. My plan would be:

* Set up a HASS VM on my Unraid Server
* Monitor that information and use that to decide what UPS I want to buy
* Repurpose the plug, for example running our vehicles' block heaters off it in the winter, so I can plug my truck in every night but it only runs the block heaters between 4-8am when the demp is -15C or below.

Is there a good, relatively inexpensive plug that can achieve those things? I'd prefer local (no cloud/accounts/phoning home) and I like Open Source (but it's not a 100% dealbreaker)

I've seen recommendations for something like the ""Sonoff s31 flashed with Tasmota"". I'm usually not opposed to flashing firmware etc on devices, although I've only ever done it with USB based firmware files and have never tried anything that requires soldering or jumping circuit boards. I've also seen people say you need to calibrate them with a calibrated AC Multimeter to get accurate results and I'm afraid I'll be in over my head with that. 

And lastly I'm not sure what protocol to aim for. Seems like the big 3 are WiFi, Zigbee and Z-Wave. If Z-Wave is the only one that won't interfere with my Wifi Network then I think that's what I'd prefer, but maybe it's not as big a deal as I have it made out to be in my head?

Edit: I guess I should mention I'm in Canada so a North American outlet is what I'm looking for."	15	"[""baize: The TP-Link Kasa line has energy monitoring that would not require, but can be integrated with HASS.

Almost as if they’re quickly switching off  then back on (assuming the scene was supposed to turn them off). Anyone  have any clue on how to fix this? My temporary fix is using Google Assistant SDK to send a message to turn them off at the end of the  routine but I’m trying to ween off the cloud completely and this is  obviously counterintuitive to that plan.	2	"['mini_juice: What do the logs say for those switches?

I've currently got an Rpi 4B (with a dongles for ZigBee and zwave) and have an Ubuntu VM in Hyper-V running DahuaVTO2MQTT in a container.  The setup works well except when I have to install an HA update and everything goes down.  Also not too happy with running that separate Ubuntu VM on my Windows server.

So I heard that running Proxmox or ESXi on my NUC is a good setup.  But I'm not sure what should be running in a VM vs a container.

Any input would be appreciated."	16	"['bsmith76s: Use Proxmox and setup home assistant in a VM. Works well for me.

Don't bother with ESXI, Proxmox or any other Hypervisor.\n\nIs that a waste of the power of the NUC? No, I don't think so. There are plenty of addons available for Home Assistant and it is very easy to create more. I like how little there is between Home Assistant and the bare metal.\n\nThere are a few downsides though, it would be nice to run both Plex and Matrix on this same machine. Both can be run as containers easily enough but Plex addon has severe limitations (can't mount network shares easily) and the Matrix addon has been deprecated (edit: I think entirely removed now, not sure why).\n\nThis leaves me with either SSHing directly in and running the containers I need entirely separately from Home Assistant or installing Portainer and doing the same.

Fourth option would be to redo my setup with ESXI or Proxmox.\n\nThere is perhaps the 5th option of working on a better Plex / Matrix addon but might not have the skills."", ""alex3305: I really love my unRAID setup.

I moved MQTT, Zigbee2MQTT and Adguard out into separate Proxmox containers. If HA goes down Adguard is still up giving devices access to the internet. I just really like the idea of these services running outside of HA. I'm still quite new to virtualisation and this wasn't hard to setup for me."", ""Konig1469: This is the way and what I did.

I also totally agree its situational, I have a lot more probably going on with my instance than a lot of folks so its built to spec for my specific situation.  I personally like the simplicity of a bare metal install as HA is basically the central point of monitoring for my network.  I need it to be snappy and rock solid stable.  Over the years I've tried about every possible way to install HA and for me this is whats been best.  I do also have to add that with this setup, I have not ever had to deal with a bare metal restore asides from testing.  I also realize that just saying that on the internet pretty much means its going to crash and burn in some horrific fashion tonight...  lol""]"

The same HomeBridge has an addon for my Miele household devices. I can do everything with this addon in HomeKit, except switching on my devices.

As the title suggests I have an issue with casting local media.

So a bit of background info.

I previously was using the HA Let's Encrypt plug-in to enable remote access using my personal google domain, Using this method my Local Media casting worked perfectly.

Since then I have moved to using Nginx proxy Manager as I have more than one service needing to have access to the outside world and because I wanted to keep as few ports open to the external web as possible (apparently this is good practice).

So I now have a new URL for my HA. This works fine with accessing my HA and is linked to my google assistant via google actions and google works nicely with HA too...

However the only snag I have now is that my HA Local Media casting makes the sound as if It's connected, but the steam never plays.

Is there something I'm missing or does this just not work with Nginx.

1682895763.0	30-Apr-2023 16:02:43	Here is a working solution for homeassistant and iPad2 (iOS 9.3.5)	Zealousideal_Durian7	1	1345rct	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1345rct/here_is_a_working_solution_for_homeassistant_and/	"Many had the same troubles like me:

Old iPads mounted to the wall are good enough as a touchscreen BUT

Lovelace UI is incompatible with iOS 9.3.5 the latest version for old iPads.

&#x200B;

Behavior: you can connect to the homeassistant but after login you see ""initializing"" and wait forever.

&#x200B;

Reason: Lovelace UI uses Polymere Javascript framework which needs newer browsers like Safari 11

&#x200B;

Updating to the last 2 supported Browsers (Dolphin (tested), iCab (not tested €€€)) do not work because Dolphin uses iOS builtin Webkit Browserengine.

&#x200B;

What works for some people: install homeassistant app on an iphone of a family member and then on the old ipad in appstore under family sharing (de: Familienfreigabe) you can download the latest compatible version of that app.

&#x200B;

Solution: 2 steps

&#x200B;

1. the last version of homeassistant docker container that kind of works with workaround is: 2021.12

Next version 2022.1 does not, even with workaround.  2021.12 has working knx integration

&#x200B;

2) login token does still not work with 2021.12 so you need to switch to an alternatin authentication method, like trusted networks

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Here is what you need to do (in this order !!!)

&#x200B;

1. &#x200B;

&#8203;

    sudo docker pull homeassistant/home-assistant:2021.12

&#x200B;

2)

    sudo docker run -d \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     --name=homeassistant \
     -h homeassistant \
     -e PUID=1001 \
     -e PGID=1001 \
     -e TZ=CET \
     --net=host \
     -v homeassistant:/config \
    homeassistant/home-assistant:2021.12

&#x200B;

3) connect on a PC and configure a user (doesn't work with trusted networks)

[http://homeassistant.local:8123](http://homeassistant.local:8123)

&#x200B;

4) enable trusted networks in configuration.yaml (insert first 5 rows end change to your net adress)

    sudo nano /var/lib/docker/volumes/homeassistant/_data/configuration.yaml

The existing setup is all in Apple HomeKit (with Philips Hue lights, iSmartGates etc.) although I'm a little on the fence about going down that path again for a new setup... The availability of Apple Home certified gear in Australia is limited and the setup is generally just painful/limited in function. Hue also has some intricacies and is pretty expensive compared to some of the more suitable Zigbee alternatives (like Mercator Ikuu).

I made the switch to Home Assistant \~6 months ago for my place and am pretty happy with it. We've integrated way more than HomeKit allowed and I've even been building sensors with ESPHome. That said, its a bit more of an investment in time to manage, update and support...

If you are going to do someone else\'s HA then it needs to be reliable.

I also set up the internets at my brother\'s house about 10 years ago and now he gets why it costed him around £500 in hardware - his requirements needed quite a lot of gear but at least he got the IT consultant for nearly free (bed, food and a lot of wine) \n\nTreat your parents like a customer and do it right.  HA will need some reasonable hardware and it must be UPS backed.  APC do a unit with normal sockets (Schneider will almost certainly have one with AUS sockets) on it for a reasonable amount - their BACKUPS range is reasonably priced.\n\nThe above is overkill just for some smart lights.

I haven't played with Home Assistant until now or any IoT devices, but I am very familiar with basic microcontrollers(Arduino, pico etc). My plans are to control all the light switches (about 6), a few led strips controlled by ESP32 (let's say 3), probably some relays for power sockets in case I leave the apartment and forget something plugged in, temperature sensors, ac unit, TV, and a locking mechanism. My question is, can the app handle that many wifi connections? Will it decrease my bandwidth consistently? Also, if my router restarts, does all the devices reconnect automatically? Wouldn't be a good ideea for some of the devices to be wired directly to the main board?"	7	"['RedditFauxGold: HA isn’t an access point so the number of Wi-Fi connections is moot as they’re just end-points on the network. You probably do have a top end for network connections but for the little bit of traffic we are talking, I can’t imagine it’s an attainable number.  \n\nWith respect to wired vs wireless, you’re not going to find hard wired wall switches as you’re mixing voltages in the box. Ie, you’d have to run Ethernet drops to the line voltage box where your lighting power is. Your exposure is that you can’t trigger jobs via TCP-IP. You should always plan to have devices keep local control where possible. This also is why I stay clear of exclusively cloud controlled things as it creates a dependency on your ISP.  \n\nAdd to this, are you sure you’re going 100% Wi-Fi connected? I just ask because the overwhelming majority of my house is zwave: robably around 40 or 45 wall switches, a few outlets, and a half dozen LED controllers. Wi-Fi I think I just have a half dozen special use Shelly relays.', 'DogTownR: If you use distributed APs (Access Points) 100+ devices on Wi-Fi won’t be a problem. HA can support 100+ IOT devices easily. You shouldn’t run into any capacity issues. IOT devices often use Zigbee and Zwave vs Wi-Fi for connectivity.', ""RoadFresh8573: Z wave from what I understand uses a lower freq, and the wifi congestion is lowered. It's that the reason you optet for that specific solution?"", 'RoadFresh8573: Also, does Z-wave is a cloud connected system? As in, what will happen if this system is no longer supported by the developer? Will I be able to use it after that, or it will all become redundant?', 'RedditFauxGold: No, I have a Meraki MR42 on each floor of my house so I have no concerns for Wi-Fi congestion. I went zwave because that’s the primary protocol (or at least was when I purchased them 6 or 7 years ago) for automation control. I also like that they create their own mesh and some things like scene control can reside locally on switches.', 'RedditFauxGold: Zwave is not, in and of itself, a cloud solution. I’m sure some vendors have created cloud access capabilities for control when you’re away from home but zwave itself is a communications protocol. It’s not a single vendor thing so there won’t be someone that just decides to stop developing it. Will it eventually sunset? I’m sure it will considering it’s like 20 years old. But when you consider the sheer number of manufacturers that have included it in their switches (Leviton as an example), there will probably be a very long tail on that decision. \n\nAlso, it is added to a local switch (over simplifying a bit…) so even if you completely abandon home automation there won’t be any impact to the basic function.', 'big-ted: Z-Wave is all local, and even if the current HA developer stops, others will pick it up as has happened in the past, it is too important to the NA market for developers not to support it']"

AstonM77	20	133zrcs	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/133zrcs/8_months_later_ive_identified_the_flaw_in_the/	"I set up HA \~8 months ago and installed 2x Emporia Vue energy monitors that I reflashed to integrate with HA (great addition BTW) in addition to adding a handful of other fairly high-frequency sensors over the following months. Essentially a decent baseline to get HA experience with as I had free time to familiarize myself with it.

Flash forward 5-6 months and I notice I am starting to have to provision additional storage to my HA VM in 5-10GB chunks because I am getting low storage warnings every so many weeks.

Three things I have come to learn from this experience...

1. It is very difficult (too difficult tbh) for a relative HA novice to figure out where their storage space is being utilized.
2. ALL of the Youtube videos I've seen on setting up InfluxDB w/ HA have the same flaw... they default you to collecting everything.
3. There is very little information I can find for a relative HA novice on untangling a mess like this after the fact.

FWIW to any novice just setting up InfluxDB that might read this... This website [Optimize Your Home Assistant Database - SmartHomeScene](https://smarthomescene.com/guides/optimize-your-home-assistant-database/?unapproved=2761&moderation-hash=252b4253820f53f16b7a335e2350edf1#comment-2761) was extremely useful for some of the better configuration practices and I wish he would have gone even more into depth on post-install best practices for maintaining a clean DB or even cleaning up an existing mess.

1682870052.0	30-Apr-2023 08:54:12	Z-Wave and Zigbee both stopped working	Saturable	3	133vi1r	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/133vi1r/zwave_and_zigbee_both_stopped_working/	"I'm running HomeAssistant on a Raspberry Pi 4. Prior to yesterday, I only had Z-Wave installed using an Aeotec Z-Stick 7 Plus. All my Z-Wave devices were working normally, but I couldn't find a Z-Wave entry sensor that met my needs. I came across the Aqara entry sensor that runs on Zigbee, so I purchased the SONOFF Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle. I plugged it in yesterday, set up Zigbee, connected the sensor, and everything was working normally - including my existing Z-Wave devices.

Fast-forward a few hours. My Z-Wave network stopped working. Confused, I went to my hub and unplugged/plugged the Aeotec stick. It didn't fix the problem. Then I noticed the Zigbee network went down too.

HomeAssistant still sees the hardware. I checked the configuration files to ensure they were still using the correct USB port, which they both are. I tried removing them and re-adding them, and that didn't work.

I have several lumen sensors, but they are affected by the light from bulbs, TVs, and other artificial sources. I want to measure the true level of natural light in the room, irrespective of any artificial sources, so that I can precisely determine when to turn on/off the lights or open/close the shutters/blinds.

I suppose one way to determine the natural brightness level of a room is to create a Node-RED script that adjusts the lux value of a custom helper based on readings from existing lumen sensors and the status of the lights (whether they are on or off). However, this method may be challenging and imprecise.

Alternatively, you can possibly use a color sensor to accurately measure the natural light level in the room. any Zigbee 3.0 and Z-Wave compatible color sensors available on the market ? which has a built-in light sensor that can differentiate between natural and artificial light sources.

Another idea is to calculate the natural light level based on the room's GPS coordinates, the orientation of the windows, and the sun's position relative to the room. However, this approach may be less accurate and more dependent on weather conditions.

\-- Saying that I wonder if the Philips Hue Sensor does that already, I have two values, perhaps the raw measured illuminance is the natural lights? (I'm probably wrong here)

Your indoor lights will have a specific spectrum which you can then subtract from the whole. This will also require you to have a power sensor on each light that let\'s you know if it\'s on or off.

I'm an happy users of HAOS on a mini pc and i'm trying undestand how different things work but there's something i still don't get about wifi devices. I'm currently using some zigbee device with m2qtt and it was pretty easy to use and understand. Now, i have few wifi devices (thermostat, plug, dishwasher, dryer) that i was using before HAOS with their apps. I obviously would like to move over and be able to use them with HAOS.   
The aim of using HA was to stop using external (most of chinese) servers around the world and have all my devices locally connected. 

So the questions is: Why do I still have to log in or create a user to the companies server to be able to connect the devices to HA? The fact they are wifi devices shouldn't be enough to be able to use them with my wifi? If I still connect the devices to HA through the brand server, that means i still have to rely on their servers and i cannot be completely offline?

Is there a plug-in or panel or integration (even the nomenclature of HA is confusing) that can make this happen?"	7	"['SpencerDub: What you want is an automation. Automations run automatically when their triggers are met. You can make automations without writing any code; you just need to navigate to the ""Automations"" section of Home Assistant and press the ""Create Automation"" button.\n\nUnder Trigger, you can choose the Time option. Put in the time you want the automation to trigger.\n\nUnder Actions, select ""Device"". Start typing the name of one of the lights you want to turn on, then select it when it pops up. Then, beneath the name of the device, select what you want it to do (turn on or turn off).\n\nYou can add additional actions for additional lights.\n\nHome Assistant is a very flexible system, so there are many ways to get the same result. You could, for instance, group all the lights together, so you\'d only have to turn on or off the group. You could set a scene with all the lights at the state you want them, then call the scene instead. Or you could use the ""call service"" action to call the ""turn on"" function.

The intent is that my shell command would capture the two parameters that are passed along as specified in the data block - the station number and then the tuner name - which is the current source for that entity. Then over in the shell\_command definition I have this.

      ./set_tuner.sh {{ station }} {{ tuner }}

At the moment `{{ tuner }}` seems to come through as the literal text- `{{ states.media_player.zone_16.source}}` which is not the intention. I am wanting to capture the value of the evaluation of that.

Looking to buy a Blinds2Go Smart Blind (like [this](https://www.blinds-2go.co.uk/roller-blinds/32558/electric-titan-snow-white.html)) which uses Tuiss SmartView.

Apparently they use 433mhz, is that true? 

Can I use my Sonoff [RF Bridge](https://sonoff.tech/product/gateway-and-sensors/rf-bridger2/) to control the blinds after recording the 433mhz signal via ewelink from the remote, or do I need to flash the RF Bridge with Tasmota etc, I have a pretty basic setup, just using ewelink, not home assisntat or similar

Nice to have them in a nice format on my phone, too.\n\nHere\'s kinda what I\'ve been thinking and would love to hear your thoughts:\n\nSo there are like 5 levels of information importance, I think:\n\n1. Information critically important to everyone onsite (read: tornado warning)\n2. Information important to family/residents (read: power cut out and we\'re on battery backup, primary internet uplink is down)\n3. Information important to home system maintainers (read: main or backup storage array is degraded, VPNs are down, some server isn\'t ping available)\n4. Interesting information (read: air conditioning is running, sprinklers are running, drive time to work)\n5. Detailed information useful for analysis and study (read: troubleshooting a problem, looking for trends to figure something out, figuring out how bad the rain storms predicted later will be)\n\nMy initial thinking for targets for these:\n\n1. Display in a simple, clear format on the primary dashboard with critical color/icons/whatever to make it easy to see what\'s happening and what needs to be done. Possibly convey these out of band (e.g. turn LED lights a different color, audio alert, whatever). Send critical notifications (we\'re iOS, so they cut through settings to make noise)\n2. Display on primary hass dashboard and send non-critical alerts.\n3. Display visualizations on secondary hass dashboard and (as desired) target notifications to me only.\n4. Display on primary or secondary hass dashboard as desired.\n5. This is the interesting one that made me want to share based on your comment. The more I think about it, the more I think I wanna slap this into Zabbix and/or InfluxDB. Those with grafana give the tools to really dig in and study the data if/when I want to do that. No need for it really in hass, and with the awesome hass->Zabbix interface I have the hass data available to match up with the data I decide not to keep in hass for grafana work.\n\nEdit: I decided to start with the ""importance 3"" dashboards because it gives me both exposure to all the data I have and helps me learn the various customization tools available.

The logbook claims the ""turn on"" event was fired by the same automation that turned it off, but that automation's traces say it wasn't running at that time.

Someone is lying! And this drives me nuts. Only happens when the switch is involved, Alexa, Google, direct calls to the service, all successfully turn it off and it stays off. But if I use the off button it comes right back on.

Some details:

- light.hallway is a ZHA group consisting of four Gledopto MR16 bulbs. Yeah, I know these suck, that's why they're in the hallway.
- The switch is a Philips Hue rwl020 using [this blueprint](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zha-philips-hue-dimmer-switch-rwl020-rwl021/255048?u=ejpenney) I've modified it slightly over the years but not much.
- I'm using this same blueprint on three other ZHA groups and their corresponding switches with no issues.
- There are two traces for every event because ZHA receives a button up event as well as a down event. The blueprint simply ignores one of them...
- The switch is not bound to the ZHA group because these Hue switches can only be bound to one endpoint and I want to monitor battery levels in HA.
- ""Switch 1"" has the same details, and the same issue

If this was an issue with the blueprint I'd expect to see something in the traces.

If this was an issue with the bulbs, I'd expect them to come back on regardless of the turn off method.

If this was ZigBee congestion, or some signal issue, I would expect the message from the switch to the controller or the controller to the bulbs to never make it at all... Or the turn on event to not appear in the logs!

System log shows nothing.  I've tried replacing this switch, the old one did this, so does the new one.

When I updated to 10.0, my entire system borked (shame on me for not keeping a local backup. Never again!) and I've had to recreate my HA system from scratch. Things were going well until I tried installing the Eufy Security HACS add-in and integration. Everything seemed to go OK. The Simple RTSP add-in installed and appears to run. The Eufy add-in loaded and seems to run. But when I installed the integration, the problems began. First, when I saved the integration's settings, I received a ""type error"" on the ""generate ffmpeg logs"" checkbox. Unchecking, saving then rechecking saving seemed to clear that up. Next, after a HA restart, the Integration asked for a reconfigure captcha, which is expected. When I solved the captcha, the system waited for about 30 seconds and then returned with an ""unknown error"" Trying it again returned a ""500"" error. Restarting HA and trying again yields the same result. This worked under HAOS 9.x. I verified the user and password for the Eufy login and verified that it had access to my devices.

Spin up a new VM and try to import from backup. It failed to work correctly after the backup, again, just like every other time the backup system is horrible.

I bit the bullet and swapped to home assistant. Everything just works; even started adding some new random automation from around the house that I wasn't even trying to do in homeseer because it is so slick. So easy to setup, love that I can dive into the yamls if needed. Android is great, starting to think I can actually set something up easy enough for my inlaws to use. Which was never going to happen with homeseer. No clue how they aren't charging money for this."	3	"[""Hands-On-Katie: Totally agree!

Mainly because I don't like to deep dive into another ecosystem to only find out after x-amount of weeks that it just isn't there. At that time Home Assistant developers were mainly focused on getting as much integrations as possible. But when I finally migrated my home automation to home assistant I was amazed. Everything just _worked_, and it was easy to do. Still the yaml hurdle was there though.\n\nHowever a while back (I guess about 2 years ago?) the HA devs made the very bold choice to start moving things to UI and honestly I couldn't be happier. I still think that sometimes they focus a little too much on quantity and not quality. For instance with blueprints that still leave quite a bit too be desired. Or faulty values/statistics that can be changed, but has a really hard to use interface. Or translations that aren't quite there, but are still released. But that's slowly changing and that's a good thing.\n\nI see a lot of users 'complain' on this sub about the dumbing down of the interface or system as a whole, and while I'm an advanced user, I see benefits in that. For instance when I switched from Supervised to OS in a VM I could actually focus on more on getting things done, instead of doing SysOps. And the same with the new UI elements. My wife loves them and finds them less in your face. And as an advanced user I can still create a custom UI when I want to.\n\nAnyway, nowadays I can fully recommend Home Assistant. Even for non-technical users. Just don't try to do everything all at once and you'll be fine. And it can even be done very cheap with a simple Zigbee coordinator or ESP devices. Oh yeah, also things that HA has picked up really well. Honestly I love this project, and can recommend it to anyone."", 'Normanras: Same!

I know there are projects that allow the other direction, Home Assistant to control E1.31. I'm also aware that there is E1.31 firmware for some ESP based smart devices.

A little backstory: I've recently been working on helping our private school upgrade their stage equipment on a budget. Specifically, I'm donating my time and limited finances. They've got a mix of several decades old Leviton Multiplex (MPX) light dimmer packs, which I'm currently building a converter for to interface to DMX. They've also got a handful of more modern DMX RGB stage lights. I've built a cheap ESP interface for this to allow control from E1.31, so now they can use open source software like QLC+ to orchestrate their stage lighting. So I've got a plan for most of the existing stage lighting.

One remaining item, some cheap LED strings with an IR remote, has yet to be integrated. It got me to thinking how easy doing something like that is on Home Assistant with ESPHome acting as an IR blaster. If I had a way of bridging the E1.31 protocol into Home Assistant acting as a slave device, it would be easy enough for me to set up IR blasters to control just about anything that has IR controls. Furthermore, it would open up the door to using cheaper off the shelf RGB bulbs, dimmers, and switches for stage lighting and other controls. I might even venture to build an actuator for the stage curtains. With templates in HA, translating a DMX channel value to an action would be easy enough.

I've done a bunch of searching on the topic but most of the results are, as I mentioned in the first paragraph, not really applicable to what I'm trying to do. Has anyone else done something similar?"	5	"['the012345: Check out node red it has some e.1.31 plugins', 'dsg123456789: You should be able to do this with only esphome.

I'm not aware of any E1.31 support in ESPHome."", 'muchtall: Huh. So I had read this before: https://esphome.io/components/light/index.html#e1-31-effect\n\nI had assumed it was to control E1.31 devices from ESPHome. Now that I re-read it, it sounds like it acts as a slave device. That might work. Does the data that comes in via E1.31 feed back to HomeAssistant as a state value?', 'dsg123456789: You would make an rgb light, add e131 as an effect. Then, create output template components. Do you business there with IR blasting or relay actuating. No Homeassistant in the loop is my suggestion. \n\nOtherwise, someone else’s suggestion to use node red is reasonable.']"

I just plugged it into a 5v adapter that actually measures 4.8v. It is now working, but it actually seems slightly sluggish. I may try to get it closer to exactly 5v and see what happens.

Internet radio from the HA radio browser doesn't work.  Internet radio url from a media_player.play_media service event doesn't work.  Internet MP3  doesn't work.

Before Music Assistant broke, it created its own media_player entities for my Sonos speakers and those were able to play all types of media I could throw at it.  That's gone now and I have no idea where to even start figuring this out.  Any ideas?

The integration could probably be improved to make this easier, but I don\'t listen to many radio stations myself. That being said, if you can find the radio station using the native Sonos app, you can save it as a Sonos favorite and select it that way from the HA media browser.

Would you be willing to show me how to get this setup and running in an IDE where I can debug it?  If you can get me that far, I can figure the rest out.

1682721036.0	28-Apr-2023 15:30:36	Using Siri, HomePods, and HA	dadbauld	1	132btn9	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/132btn9/using_siri_homepods_and_ha/	"Right now we are an Amazon Echo household with multiple screen and no-screen echos. We primarily use these to play music, control our lights (Hue, Govee), set timers, and very rarely see camera feeds. We are also very much an Apple household: two iPhones, multiple iPads, Apple Watches, two Apple TV‘s, a Macbook, etc. Currently, I’ve been experimenting with Home Assistant on an old mini PC running Windows 10. The problem I have here is obvious.. it crashes a lot. About once a week or so.

I would very much like to switch out all of the Echo devices for HomePods and Homepod mini’s and also do a more reliable HA build on a Rasperry Pi 4. My question is: Does anyone else have a setup like this and could you tell me how your pro’s/con’s? Also, would Siri/HomePod be able to control ALL of my smart home gadgets? We have everything I mentioned above but also: Logitech Harmony for TV control, a WIFI enabled home theater receiver, Xbox, MyQ garage door openers, several Ring cameras/doorbell, a couple of Wemo smart plugs, Lutron light switches, Roku TV, Govee lights, and Hue lights. Of course, I’ll likely be adding to this in the future as well.

What do you guys think? Would this make a good setup or am I missing something? Oh, and we currently have Spotify which I know is kind of a bummer that it won’t work with HomePods, but I’m not totally opposed to switching to Apple Music too.

Thanks so much for any input you could provide!"	10	"['peterxian: I am bridging almost 100 accessories from HA to HomeKit, which we control with iPhones, HomePod minis, Apple TVs, etc. It works very, very well and is (in my opinion) the easiest and safest way to enable voice control, GPS presence, and remote access away from home. For the most part, if you can integrate it with HA you can control it with Siri. The main restriction is that HomeKit doesn\'t support the wide range of [device types](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homekit#supported-components) HA does, so you can\'t bridge your power meter or your washer/dryer for example, because HomeKit doesn\'t have a model for those things (the new ""assist"" command should make up for this, somewhat).', ""gooeyblob: I have Home Assistant running on an Intel NUC on Proxmox and have the HomeKit integration setup in HA and it works pretty well.

I have some cameras running through Scrypted, but everything else is through HA.\n\nWe use HomePods and iPhones and Apple TV and the integration is nice. Pretty much nothing is missing from what I can tell. There will be some various issues where a HomePod will mysteriously disappear from the internet and was somehow also your hub at the time and all your stuff won't work, but that hasn't happened in a couple months for me since the recent architecture upgrades and it's been rock solid.

I’ve also never heard of Proxmox, so I’ll look that up. I’m getting from your post that it is more reliable than windows?

And will I have to do the same amount of organizing on her account?', 'peterxian: The “assist” [command is a shortcut](https://next.home-assistant.io/docs/assist/) you can add to your phone to route voice requests directly to the HA language processor. It’s limited for now, but quickly improving. So (eventually) you can say, “hey Siri, assist” and Siri replies, “ok” and anything you say after that goes to HA, like “how much time is left on the dyer?” and HA will send the answer to Siri without the dryer needing to be aware of HomeKit. Since Apple doesn’t actually make any of their own smart home gear, it’s up to device makers to request new types. I’d expect power monitoring to be added in a future update (Eve has energy monitors and is a big HomeKit client) but the rest could take a while.', '400HPMustang: Proxmox is a base OS for virtualizing servers…so yes it’s more reliable for this task.

After you set everything up and bridge all of your devices over you just have to organize them in the home app once and you and your wife will be set. You will have to specifically bridge each device from HA to the Home app but that gets easier after the first mass effort', 'dadbauld: Very cool! Excited to see this get better.']"
1682717979.0	28-Apr-2023 14:39:39	Lorex 2K Doorbell - got it working in HA	senor_peligro	8	132am32	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/132am32/lorex_2k_doorbell_got_it_working_in_ha/	"There's been a few posts about the Lorex 2K doorbell which I was going to reply to but I decided instead to create a new post for those interested in getting it to work in HA.  It was a struggle but I got button presses and motion detection working.

First step is that you have to install DahuaVTO2MQTT located here:

[https://github.com/elad-bar/DahuaVTO2MQTT](https://github.com/elad-bar/DahuaVTO2MQTT)

This represented my first problem.  There is an HA add-on that is very old and not supported so it has to be installed in a docker container (which I have never used before) and it only seems to work on AMD64 architecture.  So I wasn't able to run the docker on an RPI.  I had to create an Ubuntu VM on my always-on Windows Server and then install it there.  I won't go into great detail on setting up this docker as I am not an expert but I eventually was able to hack my way into setting it up.  But here are the contents of my docker-compose.yml file.  Note that the default username for the doorbell is admin.  The password is setup in the Lorex app when you add your doorbell.  It isn't the cloud account that you are forced to setup but the actual doorbell password.

`version: '3'`

`services:`

  `dahuavto2mqtt:`

`image: ""`[`registry.gitlab.com/elad.bar/dahuavto2mqtt:latest`](https://registry.gitlab.com/elad.bar/dahuavto2mqtt:latest)`""`

`container_name: ""dahuavto2mqtt""`

`hostname: ""dahuavto2mqtt""`

`restart: ""unless-stopped""`

`environment:`

`- DAHUA_VTO_HOST=<ip address of your doorbell<`

`- DAHUA_VTO_USERNAME=admin`

`- DAHUA_VTO_PASSWORD=<password that you setup on your doorbell>`

`- MQTT_BROKER_HOST=<ip address of your HA assuming that you installed mqtt there>`

`- MQTT_BROKER_PORT=1883`

`- MQTT_BROKER_USERNAME=<mqtt username>`

`- MQTT_BROKER_PASSWORD=<mqtt password>`

`- MQTT_BROKER_TOPIC_PREFIX=DahuaVTO`

`- MQTT_BROKER_CLIENT_ID=DahuaVTO2MQTT`

`- DEBUG=False`      

Once you've got that container running, you will need to enable the camera in HA by adding these lines to your configuration.yaml.

`allowlist_external_dirs:`

`- ""/config/tmp"" # You need this to capture pictures`

`ffmpeg:`

`camera:`

  `- platform: ffmpeg`

`name: Lorex 2K Doorbell`

`input: rtsp://admin:<password for doorbell>@<ip address for doorbell>`


You now have to reboot HA.  If not you will not be able to see the camera.

I also created a script to capture pictures from the doorbell using the camera settings above.  I added a delay of 2 seconds because I find that there is a small lag between the event trigger and the actual event.  And you will see that I always overwrite the picture in the /config/tmp/ directory.

`alias: Lorex 2K Doorbell Take Picture`

`sequence:`

  `- delay:`

`hours: 0`

`minutes: 0`

`seconds: 2`

`milliseconds: 0`

  `- service: camera.snapshot`

`data:`

`filename: /config/tmp/lorex_2k_doorbell_picture.jpg`

`target:`

`entity_id: camera.lorex_2k_doorbell`

`mode: single`

`icon: mdi:camera`


The next part took me a while to figure out.  At this point, MQTT should be able to receive messages from the doorbell and I had to figure out what was being sent.  I did this with MQTT Explorer (I am not an expert).  I eventually figured out that when you press the doorbell button, it publishes a topic ""DahuaVTO/PhoneCallDetect/Event"".  We are particularly interested in these messages where the action is ""Start"".  I saw that for each button press the doorbell sends a Start and Stop so you probably only want to trigger your automations once.  In the example automation below, I listen only for Start and then I send a message on discord with a picture.

`alias: Front door doorbell pressed (alert)`

`description: """"`

`trigger:`

  `- platform: mqtt`

`topic: DahuaVTO/PhoneCallDetect/Event`

`payload: Start`

`value_template: ""{{ value_json.Action }}""`

`condition: []`

`action:`

  `- service: script.lorex_2k_doorbell_take_picture`

`data: {}`

  `- service: notify.discord_ha_notification`

`data:`

`message: ""{{now().strftime(\""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"")}} - Front door doorbell pressed""`

`target: <this is redacted>`

`data:`

`images:`

`- /config/tmp/lorex_2k_doorbell_picture.jpg`

`mode: single`

Detecting motion is very similar except you are waiting for the topic ""DahuaVTO/VideoMotion/Event"".  And again, you probably only want the Start action.

`alias: Front door doorbell motion detected (alert)`

`description: """"`

`trigger:`

  `- platform: mqtt`

`topic: DahuaVTO/IntelliFrame/Event`

`payload: Start`

`value_template: ""{{ value_json.Data.Action }}""`

`condition: []`

`action:`

  `- service: script.lorex_2k_doorbell_take_picture`

`data: {}`

  `- service: notify.discord_ha_notification`

`data:`

`message: >-`

`{{now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"")}} - Front door doorbell motion`

`detected`

`target: <this is redacted>`

`data:`

`images:`

`- /config/tmp/lorex_2k_doorbell_picture.jpg`

`mode: single`

I think that these were all my steps but if I missed anything please let me know.

EDIT:
So after a few days of testing I ran into an issue with motion detection.  I made an automation that turns on my lights when motion is detected.  What happened was that suppose a passing car triggered motion detection.  My porch light would turn on.  The automation turns off the light after 2 minutes but when the light turns off, it triggers motion detection again.  And then when the light turns off it triggers it again.  So after studying the MQTT messages, I figured out that the doorbell has person detection which is reliable and doesn't trigger with the lights.  I've updated my code above.  Instead of using the topic ""DahuaVTO/VideoMotion/Event"", I'm now using ""DahuaVTO/IntelliFrame/Event"".  The value_template also changed slightly from ""value_json.Action"" to ""value_json.Data.Action""."	1	"[""senor_peligro: For anyone that may have seen my post,  I've updated it with new findings to fix an issue with motion detection.  The details are in the EDIT notes of my original post.""]"

They're called tails, and they head to your consumer unit (aka fuse box, breaker board, distribution board etc).\n\nOn your consumer unit, there's usually a liftable flap, behind which you'll see a row of switches, these are the breakers for the different circuits within your home. Do not unscrew or open anything to do with your consumer unit - just that flap and the row of breakers/switches are all you should be interacting with. You'll usually find your consumer unit in the back of kitchen cupboard, a closet or a hallway on the ground floor, it should be relatively close to the meter itself, as the tails are only allowed to be so long.\n\nI can understand the concern about how your meter board looks - but if it gives you any peace, that's quite a modern looking meter (especially given it's Zigbee-enabled) which means it was installed relatively recently.

I have a door sensor that I need to be able to trigger remotely, however, the set up I have right now isn't able to use an application to unlock a door remotely. It does, however, have a sensor that unlocks with movement. Any suggestions for either a remote controlled flap or otherwise that can generate movement to unlock the door when Im not in that room.

Replacing the system isn't an option currently."	0	[]

In long:
Hi guys, i am like you maybe saw from my earlier post a noob in these kind of things. But i am trying to figure things out even with the help of chstgpt3 i am not getting any further.  

I have a HP t620 thinclient, 4core 8 gb ram amd. I have installed home assistant OS latest version on it, i used the firmware x86-64 generic. I am very pleased with the performance, but not so with how some simple stuff can get complicated. I understand that this is for more people with experience, but these kind of things could help us noobs get experience.

I have frigate up and running for couple months now, it works nice, sometimes only some errors in the log i don't get, but they don't bother.

But now i have received my tpu first i ordered the coral dual edge tpu, knowing that most likely only 1 tpu will work but i saw there are adapters from bluesmoke for that of needed the double tpus.
But couldn't get this working. So i searched and since i had waited for 6 months for that to receive i now saw the m.2 B+M key version available with 2 days shipping.  So i immediately bought it, now i am trying to get this up and running. But i already get stuck at the point of following the steps discribed on the google coral page. Is there any of you who likes to help me or through here or through a private chat?
When i try the first echo code installing the drivers i receive an error, i tried just booting up without any installation and it seemed to recognize that it had a tpu, i saw it in the log of frigate after setting up the detectors,  but it seemed like it didn't know how to use it. If any of you could help me out i will post on the forum and here a step by step noob guide to help others with it. Because this is such a great pain in the behind. Kind regards for already reading this long story.

Edit: my goal is facial recognition, but i want to learn the steps in between and also i don't know how fast i am going to learn to use docker. I already tried it a bit but couldn't figure it out, so i started with HA OS."	9	"['nickm_27: HA OS already comes with the coral drivers included so there is no reason to worry about that.

2 - When it says host, I assume that’s just the local IP of my Pi? Does Tailscale make any difference here?

3 - It says port 3000 but I’ve heard people using different ports, which port do I choose?

4 - When it says username and password, does this mean I have to create an account initially on the AdGuard website? This is no problem I just want to know the correct process.

The other one that I found, which had serious potential but turned out to be a dud, is [OpenSky](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/opensky/).  This integration creates a radius around your house and then identifies when an aircraft is within that radius.

Another device in the same cabin was able to reach the network within the house, so I paired that first, then reset the dimmer, and now it all works!

EDIT: I guess [https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/advanced/remote-adapter/connect\_to\_a\_remote\_adapter.html](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/advanced/remote-adapter/connect_to_a_remote_adapter.html) could be an option here?

We've just had a small cabin placed at the bottom of the garden.

It's about 10 metres from the house, and the lightswitch in the house that's closest is a MOES in-wall 2 gang smart switch, but the Zigbee signal doesn't seem to reach to the smart dimmer in the summer house.

I've recently taken to using ESPHome Bluetooth Extenders pretty much everywhere and the cabin has wifi, physical network cabling, and mains power running in to it so I'm hoping there's an option I can use to make the leap between the two locations.

I'm running Zigbee2MQTT if that makes a difference?"	8	"['severanexp: IKEA usb charger with zigbee.

I recently moved my ecobee over from HomeKit to HomeKit Controller and I’m curious about the refresh rate or polling speed others have seen that have used HKC.

With HomeKit, the motion sensors immediately changed state on my phone and understandably the HA ecobee integration obvious has a delay from the cloud. Recently I've had a couple of instances where ecobee's room assignments for the sensors were lost and all automations went with it.  So I tried moving it to Home Assistant via HKC so I could do more customization on the automations and improve reliability.

With HomeKit controller, I expected similar performance to HomeKit on my phone but it seems like the response rate for the motion controllers is still several minutes at best.

Has anyone been able to get closer to real-time response to motion updates with HKC? In HomeKit I assume the rapid response is due to Bluetooth comms rather than via Wi-Fi and I’m guessing that’s not how HKC works behind the scenes?

Any insight or help would be appreciated.

I bought one of these with the thought that's it's perfect to run as a HA Assist satellite device. I saw the M5STACK ATOM Echo is being used by the dev team and wondered if the software could be installed on the ESP-BOX too at the expense of display support, or maybe the screen could just have a static clock on it for now if detected.

Also I have a raspi with the Google AIY V1 voice kit that could also be a satellite (currently running with Mycroft/OVOS) if there was any plans for software for that."	1	"['_mineshaft_gap_: I have one as well.

The idea is that whenever a product is almost empty or finished, I can simply scan it, and the barcode scanner will forward the barcode to Home Assistant using [**https://github.com/markusressel/barcode-server**](https://github.com/markusressel/barcode-server). From there, Home Assistant would look up the barcode in an Excel list using a Python script and then add the product's name to my shopping list.

At the moment, I am stuck with establishing a connection between Home Assistant and the barcode-server. The barcode-server has a WebSocket API, but I'm not sure how to connect to it from Home Assistant. I've been searching for information on how to do this, but I can only seem to find guides on connecting to Home Assistant's WebSocket API, not the other way around (i.e., from Home Assistant to a client, in this case, the barcode-server).

Any help, guidance, or resources to help me establish this connection would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!

The inability to constrain versions of a script with the same parameters from running together. So I can specify that a script can only be run in `single`, `parallel` mode...but what I _really_ want is a script to adjust my thermostats(I have 2) but you can only run it against one thermostat at a time. \n1. The fact that you can\'t have JSON as a state value. So if you want to talk to an API for your trash company, get that data back and then display a notification on your dashboard like ""Hey trash pickup is delayed this week because it\'s St Patrick\'s day""....guess what - each field from the API has to be it\'s own sensor, which means not only do you have to re-implement a bunch of shit in each sensor to get that value, but actually building this is borderline impossible due to the fact that you can\'t do any kind of filtering logic to get the value you want in `json_attributes_path` or `json_attributes` meaning you now need to have one rest sensor to actually *GET* the data from the API, then a bunch of other template sensors to read that sensor\'s state and parse it down to something useful.\n2. ~~The inability to use templates for REST `GET` requests. Need to talk to an API that wants semi-dynamic data like your location or a timestamp? Well guess what buddy, you\'re outta luck. You can do it for `POST` requests in the body...but not get requests in the URL. Seriously why.~~ EDIT: This is all wrong. What you _actually_ can\'t do is have dynamic data in the `POST` body.\n3. The new lighting controls. Sorry. Yes, I know they look nice...but they\'re terrible to use. My wife hates them. I hate them. Surely I don\'t need to elaborate on this.\n4. Whatever coked-up mess of an algorithm dictates where things get laid out on the dashboard. I\'ve given up trying to understand this and just accepted the fact that my dashboards currently do and always will look untidy. Move something up one element and now it\'s in another column. Move it up two elements, now it\'s in the first column again but moved down 3 places. Adding a single new item to your dashboard seemingly can transform it from being a narrow two column dashboard to spanning the whole screen with 4 columns. I can only assume that this layout algorithm was the same person who designed the layout tools for images/text in Microsoft word. The only way to get any kind of sensible behavior out of it is to forcibly constrain the layout with vertical/horizontal grid cards.\n1. The inability to refer to ""people"" as a whole. As-in ""I want this automation to be triggered when everyone that the device tracker knows about are detected""\n1. Speaking of the device tracker - why do I have to refer to people\'s devices in the default notification service. Why can I not just say `service.notify_lenswipe` or have a `user` attribute to notify all of that user\'s devices. Instead I have to manually specify what device the notification goes to `like service.notify_lenswipe_pixel2` or `service.notify_lenswipe_ipad`. This means several things. Firstly it means that if my phone\'s entity id ever changes, I have to either update it to be the same as my old phone, or go and update all my automations - which is absolutely super! Secondly, it also means that it\'s very difficult at a glance to tell the difference between versions of my phone that the device tracker has from the unifi integration(to determine if I\'m on the WiFi or not - and therefore home) versus the android app on my phone. Really it should be possible to just say `notify.lenswipe` and the notification gets chucked into what ever message queue HA have running and whatever device I acknowledge it on first gets it.

I got a Shelly 1 Plus for my garage door. 3D Printed a mount for it and put it on my garage door opener. I am also going to get an Aqara sensor to watch the status on the garage door. So I'd like to set these up in Home Assistant, then when the garage has been open for X amount of time, send me an alert so I can close it from HA (might set up an automation to do it automatically, but haven't decided yet).

My problem comes in when all of the tutorials show that I need a reed switch for the Shelly. I wasn't intending to use one of these.

I tried to integrate them into HA when I switched, but found it to be kind of a pain. I finally sold the plus earlier this year but since the dots are almost a spam product (for a while, you could get them bundled with almost anything from amazon), there was no point in selling them, so I ripped its brains out but kept the speaker part of it. I thought if this is ""the year of the voice"", the brains of HA sure have to come up with a solution to get my HA listen to my voice, so maybe I can reuse them.\n\nI actually found the M5Stack Atom, but from the two videos I found, it didn\'t seem to work too well (I think that was January), so I discarded that idea.\n\nKind of a pleasant surprise to see that device mentioned there again, I might give it a go after all. I still feel weird talking to tech, but if there\'s an easy solution to creating a speaker for some audio feedback, I\'m all for it. And who knows, maybe my attitude towards speaking into the void changes. I was just really appalled by how much data amazon collects. I don\'t know for the US, but EU (or maybe just German) law requires them to hand over all data they collect upon the user\'s request and what a creepy adventure it was going through those files… I got those alexas in 2018, used them a little bit with a homebridge integration, but after a while only for spotify playback. I still had some 150 audio files, in some of them you could hear when the dishwasher was running and some parts of phone calls were ""accidentally"" recorded. \n\nIf having a local voice assistant just gets 1% of alexa users to ditch that shady ass product, it was all worth it.', ""strawberry_gin: Is there any planned support for a Piper docker container that isn't an addon?

New here, and new to reddit. I have an older navien thankless water heater. Works great when it's in recirculation mode but is basically useless otherwise.

Where would somebody start to do such a thing?	7	"[""more-cow-bell: Are you saying when you are using hot water the unit is not turning on the burners automatically?

But it only takes a couple of minutes for the pump circulate the hot water. I have done this and it works. \n\nI currently use a smart plug with my tankless water heater recirculating pump. I have it set up to start recirculating when I am home during the hours I am awake. Personally, with this set-up, my gas consumption is low.

Because of the way my plumbing is set up, when the recirc pump turns on, it's basically instant hot water. But no matter what I do, if it isn't recirculating, then the water just doesn't get hot. I might just end up running an external pump and then go with a smart plug."", ""rolyatrd: No, it's too old. It's a NR-210A.

Listen, what I'm trying to do should be easy. I got myself a a little Zwave outlet connected to Smart things Hub 3 which is integrated to my HomeAssistant.  


**Now here's what I want:**  
If the outlet becomes unresponsive (presumably because it lost power) then I want to perform actions. 

**Now here's la pinche problema:**    
It's really on the SmartThings side. When I unplug it it takes several minutes (up to 32 to be exact) before ST knows and passes this info along to HA. ST has this variable for ""checkinterval"" which is set at 1920 seconds. I cannot figure out how to change this or if it even can be changed.   


So, is there a way either in HA or in ST to force poll this thing every n minutes, get a response, and if no response then do something?  


Where is this ""checkinterval"" var set? Is this from the device? From ST? Can it be modified?  


Is there an abstract way to poll/ping it through HA and get a response?  


For this purpose I need better resolution than 32 minutes. I could live with 2-3.

(Or maybe I'm just stupid and bad at Googling. Literally who knows.)

First, I made an automation triggered by tapping the NFC tag on top of her food bin. It will change a Boolean toggle to ON. 

`alias: [Dog Name] Got Fed`

`action:`

  `- service: input_boolean.turn_on`

`data: {}`

`target:`

`entity_id: input_boolean.dogname_fed`

`mode: single`

Then, I made it so that every day at midnight and 4pm, the toggle was reset to OFF. 

`alias: Reset [Dog Name] Feed`

`description: """"`

`trigger:`

  `- platform: time`

`at: ""00:00:00""`

This enables the reminder automation, which I've outlined below. It's a doozy (or at least it was for me when I was first building it), so I've added some notes inline.

I have setup a cloudflare domain name and have ports running back to my instance (with router / firewall setup as well).   This has all been running fine.  No local access to HA instance, all runs via Cloudflare (with their firewall etc).

I'm trying to setup MQTT and have issues where the MQTT integration cannot connect to MQTT server (installed via HA Add on, Mosquito MQTT).  I figuring because all traffic has to run via Cloudflare, cannot just use ""core-mosquito"" as the broker name - this needs to be another URL.  User has been setup and tested.

Thinking that I need to push my MQTT traffic in via cloudflare also - I've setup in cloudflare another sub-domain, with port forward established in router.  Entering this new URL eg [mqtt.mydomain.com](https://mqtt.mydomain.com) (with port 1883 --> port forwarding) doesn't work either.

Cannot connect.  Is my methodology sound here?  Is this how I'd need to setup MQTT with Cloudflare.

1682603733.0	27-Apr-2023 06:55:33	Help! Issues Adding HA to Existing NGINX Reverse Proxy with SSL	LoungingLemur2	1	130myc3	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/130myc3/help_issues_adding_ha_to_existing_nginx_reverse/	"Ok so I've been going crazy over the last few weeks trying to get this to work. Here's my setup; everything runs within the same Win10 Pro PC:

\- The following ports are forwarded on my router to the Win10 machine IP:

* 80:80
* 443:443

\- HAOS 10.0 running in VirtualBox

\- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS running within WSL2

\- Docker Desktop running on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

\- NGINX docker container running within Docker Desktop

\- Nextcloud docker container running within Docker Desktp

&#x200B;

**NGINX Config Info:**

I successfully installed certbot with the duckdns plugin and obtained certificates for the following (sanitized) domains (even though wildcart certs are supposedly supported, I couldn't get anything to work with them so I just used certbot to create certs for all these domains):

* mydomain.duckdns.org
* nc.mydomain.duckdns.org
* ha.mydomain.duckdns.org

\- My Nextcloud instance is successfully proxied via SSL to its domain, so I know that my SSL certs are working correctly

 

`server {`  
    `listen 443 ssl http2;`  
    `server_name ha.mydomain.duckdns.org;`  
    `ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.duckdns.org/fullchain.pem;`  
    `ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.duckdns.org/privkey.pem;`  
    `location / {`  
        `proxy_pass http://192.168.1.B:8123$request_uri;`

`proxy_set_header Host $host;`  
        `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;`  
        `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;`  
    `}`  
`}`

I think my issue may be one of two things, let's address which IP address first:

**POSSIBLE ISSUE #1**

* 192.168.1.A: IP for Win10 host machine
* 192.168.1.B: IP for HA instance (it runs under a different IP); network adapter in VirtualBox is in bridged mode
* 172.30.32.0: HA internal IP (sounds like it's the same for every HA installation)
* 172.20.55.C: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS internal IP

For my Nextcloud NGINX server block, I need to use the command `proxy_pass http:172.20.55.C:<NC PORT>` in order for the proxy to work correctly. This makes sense as the Nextcloud instance is running within Docker, whose IP should match the IP in Ubuntu from `hostname -I`. However, **which IP address do I need to place in my proxy pass command for HA?** Obviously I've tried using all of the above IP's, as well as 127.0.0.1. Here is my current HA Config file as well (clearly I just put every IP in the trusted\_proxies section while troubleshooting this:

`# Remote access settings`  
`homeassistant:`  
 `external_url: https://ha.mydomain.duckdns.org/`  
 `internal_url: http://192.168.1.B:8123`  
`http:`  
 `use_x_forwarded_for: true`  
 `trusted_proxies:`  
    `- 192.168.1.0/24`  
    `- 172.20.0.0/24`  
    `- 172.30.55.0/24`  
    `- 172.20.55.C`  
    `- 172.30.32.0`  
    `- 127.0.0.1`  
    `- 192.168.1.A`  
    `- 192.168.1.B`

I am successfully able to login to HA via the internal URL shown in this config.

**POSSIBLE ISSUE #2**

Port 443 is forwarded to the host machine IP address (192.168.1.A). Since HA is running on 192.168.1.B instead of 192.168.1.A, is this issue preventing NGINX from proxying correctly? If so, how can I fix this without changing how I'm running the various programs (e.g. I want to keep HA within a VM, and NGINX within docker).

I do not want to use any addon's within HAOS in order to enable external access...I want to proxy via my existing NGINX reverse proxy.

Once I made the above change and rebooted HA fully, everything worked (a quick reload didn\'t affect anything).\n* Also, I initially had my NGINX configs split among different files to make my life easier (i.e. common proxy\\_set\\_header statements were included in a proxy.conf file, as well as the statements to enable the web socket).

In order to run docker on a windows machine, you need to install Ubuntu in WSL2 or stand up a Hyper-Visor.

You can also access the proxy config file for each proxy. \n\nSo WSL2 is still not really production ready, its meant for development work more than anything else right now.

I have 3 Wyze cams, set up thru Wyze Docker Bridge and then added as Generic Cameras based on the RTSP feeds. Those then go to Frigate. Yesterday all was working fine, and no changes were made to either Frigate or the Bridge, yet today, the Bridge will show the initial snap shot when I restart but not play video

=ISSUE WYZE BRIDGE =

When I hit play it says  ""The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported ""

Then on the Frigate side, at least when the Docker app was up and running, I had another set of issues.  I can never get it to show a live stream (on my Amcrest cameras either). It would just show the initial snapshot and stay there. For Frigate here is my frigate.yml

=SUMMARY=

Like I mentioned, just so odd as it was at least showing the Wyze cameras live feed in Bridge app yesterday and with no changes, now not working. Wondering if I maybe had too many connection errors and now its throw codes with talking to Wyze servers?

On the Frigate side, as mentioned Ive never been able to see a live feed (maybe folks dont use this for live feed anyhow). I did see it detected a Person on 3 occasions however it gave me an error when trying to play (sorry dont hve that handy but can get if needed). 

&#x200B;

=QUESTION=

On the Frigate side, I see hardware acceleration is suggested. I am running all of this off my TS453a box with Celeron N3510. I tried using the std intel option but it gave me an error. When removing it worked (again this was last night). Not sure if there is an option that works for Celeron? And more of a VM question but for the VM I can set the CPU for it. It defaulted to Intel Core i7 Westmere however there is an option for Pass Through (celeron is not an option). Not sure if this matters but thought Id mention.

'type: custom:button-card  
entity: media\_browser\_button

navigation\_path: >-  
/media-browser/browser/app%2Cmedia-source%3A%2F%2Ftts/provider%2Cmedia-source%3A%2F%2Ftts%2Fcloud'  


It creates a button that leads to the page, but then its multiple clicks to return back to the dashboard. I was hoping I can use browser mod for it to open a pop up instead but can't seem to figure out how.

RoachForLife	1	130jy39	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/130jy39/got_integration_to_smartthings_working_but/	"Hi all, so finally got the Smartthings integration to work. After setting up my port forwarding and DuckDNS with Lets Encrypt, it ended up being such a dumb thing preventing the connection. For the external URL of HA I forgot to add the port, which the integration was using for a webhook. Anyhow...

So as a previous (well current still I suppose) ST user I have not only my zigbee and zwave devices on it but also some others like ecobee and rachio, which I now have as integrations in HA as well. 

When I brought over the connection I just brought it all over, meaning I have a good 40 devices that are on both. Now there are several ways to remove this and just seeing if the method matters?

I could

1. Remove from ST all together (not ready to do this just yet plus I like the flexibility of having in both for now)
2. I believe I can modify the token to exclude these devices at the token/access level
3. Now that they are already in HA, I see there is a 'disable' option per device. Not sure if any issues doing that way?
4. Lastly, I could just ignore them. Im thinking that means more network traffic and processing tho so probably should remove. For the time being Ive moved all the dupes to its own Area to easily distinguish. 

With that said, any thoughts on the matter are appreciated. Also would #2 and #3 effectively be the same?  Thanks all!"	5	"[""Kristopher_73: Option 1. \n\nI left ST Summer 2022 and my home was running all EDGE (Beta) drivers, but hated the road Samsung was taking the platform with 'updates' and 'new features.'\n\nYou may have your reasons for wanting to keep ST, but will tell you from a person with a purpose built and well thought out smart home....HA has no comparison and you wouldn't regret making the full switch."", ""RoachForLife: The reason, at least for now, is I don't have a zwave or zigbee dongle, so ST is powering just those devices for me.

In a different post about zwave devices it was mentioned the 700 series had a issue as of late and the 800 has even more. But the 800 sounds more future proof once things are more stable for sure. I am sure I will get to that point, maybe sooner than I think (especially considering I set HA up on a whim and after a good 40hrs invested to research and set most everything up, now Im hooked). :)', ""Kristopher_73: Yeah, doesn't take much to get hooked when you realize the power of it.\n\nI've had no issues with my 700 series stick, so could be other people's setups or not using USB extensions on them.

I've recently used this site (https://tasmota-sml-parser.dicp.net/) to change my meter definition in order to get more values from my meter, which worked fine. The only problem is, that after a certain time the total meter value will be added to my home assistant energy dashboard for some reason. Does anybody have an idea why? In the first picture it seems like there is just one bar. It's not. It's just the total meter value that has been added between 7 and 8 in the morning, so the other bars are not visible. When I manually change the value, it's fine again. But it will happen again the next day.

I am trying to setup one of my tablets as a wall tablet and my main device is my phone. So i have an automation, which needs to send a message to my phone when it's time for prayer. And i also have another automation for the wall tablet, because i want only the wall tablet to play the call for prayer. I tried several things and there is an blueprint, but it doesn't do exactly what i want. So i made myself the automation for the wall tablet to play the call for prayer, when between certain times because the baby is a very hard sleeper and wakes up from the smallest breath you take. So between 9 in the morning until 9 in the evening it can play and at night so after 9 to 9 it is not playing. But what happens is the prayer around 2 o clock playes fine, the prayer around 6 o clock in the evening should play but doesn't and also the notification for it is delayed to two hours later. Also around just for 9 in the evening there is also a prayer and that one is also not playing and the notification is delayed, same for the late night prayer, but the prayer around 3 o clock at night/morning i receive the notification on time but doesn't play like it should be.

I'm brand new to HA so bear with me.

I'm trying to trigger a TPLink Smart plug to switch on and off depending on the state of charge of a LiFePo4 battery. The MQTT message source is another Raspberry Pi on the network running Solar Assistant which receives information from the Inverter and Battery shunt. Solar Assistant sends MQTT messages which HA reads perfectly fine.

I have tried both with and without the Mosquito MQTT broker  (still not entirely sure what a broker does) and HA seems to receive the MQTT messages fine either way. All the data from the MQTT messages loads great into HA and I can create gauges and other cards with the data.

I suspect I am simply entering something incorrectly into the automation fields in HA. When listening to # in the MQTT settings, the pertinent message is formatted [as seen here.](https://imgur.com/a/8YGMZ2n) 

For this example, I want the switch to turn on when the battery SoC gets to or goes below 25%. [Here is how I've written the topic and payload.](https://imgur.com/a/DEtGC99)

However, I am experiencing an issue with the device. The sensor only updates the temperature and humidity readings once an hour, even though the manual states that it should update more frequently if the temperature changes by 0.6 - 0.7 degrees. I use my air conditioner every night, and the temperature in my room changes by more than this amount. As a result, I am not getting accurate readings from the sensor.

I'm relatively new to HA, but do have some programming background. I'm trying to dip my toes in the water a little bit more and trying to setup the following scenario.

* I've integrated a TP-Link HS110 smart plug into HA. It can be controlled and monitored currently (daily usage, current consumption etc).
* I have an XBOX plugged into the HS110 and want to be able to monitor how many hours it has been used for based on time above a certain wattage e.g. > 20 watts for the day.

The main reason I need to monitor the wattage and not just whether the smart plug is 'turned on' is because the XBOX can be in standby mode and not actively in use which means that I don't want to count those hours.

What I'm trying to achieve is something along the lines of 'if the XBOX has been actively used for more than 2 hours during the day then turn off the smart plug'

I'm assuming that I'll need some form of custom entity, but just not sure where to start.

1682559405.0	26-Apr-2023 18:36:45	PSA: You can setup a second homeassistant instance just for radio interfaces for better locality and HW failback.	waka324	23	130632e	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/130632e/psa_you_can_setup_a_second_homeassistant_instance/	"So my homeassistant install is on a proxmox VM in the basement. 

I ran cat6 to an upstairs closet and setup homeassistant on a PoE powered raspberry pi 4.

From there, I added the skyconnect dongle, my zwave dongle, and 433mhz sdr to the pi and flashed the multiprotocol FW to the skyconnect. With the silabs addon installed, the zigbee coordinator is exposed via TCP, and can be added to the primary instance using the zigbee2mqtt addon with the following config:

port: tcp://ha-radios.home:9999
adapter: ezsp

This has the added benefit of exposing the openThread instance.

Then, my 433mhz devices can be added via the rtl433 addon, pushing to the primary MQTT instance, and running the RTL433 discovery addon on the primary.

Finally, zwave can be added via zwave JS UI addon, running the zwave2mqtt integration on the primary instance.

All together, it allows me to put the radios in a more central location, and allows me to failover the proxmox vm to another machine with high availability without figuring out how to swap hardware. The second homeassistant instance makes managing the secondary instance really easy too.

I eventually want to expose the bluetooth on the pi via the same way ESPHome bluetooth proxy is done. 

Figured I'd document here so that prople know this is actually doable, as i hadn't seen anyone trybthis yet.

1. In doing this I no longer can access HA via my IP address or homeassistant.local. Do I need to do something in the config to make that still available? Only works via duckdns now

3. On the note of IPs and duckdns, when setting up devices, generally speaking should I still use the static IP instead of duckdns?

My question now however is how do I set up my remote access without breaking Homekit? I assume iPhone is using DNS to connect to the bridge, given that it broke after I messed with that, so then what DNS entries do I need for it to work?

&#x200B;

Hi All,

I'm really stuck with this problem.

**Home Assistant** **2023.4.6**

Supervisor 2023.04.1

Operating System 10.0

Frontend 20230411.1 - latest

I've had HA set up for a couple of years, and been using the homekit bridge that whole time, it was all working fine (other than devices frequently showing up as not responding).

I just recently set up remote access to HA. The changes I made:

1. Set up a port forward on my firewall (pfsense)
2. Added a DNS entry on pfsense so that the external hostname would resolve to the internal IP
3. In HA itself, under System > Network > Home Assistant URL, in the ""Internet"" field I put in the external URL that I set up in both my port forward and DNS entry.

After that, my homekit accessories wouldn't connect anymore, at all. I did some research and found solutions online talking about editing a config.json or mdns.interface files and but none of the solutions say where those files actually are, and my googling for those file locations didn't get me anywhere. So I just gave up on that, tried to delete and readd my HASS bridge to homekit, and ended up having to totally delete and reinstall the Homekit integration because apparently there's no option to make the QR code appear again after initial setup (wtf to that?).

I'm not at the point where I've undone all my remote access and DNS entries, rebooted my iPhone, firewall, and HA, and I still can't add the bridge. iPhone keeps telling me accessory not found. They're on the same network, I've undone all the changes I made, I don't understand why it can't find it? The System > Logs on HA aren't giving me any errors, so I'm at a loss?"	0	[]
1682520831.0	26-Apr-2023 07:53:51	Ping automation to flip a switch	Compusmurf	5	12zjx9m	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12zjx9m/ping_automation_to_flip_a_switch/	"I want to make an automation that:

Pings something reliable on the internet.  EX 8.8.8.8

If it fails to ping consistently, like once a minute for 10 minutes to flip a physical outlet switch off, then back on, clear the counter for the ping and restart the automation.

Here's my use case.

If my router reboots because of ANY reason, including a power outage, my FIOS ONT gets confused and sets the port speed to 10Gb and won't autorenegotiate the speed when the router comes up - 2.5Gb.  I have to manually reboot the ONT.  I have a switchable outlet now that the ONT plugs into.  So what I want to happen is home assistant automation that pings out on the internet once a minute and if it fails to ping for 10 times in row  (10 minutes worth) it tells that switch to power off, wait a minute, power on (thus rebooting the ONT) then to clear the automation counter and start over.   Obviously, the automation needs to reset the counter if during the ping count is successful.

I know there's devices out there like:  https://www.amazon.com/ezOutlet5-Internet-WiFi-Reboot-Switch/dp/B0861NX6H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8   That does this, but why buy another device to do it if I can use HA and the devices I already have?  :)

I just don't know where to start with the logic of this."	11	"[""quixotic_robotic: The ping integration already exists to automatically ping anything at a given interval.

I have several custom sensors all around my house and it just works like a sharm. I even flashed some of my Shellys to esphome und prior connection errors I had with the Shelly Firmware are gone with esphome.

So I thought about increasing my investment in esphome by buying future devices which are esphome compatible.

Or is esphome fine since it uses the native AP and not mqtt or coiot?"	15	"[""MattHashTwo: Wifi inherently is shared resource.

I have a Growatt solar inverter and after long time i found a undocumented modbus command to retrieve the state of the attached Energy Meter (SMD230).  


The problem: An answer do my requst i get a 200 byte message with all the voltages, current and energy datas. Any idea how to send it to different sensors in esphome? Here what i have:

              return float_value;
        unit_of_measurement: kWh
        accuracy_decimals: 1

Esphome doesn't accept the same custom modbus request in a second sensor. So what i need is to return multiply values to different sensors in one lambda? Any suggestions?

What i tried: It seems that the inverters doesn't accept single request to only 4 registers. To 108 = 6C and a register size of 4 bytes:

    custom_command: [ 0x1, 0x20, 0x00, 0x6C, 0x00, 0x4, 0x81, 0xE6]

i get:

Modbus command to device=1 register=0xBF40 countdown=0 no response received - removed from send queue

Why 0x6C leads to a register request of 0xBF40?

Once I connect the Xiaomi Smart Hub (lumi.gateway.v3) to HA through the Xiaomi Gateway 3 integration, the gateway very briefly shows the connected zigbee Xiaomi devices and then immediately loses connection to them both in HA and in the Xiaomi Home App. 

Trying to reset the zigbee devices will result in nothing as the gateway will fail to pair to the devices unless rebooted. Even then, the gateway will lose connection to the devices after some minutes unless I have disabled the Xiaomi Gateway 3 integration.

How bizarre… Any ideas on what might be the problem?"	0	[]

The `zwave` and `ozw` integrations were built on top of `openzwave`, an external open source project. The developer for that project has since ceased development on the library. The `zwave_js` integration is built on top of `zwave-js`, which is also an external open source project, but is both in active development, and more recently, sponsored by Nabu Casa to help keep it going.\n2. You didn't have to switch if you chose to stay on the same HA version as before. But I'm guessing you wanted new features, which people wanted for Z-Wave as well, hence the switch in later versions.\n3. The original integrations couldn't be developed any further because `openzwave` development stalled. The `zwave_js` integration has quickly surpassed the feature set of both of the earlier integrations and it does not make sense for the team to maintain multiple integrations for the protocol in the core when we feel pretty good about what we've got in `zwave_js`. It's worth noting that most users have seen a significant improvement in reliability with `zwave-js`.\n4. As mentioned in a comment below, some devices don't do instant status reporting. I believe the older GE switches had this problem with manual changes. `Openzwave` addressed this by aggressively polling devices which would drain the battery of battery operated devices and create significantly more traffic on the network. `zwave-js` has opted not to poll as aggressively. While you may not agree with this approach, it is a design choice, and if it's something you feel strongly about, you are welcome to submit feedback in the parent project ([https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js)).

For overkill, also run an LTE hotspot/router with its own powerbank to remove reliance on mains powered internet.\n\nIntegrations would include TV, Media Players, Smart Bulbs, Smart Blinds/Curtain Rail, Doorbell Camera with live feed and recordings. So I could track basic usage, to monitor her routine and also know who's calling to the house/when she leaves and returns to the house.\n\nMore intrusive devices would be cameras in most rooms, with movement detection and recording/logging. 2 way mic/speakers in the cameras. A pressure sensor in the bed to detect when she gets in and out of bed. Possibly sensors in favourite chairs in the living space. Emergency buttons in each room that dial me/local emergency services. I wouldn't count on using a wearable to do fall detection, as it is reliant on her remembering to wear it and charge it. Lastly, HA mobile app with high accuracy GPS tracking enabled to track movement outside of the home, in the case of getting lost or being unable to contact via phone.\n\nMost of the intrusive stuff would need consent and trust. What I've proposed is costly and very Big Brother but it is highest visibility, which is what would give me peace of mind. As my sister lives nearby, it will likely remain a thought experiment and not need to be implemented.\n\nDepending on your grandpa's level of technical competence, you're probably better off getting him a TV with an in-built camera and scheduling regular Zoom or Skype calls to supplement physical visits. The less button clicks involved the better. e.g. TV on > Press button X to accept the call. (You could use HA integration to control this and remove your grandpa entirely).

Wherever you look up the SNZB-02D, it has this high quality high contrast screen shown, which is simply not the case.  In reality, the display has mediocre contrast and bad viewing angles. This is expected to a degree from an LCD screen, but this was just underwhelming.

I like the sensor and Zigbee module though, so for anyone interested I disassembled and reviewed the device:

So, for example - with one sensor, I am able to add VAT and additional costs like this:   


  `- sensor:`

`- name: epex_spot_price_ct_per_kWh_with_vat`

`unit_of_measurement: ""€/kWh""`

`availability: '{{ states(""sensor.epex_spot_nl_price"") != ""unavailable"" }}'`

`state: '{{ (states(""sensor.epex_spot_nl_price"") | float / 10 * 1.21 + 2.54)/100 }}' #add vat and extra costs, then into 0.00 cents that can be understood by threshold input`

`unique_id: ""my_unique_id_epex_spot_price_ct_per_kWh_with_vat""`

&#x200B;

However - this sensor (sensor.nl\_energy\_prices\_average\_electricity\_price\_today) is where my chart data is - and I'd quite like to add VAT and additional costs (like above) to each attribute for the hour in this sensor. - therefore so each bar int he chart is correct. 

You can see a screenshot of the attributes here: [https://ibb.co/z60cfHY](https://ibb.co/z60cfHY)

  
And the code for the chart, which uses the sensor:

`type: custom:apexcharts-card`

`graph_span: 36h`

`span:`

  `start: day`

`now:`

  `show: true`

  `label: Now`

`header:`

  `show: true`

  `title: Energy costs today (€/kwh)`

`yaxis:`

  `- decimals: 2`

`series:`

  `- entity: sensor.nl_energy_prices_average_electricity_price_today`

`stroke_width: 2`

`float_precision: 3`

`type: column`

`opacity: 1`

`color: ''`

`data_generator: |`

`return entity.attributes.prices.map((entry) => {` 

`return [new Date(entry.time), entry.price];`

`});`

&#x200B;

The end result  I would like is a chart that includes the original data but with VAT added (21%) and 2.54 euro cents.

Hi people,

for some weeks, I have an error with the Homeassistant Dashboard ""MoreInformation""-View.

I use my old Android-Tablet with the Fully Kiosk Mode App.

That all works great. But when I try to load an RSTP-Stream by clicking on the Dashboard-Card, the first image shows up but the Video-Box keeps reloading / loading.  
The max-length of the video keeps getting longer, but the current-video-position keeps being stuck at 0.

I tried to get more information by connection to the tablet via USB and try to read the Console output and the Connections via the Chrome Inspector DevTool.

But the Console keeps empty. Some request are being cancelled, but I can't figure out why and how they are cancelled.  
The cancelled request are relevant requests, so I think the cancelation is the problem. But I can't figure out why they are being cancelled.

I also tried to do the same in Chrome on the device, but it's the same problem.

In my PCs browser, there is no problem at all.  
So it might a Version Problem?"	0	[]

I am planning on buying this camera system (EU): [https://nl.annke.com/products/h800-8-kanaals-beveiligingscamera-set-met-4-bullet-cameras-4-turret-camaras?variant=42627460137216](https://nl.annke.com/products/h800-8-kanaals-beveiligingscamera-set-met-4-bullet-cameras-4-turret-camaras?variant=42627460137216)

and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with ANNKE or any other 8CH camera setup with similar price/performance. I am thinking of adding frigate to this but I'm not sure if I would need extra hardware to make it work.

Most probably I will need to move home assistant from my RBP to an intel NUC or something like that to support frigate, as I probably will not be able to run it on the included NVR."	17	"[""Tardlard: Even with an Intel NUC you'll want to opt for a Coral TPU (or more than one, never had that many cameras myself)"", 'irate_ornithologist: It seems like this includes an NVR already has human and vehicle detection. Why would you want to process those separately through frigate? Frigate (to me) seems the most compelling to use as a part of or alongside something that can store video as an alternative to a dedicated NVR unit. \n\nI would buy or build the NUC (or other mini PC, optiplex, etc), a coral, and individual cameras. Leave HA on the Pi, run frigate and the mqtt broker on the NUC.', ""daern2: I use 5 cameras through Frigate with an RPi4 and it works very acceptably, typically consuming around 50% CPU.\n\nI have to use hardware decoding and secondary streams, custom tuned to the correct resolution and framerate for Frigate to reduce the impact on the RPi, but it's very stable and works well. Obviously, object detection uses a USB Coral, and there's no way it would work without this!\n\nWhatever you do, you'll need to be sure that the NVR allows you to access individual camera streams in some sort of generic way that ffmpeg can ingest on Frigate. Without this, you're not going anywhere! Personally, I have IP cameras on an IP NVR, but I actually address the cameras directly as this gives more flexibility with secondary (and tertiary) streams."", ""kitanokikori: It's impossible to click your link outside of NL because it redirects to a generic landing page, but you probably just need the cameras, not the NVR box or other hardware. Frigate usually _replaces_ the NVR box (though you could certainly pay for the dedicated Annke NVR box as well). \n\nThe important thing to check for (these cameras do support it), is H.264 support (_not_ just H.265!). Browsers cannot natively display the newer format, so despite it being a better codec, it's actually a huge pain in the ass because your Frigate server will have to transcode this content and it will be very CPU expensive"", 'aram535: Might want to check out the ""The Hook up"" channel.

Not really necessary if you have a decent cpu. The new detection process in the latest release is supposed to be even better.\n\n\n\nFor my setup, the coral is cool but not necessary. I haven't noticed a power usage decrease at all with the coral, so it's never going to pay for itself."", ""daern2: > Frigate usually replaces the NVR box (though you could certainly pay for the dedicated Annke NVR box as well).\n\nDefinitely optional. Personally, I store all of the 4k video, 24/7 on my (hardware) NVR, and only use Frigate for alert generation and associated clips/snapshots. If I wanted to wade through a lot of footage, the NVR is quite a bit more powerful.

JamesGiesbrecht	4	12z38ct	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12z38ct/netdata_integration_not_working_when_running/	"I have a Home Assistant (VM)  and Netdata docker running on the same Unraid Host.

I added the example netdata sensor from the [HA Netdata Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/netdata/) to the `configuration.yaml` and swapped out the IP and name for my own. I also verified the data\_group and element values were correct for my netdata agent.

When I restart Home Assistant with that integration, the logs show the following error: `Platform netdata not ready yet: None; Retrying in background in 30 seconds`. This is consistent after restarting all HA/Netdata multiple times including the host system.

None of the other logs show more detail, thats the only message I can see on HA. In the netdata container logs I can see connections continually being made from HA and closing after being idle for 60 seconds.

I tried installing Netdata on the Unraid bare metal and the integration worked perfectly! I was able to see multiple resources as I added them.  
But since Unraid is Slackware based, the app was wiped out upon restart. I tried installing it in non-volatile storage but it wasn't working. I'm no Linux master and I didn't want to mess with system stability so I left it at that.

&#x200B;

Any ideas why the bare metal install worked but not the Docker?  
I have them (VM and Docker) on the same custom bridge `br0` each with their own IP address.  
I have `Docker custom network type: macvlan` and `Host access to custom networks: Enabled` configured in Docker settings in Unraid.  
I can make api requests from the HA terminal to Netdata and can see traffic from HA in the Netdata logs.  
Is there anything I am overlooking in the networking department?"	0	[]

I’m thinking of monitor power usage of my house in HA. My house was installed with a “smart” meter, but unfortunately I couldn’t directly interfacing with it, except the LED that blinks when 1 Wh is consumed.

I am aware of the HA Glow project, but the location of the meter and the fact that I can’t modify the power board make it impossible to run the setup on mains.

So my meter has 3 requirements:
1. Ultra low power, able to run on AAs for a year
2. Cheaper than commerical alternatives
3. Running on Zigbee is a plus

What I have in mind now is a HA Glow setup and swap in a ESP-01 plus a DS1683 chip to do the counting while the ESP8266 is in deep sleep. However I want to push one step forward to use Zigbee to further reduce power usage. Any cheap and easy to dev SoC out there? Or I should stick with wifi instead? 

Thanks"	3	"[""scottydont_2488: It looks like the DS1683 would drain your AAs in around a year even before adding an ESP.

Just using a few timers, workday sensors, binary sensors and actionable notifications \n\nDaily limit for tv is 1.5 hours during the week, 2 hours on weekends or holidays. When those limits are reached, Apple TV will power off. Powering it back on will execute a 5 second timer and power off again. This continues until timers are reset at midnight. \n\nWhenever the Apple tv is in state playing, timer counts down. No penalty for pausing or idle time. Not that mean ;)\n\nThe automations also depend on the app context for playing state. For example, if app is Disney Plus, state is playing, and during child awake time, timer decrements. If the above conditions except app context is Amazon prime, the timer remains idle as child cannot launch it from their profile. HA can’t see which user profile is active. \n\nFive minutes before timer expiry, adults get an actionable notification with one more episode or one more hour options. If dismissed, nothing changes. \n\nOne more episode sets a binary sensor which triggers an action to bypass the timer. When the episode, or movie has reached 0 time remaining, sensor is flipped and the auto power off action is active. \n\nOne more hour sets a binary sensor which activates a one hour timer which decrements, just as the primary one does. Upon expiry binary sensor flipped and back to auto power off action. \n\nI have a couple webhooks setup as shortcuts to extend and hour, one more episode, free day or restriction which does what one would expect by the description. \n\nBeen in place for about a month and works out pretty good.

* Touch enabled
* 10.1""+, I have full approval for even up to 20ish inches

with some nice to haves like
* Could power the Pi itself (has a USB port on it)
* Thin, so it could be more flush with the wall

I am trying to work up an automation to open the correct door when me or my wife (and potentially son in the future) return home.

The way it is currently, is that when ""I"" enter the zone, my door opens and same for my wife that when she enters the zone, her door opens.

However, if we swap cars for whatever reason, the wrong door opens. 

I have a few ideas of what I'm trying to do, it's just a little beyond my skillset to resolve it.

I've added a d1mini to each car and am able to see their connection. The problem with these is that if you went turned on the car, long enough for the ping to engage, and then came back in the house, HA wouldn't know if the car left or was turned off.

I could include in the logic the garage door. It's pretty reasonable to assume that the car cannot leave without the door going up. That could be part of the logic.

I am looking for advise on helpers or a rough pseudo automation to help point me in the right direction.

&#x200B;

Im building out my home assistant home and am confused about cameras and the terminology that is used when discussing them.

 My goals with cameras are as follows and #2 is most important and what i will be using the most

1. Store files locally (no cloud or paying for recordings)
2. **I want to be able to stream video to my phone when im at home AND not at home and using cellular (preferably without too much technical work with VPN's etc.)**
3. good home assistant integration.

&#x200B;

My confusion comes with the local control + streaming while im not home. Is something that WebRTC can do, or do i need to be on the same network as the camera to watch the feed?  If my main use of cameras is just viewing the feed when im not at home, is there any advantage to using something like reolink over a nest camera?

DIY your own notifications."", ""peterxian: If you want to access your camera streams, or anything inside your LAN for that matter, from outside your home (i.e. not on your local network), you need something on the public Internet. It could be a cloud provider, a secret VPN/tunnel you setup, or something more creative but it must be very, very secure. If you don't trust the camera makers' cloud services (and you absolutely shouldn't) then your choices are VPN/tunnel or a third-party service. If you're not interested in learning the technicals of how to set up the VPN/tunnel securely, I recommend a service. The best option is Nabu Casa Cloud, which provides remote access to HA for $6.50/mo. Another good option, if you have Apple stuff (HomePod/TV and iPhones), is they come with a remote access service (Apple Home) that works pretty well with Home Assistant (this is what I use).

Let's call them Spa and Spa High. The 1st turns on the spa and turns the actuators. The second boosts the RPMs so the bubbles turn on.

Hey All,

I'm just getting my feet wet with more ""advanced"" configuration options and am working on my mobile dashboards. Above is the start of my mobile music dashboard, and I've hit 1 major roadblock that I can't figure out (but is probably easy). In my experience, typically a horizontal stack will self expand to take up the whole card area, but for some reason I can't make that happen now. Any ideas, other than creating additional blank cards in my horizontal stack, to get my buttons to center? I'm hoping to re-use much of what I'm working on for the mobile music dashboard for other views that will contain different amounts of buttons, so figuring this out will make that process much easier. 

I'm currently using a container template ([https://community.home-assistant.io/t/fun-with-custom-button-card/238450](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/fun-with-custom-button-card/238450?u=ayostepht)), and some inspiration from u/Smeen89's dashboard they shared recently.

Thanks in advance!

I have seen a bunch of threads but most are 1-2years old so Im mainly posting this to see what is the best as of April 2023. Also to note was hoping for a relatively plug and play experience.

However, I am curious on how people handle this behavior and ensure the home doesn't go absolutely bonkers.

With the 5+ monthly 2023.X.Y updates , power outages, required reboot of the host (HA OS is running as a Proxmox container), etc I have been growing frustrated at having to manually juggle things when HA OS reboots. Any ideas? Currently avoiding all but the mainline monthly updates and its running behind a small UPS to handle blip outages but still running into this issue a couple of times a month or more."	15	"['Rannasha: The easiest way to reduce the number of restarts is to not install every update. I typically get the monthly one in the second half of the month, as the initial release of the month is mostly about the new features and later releases are bugfixes. So unless there\'s a must-have feature for me, I\'ll wait for a few bugfix updates to have rolled out.\n\nI\'m not sure why your Proxmox host has to restart that often. Mine doesn\'t. Most updates for Proxmox don\'t require a restart of the host. But you can always plan your HA updates to align with your Proxmox restarts, so you can do both in one go.\n\nAs for the automations, there are some ways to smooth out interruptions. The first is by reducing how long automations run. If you have an automation that first does X, then waits for 2 hours and then does Y, consider splitting it into 2 automations. Add a helper boolean that is toggled by the first automation and trigger the second automation when the helper boolean has had the right state for 2 hours, then having Y as action as well as another action to reset the helper.\n\nThis approach is still somewhat sensitive to restarts, because this trigger is reset on HA restarts. Depending on the nature of the automation this may or may not be an issue. If it is, have the first automation set a date/time variable for the time the second automation should run and check the current time against this variable.\n\nAnother tool is the ""Home Assistant"" category of triggers. You can have automations trigger upon HA starting up or shutting down. You could use these to bring things to a sensible state upon startup. Add helper variables to your automations to keep track of what the desired state should be and use startup automations to achieve this. The shutdown trigger can also be used here, but it\'s less useful as it\'ll only help when HA shuts down gracefully (e.g. not during power outages that aren\'t covered by the UPS, or crashes).', 'diabetic_debate: The way I do it is, I have seperate automations if two actions need to happen far apart in time. For example, if I want to turn on a light at sunset and turn it off at sunrise, I have two automations that will do each step on their own. \n\nSince they are independent of each other, one running or not running has no effect on the other.', '_avee_: The solution is not to have long-running automations.\n\nAutomation you use as an example can be either split in 2 or converted into a single-action automation with multiple triggers. Same applies to pretty much all automations where you have wait_for_trigger or something similar.\n\nTemplates are great at simplifying automations: with proper setup most automations don’t need to be anything more complicated than “when single condition passes, trigger an action or several”.', ""generalambivalence: You probably need to share some yaml examples of automations that are giving you problems on restarts.\n\nDepending on the trigger, it might be something like you have your automation to trigger when a light state changes to `on` but when you restart, it changes from `unknown` to `on` which would trigger the automation. If you set the trigger when the state changes from `off` to `on` the automation wouldn't trigger on restart since the state is changing from `unknown` and not `off`. This is just an example and it may not apply in your case."", 'JCHHenderson: what kind of things do you need to juggle?\n\nI have a template \\`input\\_select\\` called \\`input\\_select.light\\_scene\\_should\\` that outputs the name of the scene that should be \\`on\\` according to ambient light.

I prefer to have fewer automations with triggers that are grouped logically rather than more automations with names that are grouped logically.\n\nFor example, I have a single automation to control reading lights on and off in my kid's room. They turn on at a specific time, turn off at various times based on whether it is a school night or not, including a check to make sure they are off (they have control over turning them on and off within time windows).

I want to build a weather station primarily to calculate evapotranspiration, but the raw weather data will obviously be useful too.

I have an ESP32 which I will use to provide the sensor data, say 10 minute sampling interval.  I then plan to save it to Influxdb running in HA, and display it using Grafana, also in HA.  Don't know how to do that yet either.

Where do I calculate Evapotranspiration?  I can use a python script to do it

https://soilwater.github.io/pynotes-agriscience/notebooks/evapotranspiration.html

and I could run that script on the ESP32 with some mods, but it would seem better to collect the daily data (ETo, Temp & RH min/max, total solar radiation, average windspeed) on the HA machine, not the ESP32 - if the ESP32 is turned off it will lose the calculations for that day.

How do I collect daily min/max, average, cumulative totals, on the HA machine?

How do I run the python script for ETo on the HA machine?"	19	"[""sembee2: I wouldn't use Home Assistant for this.

Bit of context:

I have a couple of labs i manage in two separate buildings in close proximity (100M away from each other). Each one has a variety of different things i'd like to monitor like air quality, leaks, CO2 detection, temp, humidity, etc. Currently i'm using Unifi dream machines, access hubs, UA6-Pro wireless for internet/network, security, and access control. 

I've been scratching my head a bit trying to suss out what sort of alarm system i should get (motion detection/sirens) and remembered we've been using a pi-powered home assistant setup to monitor a few of the variables mentioned in the lab with the ESP addons.

That coupled with the fact there are no off-the-shelf ""smart lab setups"" i'm thinking of getting an intel NUC and running linux on it to act as a ""smart lab"" building control system.   


There will be a lot of sensors to set up for a single lab + alarm system for the building and so I'd like to ask 

1) How easy it would be to ""clone"" what is on a NUC in one building in the other building to minimize repeating the same work i've done in one space to another?"	3	"['ElephantOrnery: 1. Super easy!', ""5yleop1m: You have two options for cloning,\n1. Clone the whole drive, you can use software like clonezilla to get a bit-by-bit copy of the fully setup NUC and restore it on the other NUC. \n\nThe down side here is initially you don't want both NUCs running at the same time since they'll be clones. You'll need to go into the cloned NUC and change things like hostnames and other unique settings so they show up as two different systems on the network. \n\nFor security you should also change all passwords so they aren't shared between the two devices. \n\nThe other option will require some manual work, you can setup both NUCs and then setup home assistant on one NUC and then use the home assistant backup addon to take a full backup of the first NUC. Then restore that backup onto the second NUC. \n\nThe down side here is you'll still need to setup most of the two NUCs, but you'd only have to do the major Home assistant setup on one NUC."", ""lastingd: Barely an inconvience.\n\nThere's also a remote HA addon https://github.com/custom-components/remote_homeassistant""]"

Since April 13 I have this weird thing when after 2 am every night, Alexa integration seems to turn on 4 lights. 1 light is in bedroom, 3 in living room.
The lights turn on with about 10’ difference.

I’ve uninstalled the Alexa Media Player integration completely from HA, restarted it.
The issue still happens.

There is no automation that runs at that time, I don’t have any Node-RED automations using Alexa nor turning on these lights (I’ve searched in Node-RED to be sure).

Any ideas what could be causing the issue?
Anyone else had something similar?

I'm struggling a bit tonight and I am just disappointed in my own abilities to figure this all out.

TLDR; HA running in container on Ubuntu, Sonoff ZigBee dongle, attempted a passthrough to container, but I can't get anything to pair.

Last year, I purchased an HP Elite desk Mini to run HA (I needed my pi for another project). I installed Ubuntu, docker, running HA in a container. Seems simple enough. Except I came from supervised, and containers (to be transparent) a foreign concept to me.

Fast forward to today. I got the Sonoff dongle (version P). Plug it in and it is not automatically detected by HA. I figured it was the container not being able to see the hardware. So I added the '/dev/ttyUSB0' host in Portainer, relaunched.

Still could not get ZHA set up; ""Add Integration"" timed out and threw an error that said ""Error"".. I don't think it knew what device to add. 

I manually added ZHA to the configuration.yaml, and now I can click 'Add ZHA device' in HA, but I can't pair anything. I've tried a different USB port, a different extension, different devices (Sylvania bulbs, Aqara T&H sensors), etc.

I *think* the Sonoff drivers installed fine (there was no prompt). I *think* the Portainer passthrough worked fine, but how do I know? I *think* the .yaml is set up properly, but again, how do I know?

Can someone please tell it to me like I'm 5 where I'm messing up? Thanks in advance.


Edit: Solution is below!! TLDR, had to manually update windows drivers to get windows to recognize the coordinator (dongle), so I could use the TI software to update the firmware.

I have two nic's in my system to separate IOT network from regular traffic. The first NIC is connected to the regular network while the second one is connected to IOT.

I'm very new to HA.  Just got HAOS running on proxmox a few days ago, and so far I'm loving it.

I wanted to get some clarity about the Alexa and Google integrations.  I *thought* I was going to be able to remove all my devices from Alexa, then use the alexa integretion as essentially a ""portal"" into HA issuing commands directly to HA.  However after adding the HA skill to Alexa, every device in my home has added again to Alexa.  (The first time being my pre-HA configuration, and the second time after adding the HA skill.)

I'm (very slowly) trying to remove my data from Amazon and Google where I can.  So I was interested to remove all my smart home devices from Alexa, and just have Alexa pass commands to HA.  But it seems this isn't how this actually works?

Could someone help a noob understand?

Then when you use some voice command, Alexa interacts whith this entity and you can use it as trigger inside HA automations.\n* There is a skill you can ""create"" (I guess is just follow a tutorial) and use it with the HA add-on Node RED, where your commands are intercepted directly on Node Red and you can run automations with it.\n\nI\'m not aware of other options, but I don\'t have extensive knowledge about alexa...\n\nHope this somewhat helps...', 'ashleypenny: Following this as used it.

I'm trying to get Frigate NVR up and running by way of Home Assistant.

I keep hitting a wall because each bit of software actually requires two other bits of software to work, which in turn each require two other bits, seemingly ad infinitum.  And most of the answers/solutions I've found after extensive searching seem like some real [How to Draw an Owl](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/572/078/d6d.jpg) type shit, at least to me \[an idiot\].

I'm currently stuck trying to get an MQTT integration configured/up and running on a secure managed cloud broker.  I'm all signed up and set up on HiveMQ, but I apparently need to access and edit configuration.yaml to get the integration going and I absolutely for the life of me cannot figure out how to find/access it.  Here's what I've done so far:

1. Intel NUC mini PC
2. Fresh and fully up-to-date Ubuntu install
3. Installed Home Assistant Core via Snap
4. Created account and credentials on HiveMQ Cloud Free
5. Following the HiveMQ instructions [here](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/connect-home-assistant-to-hivemq-cloud/), \[currently stuck on step 5\]

When I pull up the system information via the method outlined [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/), it gives me a specific file path that does exist in my file system, but when I navigate there in the Ubuntu GUI, the folder is empty \[regardless of whether hidden files are shown or hidden\].

I can't use add-ons to access/edit the config file \[as most solutions suggest\], because I'm running Core.

It also says:

>*If you use Home Assistant Core, you can find* ***configuration.yaml*** *in the config folder passed to the* ***hass*** *command (default is* ***\~/.homeassistant***\*).\*

I do use Home Assistant Core, but I don't at all understand what that means.

Why is the config file not where HA says it is?

Is configuration.yaml not really an actual file in the traditional sense?

Do I need to use some other new separate piece of software to even see or access it?"	3	"['gregigk: Why are you running core? I have a mini pc running proxmox and HomeAssistant supervised.', ""hihaatje: > Is configuration.yaml not really an actual file in the traditional sense?\n\nNo, it is an actual file that can be edited in any text editor.\n\n> Do I need to use some other new separate piece of software to even see or access it?\n\nShould not be, any text editor will do.\n\n> I do use Home Assistant Core, but I don't at all understand what that means.\n\nI believe that installing the snap package *installs* the home assistant software on your system, but does not run it. To start it, you usually need to use a terminal command. This is what the ***hass*** command is refering to. As an optional parameter to this command, you can specify the directory containing the configuration file you want to use. If this doesn't exist, home assistant will make a new, empy configuration file. \n\nNow, since you're able to get the directory from home assistant itself it should already be running. But it might be that the snap install runs some containerized version of home assistant. This means that it will create a separate, walled off part of your file system that it feeds to home assistant. Then the file paths will no longer match, since the paths home assistant gets are inside the container, not your entire file system. Is [this](https://snapcraft.io/home-assistant-snap) your version? If this is the case, you first have to figure out where the snap container is running. \n\nAlways a good option to double check is to check via a terminal. If you have no experience in this, don't worry, it shouldn't be too difficult. Open up a terminal session and type\n\n```\ncd [directory given by home assistant] \n```\n\nAnd then \n\n```\nls\n```\n\nTo list the files in that directory. If the configuration file is there, you can also edit it using\n\n```\nnano configuration.yaml\n```\n\n(nano is a sort of mini text editor inside the terminal)\n\nEdit:\n\nI just looked a bit into the snap [documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/data-locations). It seems like snaps are located in\n\n```\n/home/<username>/snap/<snap name>/<revision>\n```\n\nMaybe if you do some digging there you will find the config file."", ""ohheyheyCMYK: Honestly primarily because it was the easiest way. I have a bit of prior experience with Ubuntu, and and I was able to install HA with a few clicks via snap. And since Frigate can run easily as an integration I dont (think) I really need add-ons.\n\nVery open to other approaches if I've actually just stumbled into a world of pain.""]"

I have read through the [Plex integration documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/plex/), and I have single items and playlists working fine. Does anyone know how to get a ""radio station"" to play? I have tried using the playlist example and modifying it.

It seems in a change on GitHub support for stations was added, at least through the Plex media browser.

>entity_id: media_player.plex_player

>media_content_type: PLAYLIST

>media_content_id: '{ ""playlist_name"": ""The Best of Disco"", ""shuffle"": ""1"" }'

I am trying to figure out what the media_content_type is. I assume STATION, or something similar. I also am curious about what content would need to be in the media_content_id field.

Thank you!"	0	[]

I currently have some zigbee devices, and what i like is, that they are connected to a local hub.

Or do they all connect to your router?"	6	"[""404flyer: Home Assistant isn't a closed platform where all devices use the same protocol to communicate to it.

No problems with the original linking, only afterwards. ""Hey Google sync my devices"" also fails but also-- only intermittently. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Bizarre!

I painstakingly went over the HASS documentation and triple-checked every item. I'm aware it's complex and long, so I really invested time into it in an effort to not be embarrassed when I finally resort to asking for help and it ends up being something super stupid. For example, everything is IP addresses no hostnames (other than the CF tunnel host of course), so no exposure to DNS shenanigans. IPv6 is disabled too. I did my homework, best I could.

I also went to Cloudflare and tried a bunch of page rules and WAF rules to eliminate caching and ensure Google is permitted to access the host. Running a mtr from outside my network I show zero packets being lost to the Cloudflare tunnel hostname. It's definitely internet-accessible, I tried with a VPN.

I also checked my LAN's firewall (a UDM Pro) just in case, although I'm using Cloudflare tunnels so no port is opened or anything. Nothing in there to account for this behavior. 

Reading through the Google cloud console action logs, it gives ""BACKEND_FAILURE_URL_ERROR"" which looks like Google can't reach my CF URL. I can't seem to figure out why!

I'm running the very latest version of HASS OS in a Proxmox VM. Config YAML is all bog-standard, nothing unusual, straight from the documentation, including the SECRET_ACCOUNT.JSON file which I also triple-checked was correct. No issues with perms either, everything is readable by root.

Are incoming webhook calls logged anywhere in HASS? I can't seem to find them. 

Anyone have any ideas, other than just paying nabu casa to do it for me? 

Happy to post any config files people need, although again they're very standard. Here's the Google actions log error:

I setup Cloudflare Access on this URL, meaning that any rando coming in from the internet would have access denied by Cloudflare.

Only real solution to that is to use a script that allows every IP Google owns (connecting to CF via API to setup the access group), but that also includes Google Cloud so the security aspect is obviated. \n\nOr to pay Nabu Casa their $5/month, of course.

WOW are these things great. I set up so many automations this weekend that I'm loving so far. Well I still have an FP1 as the presence sensor in my bedroom. I want to set up an automation to pause my bedroom TV and turn on the LED's under my bed whenever I get out of bed at night, but the FP1 is set up through Z2MQTT and setting up regions seems like a pain. I might tackle it eventually but in the meantime I now have two Aqara IR motion sensors that the FP2's have made redundant. Is there any reason why it would be a bad idea to put these on the floor under my bed and have them trigger the described automation when my feet hit the floor? Is this already a thing people have done and I'm just ignorant? lol	0	[]

What confuses me is that in the Tuya App (Smart Life) it updates as expected, but not in HA.

The coordinator is a HUSBZB-1 connected to a USB extension cable. 

The behaviour I'm seeing is that the switch remains connected to the network but after about an hour, it becomes unresponsive via Home Assistant. The only resolution seems to be to delete and re-add it to the network where it will again respond for about an hour and then go silent again.

Let me start by saying that I know I have my hub  in the worst place possible, which is in my basement on the complete far end from my bedroom, but I like it there.

I have had in my bedroom for some time now two Caseta switches.  One for the main lights, and another for the ceiling fan.  I have a Pico remote for each as well and they are on the Lutron 2 remote pedestal.  No problems.

Very recently I added two Hue bulbs to the night stands, and paired another Pico remote to control those two.  It was for the week just sitting loose on the night stand, again, no problem.

Yesterday I ""upgraded"" (don't judge me for overspending on the pedestal, but secretly go ahead and judge me for it) to the 3 remote pedestal.  I put the nightstand remote in the middle.  Lights aren't working.  The other two work fine.  Seems the two remotes on the outside block some of that signal from the center one (I'm sure this works fine with a properly placed hub).  I swapped the fan remote to the inside and the nightstand to the outside.  Nightstand works and fan works.  I assume all is good and move about my life.

I have an automation at night time that if I turn on the ceiling fan it'll turn off after 30 minutes.  I turned it on and went to bed.  About an hour or so later I woke up and it was still on.  I turned it off, but thought it strange.

This morning I checked the logs and it never registered the fan on at all.  I flipped the fan on and off again but from the wall switch, HA sees it.  I do it from the remote, fan turns on but nothing in HA.  I separate the remote from the stand and now HA sees the activity.

As I can gather, it seems Lutron does pair the remote directly to the switch, but for status update it relies on the remote to talk to the hub directly.  Also note that I checked the status in the Lutron app as well, not just relying on HA.  Seems weird it doesn't check the status of the actual switch when flipped, but thought I'd share this info in case it is ever useful to anyone.

I've since gone back to my old 2 pedestal and a separate 1 pedestal stand. I got a refund so now you can only judge me slightly less."	0	[]

I am working on setting up a dashboard for my home brewery and would greatly appreciate your advice. My goal is to create a dashboard that can display information from various sensors and, in the future, control automations such as pumps.

I've considered using BrewPi, but I prefer Home Assistant for its compatibility with different switches and sensors.

Before I dive into one of the three options I've identified, I would like your input on which one would be the most suitable for my needs (or maybe some fourth option I've missed):

**Option 1:** Webpage-card or Picture Element Card. This option involves creating a locally hosted HTML, CSS (and JS) webpage and embedding it in a Webpage-card or Picture Element Card. I would then use JavaScript to update the information using sensor data and control automations.

**Option 2**: External Website (Online or Local Webserver). In this approach, I would create a website (either online or locally hosted) and include it in the dashboard. I could then communicate with the website using GET and POST actions for updating information or starting automations. The advantage here is the ability to use a powerful server-side language like PHP and easily update the layout (e.g., with a MySQL database). Is it possible and advisable to update information through a REST API, for example? I could use Node-RED to easily update the actual information on the website.

**Option 3**: Picture Elements Card (Floorplan Style). The third option is to use a Picture Elements Card, similar to a floor plan. However, positioning everything is quite difficult, and certain CSS-style-options are unavailable. The main issue with this option is the very long YAML which is difficult to update for new devices (like fermenters)

Which of these options do you think would be the best for my home brewery dashboard? Are there any other options or resources that you think would be helpful? I'm open to any suggestions and tips to make this project a success. Cheers!

The automation is easy with home assistant but its the hardware I am stuck on.

Just about all of my searches returned people suggesting the various lawn irrigation controllers which seem like overkill for what I am doing. I am running 1 sprinkler head so I just need to be able to turn on/off the water supply to it. I don't need zones and have zero plans or need to add them.

For example you might have a webserver SKU with balanced specs, DB server SKU that's RAM-heavy, storage SKU with a lot of HDDs, etc. Those SKUs have to be designed to last many years, so you have to ensure all suppliers will continue to stock the parts for any repairs.

Everything has to be budgeted. It's a lot of work.\n\nSubsequently, if there's no need to replace a dead server in a rack, you're right that it'll just be left there if the capacity isn't needed, until the next hardware refresh (servers are usually specced for 3-5 years useful life).\n\nOn the other hand, companies may be either power constrained (at or near capacity for power supply at the data center) or space constrained (no free racks left), so if there's spares on hand and more processing power is needed, that dead server is definitely going to get swapped."", 'look_ima_frog: That show was brilliant on so many levels, but not too good so that they were above making a dick joke.', 'sulylunat: Dammit, now I’m torn about whether or not to stick one of these on my server pc, which happens to be located in my guest room…', 'georgkozy: Merkel wake me up at 7, and if the bedroom lights are not on by 7:05 turn on the siren!', ""bk553: It's German's fault.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77nvJuMmnC4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77nvJuMmnC4)"", ""Th3R00ST3R: I've got 99 voices but a Brit ain't one."", 'Th3R00ST3R: Yes, it was the most realistic, although monotone.', 'krakenant: I wonder if we could get enough money together to hire Paul bettany to record training set for us 😁', 'Asfalots: At some point, could we train it with our own voice?', ""ajmaonline: To set people's expectations, how many hours of voice data does it take for it to be helpful.

&#x200B;

I'm planning to use a dedicated NUC or SFF for my HA and run docker on it, in order to run frigate properly.

As there are several ways to integrate cameras as it seems, I just want to know what would be the right way forward. In some tutorials they are talking about RTSPtoWebRTC some are mentioning go2rtc and I'm a bit lost now on the ""latest/best"" combination for my cameras and how to set them up. 

I'm currently using the picam from[https://github.com/iizukanao/picam](https://github.com/iizukanao/picam) together with its node-rtsp-rtmp server on each of the cams as this provides video+audio. From what I understood the picam is also able to output to a tcp address/port. 

Is there any way that I could get rid of the node-rtsp-rtmp server on each of the cameras by providing the tcp (MPEG-TS) output to a central server (maybe go2rtc? don't know as I don't get all the functionalities of that thing yet) running on the NUC/SFF? is there some kind of addon that provides sth like a listener for the tcp MPEG-TS stream that works well with frigate? 

I hope someone can bring some light into the dark go2rtc corner in my mind :D"	19	"[""nickm_27: frigate comes with go2rtc built in, so that is definitely the recommended way from frigate's point of view to set things up. it is fully features and works with the HA webrtc card, the frigate card also supports mse / webrtc.

I have a dehumidifier in a bedroom and have three long poles suspended under the ceiling that can carry a full set of king sized bed linen, or loads of things on hangers.

This works very well for general washing drying and seems more economical than our old conventional electric tumble dryer.

I have the dehumidifier on a TP-Link Kassa smart / monitoring switched socket and using that I can manage the On/Off and the current draw and so alert for 'Tank full' etc.

Because I'm not coder I have 3 automations that seem to manage all scenarios.

The first one turns it on at 10:30 with the condition the humidity is above 70%.

The second one turns it on if the humidity goes above 70% after 10:30 and before 22:00.

The third one turns it off if the humidity drops below 65% or if the time is 22:00.

I also added a Zigbee button on the headboard that turns the 'On when above 70%' automation off and then turns the dehumidifier off, if we are say ill and want to sleep or are watching TV etc.

I have two questions. 1) I understand that the 'relative humidity' can change as a function of temperature and so I wondered if there was an automagic way of adjusting for that re my humidity setting? (I do have 'Thermal perception' on both an inside and outside temp / humidity senders but haven't made use of them other than a desktop indicator).

2) I use the 'Climate' integration to manage the electric heaters in two rooms and I wondered if that was be a better way to manage the humidity?

Open to any advice or suggestions here. ;-)"	0	[]

So this has been my wall tablet setup for several months now (2x Fire HD 10 - 2017, Fully-Kiosk, + [kiosk-mode](https://github.com/NemesisRE/kiosk-mode) \[via ?kiosk to hide sidebar/header}). I found this design originally on FB, and just changed the info to make it more applicable to me.  I'm not married to any of the information presented, though quick access to the two bedrooms (and especially turning their lights on and off) is helpful.

I may need to go with two separate views (one for each tablet) because my use case for each is different. The one near the front door I'm largely checking weather related things before I leave. With the upstairs one, besides the bedroom access, I'm also locking and unlocking the front door (on the first floor) as a last step before going to bed, particularly if that's well before my lock-for-the-night automation.

Really, looking for thoughts/suggestions/whatever on cards/integrations/etc that people think might be helpful. I'm not entirely comfortable with card-mod, because my CSS ""skills"" are woefully out of date, but I can always muddle my way through.

Things that might be helpful to know about me in terms of what could/should be presented:

* WFH
* No HAF needed
* A variety of doctor's appointments, all over the place
* Most lights are tied to motion sensors
* allergic to a stupid amount of airborne shit
* 2 cameras I can see feeds of, one (Nest Doorbell) easier to access than the other (Eufy Floodlight)
* East Coast US

Feel free to ask me questions about things I might have integrated already if you've got ideas that may be reliant on something specific.

other than the obvious “don’t do it” - is there a comprehensive guide anywhere on the steps to take if you need to change the IP of your router without wrecking your existing HA setup? (or can anyone give me some pointers please)
e.g. I want to switch from XXX.XXX.8.XXX to XXX.XXX.1.XXX

Long story Long - 
I’m running supervised HA on an rpi3 - with quite a number of Zigbee devices & automations working well… however, I have a certain AV device on my network which has an inbuilt static IP that just will not change from the default XXX.XXX.1.XXX (I have tried everything but it just will not budge and so far will not be recognised by my router, but works perfectly fine with an older (redundant) router I had lying around which has the correct LAN IP format set-up)

Currently feeling like I have £1k worth of AV hardware which I will need to hook-up to a separate network in order to operate it remotely… which kinda defeats the purpose of the integrated smart home I am trying to create.

Last resort I can see to get everything to play together is looking like updating my router IP from XXX.XXX.8.XXX to XXX.XXX.1.XXX to accommodate it… although know this will involve a load of issues to my HA setup.

IF I go down this route, how do I set myself up for success beforehand on HA so that I don’t kill the previous year of hard-work getting it sweet?
(would be lovely if I just changed the IP and everything was seamless, but know that is never quite the case with HA)

Again, I understand the base case response will be “don’t”… but please, any guidance would be massively appreciated!"	8	"[""AlTeRnAtE-PoIsOn: Does the router that is running now, support vlan?

I recently bumped into an inexpensive, still in a box, two sets of ted5000 devices. I figured I could dip my toes into the power monitoring with HA. At first the gateway device wouldn't save any settings whatsoever, but after I got firmware updated, I was finally in business. At this point I have one MTU, one gateway, and two remote displays (had to solder new rechargeable coin batteries for those)  


I'm wondering if anybody is still using those devices with HA, and if so:  


1. The built-in support gets me current power consumption in Watts, and current line voltage. Unfortunately, power consumption does not show up in the Energy tab at all. Do any of you poll the APIs directly from the device, and if so - would you mind sharing your configs?
2. I could not save any settings with System Settings Wizard until I upgraded firmware (both gateway & footprints). After upgrading to the latest version I could, but the Utility Settings Wizard still doesn't seem to save any settings, eg: I can't set actual utility rates, etc. Am I missing something obvious?  


Thanks in advance!"	0	[]

&#x200B;

I have been making some progress in getting each room set up with a sensor and identified a generic thermostat for heat and cool for each room. Now for 'remote'-steering the actual thermostat I started implementing this automation logic below. Basically when the remote room wants to cool, the main thermostat is set to cool and then its target temperature is set to one degree lower than the current temp to ensure that it's getting started. Once the remote room reaches temp, the thermostat gets turned off. Similar automation for heating but with target temp set to one degree higher.

&#x200B;

Currently I experience though that the thermostat does not update the target temperature, if I adjust it from the remote room. Is there a way I can debug the automation with logging? Is there something else wrong about the logic or the way I try to update the value?

&#x200B;

Thanks

I have a bunch of smart devices, but all are cloud based and Wi-Fi dependent (Google Homes, bulbs and plugs using Geeni App, Nest Thermostat and a handful of cameras on Wyze). I've be doing a lot of renovations, but that is now winding down and I am looking for some recommendations on security cameras/doorbell cameras. I will be looking to migrate everything to a local network utilizing Zigbee2MQTT so would want compatibility there. Any recommendations are appreciated.	3	['_Rand_: Cameras don’t have anything to do with zigbee aside from some Aqara cameras that seem to have a built in hub, which I don’t believe work with zigbee2mqtt. Any interoperability will be with zigbee2mqtt/HA being the man in the middle and with whatever cameras you chose.\n\nWhat you want are cameras that support rtsp/onvif and record them with frigate/viseron/zonemindee/blue iris etc.\n\nPersonally I’ve had good luck with Reolink cameras, but there are a bunch available from hikvison, empiretech etc.', 'beornraukar: The new Reolink Doorbell has totally local integration into home assistant through the official addon. You can then block the internet access to the camera and it still works great.', 'Flipontheradio: I second the reolink doorbell. Just be aware it does not work with your existing chime box. This was a non issue for me but something to be aware of.']

I'm fairly new to Home Assistant and I've been troubleshooting this issue for a few hours now and could use some advice from anyone familiar with migrating their HA instance from RPi to Proxmox. As soon as try restoring my RPi backup file, I lose connectivity to my Proxmox HA instance and I am unable to connect again. Both the RPi and Proxmox are running 2023.4.6 and OS 10 

I created the HA instance on Proxmox using  `bash -c ""$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/raw/main/vm/haos-vm.sh)""` with default settings

I've tried using Samba Share to see what is happening in the log file but as soon as I start restoring the backup, I get a notification saying that I need administrator permissions to access /config. I have no issues accessing /config before restoring the backup. 

I was able to get some log info with the command `core logs` from the HA CLI but I'm not seeing anything that is standing out as to why I can no longer connect. I've attached an image with the output in Proxmox:

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"	2	"[""jmcgeejr: Here's something I learned and not sure why.  Setup your base image of HA and before you do any configuration via the CLI manually set the IP to what your IP used to be on the PI for HA.  Then go through setup and restore your backup.

I am new to HA, and so I had a good look around before posting this. I am also not afraid to dive in at the deep end, and yet, I would appreciate if you could indicate to me whether the following is possible:

```
At a given time each day (e.g. 4 hours past sunset):
  Let T be the average temperature of the last 24 hours
  If it's been more than fn(T) hours since
  - either the last time it rained
  - or this automation ran
  Then:
    Turn on a device until
    - either 30 minutes have elapsed
    - or current condition changes to rain
```

Thanks,
m"	7	"[""blueshiftlabs: Absolutely doable. You'll need a few helpers:\n\n- A [statistics sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/statistics/) to compute the average temperature over the past 24 hours (`max_age = 24`). We'll call this `sensor.daily_average_temperature`.\n- A sensor that returns the time when it last stopped raining. You can do this with an automation and a date/time helper, although if templates and YAML don't scare you, I'd suggest using a triggered template sensor instead. Call this `sensor.rain_stopped_time` - if you're using the helper, that'll be `input_datetime.rain_stopped_time` instead. \n- Your function, expressed as simple math (no logarithms or anything fancy).\n- A script (not an automation!) that does the necessary service calls to turn on your sprinklers. We'll call it `script.water_lawn` below. \n\nMake an automation. Give it a time-based trigger, configured however you'd like. In the conditions block, set a template condition:\n\n    {%- set rain_stopped = as_timestamp(states('sensor.rain_stopped')) -%}\n    {%- set last_watered = as_timestamp(state_attr('script.water_lawn', 'last_triggered')) -%}\n    {%- set seconds_since_water = as_timestamp(now()) - max(rain_stopped, last_watered) -%}\n    {%- set average_temp = states('sensor.daily_average_temperature') -%}\n    {%- set water_threshold = /* some function of average_temp */ -%}\n    {{ (seconds_since_water / 3600.0) > water_threshold }}\n\nThen, in the actions block, call the service `script.water_lawn`.\n\nTo turn off the water, have a second automation with two triggers - one being the current condition becoming rain, the other being the lawn-watering device being in the 'on' state for 30 minutes."", 'cfrudolphy: Might want to have a look at this integration\n\nhttps://github.com/jeroenterheerdt/HAsmartirrigation\n\nI am pretty sure it does what you want and takes more factors into consideration than just last time it rained or is raining now.', ""CurrentlyInHiding: Just an FYI that you shouldn't be watering your yard at night.

It looks like at some point my MQTT Broker stopped running and I hadn't noticed. Yes, I am a genius. Once it was started again, everything worked. 

So, I've been having problems with my Zigbee reliability. Thanks to a whole bunch of helpful posts here, I am transferring over from a ZHA integration to Zigbee2MQTT.

For context, I have Home Assistant running on Docker on a Raspberry Pi. MQTT is installed on the main Raspberry Pi and Zigbee2MQTT is running via (sudo) Docker Compose.  I flashed the Sonoff Zigbee Dongle with the coordinator firmware.

I've hit what is probably a very silly brick wall--specifically, this error: MQTT error: connect ECONNREFUSED \*\*Raspberry Pi IP\*\*:1883

I know everything else is working because when I use [test.mosquitto.org](https://test.mosquitto.org) as the MQTT broker address Zigbee2MQTT works fine.

I know I can't use localhost because Zigbee2MQTT is running in a container. I have tried the IPs of the Raspberry Pi and docker0 but no luck.

My Mosquitto installation is set to allow anonymous access.

I'm guessing there's something simple I'm overlooking, but I'm not sure where to start. Ideas?

BeerDoctor	2	12wm3n3	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12wm3n3/multi_floor_robot_vacuum/	"I'm curious if anyone has a robot vacuum they like that they have figured out to use with multiple floors in home assistant?

I know the common advice is to buy a robot per floor, but I have a weird split level house with 6x separate areas I have to manually move the robot to.


Right now I a roborock s5 with valetudo, but things get wonky when I move floors.  Valetudo [explicitly states they will never support multiple floors](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/why-not-valetudo.html)

I'm considering dedicating my roborock to one floor and buying a 2nd newer robot to do the other 5x floors.  I have no idea which one I should be looking at though.

We like ours.', ""sloths_in_slomo: It could be possible with a bit of playing around.\n\nI had an issue where if the robot did a run and saw a closed door, later on it would refuse to clean that room thinking it was unreachable. I solved this by doing a run with all doors open, then storing the map file, and later when the robot is docked a HA automation triggers a script on the robot to copy the stored map into the active map file. This way it always starts with a clean map of the whole house with the dots open.\n\nIt would be fairly straightforward to modify this to handle multiple floors. Just record a map of each floor and store them in separate files, the use a HA automation to tell it which floor it is on. It would need to be placed in the same spot every time when doing this.\n\nI tried to bring up the issue about the closed doors with valetudo but the suggestion wasn't taken up, i guess devs think either it's not an issue or is unsolvable (neither is the case).\n\nSo it takes a bit of familiarizing with the files on the robot, but might be workable to run it on multiple floors with one robot"", 'Sure-Temperature: My Roborock S6 allows for saving two floors in the stock app', 'ImATrickyLiar: iRobot’s J7 handles multiple floors automatically.', 'BeerDoctor: Whoa this is ideal!

First i did a full run and then store the map with this:\n\n    # cat set_preferred_map\n    #!/bin/sh\n\n    cp /mnt/data/rockrobo/last_map /mnt/data/map_backup/preferred_map\n    md5sum /mnt/data/rockrobo/last_map > /root/md5check\n\nThen this script brings the stored map back up:\n\n    root@rockrobo:~# cat replacemap\n    #!/bin/sh\n\n    if md5sum -c /root/md5check\n    then\n      echo ok\n    else\n      # file has changed, replace\n      cp /mnt/data/map_backup/preferred_map /mnt/data/rockrobo/last_map\n\n      # restart controller\n      kill -9 `ps | grep RoboController | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1;}'`\n    fi\n\nI then have an automation on HA that runs `ssh robo replacemap`, and run it 1 min after it docks\n\nIt would be possible to use something like this to store multiple maps and load them again. It's a bit hacky and needs to kill the robot service to get it to bring up the stored map again, but it has been working for me.\n\nIt would be even better if something like this was included as an option with valetudo, but I'm not sure how togl get interest with it. And it' be better if there was a way to load the map without killing the robot controller, but it works. From my perspective storing a good map is much more useful than having it use the last map, eg because of the issue if it sees a closed door and then thinks it is permanent.""]"

I also have a Aeotec Z-stick 7 on firmware 7.19.2. I am coming from Smart Things after they deleted all my stuff. I am pretty good with software and electronics in general but oh my god, so far this ecosystem is a massive headache at every turn.

Anyways, how do I add zwave devices? From Smart Things, you usually just put it in pairing mode and click the button. The devices are still able to be paired/excluded using my old Smart Things hub.

I have the Zwave JS addon and the Z wave PC Controller. The z stick shows up in both. I run exlusion mode and none of my zwave devices pop up as being excluded when I trigger them. I run inclusion mode and nothing happens when I trigger devices. I do this in both Zwave JS and the PC Controller program. Nothing happens. Main devices I am trying are GE ZW1001 outlet and ZW4003 switch.

What am I doing wrong? Is there some documentation on this I am missing? Is the z stick not compatible? Is it busted? Please help!

Edit: ended up being the most obvious and simple issue. My region was set incorrectly! Changed that and everything works perfectly as expected! Thanks for the quick replies!"	5	"['daphatty: Have you excluded your devices from Smart Things? Or even better, have you factory reset your devices?', 'flaquito_: First, I\'d recommend that you uninstall the Z-Wave JS addon, and instead use the Z-Wave JS UI from the Community Add-ons section. That will give you a really nice UI that you can add to your sidebar if you want. Then, configure it with your Aeotec stick.\n\nOnce you have that configured, go to integrations and install the Z-Wave JS integration. That\'s the part that lets Home Assistant communicate with the add-on. Now that you\'ve done that, you can either add devices from the add-on or the integration. Most things can be done directly through the integration, but having the advanced UI is really nice.\n\nTo add devices from the integration, go to the integrations section and click ""Configure"" on Z-Wave JS. There will be an ""+ Add Device"" button at the bottom-right. Click that, and then do whatever you need to reset your Z-Wave device. It should automatically go into pairing mode and show up in Home Assistant.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any other questions!', 'egoalter: Before everyone keeps telling you to install this version, use my hardware and other (well meaning?) advice, Zwave is a bit different than the protocols you know for instance WiFi - it\'s more akin to Bluetooth and if you have never programmed to that device, it can be a bit hard particular the first time.\n\nI have about 20+ Zwave devices active with HASS using the very stable Zwave JS. My only \'issue\' is how HASS names devices - don\'t plan on reusing them, with a different name. That will cause headaches, although it can be done if done right (not that I\'ve found that really documented).\n\nFirst of, this is relatively easy if the device has NEVER been joined/adopted before. If it has, some devices will not negotiate with a new zwave broker.  And infortunately the procedure to hard reset a Zwave is a bit different on each device.  Usually you have to hold down the button for 10-15 seconds and hurry to hit ""delete device"" from the JS console. I\'ve seen it work automatically I\'ve seen it only manually - mostly the latter. If your system has never seen the device before, just resetting the device _should_ be enough, but it\'s not always easy to see if there\'s an existing configuration on it. Out of habit I do this now for all new devices before I adopt them.\n\nThe basic procedure requires a bit of fast touching. I advise using the mobile app, head to where you\'re plugging in the new zwave device for the first time, put that device into ""add mode"" using the procedure you laid out, and THEN hit the add device. HASS will show a menu where zwave is first - as long as it\'s done within 20-30 seconds the device should be found. If not, there may not be a signal. Plug the zwave device in very close to where to you have broker antenna that HASS is using. And this is another complication. Not all Zwave devices are created equal. You\'ll need something close to the 700 series or higher of the plus version, to get a mesh where each device will be a routing point for others. This means you can reach much longer. If the device you\'re trying is missing this, or the devices you have do not support this it\'s easy to find dead zones in a house.\n\nLastly if connectivity is noisy, you may see a partial adaptation. Using ""heal"" on the device can resolve that in most cases. \n\nI learned a lot by putting the broker into debug mode and inspecting the logs. It\'s one way to see if communication is spotty or if your HASS thinks it already knows the device under another name (if so, remove that - I even had a duplicate name once - hard to resolve). But I wouldn\'t really recommend that unless you have a fancy for IT protocols. \n\nOnce the device is adopted it\'s been rock solid. All attributes are seen, the response to state changes are fast. And I love the battery life of the sensors.', ""NapkinsOnMyAnkle: Hey thanks for this. Will definitely be asking more questions! It looks like I was already using the zwave JS UI. What's the difference if I may ask?"", 'flaquito_: Z-Wave JS UI is an implementation of Z-Wave JS that adds extra stuff. It adds a really nice control panel, the ability to connect to an MQTT broker (not necessary with Home Assistant), debugging, Z-Wave network visualization, and some other stuff.\n\nZ-Wave JS UI used to be called ZWaveJS2mqtt, so if you see references to the old name, that should help clear up some confusion.']"

I want to keep the house pressurized. Experiments with a box fan in the window with a filter duct-taped on, powered by a smart plug, seem to keep the house more comfortable, keep temperatures more even between rooms, control allergies, and clear co2 from cooking faster. (It comes on when humidity is sensed in the bathroom, when co2 goes up in the kitchen, when the dryer is on, or when the house is negatively pressurized.)

This is because by pressurizing the house, air won't seep in through random cracks and the only air coming in goes through the filter.

Currently I am using two Aqara sensors - one outside and one inside - to calculate the pressure differential;  but they only read to 1 hpa which is about 0.4 inwc; the research I have read is that you should aim for 0.05 inwc of positive pressure.

I've considered mechanical hvac switches wired to an esp32 but these are only accurate to 0.15 inwc (still better than the aqara).

Anyone else experiment with pressurization? Anyone have ideas on pre-built pressure sensors that speak zigbee or bluetooth?"	25	"['madsciencetist: You want a differential pressure sensor.

So air will seep in through cracks and crannies. Not only will that bring in allergens such as pollen, it may pick up other nasty stuff from unfinished spaces such as dead bugs, rodent droppings and mold.

I have recently received my dual tpu after 6 months of waiting and i also bought and adapter for it to fit in my t620 pcie slot. I am really not home in to pcie slots and everything around it, so please don't be harsh on this noob. I have a hp t620, it has for what i understand a pcie slot, i think it is an 1x v2 from what i can find online, but in the bios i saw a setting with pcie 4x. It is the slot where normally a wifi card would be sitting in. I don't want to use a wifi module, i use a lan cable. But what happens is when i put it in, the system starts fine, but i can't acces my home assistant anymore. When i disable the port in the bios it will work again or when i pull the tpu out. I think there is something that the system thinks it is a wifi module but doesn't know what to do with it. I want to use it for face detection with frigate and double take. I have home assistant os general x86-64 installed, it is up to date. Is there any i can do or try? Thank u in advance.	3	"[""rich33584: Most likely it wont work in that wifi card slot anyway and if it did, only 1 tpu will show.\n\nIf these will fit, get this:\n\n[https://www.makerfabs.com/search.html?&search=MBS.PCI20102.2](https://www.makerfabs.com/search.html?&search=MBS.PCI20102.2)\n\nDo the cheapest shipping and youll get it in about 10 days in the United States..

But for now i need it to work on 1. I had already seen these but where the break is at those golden pins, is in my hp the other way around. I don't know if it is a problem. I also have 1 usb 3.0 and 1 usb 2.0 free on the motherboard inside the case, is there any adapter you know of i can use there or a m2 slot. I have m2 slot for memory but i could place that m2 storage to the usb ports with an adapter"", ""sero_t: I now received the b+m key version, it was in stock for couple hours and maintained to get one, received in 2 days.

Even if you successfully pair it and it works, after some time the lock goes into some deeper sleep and can't be used with zwave unless you unlock it with the native app. And even then, it sometimes stops working and you have to exclude it and set it up again.

We recently got a couple Sonos speakers that I now have configured in HA as well, and am able to do things like play various music streams, adjust the volume, etc.

I figured it would be nice to update the ""bedtime"" automation to also turn the speakers off. So I went into the editor and added another action to this automation that looks like this:

    service: media_player.media_pause
    data: {}
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.kitchen_speaker

When I'm in the editor and run this automation it does what I expect it to do. The speaker is paused, and all the other lights in the automation turn off as well.

The trigger for this automation is just a menu button. In the editor it looks like this:

    platform: state
    entity_id:
      - input_button.bedtime

When I click that button in the menu all the actions in the automation that turn off the lights work fine, but the speaker does not get turned off. It's only when I'm editing the automation and run it that way that the speaker turns off. I don't see anything in the system logs after running the automation via the menu button.

Why would this one action work properly when invoked one way but not the other? Am I missing something somewhere?"	6	['dukemib: Have you checked the traces?

Tuya is burning cash and running up big losses. Tuya runs the iOT platform behind most of the worlds branded smart home devices."	42	"['peterxian: There\'s a lot of misinformation in this thread so I thought I\'d try to clarify a few things having read the financial statement and investor briefing.\n\nFirst, Tuya (the company) apparently makes money in two key areas: selling their Platform as a Service, which is a one-time fee paid by device makers for ready-made apps and libraries, and selling Software as a Service, which is subscription-based smart homes for businesses like hotels, commercial buildings, etc. \n\nThe PaaS revenue this quarter was WAY down, almost 50% below a year ago, while SaaS revenue was slightly up. They blame supply-chain inventory slowdowns for the drop, and expect a recovery next year in the device market. Their margins are still very strong (and growing) at 43%+ so they are making money on sales, when they get any. They ""only"" lost around $20M this quarter which for a startup is normal to good in this perspective.\n\nThere is no indication (at this time) they have any plans to charge users for their cloud service. They do mention expanding to add user fees for value-add services like push notifications and content, but not for using the web platform, which is paid for by device makers\' fees. \n\nPersonally, I found two items in this report to be somewhat surprising. One, for a company we\'ve all heard of that has ostensibly enormous reach in the Smart Home space, annual revenue of $208 million seems *incredibly* small. These are not the scale of numbers I expect from an industry heavyweight. They clearly don\'t get royalties from device sales (which is probably their selling point compared to alternative platforms).\n\nSecond, even though they\'re losing $20M a quarter, they have almost $1 BILLION in cash reserves. Presumably this is investor/seed money, and will last them many  many years at their current burn rate.', 'aprettyparrot: Why I like things I don’t need an account for. Finding them lately has been harder though', 'Grim-D: ""Total gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased by 37.6% to US$20.2 million from US$32.4 million in the same period of 2021."" \n\nSo their profits were down from the same quarter in the previous year but they still made $20 millon so don\'t think their in much trouble yet.\n\nEdit: Grammer', ""zolli07: It's sad that all people here are happy about it, yeah I agree that tuya is not a great company and their product not top notch quality, but everyone need to realize that Thier agressive pricing strategy brings down the prices in the whole IoT segment as well.

Non-GAAP net loss was US$5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to US$31.2 million in the same period of 2021. The difference between loss from operations and net loss in the fourth quarter of 2022 was primarily because of a US$10.2 million financial income achieved mainly due to well implemented treasury strategies on the Group's cash and deposits recorded as short-term investment."", 'GhettoDuk: But sales are not where they are looking to make money.

How do I set up the config.yaml?

Context:

I am building my own irrigation controller which uses a wizfi360-EVB-Pico (raspberry pi pico basically). The unit has some libraries that can be used for sending MQTT via wifi. The library expects the subscription and publishing topics to be set prior to connecting to the MQTT broker and if you want to change them you need to kill the connection, reset the topics and fully reconnect to the broker - not really what I want to do.    
To work with this set up I have set up my pi to publish a dictionary with each valve as a key and a value of 0/1. I am able to decode this on the home assistant side with the config in the image (I just added the command topic name and am not using it right now). 

But when it comes to sending a command back from home assistant I am at a loss how I would achieve this since I am only using a single topic. What I would like to do is publish the command using a dictionary just like the one I publish from the wizfi360 or send a int which I would interpret as binary on the pi side which I would then decode as flags, i.e. 2=>0010 would be the second valve.

I just got into using MQTT with home assistant so any help/reccommendations on tutorials would be greatly appreciated."	2	"['lastingd: Without a ""Why you want to do it this way"" preamble, this is an abstract request for help.\n\nCare to explain further?\n\nConvention would have each valve with it\'s own topic for status and command and these could be controlled from a single HA switch entity setup as a group.', ""Dr-LucienSanchez: I agree that this is not the ideal way to do this, and I wouldn't do it this way except that to me it looks like the mcus wifi module has an at-serial command which requires the topics to be set prior to connecting to the broker - [at commands](https://docs.wiznet.io/img/products/wizfi360/wizfi360ds/wizfi360_atset_v1118_e.pdf) - unless I am mistaken. \n\nIf I am right then my choices are, disconnect from the broker and reconnect everytime I want to send/receive for a valve from mqtt (this takes a while and I'd prefer not to do it this way), have one MCU per valve (which is an overkill and seems like a waste) or find a way to send commands for multiple valves on a single topic. I'd prefer the last since all the valves are controlled by a single MCU.\n\nDo you know if it is possible via an inbuilt or custom message type to achieve sending a single command message with multiple entries i.e. valve 0, valve 1, etc?""]"

My big x86 file server/docker host decided to call it quits, and I am considering not reviving it anymore (smells like motherboard failure), but reengineer my setup a bit.

I have a Raspberry Pi 4 with an USB SSD. I was considering just installing Docker on the base OS, mounting my existing volume and dealing with any eventual consequences from moving from x86 to arm. But then, alternatively I could install HassOS as well and have this be a bit more plug-and-play. I have not found how I can move my current config over since I never used Home Assistants backup functionality. I have always been snapshotting at the file system level. Is there any recent tutorial on that that I haven't found yet? I am comfortable on the command line.

My home assistant config goes back to the days when lovelace was the hot new thing, I am quite vested in being able to take it over to a new environment intact.

Also, how about Frigate? I have an USB Coral, would an RPI4 cope with 2 or 3 cameras in addition to HA?

Thanks"	7	"[""boxalarm: Run a full backup of HA. Install HA on the Pi4 and when's it's installed, there's an option to restore your config.

It finally filled up to the point where I couldn't do anymore updates on it. I had a Raspberry Pi 4 just running ADSB so I robbed that, put a 64GB SD card in it and installed HA.

Instead I used a service call under Dev Tools (Insteon>Add all link) to add devices one at a time by pressing the set button to link to the 2448; this info was tucked in an obscure corner of the documentation and had me scratching my head for a while.  A couple months back there was a release which — I think — claimed to fix adding devices by ID but I’ve not needed it.  \nI’ve deleted all the Insteon scenes and replicated them in HA, which is much more flexible and reliable.  I expose all my devices through the HomeKit bridge and can control them using Apple’s Home app or Siri, and also via Alexa/Amazon Dot.

I found a solution to the unpleasant thing, that the screen brightness and color temperature of my Linux PC never fit to the color temperature of my lamps. (Home assistant runs on a raspberry pi.)

I want to share, how I solved it in case somebody wants to do the same:

Linux PC:

* install redshift (but don't use the automation)
* create a user 'homeassistant' on the Linux PC.
* write a script which automatically copies the .Xauthority file to the homeassistant user's home after login of your own user (e.g. by using you window managers autostart function)
   * to avoid issues with permissions, passwords, rights, ... I used scp:
      * Copy your Linux PC user's ssh public key to /home/homeassistant/.ssh/authorized\_keys so you don't need a password
      * Copy the ssh public key of your raspberry pi's homeassistant user's to the same file on your linux PC
      * the script to copy the .Xauthority is only this line:

&#x200B;

    #!/bin/bash
    scp /home/user/.Xauthority homeassistant@localhost:""

&#x200B;

* on your raspberry pi:
   * write a simple bash script ""linuxpc\_screen.sh"" to change the screen settings on your Linux PC

&#x200B;

    #!/bin/bash
    ssh homeassistant@linuxpc ""DISPLAY=:0 redshift -x"" 
    ssh homeassistant@linuxpc ""DISPLAY=:0 redshift -P -O $1 -b $2""

&#x200B;

* In home assistant
   * make helpers: two input\_text and one button
   * In your configuration.yaml add the shell\_command

&#x200B;

    shell_command:
      linuxpc_screen: /home/homeassistant/linuxpc_screen.sh {{ states('input_text.screen_colortemp') }} {{ states('input_text.screen_brightness') }}

* make an automation triggered by the button which runs the shell command as a service
* If you want to trigger it automatically by changing a scene, you can use the event trigger in further automations:

&#x200B;

    trigger:
      - event_data:
          domain: scene
          service: turn_on
          service_data:
            entity_id: scene.my_scene
        event_type: call_service
        platform: event

Voila: Now, your screen brightness and color temperature fits the to light in your room."	3	"['Wolfgang-Warner: Nice work, a major improvement to the mood of a room I bet', ""sgunb: Thanks.

I'd like IOTLink on my PC to share on a new topic the result of a command I set up (actually a powershell script), so my HA can use it as a sensor (more specifically, the ""is the PC muted or not, with "" Get-AudioDevice -PlaybackMute "").

I guess I could set a HA Script that queries from HA to my pc this via the ""iotlink/workgroup/pc/commands/run"" handle, but I'd like to avoid my HA having to ask every now and then about it, and having my PC proactively delivering it!

# Past Disk Space Issues

About 18 months ago I started running ***Home Assistant***, with the supervisor, in a VM running under ***VirtualBox*** on ***Windows 10***.

But roughly 2 months ago I started having issues where some of my addons would fail to start with an error of ""***no space left on device***"":

    Can’t start addon_a0d7b954_nodered: 500 Server Error for http+docker://localhost/v1.41/containers/a7b66ba697a19f694afca72eb799f6a12fd987b85b6d58a618995eb1a8cff9c6/start: Internal Server Error (“failed to open stdout fifo: error creating fifo /var/run/docker/containerd/a7b66ba697a19f694afca72eb799f6a12fd987b85b6d58a618995eb1a8cff9c6/init-stdout: no space left on device”)

At the time, I found some threads that suggested this could be due to the docker images not being properly pruned. But I wasn't able to figure it out, so I just reverted to an older saved VM image. This lasted me until I build my new ***Unraid 6.11*** server.

# Disk Usage Looks sus

Everything has been running well on Unraid, but I still think that I'm having some issues of old files not being properly cleaned up.

^(I say this because when I run the below command via the) ***^(terminal)*** ^(in) ***^(Unraid)***^(, I can see that the) ***^(virtual size)*** ^(of my VM image is) ***^(100GB)***^(, which is fine, but the) ***^(disk size)*** ^(is) ***^(83GB)***^(.)

    root@Unraid:qemu-img info home_assistant.qcow2 
    image: home_assistant.qcow2
    file format: qcow2
    virtual size: 100 GiB (107374182400 bytes)
    disk size: 83 GiB
    cluster_size: 65536
    Format specific information:

        lazy refcounts: false
        refcount bits: 16
        corrupt: false
        extended l2: false

Is the `disk size` actually the amount of data being stored in the image or is that something else?

&#x200B;

But when I check the disk usage in the ***Home Assistant web GUI***, it shows only `17GB` being used, which would be fine if that's the case.

This is corroborated when I run the `df` command via the ***terminal addon***, I can see that it looks like my ***disk usage*** is only `17GB`.

Muscle memory)

I recently switched from several custom generic camera entities defined in yaml to the Reolink integration for my Reolink cameras. Since then I have a rogue camera entity throwing errors in the logs and I can't find it or get rid of it. The error shows up hundreds of times a day in the logs but I cannot find the actual entity to get rid of it.

`camera.garage_inside` was the name of a previous camera I had setup in the config yaml. The base name of the camera now that it's configured in the Reolink integration is still 'Garage Inside' but the entity the integration has created is `camera.garage_inside_sub`, there is no `camera.garage_inside` entity anymore. All functions of the camera work as expected so that's another confirmation that the `camera.garage_inside` entity that's throwing errors isn't the new one via the integration.

Searches in all my HA files (even beyond the config yamls) turns up nothing. There's just some legacy stuff in the secrets file that's commented out.

I did find a lingering entity under the original name in the UI and I tried disabling and even renaming it but the errors still get thrown under the original `camera.garage_inside` name in the log. So it seems like this entity isn't even representatives of the one that's throwing the errors? I'm confused.

Here goes...

I am running HAOS in a VirtualBox VM on a Win10 machine. I have previously successfully enabled external access to Home Assistant via the duckdns addon within HA, which authenticates the certificates using letsencrypt (according to [this](https://peyanski.com/home-assistant-remote-access/) guide). I was successfully able to configure HA to use a sub-sub domain from duckdns (e.g. **ha.mydomain.duckdns.org**). My Duck DNS addon config file therefore looks like this:

`domains:`

  `- ha.mydomain.duckdns.org`

`token: <my-duckdns-token>`

`aliases:`

  `- domain: ha.mydomain.duckdns.org`

`alias: mydomain.duckdns.org`

`lets_encrypt:`

  `accept_terms: true`

  `algo: secp384r1`

  `certfile: fullchain.pem`

  `keyfile: privkey.pem`

`seconds: 300`

Recently, I am trying to stand up several other services that will be running in docker containers (on the same host machine as the HA VM). I am running docker via Ubuntu 22.04 LTS within a WSL2 environment. I would like to use NGINX reverse proxy to enable external access to those services using sub-sub domains from the same duckdns domain (lets use Nextcloud as an example). I installed certbot in my Ubuntu environment, and successfully obtained a wildcard certificate for \*.mydomain.duckdns.org. NGINX in docker is configured to point my Nextcloud instance to **nc.mydomain.duckdns.org**. However, my Home Assistant instance shows up when I navigate to each of the following URLs:

* ha.mydomain.duckdns.org (as is expected)
* nc.mydomain.duckdns.org (problem)
* mydomain.duckdns.org (problem) 

I'm starting to wonder if this configuration won't work...is there a conflict between the certificate issued via the duckdns addon in HA and the certificate issued by NGINX in docker because they both ultimately point to the same duckdns subdomain (**mydomain.duckdns.org**)? Does anyone else run HAOS in a VM, and use a reverse proxy to manage other self-hosted services? How do you avoid this conflict?"	6	"[""Lectere: Reverse proxy for one ha instance is madness and you are just relay your certificate problem.

I'm have really poor time management skills particularly in the morning and I wanted to see if you had an idea how to better approach this 

Basically I'd need a timer card that tells me how long I have to get ready and leave the house, based on the time I need to be at work by, and the commuting time with current traffic.


So the way how I think this would work:

- A dropdown where I can choose the time I need to be at work (9:30,10,10:30 etc)

- A sensor for commuting time with traffic (I already have this) 

- A sensor to get the current time

- An automation that starts a timer by passing the following variable: 10:30 (dropdown) - 00:30 (commute) - 09:20 (current time) = 00:40 min timer

- a button to start the automation 

- a timer card that lets me display this 

Am I missing something? Do you have any advice on this, as I'm quite new to all of it? 

Thank you"	3	"[""Fritz00015: Do you know the time you need to be at work based on your calendar?

HisCromulency	2	12v6fqo	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12v6fqo/how_to_mount_smb_media_shares_from_separate_nas/	"I have Home Assistant OS 10 installed bare metal on an Intel NUC. 

I can't figure out why my configuration isn't letting me access and mount SMB shares from my OpenMediaVault server. I followed [this previous Reddit thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/rm36s3/how_to_mount_an_nfs_or_smb_filesystem_on_ha/) as a guide, and as far as I know I did everything correct. 

This is what I have in my configuration.yaml:

    homeassistant:
      media_dirs:
        movies: /mnt/media/movies
        tv: /mnt/media/tv
        music: /mnt/media/music
        
    shell_command:
      mount_media_movies: mkdir -p /mnt/media/movies;mount -t cifs -o username=HisCromulency,password=HisCromulencyPW //192.168.1.199/Movies /mnt/media/movies
      mount_media_tv: mkdir -p /mnt/media/tv;mount -t cifs -o username=HisCromulency,password=HisCromulencyPW //192.168.1.199/TV_Shows /mnt/media/tv

I did the step of creating the Movies, TV, and Music directories first in HA. Did a full system reboot. Made the shell commands, and validated that there were no problems. I also made the automation to run the shell commands on HA boot: 

    alias: Mount /media on HA start

I also have ""allow guest access"" permissions on my OpenMediaVault SMB shares.

When I click on Media>Local Media, I can see the Movies, TV, and Music folders I have created https://imgur.com/7mT0z9r. But when I click on say ""movies"" folder, I just get an infinite loop of loading the movies folder over again and again.

I have Home assistant running via my raspberry pi 3 b+ and since yersterday I’m trying to connect my 8266 board to it via WiFi to automate stuff but it just doesn’t work and I have no clue why since absolutely all tutorials and documentation are different from the updated Home Assistant version. 

When I’m connecting a new device to HA it pops a message saying “install ESP home via the browser” and that “not all requirements are met” since ESP Home isn’t running over HTTPS (I don’t have https on my local ha adress) so he tries to download the project and asks me to run the installation via esphome web, which I try to do. The downloading of the projects stays at the “preparing download …” step without downloading anything. 

On esphome web, everything works fine, after installing the drivers he finds the port and installs everything. That is until I’m trying to connect to my wifi asking credentials and this step just doesn’t work since I get an error message saying “connection failed”. My credentials are good and when I try to connect it to WiFi using Arduino ide it works just fine.

You now have 2 kwh of electric stored at a 60p per kWh.\nIf you discharge 1 kwh hour you have 1kwh at 60p per kWH, and if you then charged another 1 kwh you would have 2kwh at 30p per kWh.\n\nSo I’d have a tariff that fluctuates with the ratio of charge method and then saving is realised with the discharge.', 'DragonQ0105: If you\'re with a provider that has an API for unit price (i.e. Octopus in the UK), you can get an actual cost figure by setting your ""energy import"" and tariff correctly in the Energy dashboard.\n\nThen all you have to do is compare that to a second figure, which is basically ""home usage"" multiplied by the tariff at each interval. This is the part I\'m not entirely sure how to do and would depend on your setup.\n\nI know that before getting solar our usage was 50% peak and 50% off-peak so it\'s easy to work out, plus I know what our average bill & usage was anyway.', ""defeatedbythecat: Yeah I think that's the way to go about it. But it's how to keep track of those ratios on days where I don't use any grid. \n\nSo then the next day I need to keep that average price and work out a new one with what goes in the next day. \n\nI know the battery doesn't differentiate, but the saving will fluctuate based on what goes in. \n\nThe rate of grid is fixed so that's not an issue.

For some time now I have been caring for my grandfather who lives 40 min away from me in the outskirts of Munich. Since I am so far away, I always worry about whether he is alright. I always looked for solutions to calm my mind. During a project at the university, I then developed intelligent adapter plugs together with other students. The aim of this plug-in is to record when a technical device in the household is used (e.g. TV, refrigerator, bedside lamp). During the first few days, it is determined how often a person in need of care uses the technical devices in the household. If there are subsequent deviations in usage behavior, this could indicate health problems. For example, if the bedside lamp comes on eight times a night instead of twice, this could indicate insomnia. If the refrigerator is opened only twice a day instead of five times, lack of appetite could be the reason. In such a case, a relative is notified directly by SMS. It is important to note that caregivers will not be able to see the daily usage behavior of the persons they care for, i.e. they will not be able to see how often the TV is used. They will only get a message once typical behavior deviates.

What do you think about this solution?"	23	"['trantoriana: Good idea, but latency of events is probably too high.

She however hates when the switch is out of sync with the light. Every night we go to bed and the switch is 'on' but we use the remote to turn the light off. Then the next day it's 'backwards' and she gets annoyed.

Does anyone have an idea how I should configure this so turning the switch on, always turns the light on (even if the switch is already in the on position)? And the same for turning it off? 

I would also be happy with some sort of way to turn the switch off at a set time in the morning without triggering the light or actually killing the power to the fan.

For posterity, the external (dumb) switch can only control the actual switch function of the zen23. So I have an automation where if the state of that switch changes, it checks if the lights are on or off and then toggles them accordingly. That switch ends up being in all sorts of different configurations of up and down, but that\'s how it was before in the three way configuration anyway so my wife doesn\'t mind.

I\'m not sure if all of lights get that in Home Assistant, but my did so I didn\'t look into it further.\n\nIn the end I can recommend adding a **logbook exclusion** for the 2 automations beause you\'ll get it filled with brightness changing.

I rarely use the physical light switch, and depend on automations and motion + contact sensors to turn it on and off, but I do have a button card that I use.

I have the switch configured by the Z-Wave parameters UI to be set to ""Normal"", but this allows the new dialogue to use the slider and set the expected brightness from 1-99%, rather than being a simple on off switch as my button is set to. If I change it to ""On/Off"", I can still control the brightness via the slider introduced in 2023.3. But on top of that, I then have issues where tapping the power button on the slider menu (or my regular old button) don't control toggling the light on and off.

My current solution is to change it back to ""Normal"" mode and do my best to not accidentally open the slider menu and touch it, but this is not ideal. Any suggestions?"	1	"[""ImSorryButWho: I'd suggest creating a [template light](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.template/) that only defines `value_template`, `turn_on` and `turn_off`, passing them all through to the underlying light.

For the most part they work great. I got them paired up with my Zigbee network and they're very reliable. My only issue is the bead connector which will sometimes pass through (while making a sickening sound as it makes its way) but more often than not gets stuck. Besides the strain on the motor, this introduces a whole host of problems in recalibrating my upper and lower limits, etc. Has anyone found a solution to this issue besides spending $100 on bead joining pliers I will use one time? Installing an infinity chain kind of defeats the purpose of these motors to begin with. If I was going to go through the trouble of getting up there to disassemble, etc I would have just bought tube roller units. I seem to remember when I was researching blind motors one of the more expensive companies used to send a special connector for this very problem. Someone please help!	4	"['Sporebattyl: I have the same issue. The trick is to get the tension of the beaded cord just right. No slack, but not taut. \n\n\nTwo of the three I have are calibrated just right and I don’t want to start on the third. The third works, but it makes that nightmare sound sometimes. It’s a headache to get right.

They punch a hole in one of the metal beads then crimp it around the thin connecting part so it creates one seamless chain. It only works on metal I believe.

I tried to go to the repository screen and manually add the default back and it says it exists already. I also added some others I found online and those seem to show when searching.

Moquitto broker
rtl_433
rtl_433 auto discovery
MariaDB

Dongle: Nooelec NESDR Mini USB RTL-SDR & ADS-B Receiver Set

Sensors: Acurite Fridge & freezer temp sensors

The setup seemed pretty straightforward. I installed Moquitto, installed the two rtl_433 add-ons, plugged in the dongle then rebooted. Started the rtl_433 and auto discovery add-ons. The logs for the add-ons aren't showing any errors and my Acurite sensors (fridge & freezer) are picked up by the broker and get imported as Devices/Entities. I can see the current statuses.

The problem is that a few minutes after discovery, everything goes absolutely haywire. I start seeing a bunch of DB errors in HA and nothing will load, then a reboot is required. At first I was using SQLite for my DB but switched to MariaDB since it seemed more stable and less prone to corruption. I also have limited Recorder by adding a bunch of items to the exclude list, including sensors (to debug).

It's very difficult to get valid logs because it seems like something from rtl_433 being sent to the recorder is causing corruption, then everything breaks. If I unplug the dongle and reboot, it all settles down and the errors go away. Any tips or suggestions?

Edit:
I ended up buying a 4 port powered USB 3 hub and moved my z-wave/ZigBee stick, SSD, and the 433 dongle to that (with extensions). Everything is running smoothly now!

&#x200B;

I was thinking of using load cells for detecting several things. For example, place them under the bed for occupancy detection, under the cat's litter box to get their weight and monitor how often and how much they go litter, under a pet feeder to measure exactly how much came out of the feeder.

&#x200B;

The common problem with all these ideas is that, it takes very precise analysis of the graph data to determine some truth from it. Take the litter box for example. 

1. Over time, the load cells may drift because of being under constant load
2. Other objects may be placed on the litter box, which should not be distinguished from your cat.
3. Cat's may sit and jump on the litter box, leading to even more unpredictable results.

Of course, you can manually develop filters or an algorithm to draw conclusions from such data, but I was thinking that maybe machine learning (or something similar) may be of good use here. As you might guess, I have no experience with using ML, but I am eager to learn more about it (and this seems like the perfect project to get into it).

&#x200B;

My questions for you:

1. Have you used ML for your sensors in Home Assistant before?
2. Are there any plugins/addons/AppDaemon apps I should look into?
3. Is reinforced learning a good tool here? Is there any interface I can reuse to evaluate measurements and manually label them for what they should be (cat detected, anamoly etc.)?
4. Do you know of any similar projects/problems I should look into?

So I bought two 3040 thin clients from a guy I know for 35 euros. Great deal. On our local ebay ish site, they go for more than double that **per** device. They're only 2 and 3 years old and they look new.

I want to install HA on one of them. Also ordered the sonoff zigbee usb. They're 2gb ram, i know it's tight but should be more than fine to start off with.

1. [**Main dashboard**](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/uc79cv/a_maximalist_approach_on_designing_the_ha/) **at my battlestation**: A Fujitsu Stylistic tablet. The summary page is designed so that I can see what I need to pay attention to at a glance.
2. **Bedside Clock**: A hacked Lenovo Clock 2 using Fully Kiosk. So that I can see what’s going on around the house from my bed, and control the media and lights in my bedroom, which used to be separate apps.
3. [**Foyer dashboard**](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/vncni6/eink_displays_are_great_for_blending_in_with_the/)**:** A Waveshare e-ink display using ESPHome.
4. **Kitchen Echo Show**: An Echo Show 8 automated to show Fire browser at all times. It replaces the slide show Amazon provides with data of my own.
5. **Living Room Dashboard**: A Fire tablet using Fully Kiosk that I can use to control my entertainment center and lights in the living room easily.
6. **My phone!**: I don't use it much but I do like to peek what's going on and maybe turn off some lights once in a while.

It should only add additional flexibility and automation.  If I have to use my phone or tablet to interact with something, there is something terribly wrong with that system.  It's great to add additional automation to existing systems, but it generally isn't going to change how I interact with those devices on a day to day basis.  The one exception being Alexa.

I have an automation that I need to add a delay to in the conditions.

* When Kitchen Sensor detects motion

**CONDITIONS**

* It's not between 09:00 & 11:00 on Tuesday;
* Cats are not present

**ACTIONS**

* Send notification via mobile app.

The issue I have is when the cats enter the cat flap, the kitchen sensor picks up on this within seconds, however the cat flap sensor takes a few extra seconds therefore we get a notification that there is movement in the kitchen. We don't want notifications if the cats are in the kitchen otherwise our phones would be getting notifications constantly!

Therefore, if I could somehow add a delay in so that if motion is sensed and then the cats enter the house with 10 seconds, we won't get a notification.

I actually did a PiHole a week ago which is working nicely, and for the moment using my NAS to virtualize HA so I can test it out (have only 1 Pi). What Im wondering is, since i have only 1 Pi I can do one of the following (and of course get another Pi at some point)

1. Run PiHole/Adguard on the RPi 3 and HA as a VM on the NAS as is
2. Run both HA and Adguard on the RPi, and take the NAS out of the equation

Ive been monitoring the hit to the NAS with HA and right now it seems like my memory usuage on the NAS goes from 55% with VM Station off complete to about 75% when VM Station and the HO VM is running. That is with default settings of 2gig max memory and 2cores.

&#x200B;

Anyhow I guess this is more of a question about seeing which option makes more sense. I have only used PiHole but from my reading Adguard is pretty comparable. Also unsure if any issues with not running the DNS side as its own separate device, etc. On the flipside, I know SD cards is a real issue so Im thinking maybe keeping it on physical HDs from my NAS could be a good thing maybe. Anyhow, any thoughts greatly appreciated!"	10	"[""2c0: I run both on a RPi 4.

Hi there, 
for an old house built in 1980, with an old electrical system, what kind of hardware solutions, starting from the necessary `integrations` for the Home Assistant, up to suitable artificial lights, would it be recommended to buy?
We would like to control the whole system through an e-ink, touchscreen dashboard display, and ofc the classic digital dashboard, to be controlled from a PC/smartphone, even remotely (when needed).

**The main functions for which Home Assistant is needed:**

* management of artificial lights: automate scenarios in which to vary the values of Temperature and Intensity of the Lights.
 * intercom management: automate gate opening/closing management.
  * security management: automate sending of a notification alert in case of break-in of an unidentified external object in the property
* solar system management: automate scenarios in which battery or grid withdrawal varies.
* scenario management: automate ""at home"" and ""away from home"" scenarios, and, ""night"" and ""day"", etc.
* vegetable garden management: automate the maintenance of the vegetable garden, garden and everything concerning the area outside the house, if applicable.
* house chore management: automate house maintenance/cleaning/chores where possible.
* voice assistant management: possibility of recalling all the Home Assistant functions mentioned above through a voice assistant that runs locally and not the usual alexa, google, etc.

**About artificial lights, what would be appropriate? LED Strips, Bulbs, Tubes?** 
The requirements for both internal and external lights are as follows:

* Compatibile with home assistant (Temperature, intensity control, etc).
* CRI >90
* Flicker Free (It must not have flicker, PWM frequency at 0hz or absent. Beware of flicker free which are just marketing)

**About the house**
The house is about 70sqm, kitchen/living room, bathroom, bedroom and master bedroom, hallway, large courtyard, garden, vegetable garden and veranda.

I am a user of LightPhone. At home we don't use TV or Smartphone, but I could access to the android operating system via the LightPhone in case of emergencies. For this reason, I intend to use Home Assistant on the e-ink dashboard, or vocally, when I'm present at home. I state that I use Home Assistant because I believe it is essential to automate useful things and obtain new functions, not to have ""persistent"" control over the home.

I await your advice! Thank you all! :)"	13	"[""FishScrounger: 1980s is an old house?\n\nI've used HA in a house built in the late 1910s and another built in the early 90s and the wiring was a hell of a lot easier to do in the latter!"", ""xaris33: Stay away from tuya WiFi stuff. \nSmartify the switch, not the light.

This is likely also true of many switches in your house.\n\nThe lack of a neutral rules out the use of most smart switches and dimmers. I used a few Lutron Caseta dimmers for a while, because they do not require a neutral. But they require having Home Assistant talk to the proprietary Lutron hub. That annoyed me.

I am going through the best options to make all my switches smart.

One of the ideas I like is to make a small distribution box in (almost) every room, and terminate all the wiring of each room in this DB Box. It might be an overkill, but I think it is future proof.

My idea is to terminate the power (L+N) in a DIN controllers (zigbee or zwave), which will control the lights, but also I would like to control these DIN controllers with the wall switches. 

From experience, what do you think? Are there any good and reliable DIN controllers on the market?

And what about two-way switches? Can a single load be controlled by two switches without an automation in the background?

I am attaching a small diagram of what I have in mind

I have a calendar event in local calendar which sends a push notification to my iPhone to water the indoor plants. 

In the notify action I currently have this

`sticky: ""true""`

And i then have another action turn on an input Boolean, incase I’m not home and I clear the notification, so when I arrive home if the input Boolean is on to send me a notification.

Ive been trying to find a way to switch that input Boolean off when I’ve watered the plant. So I thought I could use an actionable notification, my plans were when the notification comes up to have a button to say something like watered the plants and to turn the input Boolean off.

But I’m not sure how to do this, if I could have someone’s help please. I’m aware it should be in the data section of the notify cation but I’m not sure what to put.

Also in my arrive home notification, if the input Boolean is on, i have the following in the data section 

`push:`

    `sound:
     name: default
     critical: 1
     volume: 1`

Not sure if there’s a reliable system out there. I saw X sense fit the bill, but there have been multiple reviews from buyers that have tested it with CO and gave a “0 ppm” reading - which seems unreliable

Also reason why I want to monitor low levels is because apparently traditional CO alarms ONLY alerts lethal levels which is not helpful if there is a low level leak which would not be alerted thus leading to constant exposure

I can't do a smart light switch or similar for a multitude of reasons (multiple lights in the room that might be used, armored wires in the wall, no space in box behind light switch to add relay modules, etc)

From a bit of research today, it looks like many of the light sensors that are integrated into motion sensors only report when there's motion. I need a light sensor that doesn't need motion.

They expose a simple local API that returns a JSON string with their sensor values when queried.

I've tried following a few examples, [Most recently this one](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/davis-weatherlink-integration/134737), of adding a rest API sensor to HA, but it never quite works out the way I want. I can't seem to get both of the AirLinks to show up. I'd like each one to be a device, with the various measurements as entities.

Or better yet, I'd like the temperature and humidity sensors to show up as entities, and for HA to calculate the AQI based on the particulate readings (It doesn't return the actual AQI, just the PPM measurements of different aerosol sizes).

I'm not quite familiar with templates, so maybe I need to do more research, but I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions.

I'm not sure how to do it in Home Assistant, so I'd like some help on this.

In software, I would make the motion detector send motion detected events to anyone listening. Then the light would listen for such an event and have a motion detected event handler. Thus, I want something like this pseudocode

Dear Community,

i have a MS-105BZ dual zigbee dimmer.  
I do not know how to get it into pairing mode.

In the manual it says:

>After the wiring of switch module is done, press the reset switch for 10 times (keep time interval not too short) until the beep sounds continuously and rapidly as Di-Di-Di… for pairing mode.

I tried clicking the stupid buttons thousands of times in different intervals. There is just nothing changing. The lights turn on or off but there is no pairing mode.

Does anybody have an idea?"	1	['Molokaisylph32: The video is in Portuguese but shows the pairing process: [https://youtu.be/f7x93k0ol9A?t=420](https://youtu.be/f7x93k0ol9A?t=420)']

Shutters won\'t need to move **much** throughout the day, so a single control-battery-charge pack could (notionally) power a set of shutters with no visible wires from the interior of the house\n   * Control latency is something that needs to be explored.  Having a microcontroller wake up every minute to check a queue for commands doesn\'t ""feel"" very responsive.\n   * Wifi/Bluetooth control are a requirement\n* May need to account for condensation depending on your windows.  All windows aren\'t perfectly sealed (As I sit here in my 20+ year old house)\n* In the worst place in my house, I have 4 windows 20 feet in the air\n   * Each window has an upper and lower shutter\n   * Ideally, one power-pack would have the 8 servo\'s to control and manage all of these with minimal cost/effort.\n   * Signal wire length may be a concern from what I understand\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOtherwise, really cool to see progression in this space.

Not sure if this is the best place, as I know this config isn't super common, but I got the idea from this subreddit - so here goes.


I setup a Lenovo Smart Clock 2 to function as a HA dashboard using Fully Kiosk Browser. I've turned on kiosk mode, and it defaults to my preferred dashboard automatically. All mostly works. However, every time I restart the device, or it loses power - it re-prompts to grant Fully Kiosk admin rights. Every time I accept that, yes, it should be an admin on the device, and then all is good until next reboot. Granting device admin doesn't seem to stick. Has anyone ever had a similar experience, or have any suggestions?

However, usually I find a solid YouTube video or online guide to help me build it on previous similar projects. Im struggling to find that and identify the exact components I need to buy. 

What:
A smart 10 zone sprinkler controller that replaces a hunter branded one in my garage. I obviously want to control it in HA.

The parts that I’m unsure about
- is can I do 10 zones or is there a limit based on the pins available on the esp8266 (or 32?)
- how do I make sure only 1 zone ever goes on at a time. I feel like this needs to be the case to prevent disaster. 
- how do I make sure a zone isn’t ever opened forever if HA restarts or malfunctions mid automation?

Thats it for starters but I know they’ll be more questions."	10	"[""quixotic_robotic: I think the NodeMCU version of the 8266 host board has 12 GPIO pins that can be used for this, as long as it doesn't need to do anything else like serial or SPI to other sensors. Check the sheets carefully to make sure there isn't some weird behavior like they might default to a high status bit. Or just get an esp32 like the wroom and you have plenty of pins.\n\nWith ESPHome, you can do some automation directly on the device itself. You would basically configure some endpoints that HA can control, and these would trigger automations to turn on a zone for 10 min then turn off. These run locally without needing a network connection. Or, give them a longer fallback timeout like 30 min just in case, but still let HA do the scheduling so it's easier to manage remotely.. Not sure why more than one zone would cause disaster, but you could similarly have each of the zone triggers turn off all zones and then turn on the one you want."", 'mattkenny: There\'s a native esphome sprinkler component that handles most of this already: https://esphome.io/components/sprinkler.html\n\nBut you can also roll your own - I did thus because it was before the native sprinkler component was created.\n\nI\'ve added some logic in esphome that will make sure only one some is in at once from within the ESP device itself, and also make sure the matter solenoid is on if any of the normal zone valves is on. I\'ve also got a default state of ""off"" for if it reboots mid cycle (never happened), and I\'ve also got a few extra time triggers in home assistant to force all valves off at a few times of day (my area has watering restrictions which mean I can get fined if they are on between 9am and 6pm, so I\'ve got a 9am fail-safe off command)\n\nBecause I\'ve implemented the cycle logic in HA and not in esphome, I\'m not restricted to having to have all controls on a single device. I\'m actually planning on having a few extra zones controlled by a separate esp device in the rear yard, but have them act as ""sub-zones"" from a plumbing perspective - e.g. I\'d have to turn on the master valve and say valve#3 on the main controller; this would then supply water to another bank of valves in the backyard controlled by the second esp, which can then run each of the sub-zones.\n\nBut because it\'s all through HA and esphome, I can hide all this sonicated logic and still make it appear as just a bunch of independent zones from a scheduling and manual operation standpoint.\n\nFor the actual sequencing, I run that through pyscript in HA as the YAML/gui based automation system is painful for anything complicated.

I have an problem I am trying to solve with home assistant that I am looking for some answers on. Currently I have a newer TV hooked up to an older home theatre receiver that does not have CEC so the receiver always stays on even when i turn off the TV. My thought is to get a zwave plug with energy monitoring that i could detect when the tv is on vs off/standby and turn on a seperate z wave plug to turn on the receiver.

Works fine in esphome but HA only sees one of those sensors. How to see both sensors in HA?

&#x200B;

I wasn't sure if I should post here or in the esphome subreddit, but the problem very much looks like a HA so I wanted to try here first.

I'm running a D1 mini with a moisture sensor sensor from which I want to get two readings: The raw voltage value and the soil moisture percentage derived from the voltage.

The esphome code for those sensors:

https://preview.redd.it/e5ozlso601va1.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b959b1f9adea8697a0573a0886de9629052a407c

The esphome log looks fine and shows both sensors:

But HA only shows one of those 2 sensors:

The funny thing is, if I change the order inside the esphome yaml config of the device and reload the device in HA, the other sensor is shown:

But HA only ever seems to show one of those two sensors.

How can I HA convince to show BOTH sensors at the same time?Thanks!

so there is sth wrong with the oauth, but I can't figure out what might be wrong or missing. I've checked several other topics, which were reporting similar issues, but in most cases it was just a change to the `my.homeassistant` url as redirect url instead an ""old"" url with sth like "".../callback ...""

 

* I've recreated the application in the dev portal, waited and used the new ID/Secret
* I've logged out of everything prior to setting up the integration
* I've removed the HA instance from my Pi-Hole
* I've removed all saved credential prior to every integration attempt
* I've removed the internal DNS resolution of my HA and resolved the name via internet DNS
* I've even added my HA URL as additional redirect URL
* I've added even my local IP (with https) in `my`  (funnily enough same error, where I would expect a certificate error at least)

I'm out of ideas, maybe someone can help me with that issue, I've raised that topic also in the HA Forum, but no response until now ([https://community.home-assistant.io/t/first-time-home-connect-integration-failing-during-oauth/561675](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/first-time-home-connect-integration-failing-during-oauth/561675)) 

As this is the first time that I use an Oauth integration I might have missed a crucial point here. I'm using the same mailaddress for home connect and developer portal. 

Is NabuCasa subsciption required for the `my`  integration to work properly?

&#x200B;

I hope someone can point me in the right direction so I get this finally done."	1	"['Nighter83: seems that is was related to an ""autocorrected"" mail address, which ""upped"" the first letter of the entered mail address at the singlekey registration to a capital letter.\n\nThis is a known bug with singlekey-id and home connect. \n\nAfter I\'ve deleted all accounts and re-registered with the singlekey and dev account with different +aliases of my mail, I was able to register the device.']"

1681971456.0	19-Apr-2023 23:17:36	I tested the Aqara FP2 Presence Sensor and compared it to the FP1, this is my review	BackHerniation	298	12sofgv	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12sofgv/i_tested_the_aqara_fp2_presence_sensor_and/	"Hi,

I bought the FP2 about 20 days ago on AliExpress for $75 from a seller that I’ve dealt with in the past. I simply messaged them, asking for the FP2 and they sent me a *“special payment link”* and 15 days later I had it.

I fully disassembled the device, tested some features and managed to integrate it in Home Assistant via the HomeKit Controller Integration. It's still reliant on the Aqara Home App, to initialize it and create detection zones. It has an ESP32 board inside, so maybe ESPHome is possible down the line.

What's neat is, whatever zones you create in the Aqara App are exposed as separate entities in Home Assistant and change state individually when a person is detected.

The sensor is extremely capable and accurate, it pushes live data of a persons position in the app almost immediately. The detection time is instant, no need for a PIR sensor pairing anymore.

I took a bunch of pictures and wrote a detailed comparison to the FP1:

While wifi lights for example, have to use the internet out of the box, once flashed to work with ESPHome everything is local. Obviously not what your average person would do but wifi devices don't have to have internet connectivity to work but require flashing in order to achieve this. \n\nEven with ZigBee devices which are less dependent on the internet quickly become dependent on the internet if you add them to Alexa or use the native app like the Hue app. Also, a common misconception about ZigBee devices is every device extends the range of your ZigBee network. Not all ZigBee devices are routers so they don't extend ZigBee range. The Aqara FP1 used ZigBee yet it didn't extend the range of your ZigBee network because it is an end-device and not a router device and end-devices don't extend ZigBee range. Below is about Hue but the same principal applies. More ZigBee devices are end-devices than router devices than most people think. The Hue app is dependent on the internet also so unless you add it to home assistant it's pretty much dependent on the internet as the Hue app requires internet connectivity to work, so does the Aqara app. If I'm getting something wrong please clarify on what I'm missing. Not trying to be condescending, just generally interested in what I'm mistaken about. \n\nThis starts to make ZigBee more internet dependent quickly similar to wifi devices. If you can't use the Hue app without the internet then outside schedules most things start to require internet connectivity to work properly. \n\nhttps://www.smarthomewinner.com/philips-hue-internet-or-local-control/\n\nDon’t forget that some features of Hue smart bulbs including dimmer switches and schedules are designed to work even without the internet. To put it simply, Hue bulbs require the internet a lot less than other smart bulbs.\n\nUnfortunately, you won’t be able to use the Hue app or Echo voice control to control your lights and get additional functionalities without the internet.\n\nhttps://blog.wijman.net/aqara-fp1-human-presence-review/\n\nSince the FP1 is 'mains' powered via USB one could expect it to work as a Zigbee router, but unfortunately it doesn't. It is recognised as a end-device."", ""ginandbaconFU: True but there are 3 types of ZigBee devices, routers, end devices and coordinaters. Routers do extend ZigBee range but end devices do not. The FP1 was an end device so it did not extend ZigBee range and more ZigBee devices are actually end devices than most people think. Any battery powered device is almost always an end device to preserve battery life but devices that are plugged in full time can also be end devices and not routers like the FP1. Coordinators are obviously a hub or USB dongle that is responsible for forming the network\n\nZigBee also runs on the 2.4ghz frequency so it can interfere with wifi devices (unless they are on 5ghz) but your out of the box router can handle 255 devices so that's really never been a concern to me personally. If you have that many devices you should be running subnets or vlans but I understand your preference in ZigBee as most people do but most people aren't aware that not all ZigBee devices extend ZigBee range.

The manufacturer can force ZigBee devices to require cloud access so no, ZigBee is not 100 percent LAN controlled depending on the hub and devices you own.

The microwave sensors are pretty good at picking up those subtle movements. Where they get tricky is wall penetration and picking up movements outside of the room. From my reading on them it seems that they have a spherical area of triggering that can be adjusted (expanded/contracted) but since rooms are rectangular, in theory the sphere would need to be small enough to not bleed out but big enough to detect me as I come in. Placement plays a big role here. Anyway, went off on a tangent :)"", ""ginandbaconFU: So you don't like reading and learning how some things actually work.... Cool...\n\nAnyways, video review below. Since it uses WiFi and not ZigBee that's why no hub is required. Aqara could have easily made this device work with ZigBee and force you to purchase one of their ZigBee hubs to even make it work and have the hub phone home like other manufacturers do as stated above even though you probably won't read this either. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/yarollsdao4"", 'ginandbaconFU: MmWave sensors are ""fun"" to place and setup for lack of a better term. Outside the FP2, I\'m unaware of any MmWave sensor that can ignore certain areas like ceiling fans. The FP1 supports zones in Zigbee2MQTT but I\'ve never really messed with it and the FP1 was only released in China so you have to get one from somewhere like AliExpress, possibly eBay. \n\nAnother cheaper option that I used after the FP1 didn\'t work out for me and that I use for some automations is espresense which just requires some ESP32\'s or a specific model of an m5stack ESP32-C3 which is what I use as it just looks better although the base stations can be hidden somewhere out of site. They actually work very well by tracking Bluetooth devices. I use my Android phone but several devices are supported. The obvious downside is you have to have the device on you. So if you had one in your office you could have it trigger an automation when it connects to another one in say, your living room. They also get an IP via WiFi and have a web interface which gives you control over distance you want to detect a device and can specify Bluetooth devices to ignore or track. There are a few videos on YouTube on how to set everything up. You have to install one of the 2 MQTT broker add ons but it\'s pretty much setup and forget about it once things are up and running. Espresense\'s have all the information very well documented and you flash the ESP32 base station via a web browser so it\'s very straight forward. That might be the best option for your office but as previously stated, you have to have the Bluetooth device on you so if you use your phone and leave it in your office then the automation would never turn off. On the plus side you can have different automations trigger based on the Bluetooth device so you could have different automations triggered based on if the Bluetooth device is your\'s or your wife\'s if needed. \n\nOutside that I can\'t really think of anything else except an MmWave sensor due to PIR sensors being great for fast movement but obviously aren\'t good with minimal movement. Honestly, espresense would be worth trying, especial if you have a spare ESP32 or preferably two sitting around as nothing else would be needed. There are some cheap MmWave sensors that work via Bluetooth with a native Android integration but to my knowledge they are only available on AliExpress but you can get 7 for maybe 30 dollars plus shipping. They are made my Hi-Link. Below is a link to mouser for what I use as base stations but like I said, a generic ESP32 will work also if you have one already. They can also track smart watches and tile trackers so it doesn\'t have to be a phone. Espresense has all the supported devices listed on their site below. \n\nEspresense site:\nhttps://espresense.com/\n\nM5Stack supported base station if you live in the US.  They also have 5 for 30 dollars. \n\nhttps://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/M5Stack/C056-B?qs=A6eO%252BMLsxmSKM%2FUqJNAHBQ%3D%3D\n\nCheap. MmWave sensor that work via Bluetooth. Just need to run power to it via the 5V and ground pin which can be done in a few ways, easiest is a USB cable. The smaller model ones are TINY, just make sure you get one with BT, they can also be setup in ESPHome with an ESP32. There are several guides and yaml out there if you want to go that route. I can leave a link if you want to go that route. \n\nhttps://a.aliexpress.com/_mPBEqfA\n\nUSB cable you can use or you can cut a USB power only cable and soldier the red wire to the 5V pin and black wire to the ground pin. \n\nhttps://a.co/d/2oc4MUN\n\nHonestly I would try espresense first. Especially if you have a spare ESP32 or 2 sitting around as you would already have everything you need and can go the MmWave route if that doesn\'t work for you. Outside that, time based automations is really the only other thing I can think of like turning stuff in your office from say, 8am to 5pm Monday through Friday but obviously this would trigger regardless if you were in your office or not. \n\nEspresense setup video by the same guy who makes and sells the everything presense one\n\nhttps://youtu.be/p7C2QvmsM8M\n\nForgot to leave a link for Bluetooth proxies which extend your Bluetooth range but also require an ESP32.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CjpPdwK_ttg']"
1681968655.0	19-Apr-2023 22:30:55	SkyConnect Users: How is your experience? Mine's been... buggy.	MikeDeansMustard	6	12sne3c	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12sne3c/skyconnect_users_how_is_your_experience_mines/	"Looking to get a baseline for expectations around the SkyConnect. I've had mine for just over a month now, and my experience has felt shaky. 

1.	I'm operating in Zigbee only mode. 
2.	This is my first Zigbee adapter I've ever used, so I don't know what expectations are supposed to be like. 

Let's get started. It's been commonly shared that the experience with this adapter operating in both Matter and Zigbee (Dual PAN) mode has been really rocky. Based on that, I've kept the adapter in Zigbee only mode. 

-	**OTA Updates**: Frequently crashes Zigbee2MQTT during the update. I have to attempt an upgrade for each device about three times each before it finally takes without requiring me to restart Z2M. 
-	**Interaction with devices**: Variable. Mostly stable, but more instability than I'd like. 
    -	My Inovelli light switches have, multiple times, become fully unresponsive and require the breaker to be tripped, or have me just wake the device up by pushing buttons for a few seconds until I get a response. 
    -	My Hue bulbs sometimes spaz out as if they've received a command I didn't send. I'll send an ""Off"" request to a group, and one of the bulbs in the group will just stay on or flicker once. 
    - I have to put in manual delays into Zigbee-based automations because it just doesn't seem like I get predictable behaviour otherwise. 

I have separated my 2.4GHz networks so there's no overlap (802.11ax Channel 6 & Channel 1, Zigbee Channel 25, and Bluetooth), and I have my adapters on USB extensions away from my server. I'm on the latest HAOS, and I run Z2M. I have limited interference as confirmed from some light signal testing and analysis. 

I'm wondering if the problem lays with the SkyConnect, or rather with some other part of my setup."	30	"['Biornus: Might have missed it from your post, [but have you updated the firmware](https://skyconnect.home-assistant.io/firmware-update/)?\n\nIt was rock solid with ZHA, but switched to Z2M to get some new Aqara switches to behave.

Leaving this up in case it helps someone in the future.  


I've never had an issue with an upgrade before, and I've gotten in the habit of always just installing the newest version when prompted.

Well... that's a lesson learned. Since the update Zigbee2MQTT refuses to start up, so all of my devices are dead. I tried rolling back and that did nothing.

I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do now. Is there a known issue with this update? I'm not that savvy, the most I can see is this log file that looks like it's trying to tell me something important but I'm not grokking what I need to do to fix this. Any ideas?

I recently started using Home Assistant and I love it.  I have two separate zigbee networks (Aqara devices and Philips Hue), and I'd like to combine them into a single network to improve range and stability. My plan is to use a Sonoff Zigbee stick and z2m. 

Problem is that if I want to combine the networks I'll have to ditch the Philips Hue Bridge. I rely on fairly heavily on the Hue app, and [this desktop app](https://welovelights.app/) and I don't know how I can replace those with the existing Home Assistant UI.

How would you replicate the Nest schedule in HA directly using automations/calendar/helpers etc?

Ideally I’d like to set up a weekly schedule - e.g. Monday - Friday heating comes on at 9am - 11am at 21 degrees, then 19 degrees until 5pm etc. But like nest, probably a different schedule on the weekend.

I’ll be using other sensors and device trackers too, but I’m mainly worried about how you’d go about the calendar/scheduling for now, as having looked at the calendar triggers I’m a little unsure about the best way to set this up (and to feed the temp in, for example).

Interested to hear how you’d approach this!"	2	"[""LifeBandit666: You could use the weekday function to pick the weekday and weekend (condition?) then just set the times and temp. \n\nPersonally I've turned it all off, it's too warm now. The only automation I have set up with my Nest is using Sleep As Android which sends MQTT messages based on alarms. An hour before my alarm goes off I have it warm up a touch (because that's when SAA sends the message) and have it switch off again when I go to work at half 5"", ""Preference22: I've done exactly this in Node-red. The bigtimer is what you are looking for to create your schedule. In this case you'd need multiple bigtimers (weekdays, weekend), on the bottom you can select for which months, weeks and days that timer is active.\n\nFrom there you can all join them to next check in your logic and done. Make sure that you setup the on and off message in bigtimer, I did 0 and 1. With a switch function (i think it's called switch, doing if from memory) you can redirect the off and on message to different flows.\n\nI've set it up to output every minute and before calling the service checking if the said service is the way I want it to be. If not, I push it.\n\nOn my dashboard I've only setup 2 buttons to manipulate the thermostat. 1 slider that sets the room temperature which will be picked up as a variable in the java function block, so it's dynamic. And 1 text field with 4 options: Auto, on, off and manual. That's my thermostat override functionality. Standard in auto but if I ever want to heat outside the given schedule, this is the way! These are being pushed into the bigtimer block, as they are standard commands this block understands.\n\nIf you have any more questions, please let me know. However, I'm getting married today (typing this in bed as I woke up way too early) and going on our honeymoon for 3 weeks soon after. So not sure when I'll reply 😁.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: extra information on override.""]"

I have it plugged in to a Tuya plug which also measures current, voltage etc. in addition to the standard on/off feature. It’s plumbed in to Home Assistant under the Tuya Local integration. 

I want the following to happen (once the kettle is switched on):

Once kettle boils and switches itself off, and subsequent electrical current drops close to zero (or zero) in plug, I want the plug to then turn off. There needs to be a caveat in that as it’ll be low current in the initial switch on and start up of kettle for a split-second. I therefore wouldn’t want the switch the plug off at that point as nothing would ever happen! I need to make sure the condition of the current being zero (or close to zero) doesn’t become a factor for the first few seconds. 

So, how would I configure the automation? Any help greatly appreciated."	23	"['ten1219eighty5: You just have to select a condition that it has to be below X for X amount of seconds before It turns off', ""Nyghtshayde: If this all proves too much, there's a Tuya kettle available for about $30. From memory it integrates very well in Localtuya as well."", ""KevinBrexit:  \n\nHey there mate, I can totally help you with that!\n\nSounds like you want to make your regular ol' kettle a bit more high-tech. And I gotta say, that's pretty cool!\n\nSo, you've got your kettle plugged into a Tuya plug that measures all kinds of electric data, and you've got it all set up in Home Assistant. Nice work!\n\nNow, what you want is for the plug to turn off once the kettle has boiled and switched itself off, and the current drops to near-zero or zero. That's totally doable.\n\nBut, we need to make sure that we don't accidentally turn off the plug too soon, before the kettle has even had a chance to start boiling. That would be a major bummer!\n\nSo, what we can do is set up a little delay. We'll give the kettle a few seconds to start heating up before we start checking the current. That way, we can be sure that we're not turning off the plug prematurely.\n\nLet's say we give the kettle 10 seconds to start heating up. Then, once that time has passed, we can start monitoring the current. We'll set a threshold of, say, 0.5 amps. That's low enough that it won't interfere with the initial startup of the kettle, but high enough that we'll know when it's actually boiling.\n\nOnce the current goes above that threshold, we know the kettle is boiling. Then, we just need to wait for the current to drop back down to near-zero or zero. Let's say we give it a margin of error of 0.05 amps. That way, we won't accidentally turn off the plug if there's a tiny bit of residual current.\n\nOnce the current drops below that threshold, we know the kettle is done boiling, and we can turn off the plug.\n\nSo, in summary, here's how we'll set up the automation:\n\n1. Wait 10 seconds after the kettle is switched on\n2. Check the current every second\n3. Once the current goes above 0.5 amps, start monitoring it\n4.

In this case, the trigger is the kettle being switched on. Since you\'ve already got the Tuya plug set up in Home Assistant, I\'m assuming you\'ve already created a switch entity for the kettle plug.

Click on the ""+"" button to create a new automation.\n\nFor the trigger, select ""Device"" and then choose your kettle switch entity. Make sure the ""From"" state is ""off"" and the ""To"" state is ""on"".\n\nNow, let\'s move on to the conditions. As I mentioned earlier, we want to give the kettle a few seconds to start heating up before we start checking the current. So, we\'ll use a delay condition for that.\n\nAdd a new condition by clicking on the ""+"" button under the ""Conditions"" section. Select ""Delay"" and set it to 10 seconds.\n\nNext, we\'ll add the condition for checking the current. Click on the ""+"" button again to add a new condition. Select ""Numeric state"" and choose the Tuya plug entity that measures the current. Set the ""Above"" threshold to 0.5 and leave the ""For"" duration blank, since we want this condition to remain true until the current drops back down.\n\nNow, onto the actions. We want the plug to turn off once the kettle has boiled and the current has dropped back down to near-zero or zero. So, we\'ll add an action to turn off the Tuya plug.\n\nClick on the ""+"" button under the ""Actions"" section. Select ""Device"" and choose the Tuya plug switch entity. Set the ""To"" state to ""off"".\n\nWe\'ll add another delay to make sure we\'re not turning off the plug too soon. Click on the ""+"" button again and select ""Delay"".

ich habe ein kleines Problem bei der Umsetzung bzw. Integration eines Hörmann Torantriebes ins Homeassistant. Zur Ausgangslage:
Ich kann an der KNX Konfiguration nichts ändern.
Für ein Tor sind insgesamt 4 Gruppenadresen hinterlegt. Eine für auf, eine für zu, eine für Rückmeldung = auf und eine für Rückmeldung = zu. Dies ist leider damals nicht über Statusadressen gelöst wordeny also sehr umständlich und unübersichtlich. Es gibt auch keine Stopp Adresse.
Mein Ziel ist es allerdings trotzdem irgendwie in Homeassistant eine Übersicht bekommen um die Tore darzustellen. Achso btw. wir reden von ca. 40 Toren, deshalb wäre eine um Programmierung des KNX sehr teuer 😉

Vielleicht fällt euch dazu ja eine elegante und ""hübsche"" Lösung ein. 
Achso und btw ich würd mich noch als Anfänger für Homeassistant bezeichnen, deshalb zeigt Gnade bei eventuellen Nachfragen zue Umsetzung. 

Herzlichen Dank und viele Grüße

I have a Control4 system that was installed a few months ago (because the previous smart lighting system was terrible, and all the lights were wired to a wiring closet).

I installed Home Assistant, added the Control4 integration, and configured it with my username and password, so it pointed to the Control4 device on my local network with port 80 open. 

Home Assistant reports that it connected, but it is only showing one device:

It's a lot, but hopefully you get something valuable from the solutions I found to my headaches.*

I recently built a new system that I wanted to  setup dual boot with Unraid and Windows so that I could use the full  power of my rig for gaming and creative work in Windows when I want. I wasn't getting the performance I needed from a VM and this definitely seemed the better option for my personal needs  Simple enough to set up the basic dual boot. I installed Windows on an NVME drive, left the NVME unmounted in Unraid, and disabled all of my SATA controllers in Windows so as not to screw up any of my Unraid data when I was using Windows. Then I set up my boot order in BIOS with USB first and the NVME second. If the flash drive was inserted, the system  booted to Unraid. If the flash drive was out, the system booted into  Windows. Easy!

Not so easy: I also  wanted to be able to reboot from and into either OS from inside Home Assistant (running on a different server) without going through the process of having to shut down, pull or insert the  flash drive, and turn the system back on. My server is on the other side  of my apartment from my desk and I’m lazy, so I set out to make this a  reality. I faced a number of hurdles along the way and I wanted to share  how I overcame them in case anyone else is facing some of the same  struggles since these might be applicable to more than just my use case.

The  first item on my list was figuring out how to remotely “disable” and  “enable” the Unraid flash drive. I initially thought I could accomplish  this by using a powered USB hub and a smart plug. The problem was, every  powered USB hub I found could be powered by the USB bus if the  power was disabled. The additional power is only for high-power devices and charging. I had the idea to use a smart relay and after some  research online I couldn’t find any reason why this wouldn’t work. I  ordered a 5v Zigbee relay on Amazon. I VERY carefully stripped the  sheathing from around a USB extension cable then isolated and cut the  delicate power wire and stripped it as well. I’m an amateur at this stuff at best, but using these relays couldn’t be easier. I connected  the power wire to the relay and then paired it to my Zigbee2MQTT. The  entire process took less than 5 minutes. The secondary benefit of this method is I didn’t have to figure out a way to let HA query or know  which OS I was currently running – If the relay is “on” I’m in Unraid,  if it’s “off” I’m in Windows. The first issue was resolved.

*EDIT 1: After a few days I decided against using the state of the relay to definitively let HA know if I was in Unraid or Windows. There was too much as risk if the automation decided to disconnect the Unraid flash drive early or mistakenly and cause an ""unclean"" shutdown before the drive array is stopped, so I added some additional assurances to cover myself which I'll explain later in the post*

Next  I had to figure out how to remotely shutdown / reboot Unraid and  Windows from Home Assistant. This was my biggest headache.  Windows was no sweat – HASS Agent makes controlling Windows machines  from HA a breeze. I can’t recommend that software enough. Unraid was harder. I knew the answer was using SSH, but I was having a hell of a  time getting the SSH keys between my HA and Unraid to work to set up my HA automations. I followed every guide I could find online and couldn’t get  it to work. I spent DAYS trying to figure this out and almost gave up. I don’t know if the  problem was in how I stored the keys or the YAML in my HA config. I  finally stumbled upon the below link which got it working for me. Also, note that I was connected to HA via SSH using PuTTY when I got this  working NOT via the SSH/Terminal Add-On. I’m not sure it would make a  difference but worth noting.

Link to the guide that finally worked: [https://community.home-assistant.io/t/hassio-integration-with-other-entities-using-ssh/208915](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/hassio-integration-with-other-entities-using-ssh/208915)

*EDIT 2: After some more experience using the HA CLI it seems to me that the terminal add-on isn't storing anything in the actual HA file system and SSH is the correct way to go for these things. I think I read that the add-on runs in a container or something to that extent and maybe that's why? I'm sure someone much smarter than me will explain or correct me in the comments.*

Last,  it was time to make the automations in NodeRed and create a card for my  dashboard. I’m assuming you know about the integrations used, so I  won’t get into the details (remember: I’m lazy), but I’ve laid out the gist of how they work below.

Automations

1. Reboot  into Unraid – Triggered by a button created using NR into a node that queries the “OS”  (state of the relay). If I’m already in Unraid it sends an SSH command  to Unraid to reboot. If I’m in Windows it sends a shutdown command to  Windows, waits 60 seconds, turns on the flash drive via the relay,  reboots the system via WOL and no I'm booting into Unraid
2. Reboot  into Windows – Triggered the same way by another button. If I’m already in Windows, it  triggers HASS Agent to Restart Windows. If I’m in Unraid it sends an SSH  command to Unraid to Poweroff, waits 60 seconds for a clean shutdown,  turns off the flash drive via the relay, reboots the system via WOL and now I'm booting into Windows.

*Edit 3: Here is where I implemented a few extra measures to make sure the flash drive wasn't disconnected prematurely. To be honest only using the relay to ensure what OS was running was lazy, even for me. I shortened the delay when shutting down Unraid to 30 seconds then the automation runs a shell command which uses the netcat command to check if the server is responding (specifically on port 80 which is the Unraid port so as not to report back as ""online"" when I'm booted into Windows). It then writes the response as either ""Online"" or ""Offline"" into a text file and I have a binary sensor set up to read the text file and then report it's status as ""on"" or ""off"". After the shell command completes, NodeRED checks the status of the binary sensor. If it reports Unraid is still ""on"" it goes into a 5 second delay node which then circles back to the shell command node again, and round and round we go until the sensor reports as ""off"" and the automation continues. This is also helpful in adding a ""boot into Unraid"" branch should my server just be off because I was working on it.*

*While I thought up the concept of how to implement the solution used in this particular edit, I am nowhere NEAR experienced enough in writing YAML to have gotten the config parts implemented so flawlessly. I have ChatGPT to thank for that. Also as an FYI if you want to use ChatGPT to check or write your YAML it works great (usually), but the GPT4 model is head and shoulders above 3.5 when it comes to this. GPT 4 was nearly flawless, and when it wasn't I would just copy and paste the errors in my log and it would figure out a solution. 3.5 was hit or miss at best. All that said, you still have to know the questions to ask and how to ask them, so for complete noobs I'm not sure how helpful AI will be.*

The  card on my dashboard was made using Custom Button Card. The entity  picture of the card displays the logo of whichever OS is currently running on the  server based on a sensor I created in my config that reflects the state of the relay as ""Unraid"" or  ""Windows"". Tapping the button triggers a  popup via BrowserMod. Inside the popup card, I have a horizontal stack  with two more custom button cards. One card triggers “Reboot Into Unraid” and the other triggers “Reboot into Windows”

My Build if anyone cares is an MSI Z690 EDGE Wifi, i7-13700K, 128GB DDR5, 3080 ti.

I  hope this post can help someone as it took me a very long time to  figure this out and collect everything I needed to get this to work.  Feel free to ask if you have any questions and I'm definitely up for suggestions on how to streamline or improve anything here.

&#x200B;

*4/20/23 Update: Two important things I've realized that I left out. The first is that Unraid boots from a flash drive that needs to stay plugged in at all times. Your license is attached to a unique key on the flash drive and changing it is not easy. I shouldn't assume everyone knows that. The second part I left out was another solution I tried that failed. As someone pointed out in the comments, you can buy data-only USB power blockers. I actually tried putting one of these in between my hub and server thinking that this would accomplish my goal of being able to control the power to the USB drive via turning power on and off to the hub. When I did this the system completely failed to recognize the USB drive even with power to the hub. I'm not sure if there's a straight forward answer to why that is, but my working theory is that my flash drive didn't know it was plugged into anything without some kind of power signal from the server and so it did not do anything. I wasn't going to start buying different USB hubs, etc to troubleshoot but would have probably made my way back to figuring it out had the relay not worked. If there IS a straightforward answer to why this didn't work I'd love to know so feel free to school me.*"	3	"[""IroesStrongarm: Good on you for solving your setup.

I don't even know if the issue was caused by my PC, the hub, or my flash drive but I wasn't about to start buying different hubs to try and Unraid license is linked to a unique identifier on the USB key so switching that is a pain in the ass. In the end I would have gone back to this route and tried harder to troubleshoot if the relay didn''t end up working, but so far , so good."", ""IroesStrongarm: Ah, too bad that didn't work.

This is my first build and attempt at home automation. I want a machine that can function as a NAS and run a VM with Home Assistant OS. I’m also on a tight budget.

- Option 1: used Lenovo: Originally the plan was to use a Raspberry Pi, but I can’t justify the inflated cost ($149 on Amazon). At that price, I may as well buy a used Small Form Factor PC like a Lenovo for $130. 

But a SFF pc doesn’t provide much expandability in the future.

- Option 2: Build a NAS: So then my next option is to build my own NAS. I’ve put together a nice build for $250 (asus motherboard, AMD cpu).

- Option 3: Le Potato: except I’m not familiar with Ubuntu or the other OS options, and getting Home Assistant to run on Le Potato doesn’t appear to be as streamlined as my other options. 

So for a first timer, what would y’all recommend? Money is tight. I don’t want to spend $250 unless I have no other viable options. Thanks for the advice!"	2	"['MeudA67: Well, first of all, lookin at Le Potato\'s specs (what a stupid name lol, never heard of it before), Ethernet is 100mbps...big nope for a NAS use case!\n\nAs a starting point, I think option 1 is probably best for your budget and use case. That will allow you to cut on cost and get some hands on time before putting a proper build together.\n\nWhere are you located? I currently have 2 SFF Optiplex 7040 workstations for sale on r/homelabsales ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelabsales/comments/12oc3dv/fsusgaoptiplex_7040_sff_x2_i5_6500_no_ramno/)). These have 6th gen i5 quad core CPUs.\n\nTo ""help a friend"", I can drop the price a bit and add a 250GB (may be 240) SSD SATA OS drive to get you started. All you\'d need is RAM (4GB would be enough, $15 on Amazon [HERE](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-4GBx2-PC4-19200-288-Pin-Memory/dp/B019FRDFU0/ref=sr_1_3?crid=AOS33J3D7YD8&keywords=4GB%2BRAM%2BPC%2B2400%2Bdesktop&qid=1681922528&sprefix=4gb%2Bram%2Bpc%2B2400%2Bdesktop%2Caps%2C81&sr=8-3&th=1), 8GB for $21), and a USB3 HDD for more storage (endless options here!).\n\nLet me know!', 'Revan_Perspectives: Thanks for helping me narrow down my options! \n\nYeah I’m wanting to start off small and have something that could work for the next 6 months or so. Maybe I’ll build a NAS when the Black Friday deals hit later this year. \n\nI’ll likely get the used Lenovo but I appreciate your offer, friend!']"

At first thank you all for sharing your projects and troubles, you’re a great source of knowledge ! :)

So, the goal of this message is to find a solution about solar overproduction. I currently have two small plug & play panels (800W total) for auto-consumption, and was thinking about using an AC battery such as ecoflow to store exceeding production. The trouble is that the ecoflow position (to power a 19” bay) is too far away for a direct connexion using MC4 connectors.

My first idea is to use this HACS integration( https://github.com/tolwi/hassio-ecoflow-cloud ) in the following way:
Depending on custom rules
- open the battery charge only at 140w for a passthrough powering (consumption of the bay)
- open the battery charge at 140w + exceeding production (using a dedicated entity for that)
- close the battery charge to power the bay through the stored energy, and open at power at 140w if battery level is round 20%

Does someone as a similar system ? Does it sounds good ?

Thank you for your feedback :)"	0	[]

This can be achieved by setting the `scan_interval` to some extremely high number, and then controlling the updates via `homeassistant.update_entity`, however this won't prevent HASS from scanning the endpoint after a restart. This is an edge case, but I'd like to prevent unnecessary calls to the endpoint.

Is there a way to prevent a REST sensor (or really any other sensor with a `scan_interval`) from being updated on HASS restart?

Being in a a privileged country, I was offered to do the migration to ADT along with many others, but I said to myself “why not do it myself?”. What you see in this picture is a custom dashboard that I built on the web socket API of HomeAssistant which features an alarm panel similar in layout to the Nest Guard. On the backend I’m using Alarmo (a fantastic project!), but I’ve added the birdseye feed from Frigate as well to make it more useful. Buttons are fully functional and even give haptic feedback, and I’ve added sound effects to better emulate an actual alarm. I’ve still got quite a lot of tweaking before it’s done, but I’ve got a few months before my Nest equipment becomes useless. 

I hope I can inspire others facing my situation to do the same, and I’m here to answer any questions that I can.

I also got a Starling Home Hub to better integrate between my HASS and my nest devices.

But I knew once there was no option for paid monitoring that my days with the secure were numbered.

Around here it's around 10 minutes or more. So the intruders get in and get out. Five minutes is more than enough time for them. Sirens are ok but people tend to ignore them. They are handy if you are at home during the intrusion. I agree that wired is better and more convenient in the long run. If you're not at home, all a security system will do is tell you that you've been robbed. If you're really lucky it might scare the intruder away before they do too much damage.\n\nPrevention focuses on making your home less attractive than your neighbors. A 90lb German Shepherd will do more to deter intruders than any sensors. But that's not always an option. So good camera coverage, including a doorbell camera, might make your house less attractive than your neighbor. Not because it the cameras will ID the intruder, but because they don't want to deal with the possibility of being recorded. Especially if your neighbor's house doesn't have a bunch of cameras around it. But a simple scarf will obscure an intruder's face. Motion sensing flood lights are also great for deterrence.

(Or even help with 'Google-Fu' would be amazing)

\-

I'm looking to essentially simulate a button press **via** this particular remote. I'm hoping someone has come across a similar project, perhaps wiring an esp to the button contacts internally.

Ideally something reliable and around the cost of an esp + any modules/wiring. *I'm not too interested in anything like a handful of Switchbot's physically trying to click the remote for example.*

**Why take this approach?**  
Long story short, the usual method of using learning/repeating RF codes via an RM4Pro isn't meeting my needs, due to rollerhouse's rolling code 'security'. At this point after throwing days at the RM4Pro approach, I just want to rely on the remote's internals since it's 100% reliable at sending the correct rolling code each time.^((I've researched around for months, researched Bond, researched RTL-SDR, got in touch with multiple RF open source devs etc. I've strangely got a workaround somewhat working via my RM4Pro at the moment, I believe I'm essentially brute forcing the rolling code security by slamming it with learnt codes until it changes state, but in reality this approach sometimes takes up to 3mins before the blinds accept it and raise/lower, which is not ideal when you're waiting by the door naked after a shower. This approach is a longer story that I don't really want to bog my main question down with.))

For context, I'm somewhat comfortable with esp, soldering etc, but I'm definitely a '*give me a youtube tutorial + 2 weeks*' in terms of skill/knowledge.

The rollerhouse is relatively ok price/delivery times here.\n* It took months of research to gather the few components needed (specific aluminium tube was tough to track down here locally, nobody seems to delivery domestically)\n* I've got a touch of 'sunk-cost fallacy' with this hardware. We only have one room done, the aim is to prove full reliable local control (✅) via a button/remote (✅) and also via HA automations (\\~❓)\n\n*On the otherhand, if anyone does know of a motor that'd work for my requirements, that's available in IE/UK/EU, I'd also appreciate hearing.*"", ""bullwinkle_z_moose: You can use an ESP along with an RF transmitter to send RF signals.\n\n[Tasmota has sensors to do this](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/RF-Transceiver/).\n\nThis guy has [a nice little write-up](https://wereallgeeks.wordpress.com/2021/02/06/tasmotarftranceiver/) of what he did if you'd like to use it for reference."", ""quixotic_robotic: In the end, the buttons are just making contact between 2 points on the board.

A solid-state relay (mosfet) could probably work for smaller and cheaper, but there's a chance that either the leakage current or the voltage drop across it could interfere with the remote's method for reading the button, so I'd go mechanical. There are expansion boards out there with a set of relays mounted that could work.

Zigbee2MQTT stops recognising it and the addon closes, won't detect it and won't connect to it

Only way to fix this is to physically reboot the machine that the SkyConnect is plugged into

Post reboot it works perfectly again for another 2-3 days but kind of a pain in the ass running servers for multiple things off that machine and having to interrupt

Restarting HA, restarting the VM, unplugging and re-plugging the SkyConnect USB do not resolve the issue; only rebooting the actual physical machine.

Running on Oracle VirtualBox. Don't have any other USB filters through the VM.

Any suggestions?

in the last few days I was experimenting with the snapcast addon from [https://github.com/corneyl/hassio-addons](https://github.com/corneyl/hassio-addons) 

However the addon suddenly stopped working for me so I would like to ask if some of you could try installing the addon and see if it starts for them. For me it hangs at ""INFO: Starting dbus-daemon... "" in the log. This persists over reboots and reinstallations of the addon.

If you could try the addon (default config) I would like to know wether:  
\- the addon starts or hangs at the same point  
\- your installation type

Nbr1sniper	4	12rpfv9	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12rpfv9/zwave_help/	"I just upgraded my pi4 HA to an SSD due to slow performance/signs of a dying SD card. I’m on the latest version of HA and Zwave without moving to 10.0.  Within a day of moving to the SSD I found my ZWave devices were falling off the system saying they were dead. If I manually turn on and off the device (light switch) there is a 90/10 chance it will reconnect to HA. If I try and heal the network or relearn the device it fails (most of the time). Then after a little bit it will fall off again. I thought it could be interference with the ZWave dongle being next to the SSD usb port so I moved it from the 3.0 to the 2.0 but that didn’t fix anything. 

Is my only option to remove each device and relearn them hoping it will clear up the problem? I’m not a fan of removing 10 devices, re-adding them, removing the old switch name so I can rename them the same names, then redo all my automations.

Anything else you can think of is appreciated!!!"	10	"[""alex3305: > I thought it could be interference with the ZWave dongle being next to the SSD usb port so I moved it from the 3.0 to the 2.0 but that didn’t fix anything.\n\nThis is your issue. It's USB3 interference. You'll need to use an USB extension cord with your Z-Wave Dongle to prevent interference."", 'Nbr1sniper: What do you mean? It originally was on usb3 and was fine. Added the ssd to the USB3 below and began to have issues. Shutdown and moved the dongle to usb2.0 and still issues even though the wire isn’t close to the ssd cord. \n\nAre you thinking the dongle needs to be farther away? I had an issue some time ago with a change that caused me to have to relearn all the Zwave devices and thought this may be a similar case but you’re thinking just need to put an extension to move the dongle farther from the ssd? If yes, should it go back to the USB3 port?', ""alex3305: > It originally was on usb3 and was fine.\n\nProbably because it was operating on USB2 mode which causes way less interference than high speed USB3.\n\n> [Y]ou’re thinking just need to put an extension to move the dongle farther from the ssd?\n\nYes. This is recommended for all wireless dongles because of interference.\n\nIn my system I have two USB3 ports stacked on top of each other.

I have a wall switch for a ceiling lamp ([https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/14147206L.html#lidl-14147206l](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/14147206L.html#lidl-14147206l)). So when I turn off the switch, the light becomes offline/unavailable.  
How can I update its state in Home Assistant, as soon as the entity becomes online again after turning on the switch? Especially read the value for brightness and temperature?

But what I'm having trouble is getting a good server to have HA on it and at the same time some NAS at the side or even some game server here and there.

My initial idea was to use a leftover PC that I had from a relative, it's not being used and I thought why not? I cleaned it up, setup the PC in Linux and... unfortunately I don't think I can live with it in my room. It's loud, takes up quite a power and bulky as it's just a normal ATX sized PC. 

Which leads to me finding some Raspberry Pi options. And we know that's never going to happen. So my other options, thanks to a bit of searching is to get something similar to a NUC or Thinclient.

Finding one on eBay for under 50 euros is possible. They're mostly quiet and doesn't draw any power, which is perfect to run a 24/7 HA server on it. But I wonder if I can kill two birds with one stone and setup NAS alongside with it, would it have any drawback for doing such a thing?

I'm not a tech whiz, I'm far from it but I'm happy to learn the ropes. So I would love some advice on how to get those working in tandem?

1681882541.0	18-Apr-2023 22:35:41	Looking for suggestions/ideas to set up a new home alarm system from scratch, please give me your input!	TheCriticalTaco	4	12ribp0	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12ribp0/looking_for_suggestionsideas_to_set_up_a_new_home/	"Hello HA reddit!

&#x200B;

I recently purchased a new house that had an existing Honeywell Lynx Touch L5000 Panel/System with three wireless door sensors.

First night at the house, I *accidentally* triggered the system and the Panel went **SCREAMING (seriously, it was loud as f\*\*\* at midnight).**

&#x200B;

The previous owners did not give us the code/didn't remember it. So I had to rip the panel off the wall and disconnect the battery LOL.... *guess I will need a new one* (we tired multiple ways to reset it, no-go, it is a lost cause).

&#x200B;

**So, now I am in the market for a new system.** I found out about HomeAssistant and I would like to leverage it as part of, but not the main, alarm system.

&#x200B;

It seems that most people on here recommend Alarmo, I wanted to see if I should go with that or if there are other options to consider? *(we are starting from scratch here so all ideas are welcome)*

&#x200B;

Compatibility with existing door sensor is not required (but would be a nice plus), I don't mind purchasing new ones, **so long as they are wireless since I don't want to run wires**.

&#x200B;

I work in software and don't mind tinkering with Tech & code, just looking for something robust and with modern features (iPhone integration, etc.)

&#x200B;

***What do you recommend?***

**Would I buy the panel/alarm separately?**

**What brand do** ***recommend*****?**

**Anything else I should know?**

* Location: US
* Existing System: Honeywell Lynx Touch L5000 (but not looking to use the panel)
* Use case: Just three door senors for now, might add window/glass break sensors later. Not looking to add CO2 or smoke sensors.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your attention and taking the time to help me out.

EDIT: Also, what are the downsides to using [a cheap panel/system from AliExpress such as this one](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256801514336914.html?spm=a2g0o.cart.0.0.17d238daSiySmN&mp=1&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa&_randl_shipto=US) and trying to link it to HomeAssistant?"	21	"['Cafe_y_Wifi: Hello. You can use the Konnected panel to retrofit your existing wired system (https://www.amazon.com/Konnected-Alarm-Panel-System-Conversion/dp/B07P5GYJMP) and control it from Home Assistant via a native integration (https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/konnected/).', '_Rand_: Alarmo is fantastic, and will work with literally anything home assistant does.\n\nAs for sensors/panel I highly recommend ring and third reality sensors, both are super solid and easily supported.  Ring sensors don’t need to be used with the base station, they are just refular old zwave and work with a regular usb zwave adapter.\n\nRealistically though any zwave/zigbee/whatever sensor you can connect to HA will do just fine,  but I’m still fond of ring/third reality in particular.\n\nOf note thought, third reality stuff all (mostly?) uses AA/AAA batteries and are on the large side, but have fantastic lifespans because of it.\n\nUnfortunately I’ve not rhe slightest clue if that system you linked works with HA, aside from the sensors being 433mhz which you should be able to pick up just fine with an rtl-sdr usb stick and the rtl_433 docker/add-on.  Its just a bit of a bear compared to zigbee/zwave (and I have slight privacy concerns as well).', 'thereddevil20: While I don’t use Alarmo (my alarm system is set using automations), Home Assistant is a good system to setup an alarm and Alarmo is a very highly rated system.\n\nI use a mix of Zwave and Zigbee door sensors to help with alarming as well as a tilt sensor on the garage.\n\nAlso alarm systems (like Ring, ADT) offer services that will call you when an alarm goes off and notifies Law Enforcement if you’re unreachable. There is a equivalent alarming system called Noonlight which is really cheap and can be configured using HA.\n\nLet me know if you have further questions\n\nEdit: Looked through your link. I think it would work but will need additional hardware for sdr and the antenna if you just want to use the sensors. Or you could integrate to HA using Tuya (I wouldn’t recommend it personally since I’ve had issues with it). You could also go with a cheap wall mounted tablet as an alarm panel. I have a tablet setup but tbh barely use it and interact with HA mostly through my phone.', 'undeleted_username: If you are already using HA, do you really need a ""system""?\n\nI set up my alarm using off-the-shelf door/windows and motion sensors, a siren controlled by a smart switch, ... Once all the sensors are integrated, all the logic and control resides on HA.', ""Tatermen: What weirds me out about those Aliexpress alarm panels is that they can be connected to Google Home/Amazon Alexa - so that you can arm/disarm via voice commands.\n\nWhat's to stop the burglar from doing the same? Seems like a bit of a major oversight for an alarm system."", ""phrogpilot73: I might be labeled as a HA heretic for this, but there is definitely a use case for a monitored system that integrates with HA. Case in point - from personal experience, when the smoke/fire alarm starts going off at 3 AM and your downstairs is filled with smoke, the LAST thing on your mind at that point is calling 911. We got ourselves and the dogs/cats outside, and the firetrucks were already rolling up to our house. Why? Because we were so out of it/focused on us and the dogs, I didn't even notice the three calls from the alarm company. In the end, the quick response only led to replacing a deep sink, repainting some walls, and replacing all the HVAC filters. \n\nHowever - we have frontpoint which uses alarm.com and it integrates with HA, so I get the best of both worlds."", 'Hefty_Science_2980: I went with a DSC system (alarm specific hardware) and connected it and control it with HA via envisalink. Full conventional alarm system and still have access to all sensors and automation. I like this setup but tbh I’ve never used Konnected or alarmo. It can be monitored if you want but can also stand alone.', ""TheCriticalTaco: Thank you! I will look into that. The problem is the existing sensors are wireless, not wired.\n\nLooking at the prices for new Zigbee or Z-wave senors, they only run about \\~$20-30 bucks each, and I will just need three. Plus a usb to communicate with PC and a siren, doesn't seem like a lot. So I might go that route + Alarmo."", ""TheCriticalTaco: Awesome, thank you for your feedback.  Would I be able to use this [Aeotec Z-Stick](https://www.amazon.com/Aeotec-Z-Stick-Z-Wave-create-gateway/dp/B00X0AWA6E) with the Ring sensors?\n\nI am curious why you strongly recommend those two, but I am sure you have experience that taught you they are the best. Would you still prefer them over the basic [Zooz Z-Wave Plus 700 Series](https://www.thesmartesthouse.com/products/zooz-z-wave-plus-700-series-xs-open-close-sensor-zse41)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love the sound of long battery lifespans, and totally do not mind senors on the larger side, the less battery changes I have to make, the better!  \n\n\nYeah, I gonna disregard that cheap AliExpress system. I don't really need a panel to arm/disarm the system if I can do it from my phone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo it seems the direction I will be taking is this: Zigbee/Z-wave sensors + dongle to communicate with them (Zigbee/Z-wave) + Siren + Server with HA OS. Is there anything else I am missing? Do you have any preference to Zigbee or Z-wave?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you again so much for your response"", ""TheCriticalTaco: Thank you for your input!\n\nDo you have any preference to Zigbee or Z-wave? I know one is open standard and the other is closed. One may get interfered with Wi-Fi, the other not. But in your day-to-day use, do you have a preference?\n\nYeah... I am not really interested in 24/7 monitoring for now, the discount I would get from my homeowners insurance doesn't really offset the monthly cost for it. But thank you for informing me, I will keep that in mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah I don't like Tuya either. But just for clarification, if I were to get those sensors, I would [use an SDR as such?](https://www.amazon.com/RTL-SDR-Blog-RTL2832U-Software-Defined/dp/B0BMKZCKTF)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if I were to go with the Z-wave sensors I would use this [Aeotec Z-Stick?](https://www.amazon.com/Aeotec-Z-Stick-Z-Wave-create-gateway/dp/B00X0AWA6E) Did I get the correctly\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTbh I am probably going to skip the alarm panel/tablet too. I don't really see myself using it that much, we all have our phones on us everywhere now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if I am getting this correctly, a minimalist setup would-be: Senors + Siren + Dongle for communication + a Server/PC running HA OS?\n\nThe server would communicate with the sensors through the dongle, and I would arm/disarm through phone."", ""TheCriticalTaco: As I found out, no I don't! I will just be going with HA + sensors + dongle + and a siren. Thank you!"", ""TheCriticalTaco: You are right. And the fact that the panel is powered by a simple, visible Micro-USB port. What is stopping them from disconnecting that (assuming it doesn't have an internal battery) ?\n\nBut, having been on the other side of the coin, when my alarm went screaming, all I had to do as well was yank it off the wall and disconnect it's internal battery (and the device isn't even sealed that well, it was just two simple tabs that I had to push down and it exposed the device internals).  \n\n\nOne can argue that after these alarms have been triggered and are sounding the alarm, their job is done, because a simple bullet or elbow grease will stop them. At that point, it's your turn to act.\n\nNot arguing in its favor, because it still looks cheap to me."", ""TheCriticalTaco: Damn, that is nice, but unfortunate! Sorry you had to go through that, but it definitely puts into perspective the use-case for monitoring. It is true, when shit goes down, last thing on your mind is dialing 911. Thank you for your perspective, really made me think about things I didn't consider."", ""TheCriticalTaco: That is cool actually, Thanks for letting me know, I'm gonna consider that as well!"", ""Cafe_y_Wifi: That's the route I took, actually. The suggestion for Konnected was in case you wanted to leverage the existing alarm setup. Good luck"", '_Rand_: That zwave stick should be fine, I use a zooz myself but they are more or less identical so it shouldn’t make a difference.  I’d just get whichever is cheaper really.\n\nAs for the sensors, I’ve tried probably 10 or 12 different brands by now (though not necessarily all the equivalent products) and have just fiund ring and third reality to be all around solid and reasonably prices to boot.  I’ve not had issues of any sort with either brand, and as you mentioned with the third reality stuff I don’t mind the size and love the battery life.\n\nNot that other brands are definitely bad or anything mind, but I find those two hit all the marks really.\n\nZooz and aeotec stuff is nice too for example but seems overpriced, sonoff works well enough but feels SUPER cheap, ikea stuff is ugly and gigantic (but fairly well priced), Aqara is super finicky etc.\n\n\nSo these days I typically stick with ring/third reality mainly because nothing about them really bothers me.\n\nPro-tip, Amazon somewhat regularly puts the Ring alarm kits on sale super cheap and even if you toss the base station the sensors can come out to like $15-20 each.  If you ever need to expand or want extra sensors for controlling lights or something its an inexpensive way to stock up.\n\nI don’t have a real preference between zwave/zigbee myself though most people report zwave works better overall due to potential interference with zigbee and wifi.  Your milage may vary of course.\n \nAnd you’ll need a server of some sort, zigbee and zwave dongles (unless you go 100% one way or the other) sensors, and a siren (with control pads optional).   \n\nI’d recommend zooz or aeotec for you zwave dongle, and a Sonoff 3.0 -p (not -e) for you zigbee dongle or perhaps a Home Assistant Sky Connect but that one seems slightly less compatible.\n\nAlso you may want to consider using a generic 12v siren.  You can hook them up to a smart outlet and turn it on when the alarm is triggered, its a bit uglier and less flexible than the zwave/zigbee sirens but they can be absurdly loud.', 'thereddevil20: My zwave setup has been solid. Zigbee too for that matter but I’m between zha and zigbee2mqtt right now so things are funky. If you have a large house ensure you have enough routers on your mesh network.\n\n24/7 monitoring in my mind is really cool for $10/month from Noonlight. But it’s obviously subjective.\n\nI’m not very familiar with SDR (don’t use any such devices) but the AliExpress link mentioned 433Mhz and anything that can handle it should be good enough. Another commenter mentioned there are security implications since those signals are broadcasted everywhere. \n\nI’d suggest going with zwave 800 with a dongle like this if you’re going zwave (it’s a coordinator with the latest version) https://www.thesmartesthouse.com/products/zooz-800-series-z-wave-long-range-usb-stick-zst39 However, since you’re starting from scratch I think it would be valuable to look at matter/thread compatible devices for interoperability with HomeKit and others. Sky connect dongle by HA has the ability to run Zigbee and matter at the same time but is still in beta. \n\nYou are correct on the setup. For a siren, I use a smart plug that gets triggered from HA but you have the correct basic idea on how to set things up.', ""phrogpilot73: I won't lie, it was nice that there was little damage. As I was implementing all the home automation stuff (to include Wyze cams with Dafang firmware), we were starting to think about moving away from monitored alarm stuff. We never arm it, because even if we're out of town - my in-laws live across the street and they keep their eye on our house. Then this happened. It was enough to convince us that not everything is worth self-hosting."", 'TheCriticalTaco: Thank you!', 'TheCriticalTaco: Good to know! Thank you so much for the detailed write-up! \n\nI will definitely be taking all that into consideration when I purchase them soon. You have helped me immensely !', ""TheCriticalTaco: Awesome! Thank you so much for your guidance! I appreciate it!\n\nYeah I'm not gonna use that 433Mhz sensor since I've seen LockpickingLawyer's video on how to jam similar ones.\n\nThanks also for the dongle suggestion, but if I want homeKit integration I should lookout for something that is matter/thread compatible, so I will keep that in mind. Thankfully my house isn't large (1,452 sqft) so I won't have to worry much about network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, on second thought, I will be getting monitoring, possibly in the future, since it seems to give my spouse peace-of-mind, and a lot of people recommend it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You are correct on the setup.

I was able to setup this remote to control a Zigbee light in the house.  I had to do it with two separate automations, one to handle on and the other to handle off.  I feel there should be a way to do this in just one automation.

What I've looked at so far to solve this but doesn't seem right is to set two triggers, one when the on button is pushed and another when off is pushed.  This way the automation will trigger on any button press.

Then I went to the actions and tried to set an If/Then action.  I picked device for the first if, selected the remote, but there are no conditions available to pull from.  What am I missing?  I know there's nothing wrong with just doing this as two automations but it would be nice to consolidate them if possible."	8	"['generalambivalence: Use trigger IDs in your triggers.

Fookes74	4	12qyttb	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12qyttb/toying_with_moving_from_homebridge_are_there/	"Hi, I’m toying with Home Assistant at present after a few years away from it. To be honest, it’s like starting all over again - it seems that different from how I remember it!

One of the plug-ins I use in Homebridge is Occupancy Delay (see here for a good guide to its intended use):

https://github.com/archanglmr/homebridge-occupancy-delay#readme

This is used in conjunction to a motion sensor in our WC downstairs - the logic being that the light turns on and a countdown begins. If further motion is detected within the set countdown, the clock ‘resets’ and the countdown begins again. It works really well in this room and the light doesn’t go off at silly times. It’s also not on for far longer than it’s needed to be. 

So, firstly, is there an equivalent way of configuring this in Home Assistant? If so, some guidance would be appreciated!

Secondly, I have an automation configured which arms an alarm system plugin when the last person leaves home and disarms it when the first person arrives back. Works really well and is very accurate (only actioning both of these close to home).

I guess (although I’m not sure) that my existing Homebridge / HomeKit setup utilises not only my router but also my Apple HomePods to improve accuracy and location to do these tasks. Is there an equally effective option in Home Assistant? It needs to be rock solid if so. Again, I’d be grateful for any guidance offered on this. 

Thanks in advance."	17	"['VikingOy: I have no knowledge of Homebridge, but having to turn on a light that is already on, in order to turn it off, seems to me like an overkill ? In Home Assistant, this is very straight forward and logical; You make an automation that turns off the light if no movements has been detected for x-amount of minutes. I\'m using a cheap IKEA motion sensor for this in my bathroom;\n\n    trigger:\n      - platform: state\n        entity_id:\n          - binary_sensor.bathroom\n        to: ""off""\n        for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 4\n          seconds: 0\n    \n    action:\n      - service: light.turn_off\n        data: {}\n        target:\n          entity_id:\n            - light.bathroom\n    \n\nAnd of course I have another automation that turns the light on. But they are almost identical except that ""off"" is replaced by ""on"" and the ""for"" condition is absent so that the light comes on immediately when someone enters the room.\n\nOff course, if you sit absolutely still on the toilet for more than 4 minutes, the light will go out, but all you need to do in order to get it back on again, is to wiggle your head or raise your hand. Then the light will stay on for another 4 minutes.', 'Mazekopp1: Went from Homebridge to HA a few weeks ago. I had the exact same plugin in Homebridge that you are using. \n\nHome Assistant is in my opinion, much better than HomeKit when it comes to automation. \n\nNow I only have to make one automation that says “When Motion Sensor stops detecting motion for X minutes, turn off light”.', ""FoShizzleShindig: Seems like you're hung up on your scenarios presented in the github page you linked.\n\nYou can use helpers like [timers](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/input_boolean/) and [booleans](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/input_boolean/) to recreate those in HA.\n\nFor your location-based automations you'd download the HA app on your mobile device and use the device tracker feature built in to create your arrival/departure automations."", 'gergles: I\'d recommend using the community provided ""sensor light"" automation blueprint which has all the features of HomeKit\'s automation and then some.\n\n[This link](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2FBlackshome%2F6edfec0ff6a25c5da0d07b88dc908238) would let you install it in your HA instance, and [this one]( https://community.home-assistant.io/t/481048) is the community thread discussing the automation.', 'Fookes74: Many thanks. But does this example you give cover the real world examples given in the plugin link I sent through?', 'Fookes74: Does that achieve the same though?

Aren’t you just describing a turn on and then turn off without any of the real world examples given?', 'Fookes74: Maybe you’re right.

This looks (in terms of what I’m currently using) to be a very similar setup. My one concern is this:\n\nHaving configured this I’m seeing the following results:\n\n1) Light not turning off after desired set time in config (I’ve done 1 min which is in addition to the inbuilt 30 seconds on the Motion sensor). Light goes on instantly on detection but will not switch off. What am I doing wrong here?\n\n2) We have a smart Sonoff Tasmota wall switch controlled via MQTT which also controls this same light. I’ve noticed on testing that if i use the motion sensor automation which turns the light on, if I then turn off the light at the wall switch and then re-enter the room to trigger the motion sensor it doesn’t happen. I’m presuming the internal countdown is still progressing and it won’t work until that’s cleared. Is there any way to do a either / or method of controlling this? I’ve always used Motion sensor but my SO is a little more technophobic and still likes switches!', 'VikingOy: Well, both my toilet and my world is real, and it works. It appears to me that you are trying (wanting) to do things in HA exactly as you did in HomeBridge.  In HA, there is no need to first turn a light on in order to be able to turn it off.', 'Mazekopp1: Yes HA can do all of the examples! The automations in HomeKit are not as powerful as HAs. \n\nYou can tweak the automations with triggers (the motion sensor) add conditions (if motion sensor senses motion) and actions (turn on lights). You can even add several triggers, conditions and actions to make the automation perfect for your use-case.', ""FoShizzleShindig: I have a laundry room motion sensor and just use a basic automation presented by another user in this thread.  \n\n\nIf you want to re-create the scenarios listed a boolean would be a virtual switch that the automation would turn on. I'd probably just use a timer helper and skip the boolean unless you want to really drill down into the automation.\n\nHave one automation start a timer when motion is detected as well as turn on the lights. Have a wait for timer condition to turn off the light. Have a separate automation to reset the timer when motion is detected. \n\nI've been using regular GPS tracking from the mobile app for a couple years now to arm and disarm my alarm and it has been rock solid. Also use it to open my garage when I arrive home automatically."", 'Fookes74: Fair comments. I’m new to this though effectively (after quite some time with Homebridge) so that’s why I’m trying to learn and understand what I should be doing.', 'Mazekopp1: As per real-world example: I used the same plugin for my kitchen lights, otherwise I would have to wave my hand every two minutes to make the motion sensor trigger the lights. With HA I just made an automation that said when the motion sensor has not detected motion for X minutes, then turn off the lights. No need for extra plugins that starts a timer.', 'Fookes74: So Booleans are effectively dummy switches? \n\nOk, that makes sense. I guess it may take a little time to tweak it time-wise to suit my particular need here. Greatly appreciate the input from you.', 'Fookes74: Also. You mention the built in tracking of the mobile app. Is it still something I need to toggle on in the app or is it primed and ready to go?', 'FoShizzleShindig: Make sure on iOS you enable location tracking to always in the actual phone settings, and you should be good to go. You can verify the state of your location in the developer tools section.', 'Fookes74: Thank you']"

I would like to ask if someone else is experiencing the same ""issue"" as me, and another user I know.

The problem is that not all the flows I have configured with a timer node, starts at the (exact) time that is configured on them, but 20, 30 or 40 seconds after. It doesn't happen with currently running flows (loops, for example) that needs to be stopped after a certain looping time, or at a specific time.

**For example:**

I have a flow that turns on the water heater by turning on the smart plug, at 03:00 AM. Then, it turns it off at the configured time.

By the other hand, the delay doesn't happends when it's turn off. Also, for the flows below it (loop).

Do you know something about it?

The plug turns off by itself automatically if it looses the connection with the coordinator (or other router), even if it lasts for ms, the plug won't turn on after that: FW problem (didn't get fixed by the devs). And, adding that node I can make the flow much more simple than having to build a loop task just for this."", 'mrtramplefoot: If you just turn the plug on from HA is it instant?

But I don’t know, if Border Routers from different vendors exchange Thread credentials automatically when they all use Thread version 1.3.0.\n\nIf you want to pair your Thread (not Matter) bulbs to Home Assistant, you need a SkyConnect for example. Then you can create your own Home Assistant Open Thread Border Router and pair your bulbs the way I described before. You have to unpair your bulbs from Nanoleaf. Then you see the devices and entities.\n\nIf you have Nanoleaf Matter bulbs, you can pair them as a Matter device to Home Assistant, when you use Home Assistant OS. After you paired a Thread device by Matter, you won’t see any device in the Thread integration of HA, but you have the Matter device/entities. As already described we do not have the Thread credentials to bring this together.\n\nBut this all (Thread and Matter) is very new/beta and it’s maybe not so stable, you would like it to be. 😉', 'The_Caramon_Majere: Good to know, thanks for sharing!', 'KartoffelToby: Oh yes sorry your right.

You could give each event an ```end_date_time``` of ```{{ now() + timedelta(minutes=5) }}```, but if I were doing this, I would probably try this..\n\nCreate a datetime helper:\n\n````\ninput_datetime:\n  work_started:\n    name: Work Started\n    has_date: true\n    has_time: true\n````\n\nand when entering the Work zone, I would call the service:\n\n````\n- service: input_datetime.set_datetime\n  target:\n    entity_id: input_datetime.work_started\n  data:\n    datetime: ""{{ now().strftime(\'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\') }}""\n````\n\nAnd when leaving the Work zone:\n\n````\n- service: google.create_event\n  target:\n    entity_id: calendar.my_work_calendar\n  data:\n    summary: ""Example""\n    start_date_time: ""{{ states(\'input_datetime.work_started\') }}""\n    end_date_time: ""{{ now() }}""\n````\n\nOnly side-effect would be the lack of any event created while you\'re at work, but you could use the Work zone status if you needed immediate automations based on whether or not you\'re at work. \n\nNote: Adapted from the examples in the documentation - none of this is tested at all, and I\'m not sure if the ```google.create_event``` service requires specific date formatting on the start/end date times. Experiment with it in the dev tools first.', 'podc87: thank you for all this infomation it really helped and helped get me to the code that seems to be working now  \n  `start_date_time: ""{{ as_timestamp(now()) | timestamp_custom(\'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\')}}""`\n\n  `end_date_time: {{ as_timestamp(now() + timedelta(minutes=5)) |timestamp_custom(\'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\') }}`']"

Now, whenever the doorbell is pressed, a binary sensor in HA shows its status as either on or off. To ensure my wife and I never miss a visitor, I set up an iCloud Alert Message notification on our iPhones. However, I'm still searching for a way to integrate this sensor button into my HomeKit Doorbell Notifications, even without a camera. Can someone suggest any possible solutions?	5	"['sejoki_: If you set up HomeKit integration via yaml, add the following to your configuration.yaml (or better yet, homekit.yaml)\n\n      entity_config:\n        camera.bell_homekit:\n            name: Bell\n            support_audio: false\n            linked_doorbell_sensor: binary_sensor.doorbell_sensor\n\nA camera is technically needed (HomeKit requirement), but it can be a generic one, linking to a static image. Since you already have your doorbell as a binary sensor, you can use that (for the linked\\_doorbell\\_sensor) or create a seperate helper. I\'ve gone the seperate helper route because I have actionable notifications on my Mac and iPhone and only need the HomeKit Notification for when the Apple TV is active.\n\nIf you configured HK via the integrations/GUI, there\'s no way to add it manually, but you can have a second HK instance running and only include cameras. Though I\'d recommend the yaml option there. I first had everything done with the GUI but redid everything and manually include the entities I want.\n\nOn the HomeKit side, there\'s no setup required. ""It just works"" ^(TM until it doesn\'t work and fuck you for wanting any way of manually fixing it or troubleshooting anything, we told you it just works, what the hell is your problem. Go buy a new iPhone.)', ""Xorfee069: Thanks a lot.. it worked, but second instance messed up and did a carnage to my first HomeKit instance.. including every device again (double devices are shown now).

But I really appreciate your help!"", 'sejoki_: >Can\'t even remove them unless I exclude them from HomeKit.yaml (so I have to put all devices into the list and exclude them) .\n\nYeah, that\'s what I meant with ""only include cameras"", but I see where that\'s not clear enough, sorry.\n\nWhile you\'re there, I\'d recommend only *including* the devices you actually need vs. *excluding* the ones you don\'t. Yes, you have to manually add new devices, but there are just so many entities that are irrelevant if you only use HomeKit for manual control (and I don\'t know why anyone would use it for anything else, the horrible automation interface got me to switch to Home Assistant in the first place)', 'Xorfee069: Funny point is that nearly 160 devices (sensors / lights / devices that are relevant - automation are controlled by HomeKit with over 200 automations ) added while I added the bridge, including 1 camera (doorbell). And the only thing I added to the HomeKit.yaml was just the script above …. So I tried to remove the double devices from the list, but was not able to do so, cause it said that I should edit the HomeKit.yaml file. \nIn conclusion I need to research more about it .. maybe I can figure it out how to do so. But thanks for your support ! At least I know where to begin with', 'jmcgeejr: Yeah I do the exclude by default and then just pick what I want for that exact reason, first time, homekit picked up 300 things lol.']"

the Spotcast integration, where about 10 call services executed with spotcast.start, begins to stop working and throws errors like: ""Call-service error.

The only way to solve the problem is to restart Home Assistant. Is there a way to restart the Spotcast integration without restarting the entire Home Assistant? This way, I could ""capture"" the error, and when it happens, automatically restart the integration."	4	"[""kunigit: Auto-restarting something is rarely the best solution.\n\nWhat does your ```spotcast.start``` service call look like?

That\'s why I\'m looking for a way to restart the integration without having to manually restart home assistant.\n\nThe error message is: ""\\[custom\\_components.spotcast.spotcast\\_controller\\] Found cast device: Chromecast(\'unknown\', port=8009, cast\\_info=CastInfo(services={ServiceInfo(type=\'host\', data=(\'10.10.10.58\', 8009)), ServiceInfo(type=\'mdns\', data=\'Google-Nest-Mini-1fef5fe3c43a7eb124499ecf16a75bb7.\\_googlecast.\\_tcp.local.\')}, uuid=UUID(\'1fef5fe3-c43a-7eb1-2449-9ecf16a75bb7\'), model\\_name=\'Google Nest Mini\', friendly\\_name=\'Bagno\', host=\'10.10.10.58\', port=8009, cast\\_type=\'audio\', manufacturer=\'Google Inc.\')).""\n\nI believe the issue may be with the ""unknown"" status of the device. After starting spotcast.start many times (probably ten times a day), it stops recognizing the cast device. This is likely a bug. The only way I know to restore its functionality is to restart home assistant.\n\nIt may be useful to know if there is a way to restart home assistant from Node-RED, but this is not the best solution too because while it is restarting, all other functionalities are paused, which means the other people in my home cannot turn on and off the smart bulbs or use the other automations.']"

1681808978.0	18-Apr-2023 02:09:38	Made my own motion/temperature sensors and how to prevent false positives with HC-SR501 PIR sensors	mark364i	2	12qgxfh	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12qgxfh/made_my_own_motiontemperature_sensors_and_how_to/	"Wanted to outfit several rooms in my house with motion sensors to control the lights and other devices, thought it would be a good challenge to try to create my own using ESPHome. They consist of:

* ESP-32S
* HC-SR501 - PIR Motion Sensor
* DHT22 - Temperature Sensor
* 3d printed case designed and printed by my brother

Couple of pictures of the finished product (plus command strip lol)

https://imgur.com/a/wPfWZkW

Average cost per unit is about £15.

The hardest part was figuring out how to prevent the false positives with the HC-SR501, I did see some posts about adding capacitors and what not but I'm not very good with a soldering iron especially on a small scale like this.

Thought it would be good to post a mostly software fix if anyone stumbles across this in the future.

The first part consists of moving the yellow jumper across to put the sensor in multiple trigger mode, this basically tells it to constantly send ""motion detected"" messages while it detects motion, compared to the single trigger mode where it will only send one message when motion is detected.

The 2nd part is to add a filter to the GPIO sensor in the yaml, I use delayed_on_off but delayed_on will also work. This basically means the sensor will need to see motion for at least the set time before sending the ""motion detected"" message to Home Assistant. I have mine set to 500ms as its the first timing I went with and it works flawlessly, the delay isn't noticeable so no point in changing it.

I also have the distance pot on the sensor set all way anti clockwise, the minimum distance is 3 metres I believe which is more than I need anyway.

Here is what my YAML looks like for the motion sensor:

https://i.imgur.com/sMWQSrg.png

Since implementing them like this I haven't had a single false positive, they all work better than I could have imagined. Don't need to go out and buy some more expensive radar sensor.

Hopefully this helps someone else who is struggling with the sensors, happy to answer any questions. Cheers."	3	"['slboat: Nice job, makes us want to make a pir sensor like that too.  \n\nWe made a very small human radar before, and the radar might work a little better than the pir.

However, there are times when it would be nice to have some information available to a 3rd party without giving them access to your system. The Govee system appears like it would solve that challenge for me since Home Assistant does not have granular controls for user access. I could use a few cloud-connected Govee devices that I allow others to see, and integrate them with Home Assistant for my use while keeping access to all other sensors and controls local. \n\nWith that background, I still think my original questions were valid. Answers appear to be along the lines of ""Govee looks to be free while they are building a market share; expect a fee for cloud services in the future"", ""Avoid the Govee and other cloud services if you have concerns about the specific data you are collecting being accessible to the company providing the services"", and ""The Govee sensors can be monitored locally in the event the cloud service becomes a paid service"". I remain interested to find out if they can be used locally only (without reporting anything to Govee) or not.', ""L24E: I didn't realize that could be done. In this case, I will benefit from the cloud monitoring, but if it moves to a paid service, it sounds like I could just use the sensors locally without it."", ""L24E: I didn't realize you could use these without the Govee cloud. Do they still connect outward and you also get the data locally - or do you actually stop the connection to Govee entirely?"", ""inorganiccentipede: Your monitoring goals are easily solved with InfluxDB and Grafana, both available as HA add-ons.\n\nWhatever your use case for having this info available to a third party, I'd say you are better off looking for a way to make those Grafana graphs available via something like NGINX than using a cloud-based service that's scooping up all sorts of metadata about the wireless environment around you."", ""pokemanho: That's what I've done with mine, just use the Bluetooth integration and pair them that way. All show up perfectly fine."", ""sauberflute: I think I still had to activate them in the Govee app but I haven't touched it since. I use the onboard bluetooth and BLE in active mode to poll them.""]"

I am able to boot it and see Supervisor CLI prompt. When I access http://HAOS\_IP:8123 from a web browser I get ""Preparing Home Assistant"" page which is stuck indefinitely.   
I checked firewall logs and HAOS was trying to connect to NTP which I solved by pointing to local NTP server.

But this didnt help. It is still trying to connect to some resources outside of my local network.

This HAOS installation is on a part of the network which has no internet access whatsoever. I am not able to give it access even for 1 second.

I need to download whatever HAOS needs on another internet connected PC and copy it locally but cannot find any info how to do this. 

Found sound posts stating HAOS needs internet to download some docker images at setup then it can left offline but this approach will not work as per above.

So two questions:

1. What exactly HAOS needs from the internet
2. Has anyone managed to get HAOS running without internet or I am wasting my time

Thanks for your help"	1	"['Sometimes-Scott: HAOS is an OS that downloads the latest HA docker container. You need internet to setup HA OS. Their isn\'t a practical way around it.\n\nIn theory, you can install HA core without internet. You would have to download all of the python repositories and put them in the correct directory.\n\nYou might be able to download the container and move it, but I\'m not sure.\n\nThe practical answer is you are fighting a very uphill battle. Maybe create the VM on your laptop/deskop and then migrate it to the server?\n\nProfessional advice, if this is for a business, don\'t. If the network is that locked down, you probably shouldn\'t install something that has ""home"" in the title and pulls from so many repositories.']"

I use duckdns to access my HA remotely, and even when I am on my home network I am still connecting via the external IP. I think this may be part of my issue.

I have been able to upload some mp3 files in my www folder but I cannot get the speaker to play these files. They are very small files that I want to use for automations (like an mp3 with a voice saying ""front door open"" when the front door is opened).

Is there any way to play these locally hosted files with my current setup? I appreciate any help that can be provided. It really feels like it shouldn't be that difficult.

TheMagicVariable	1	12q9a8d	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12q9a8d/ddcci_to_switch_monitors_as_part_of_a_scene/	"I'm lucky enough to have a nice triple monitor setup in my home office-- mostly for work, but it pulls double duty for play as well.  I'm looking for a way to control the inputs via HA-- My current ""Work"" scene changes lights and drops the blinds, but I also want it to change the input on certain (not all) monitors to the HDMI from my work laptop (and vice versa for when work is over).  But I also want to change them one-by-one as needed as I use my personal PC for certain work tasks.

I already use ClickMonitorDDC on one of the PCs, which works great when I leave everything on and have visibility to that PC. I know I can assign hotkeys and go that route, but it seems to be unstable, especially if my main PC is turned off and I start manually changing inputs.  My HA server is on a Pi-- how do I control 3 monitors from a pi (actually using one as a display for the pi would be a bonus, but not necessary)

I've seen posts for ESP32 HDMI dongles that sounded promising, but I couldn't follow along well enough to know if that was the right path for me.  Thoughts anyone? 

And before anyone goes for KVM-- my personal PC is really finicky about its graphic outputs.  As soon  as I do anything funny, including using its HDMI port or using a DP to HDMI adapter, it crashes my PC.  So KVM is out :(.  But it doesn't know that I've got HDMI plugged into the same monitors and doesn't seem to have a problem with me switching monitor inputs!"	0	[]

I've been searching for ways to control MIDI devices via HA, but everything I've found so far involves the opposite: controlling HA with a MIDI controller such as a piano or otherwise. My goal is to send MIDI commands *to* my audio interface to trigger different routing presets.  


To boil it down, is there a way I can send MIDI signals to a device through HA? I have a feeling it'll end up requiring a DIY solution, but if there's any existing product or software I'd be more than grateful to hear any recommendations.
