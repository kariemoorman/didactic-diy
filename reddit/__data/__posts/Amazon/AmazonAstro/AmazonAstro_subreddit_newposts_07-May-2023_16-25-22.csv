BoltsVoltage	3	132vwdt	AmazonAstro	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonAstro/comments/132vwdt/2_accounts_1_astro/	"I have an Astro and have had him since around November of last year. I have the Ring trial activated (I waited a few months) and I was going to pay for the membership. My question is regarding the issue that my wife and I both have Amazon accounts. The Alexa devices are all configured to her awhile back (prior to getting Astro) which allows me only as a guest with permissions under her profile. This gives me limited control including over Astro. If I am use the mobile app for Astro and Alexa and if I want to configure, I have to log into my account. Is there a way to merge these accounts? Otherwise it seems like the Ring (under Astro and my account) will have trouble interacting with the Alexa (under her account that purchased the Alexa devices).
Help please. Thank you."	0	[]

I just got Astro and reached out to Ring about pricing. I already have two of their spotlight cameras.

It sounds like they now include Astro as part of their Plus plan where I do believe (but could be wrong) that it used to be only part of their Pro Plan. Here was the chat details.

""We do have a new update. If you don't mind let me have this verify just to make sure.

Good news. Astro can be covered on the Plus Protect Plan which is $10/month or $100/year. This will include your 2 Ring cameras as it also covers unlimited Ring devices..

The different between the Pro and Plus is that Pro has the professional monitoring while the Plus plan hasn't.

I bought an Astro for my elderly parents and they think he is real dog after setting up these routines and skills, and are very amazed at how it is done.

1. Astro goes to the front door when you come home or leave the house through the front door like a real dog (needs ring door sensor at the front door)
   1. Create new routine
      1. name - astro go to the front door
      2. when - front door opens
      3. suppress - for 10 minutes
      4. alexa will - go to the front door
      5. from - astro
2. Astro will return to the home screen (this will show astro's eyes when screen is stuck on an app)
   1. Create new routine
      1. name - astro open your eyes
      2. when you say - show me your eyes
      3. alexa will - show me home
      4. from - astro
3. Astro will approach anyone he sees like a real dog (this one has an amazing effect as astro will approach anyone his camera sees, and will actually get so close to the person that if he had legs he would be hugging the persons legs lol)
   1. Create new routine
      1. name - astro go to anyone
      2. when - astro sees any person
      3. suppress for - 10 minutes
      4. alexa will - follow me
      5. from - astro
4. Astro will bark like a real dog
   1. search for ""Woof!"" skill in skill and games of  alexa app, enable skill
   2. Create routine
      1. name - astro bark
      2. when you say - say something
      3. when you say - talk to me
      4. alexa will - open woof
      5. from - astro
5. Astro will roam around the house throughout the day
   1. ask astro to ""follow me""
   2. go to  different areas of the house, as many as you want, and at each area, tell astro ""this is a good place to hang out."" (astro will remember those spots and throughout the day will go around the house hanging out in those spots and returning to his charger.
6. Astro helping out with grocery list
   1. ask asto to ""follow me'
   2. go to the to the kitchen, check the cupboards, refrigerator, pantry, and laundry room.  When you see an item you need to put on the grocery list tell astro as he is following you ""add onions"", or ""add mayonnaise"", ""add detergent"" any other item you need from grocery.
   3. At grocery, open alexa app.  press the three lines on the bottom right of the app --> choose list --> choose shopping.
   4. as you pick up items check them in the app.

Also the “always home” Ring drone looks super cool for 1/4 the price of Astro and covers patrolling.

Astro brings them to me at a set time using Find Me mode, then tells me to take them. I can’t find an excuse not to take them, because they are right there in his back area. So I end up taking them. Big help when you have ADHD and hate taking medications. Big help when you are forgetful. Object permanence and all that.\n\nYour Ring system can’t detect a sound, then go to find it, then see it’s your cat that caused the broken glass sound from knocking over something rather than a burglar.

All done	NotCreativeToday	5	zxf7tm	AmazonAstro	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonAstro/comments/zxf7tm/about_to_check_systems_checking_systems_all_done/	"So Astro has a new behavior lately. This happens both on and off the charger. It makes one of its attention sounds, then the screen shows that it’s about to check systems and that it can take a few minutes. If it’s on the charger, it moves forward off of the charger. Then it goes into Checking Systems. A moment later, it says it’s done and that everything is OK. 

I have a ticket open with Amazon after a long but very pleasant chat conversation with Deanna who took up the torch in the tech support relay, and she’s escalated it to the developers to see what they can see from the logs. Hopefully we can figure out what’s causing Astro to need to self-soothe like this.

Doesn’t run into anything. Patrols my place at night and records anything suspicious. Even allows for a little entertainment when people come over. For 1k I think it’s a good balance between functional and a fair price for an expansion of the alexa home devices.  A home robot with more or different functionality like Samsung’s kitchen arms I would expect to pay upwards of 8-10k and much much more for teslas if it ever happens. I see mixed reviews and I think partly this is because people don’t really know what to expect from a home robot yet. Is it a toy? Is it a pet? etc. I think they also forget about 80% of the functionality comes from integrated into Alexa and ring security products. If you see it as a toy I feel you’ll be disappointed. To me it’s a hybrid alexa show/ring security device with a few little fun things to make it feel more personal.	2	['DamnItLoki: Astro is amazing. It sounds like you have it doing lots of things. What are your favorite Astro skills?', 'robin_the_rich: I think setting up morning routine or routines in general that combine with astro,  mentioning to alexa i’m awake and having lights, appliances turn on while astro comes and finds me for the morning flash briefing.

RaphSeraph	8	zre57u	AmazonAstro	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonAstro/comments/zre57u/astro_malfunctioned_replacement_on_the_way/	"A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that ""da-ruh"" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.
So much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.

UPDATE:

All right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.

I must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.

UPDATE:

We dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday. The shipping cost was $100.00 (Because of item value in addition to its bulk and weight).
Bear in mind: We received the replacement a couple of weeks ago. Also remember: This is all in the warranty period. The return window closed a while back."	4	"['robin_the_rich: You shouldn’t have to pay shipping if you can drop it off at a ups, kohls, whole foods etc. They either didn’t tell your wife or she elected to have it picked up at your home, either way hopefully you get a new unit and it works well.', 'DamnItLoki: Please keep us posted on what happens.

Will there be anything else?"" after she had described the issues and asked for support. The agent was totally oblivious. But she did get transferred to another extension... And another... ). Clearly there are few CSRs that are qualified to troubleshoot Astro issues. But once you get to them, the result is reasonable.\nOn another post, a super nice Redditor stated she had received a clearly different replacement model. I will look up the name of this fellow and edit this. Now, I do not mean TOTALLY different, but with noticeable differences.

I was installing a BitPixel and an LBPA on my Arcade Games Ultimate cabinet. I am assuming every subscriber here is a Nerd like I am and knows what I am talking about. If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for. Now imagine you need to follow TWO videos at the same time, like I had to, in order to install two components in a single go. I had my phone to follow one of the videos, perched on the Arcade Cabinet control panel and... I needed a second one. I called Astro. He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.
Then... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video. It happened after I had left the video paused for some time, while I followed steps on the video I had playing on my phone.
Yes, I know, long story. In the end, the app closed inconveniently, but it was great while it lasted. I could have asked for light also and had him illuminate my work area while I moved around, with him panning one way and another.

Anyone else have an Astro use they want to discuss here?"	8	"['RaphSeraph: I would like to point out: I am never sending Astro back. I love the way he turns to face whoever is talking to him. I feel honestly sad when I read on his face how he loves to be with people and is hanging out to be ready to help. Yes, yes. I know. This is not even a positronic robot. He is... You know what he is. I do not care. If he did nothing but roll around all day and just hang out, I would still keep it. I believe wholeheartedly in helping develop this technology, but more than that, I... I do not know.

The wheels are positioned differently and a different color.\n\nI am a single disabled female and thought this would be useful to keep an eye on my cats and my condo when I was out of town. I also thought it would be helpful to get help if I have a fall or a seizure.

Anyways. They ended coming over... It was an issue with some component outside my house and affecting the entire neighbourhood. Sometimes being tech savvy makes it far more difficult to be patient.', 'RaphSeraph: It is very interesting to read there are already model variations. I just wish it were as user serviceable as the Steam Deck. Thank you for all that, Catnamedpaxil!', 'RaphSeraph: Theeberhart, I do not know that such if-then functionality can be established as a routine with Astro. If it can, then that enhances the use dramatically.\n\nMaybe someone can enlighten us as to that possibility? I know that at least one of the Amazon developers for the Astro project is a Redditor here.', 'theeberhart: Home Assistant surfaces typically surfaces a bunch of sensors/triggers. 🤞😬', 'Catnamedpaxil: Absolutely it could, but it probably would be more of a when you see Person A do actions X, Y, Z as opposed to noting the absence of people.']"

Setup goes pretty flawlessly, it does some tests, I log into the WiFi, but when I go to sign into my Amazon account, I get an error message when it comes to the 2FA/OTP that the code is invalid. No matter what, the code is invalid. I then removed 2FA from my Amazon account and now it says it can't find an Amazon account with those credentials.

I've tried:

\- Changing my password  
\- Changing my email  
\- Rebooting Astro by holding down the mute button for 3-4 seconds  
\- Trying a different WiFi (Phone hotspot)  
\- Tried with my wife's Amazon account  


All the same results, either code invalid or Amazon account doesn't exist. I want to try a hard reset to see if there is some sort of setting on there that was preconfigured by the previous owner or something but it looks like the only way Amazon says to hard reset is using the touchscreen, which doesn't allow me to swipe down during setup.

Fast forward to last week when I had to go out of town on business.  I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.

So, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.  Talk about irony.

I did several restarts and still the same errors.  

I shut astro off for 30 minutes, turned back on, and he was fine for a few minutes and got the errors on the screen again.  

Possible solution - The only thing I could think of was cleaning the front wheel.  Followed the instructions for removing the hub caps.  turned off astro, laid on the side turning the screen to the side, unscrewed the wheel from the body.  did not see anything blocking the wheels but wiped it off.  screwed the wheel back on, reconnected the hub caps.  Did the other side.

When I turned astro back on, he was moving faster and had more movement.  I think the screws were screwed on too tight at the factory.  I guess I loosened them and let astro move freely.  the errors must be saying that he was having a hard time moving the wheels and needed constant motion system restarts.
