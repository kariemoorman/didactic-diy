&nbsp;

First the autoplay of trailers which nobody has ever liked, instead of letting us look at posters and read descriptions. Then there was hiding useful headings like ""movies"" and ""tv"" in order to promote buying more subscription channels and renting/buying movies that aren't on Prime. Since you know, it's never enough that you're already paying for Prime. Then those awful ""skip intro"" buttons that appear during a tv theme song/intro credits. Crimes against humanity. But at least in some measure or form the website was readable. You could see many different things at once from a glance. But that was just too non-shitty enough for Amazon. They needed to break the shit ceiling and go one notch lower. So now, congrats, you can barely see anything appear on screen as giant vertical boxes appear instead of small horizontal ones. It's so poorly programmed that you can't even zoom out to see more tiles in the grid. It will always display the same 5 tiles per row, just make the text smaller. Gee, thanks.

&nbsp;

Edit: Amazing, now there's not even a ""free to me"" section, because why would we want the stuff we paid for? Hell no, we're paying for more ads, let's force people to buy, buy, buy! And the auto-trailers are so pernicious you can't even read the description of the movie unless you move the mouse to hide the video every 2 seconds. 

&nbsp;

Dear developers, stop fucking redesigning things to make them worse. Do you even test your work? Do basic market research? Quit turning what was once a premier streaming network--before everyone else got in on the bandwagon I might add--into yet another generic piece of garbage. You're sinking your own ship!"	2	"['Animal-Crackers: >\tEdit: Amazing, now there’s not even a “free to me” section\n\nFree has a different meaning now that Freevee is integrated with Prime Video.

Then I’d go and cancel all of the S&S items I didn’t need more of. Now it seems they’ve changed the S&S model where if you order something as S&S, they ship one out immediately with a 5% discount and then will ship out another on your regular S&S date.  There is no option to wait for it to ship with the next S&S batch shipment at a decreased price (10% or 15%). 

Has anyone else noticed this?  Why did they make this change?

Honestly it could very well be costing them more money as they have to ship each time out expedited for 2 day delivery whereas with the S&S bulk shipment it all usually arrives in a single big box. I have to imagine those extra shipping costs for each individual item are expensive, not to mention bad for the environment."	2	"[""moonbeam127: Ive not been adding to S&S, i think you can go and change the date to 'next shipping' but its not user friendly.  \n\nwhat i did notice is when you delete from S&S previously amazon kept all those items in a list for you under 'cancelled subscriptions'  that section is blank.

I was having an issue where when I place orders, it won't process the order. No charge is made to my card, it just sits there on Not Yet Shipped.

However - when I go into the order and manually update the shipping speed, it immediately will process and I get a delivery date.

I couldn't get anyone to really believe it was an issue until I was talking to their Key Delivery department, and I had an order I had placed earlier that day. She told me there was not inventory and the order would update when it was available. I then changed the shipping speed an immediately got an estimated delivery date, order processed, and my card was charged. I guess that was proof enough because she called out to another department.

Apparently there is an internal issue they're working on. They didn't really have a workaround or information on a fix, but at least it was confirmation there is an issue

* Amazon delivery using in-garage gets stuck
* Can be unstuck by changing delivery speed

This is actually 1st time I am so pisst off with Amazon . 
I am their customer now for 8 years got arroundish 2k orders so far and less than 10 returns ( because items were faulty ) no other claims.  

Last week I decided to upgrade from my 2080 ti to 4070 ( no judge xD ) , ordered it from Amazon ( amazon is seller and dispatcher ) , item box got delivered it in Amazon paper bag . And what was my surprise when I opened and there was no GPU inside.  Item box had no seals (film) or stickers on at all . I contacted Amazon straight away where CS asked me to file police report and send them back. 

Yesterday went to the police office and asked them what to do , they just looked at me and said I should deal with Amazon as item was lost with them not stolen from my possession. So I contacted Amazon today once again told them all the limbo and once again - they said they will transfer chat to concerns team , they are not available and will respond within 24-48 hours . After 4 minutes I got email stating same thing again . That based on similar deliveries they believe that item was delivered .

It’s about the money fraud, dimwit.\n\nAnd, filing a police report is just what it’s called.  The police aren’t likely to even be involved.  It’s clerical, unless you CALL THEM TO YOU TO DO THE CLERICAL WORK, which in some locals, they won’t and will make you go in for the clerical people that work for the POLICE (DEPARTMENT) to take the report.\n\nI surely hope you never get your identity stolen, get hacked and have money stolen, get your vehicle side swiped in a hit and run, or you know any other type of thing that involves a police report being filed (at your request, for your benefit) because you are a lost cost if so.']"

Hey, I am experiencing a very bizarre situation with Amazon(DE). Let me tell you about everything.

After months of saving the money, on April 13 I have decided to order my new gaming PC. I was really undecided what parts should I get, I have canceled few orders before I made the right purchase but I finally got everything right and paid them (via bank transfer, unfortunately). My order got split into 2 packages and got dispatched on April 14. And the split is very important now, one package contained: GPU, CPU and RAM (Package 1) and the second package was a single item with expensive motherboard. (Package 2)

On April 15 I received an e-mail that Amazon decided to block my account due to suspicious activity. I was confused and worried because they said all orders will be canceled, after educating myself from this page [https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GCC7G9HKYQBZT5FX](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GCC7G9HKYQBZT5FX) I have decided to refuse the delivery and let the packages go back to Amazon because I was worried about warranty and . According to the tracking links the packages reached Amazon on April 19 and April 20 so I was hoping I will get refunded within few business days.

Days passed and I didn't hear any news from Amazon so I decided to e-mail them, at first they kept hitting me with ""Blah, blah. Packages take up to 14 days to reach our return center, if you wont get refunded after 30 days contact the carrier"". But after spamming them for a while they told me there's an item missing (GPU) from the Package 1 which contained CPU, GPU and RAM. They scanned only RAM and CPU and issued me a refund for those items on April 27. (Total of 920 Euro from 2820 EUR)

I didn't hear anything about Package 2 yet so I decided to contact the carrier, they confirmed that the package got picked up by the sender on April 20. After asking Amazon support what's going on with the 2nd package they told me that they have to investigate will contact me within 24 hours. After just a few hours I have received an answer from them - They received wrong item in the package which wasn't the motherboard. I was shocked.

On the next day I sent them a very long essay explaining everything that I never received the packages, had no ability to modify them in any form and I refused to pick them up through the carrier website so it actually never reached my house. They have all proof, the tracking links confirm that. I was told to wait up to 4 days because their super team is investigating on the case. Today, few hours ago I received the answer that they can't issue me a refund and if I have any questions I should contact account specialist.

I am speechless and hopeless. This is the most fucked up situation I've been in and I don't know what to do. If I paid with card I would chargeback them right away, but unfortunately I was trusting this company...

TL:DR: Wanted to order dream PC from Amazon. Amazon account gets blocked, I decided to refuse to pick up the packages from the carrier, packages went back to Amazon's return center. A week later amazon tells me that there are items missing in both packages, they don't want to refund me the remaining amount which is 1900 EUR. I am hopeless."	9	"[""SpellMyNames: The worst mistake you make was refusing the delivery. If they sent you that you should have received. Doesnt matter the warranty you can then later appeal to reopen account and get your warranty if need\n\nBut also can't you call your Bank and file a complaint for the money? How are things in Germany? Just call and file complaint for fraud or something? They may be able to help? I don't know. \n\nAmazon is has becoming a mess when it comes to refunds or replacements"", ""turtlehead357: i don't understand the thought process behind these computer builds and ordering all the part at the same time. Not implying that you're trying to pull something, but ordering a bunch of expensive items at the same time triggers security investigating both by the company that your are ordering from and your bank account.\n\nI only order inexpensive item around $10-20, and still got the security checkpoint a month ago."", 'gr8teeth: We’re the items shipped by Amazon or was it a third party?', 'tworule: Have you tried issuing a complaint ? https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home2.show&lng=EN if you are based in EU.', 'Throwingshead: Likely a glitch in the system and or whoever you talked to doesn\'t understand the situation and you may have confused them by reaching out early. Just based on the language the rep used if you accurately stated it proves they are confused with the situation or there is more to this than stated.\n\nTo start off these can take weeks if not a bit more to have a refund released. You refusing the delivery means nothing will be released until the item is checked back into their system and manually inspected. So even if it was delivered on the 20th doesn\'t mean they are able to get to it in the time you believe. It can take weeks before it\'s your orders turn to get processed due to high return volume.\n\nHaving said that if you truly were able to refuse the shipment before it was marked as delivered that would have voided the sales contract so technically the sale was never completed and the carrier never relinquished possession and liability for the order. Because of that you have no liability for the packages and the contents within them. \n\n>I didn\'t hear anything about Package 2 yet so I decided to contact the carrier, they confirmed that the package got picked up by the sender on April 20.

""But after spamming them for a while"" - reps are human, reps don\'t like being spammed when you are constantly given correct info and it is out of their power to do anything until the warehouse returns department releases the funds. Doing this likely caused them to mess something up out of confusion or to get you to stop spamming them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>""Blah, blah. Packages take up to 14 days to reach our return center, if you wont get refunded after 30 days contact the carrier""\n\nThis was accurate aside from your responsibility to contact the carrier. Sometimes the truth isn\'t what you want to hear or accept but being patient for expensive items like this is important.\n\nAmazon didn\'t scam you in this situation, you more than likely created chaos by not letting their procedures play out.', ""SpellMyNames: Oh I just read that you paid with Bank Transfer. So I don't know can you dispute the Bank Transfer maybe? Have you checked that?"", 'Landiago: Just checked, All items were shipped by amazon', 'gr8teeth: Hmm I’m not sure then.

The delivery person didn't take a picture and I have history of failed deliveries, not many but it happens. I live in a small gated area with 4 houses and I gave the code to the gate. Sometimes they deliver to my door, sometimes they throw it over the gate, and sometimes they leave it outside the gate. My neighborhood isn't that great/safe so if it's left outside the gate, it's guaranteed to be stolen. If they throw it over and it lands near our trash, sometimes our trash guy will think it's trash and throw it away or maybe take it for himself? But I've had no problems before with refunds or replacements, but for this one they are saying it's their policy that they are not responsible for lost/stolen items and are not willing to replace/refund/or give any promotional credits. There's nothing on the item I bought stating that refunds/replacements are not an option. So is this a new policy? If so, do they expect their customers to accept losing $100s?

The customer service people all say the same thing about it's status saying it's delivered so they can't do anything. I've gone through 3 reps and they all say that they cannot do anything because of their policy.

Tried to purchase a gift card (no I'm not getting scammed, its for me); with the same card I always use thats selected by default. Card doesn;t arrive, everything gets locked, I start getting these ""someone may hav e1337 haxx0rd ur account!"" emails from Amazon that tell me they locked it down and I should be able to log in and make a new password; yet every time I do, I can't because it asks me for the expiration date of a card that I literally do not have. If I did its an old card I never removed from the account because I do not have this stupid card. Of course it picks THE one card that I don't seem to have in my little card book (why wouldn't it just ask for the primary or a recent card?)  


Call center guy says nothing can be done if I cna't answer that question, and yet asks me for all my info like address, phone etc which is all answered correctly; but still says its up to some dudes in some other department that might answer yes or no in another department.   


What kind of company wouldn't unlock an account when someone is 

1. Calling from the registered phone
2. Answers all verification questions correct
3. Succesfully confirms 6 OTP to the registered email
4. Can provide full card numbers of every other dang card on the account
5. Provides all information correctly such as address etc

I'll give a brief explanation of what happened, back in Jan16 I sent back a 988.23$ gaming motherboard, UPS delivered it on Jan18th, fast forward to 2 months later and Amazon says the never heard anything from the return center, so the item is pretty much lost, im told I won't be getting a refund, and to call UPS, called them atleast 20 times, no help from them.ither, they sent me all the proof that the item was in fact delivered. I have emailed jeff@amazon.com, talked to many CS reps and supervisors, zero help, so I'm done trying now after 3 months still no refund nothing, im ready to sue, can anyone tell me the correct way to do this?

I don't think they were new. They came in a small bubble envelope. I went to set up a return and found that the only options now are to bring it to Whole Foods, an Amazon store, Staples ,or Kohls, sans packaging and they will package it up and return it for me for free.

But since none of those options are close to where I am-- and the nearest locker is a couple of miles away-- my choices are to pay $6.99 to drop it off at the local mom and pop mailing shop that I've always used before and is a block away, or have UPS come to my house to pick up the package for $7.99. 

I get they are trying to save on costs, but this seems a bit extreme, especially since the item is defective. I don't know if these are static return costs, but if you buy a $10 item and it's defective, you'll get about $2. back after you pay to return it. That doesn't seem right.

Later I found out that my roommate, who I share my account with, legitimately bought the gift card for a friend, but as a result of me cancelling the order, the friend's account was put on hold.

I feel terrible about all of this, so I am trying to show that the transaction was legitimate and help get my roommate's friend's account unlocked, but not much progress is being made. I've called Amazon Customer Support several times, and only twice have I spoken to anyone remotely helpful. Of course, I've been very nice and respectful and patient to everyone about all of this.

The first helpful person said they'd escalate the matter to the fraud department to let them know the transaction was legitimate and to release the hold on the friend's account, and upon my request the customer service rep also sent me an email confirming that this is what they told me. The second helpful person, who I called about two days later, did the same thing and read me the email they sent to the fraud department to escalate the matter. Amazon's customer service has been awful lately so I'm not optimistic, however, and I really want to fix this.

I've emailed Amazon explaining the situation and provided documents (with all irrelevant information redacted, of course) proving that I am the account holder and the holder of the credit card used to buy the gift card, and even emailed some of the addresses that I've seen people recommend on this subreddit. I've heard this leads to more success stories than just calling and constantly hoping you don't get some outsourced representative who won't help you.

I was explicitly told that this was acceptable to share.

Long rant:

Hey folks, so on march 10th, I ordered a pull down green screen. It was a third party seller, but amazon fulfilled. after 10 days of the delivery getting pushed back, I reached out ot customer service and was transferred from indian call center to north american based support, who said it would be [shipped by the 28th or I'd be refunded or it'd be replaced.](https://i.imgur.com/oEe6gqe.png) 

Some time after this, it was simply cancelled. I noticed it in my cancelled orders and called repeatedly asking for them to reship etc, and it just wasn't happening. When asking to speak to north american customer service again, i was told this is impossible and no human on earth has this power. I asked why it was cancelled, asked them to uncancelled it, etc, but nothing could fix this. The indian service was useless and could offer nothing. I was hung up on, sent a [blank email at one point](https://i.imgur.com/8lihqts.png) and I was stern - but not screaming, not yelling, not swearing. Just ""I was told this one thing, and I want this thing I was told to be honored."" 

After wasting 5+ hours on phone calls and escalations and finding it to truly be pointless, I set out to find another way to contact amazon. I found Vincent Duong and doug herring's contact information publicly listed on linkedin and other places - C levels at amazon USA, so I reached out to them directly. I did not receive a reply, but I did receive a call from Amazon.com Executive Customer Relations and their reply email was ecr-replies@amazon.com rather than just CS-reply@amazon.com

This person was legitimately helpful. they pulled the actual call audio and listened to it and stated that it was very clear in the call you would receive the product if it wasn't shipped. they said the cancellation was a misunderstanding by an ""outsourced service department"" and that resulted in an unsolvable situation. After we talked it over and I was given a 50 dollar credit (item cost was initially 100ish) and was assured this wouldn't happen again, as is generally the case with these things, but it was nice that he had all the information and was able to understand that I was told something so they should honor it. Which... they didn't. but it was better than nothing after waiting more than a month for something I could just order from aliexpress for 60 bucks and also wait a month. I asked, repeatedly, if I could share any contact information for this department and he said there was no way to call in, but that I was free to share how I escalated it. I made it very clear that the email addresses were public, but I emailed C-levels directly to get further engagement on my issue, and he said that is appropriate. 

This was not the end of my frustration, though. I wanted to order a large TV to celebrate a personal milestone, and placed an order earlier this week for an 85 inch LG, scheduled to be delivered today. I was called and told the packaging was damaged, so they could just ship a new one tomorrow unless I wanted to inspect it, but I told him that was just fine as long as they could ship another - as someone less tech savy would be receiving it under instructions to reject any serious damage or if the TV was visible through damage, which he said it was. So that's great, they'll reship. Large/heavy item handling is much less frustrating to deal with, it seemed like. I get a call from an extremely noisy indian call center 20 minutes later, informing me of a refund to my card, it will take 3-5 days to process. I say I don't authorize this, I want it reshipped as I was told would happen, one is still in stock and this should be doable. The price has been fluctuating up as much as 300 in the last few days so I want it for the price I paid, and I planned my weekend around picking it up and installing it, and was told ""oh well the refund is already pushed sir you must purchase again"" 

Well the card I used has a good interest rate I wanted to take advantage of, but not a high enough limit to just throw another 1700$ TV on it, so this just does not work. I was told one thing, and then immediately had the rug pulled. I thought I could follow the same procedure as last time, but I figured at this point I'm just tired of amazon. I cancelled my prime and found the same TV at best buy for the same price I paid, for pickup on sunday. 

And I just don't want to deal with spending hours on the phone with amazon, again, to find out that someone who says something has absolutely no responsibility for what they say whatsoever. In general it seems like amazon isn't always the cheapest option anymore, and they certainly don't have even remotely useful customer service. 

So I wanted to rant about all that, and share what did work for me, for those who may want a solution. I was explicitly told, again, by exec CS that this information was OK to share. And if anyone else has any information on moving away from amazon, I'd love to hear it. Newegg seems terrible these days but generally it seems like best buy has competitive pricing for large items, so I imagine that's the case for a lot of things you might typically order - less one stop shopping, but not really paying more, generally."	13	"['IndiaEvans: Thanks for sharing!

I did a trade-in, used the trade-in gift card, used the trade-in discount, and it was on sale so I got a good deal.  I don't want to cancel and reorder unless it get the same deal.  When I talk to customer service, it takes about 30 minutes to explain the background.  Then the person realizes that they don't know what to do next and they immediately disconnect.

Then the number of orders i placed that were over $25 that qualified for normal free shipping if i didnt have prime cut out like 80% of my orders. \n\nThe piddily crap that was under $25 that I would of had to pay shipping would of been $4-$8 bucks to ship and honestly if i waited a week or two i could of just lumped them together and make it over $25 to ship free. So that left like a handful of orders a year that i would of had to pay shipping on. Those shipping charges dont add up to even 1/4 of what prime cost me a year. Add on i never used kindle books, never used music, never used photo storage or any of the other dozen perks that i have no interest in and amazon prime video just became shittier and shittier - some months you have to pay for certian shows others not, or pay for certain seasons or episodes  and constantly changed out what movies were free or not. Also the bullshit $5 rental on a 30 year old movie when you can buy the fucking DVD off amazon NEW for $2 is an absolute joke.\n\nSo yea i was absolutely right to dump it. They didnt even try to persuade me when i called and wanted a refund of my remainder of my prime subscription. They were just like OK sorry you havent been enjoying it and that was it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSO i suggest anyone reading my rant - actually sit down, pull up past order history, remove anythign over $25, really analyze and think about the under $25 items you could of bundled together as you didnt need them right then and there, and see whats left. Then ask yourself is it really worth paying $150 to get those items? If you factor in that $150 cost - could you of just bought them locally or whatnot?']"

My interior decorator had my AMEX card on her Amazon account to use when she purchased items for me. It was NOT her default payment. I started getting $14.99/month charges on my AMEX for Prime and I had no idea why. I pay for my membership annually, and I couldn't find these charges anywhere on my account. After several chats with AMEX and Amazon that went around in circles the charges got reversed. About a month later my decorator texted me that she was horrified that her Prime membership was being charged to my AMEX! She had no idea how it had happened but she immediately removed my card from her account.

Fast forward a few months to March and my mother gets an Amazon Prime $139 charge to her Discover card. She doesn't even have an Amazon account so she contacted Discover, got it reversed and got a replacement card. Then she calls me yesterday that it happened again in April!

I contacted Amazon, got it reversed, and removed her card from the account completely. My AMEX is my default card, it shows as my default card for my Prime membership, and I literally charge to it EVERY DAY so I know there wasn't a problem with it.

I went to my account to see if there’s any information on warranty etc. There was none. The only support option was to call them. 

So I did. 

I get connected to somewhere in India where the person says, ‘No worries, you’re in the return period. We can process a return’ and then proceeds to create a return label (!?). I asked them it can’t be because I’ve had the wire for 6 months. We’re having this conversation when the line drops.

Couple of weeks back received an email from them stating ""After a review of your details, we have determined it is necessary to close your [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) account.""

I tried logging in and was asked to send payment card info. Did that and they responded stating ""Thank you for writing back regarding your [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Gift Card activity. We sent an email on xxxx informing you that your Gift Card usage is in violation of [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Gift Card Terms and Conditions and we closed your account.""

The strange thing is I have used gc's for less than 0.01% of my purchases and nothing in the last 4-5 months was purchased using GC's. Another thing is in 2022, I purchased about $1 mio worth of stuff across 3 household accounts and this year (Jan - Mar) I have done less than $10k total, primarily because had no time and none of the purchases was using GC's.

Called to request a review but nothing happened. I used these accounts primarily for BG purchases using Amazon Prime card but there were minimal returns and no charge backs, so not sure what the real reason is. I am well aware of many others doing much bigger volumes than me or atleast similar volumes so not sure what triggered this. 

They even refused to return my Amazon prime annual fee which seems pretty rough considering they closed the account without any actual reason being given. While I am fine with them closing the account, I am wondering what do I do to purchase items for personal use from Amazon as they will probably close the new account too?

Out of nowhere my account was put on hold.

When logging in I was then asked to provide my credit card statement with a few requirements like blocking out all except the last 4 digits of my card number.
The requirements also listed that my address needed to be visible, my name, as well as my phone number.

My statement doesn't list my phone number. It just doesn't. I've never seen a statement that does.

I uploaded my statement and put in the note that my statement doesn't list the phone number.

After a review I received an email saying the hold could not be removed and to upload the same thing.

So I did.

Again, the hold was not removed.

I received another email saying to upload my credit card with only the last 4 digits visible.

I went to log in again, on the website it didn't ask for the credit card but for the card statement again.

So I uploaded both.

Again, I received an email saying the hold could not be removed and to upload the credit card. And it said if this wasn't provided the account would be closed.

On the website it again asked for the statment. I uploaded just the credit card this time.

I then received an email saying that the hold could not be removed and that my account would be closed now. That's it. Gone now.

WTF???

Now, after all of this I decided to just open a new account. Once I wanted to buy something and went to check out, bam, account on hold. And I then went throguht the identical experience again, account closed.

Wtf?

The grill cost $1500 in total.

I instantly Amazon and requested to refund my item and they told me that would be no problem and they will email me refund instructions within 48 hours so about three days go by and I never received an email so I contact another Amazon rep within tells me to wait 24 hours at the email will be sent.  Again I wait another three days with no email and finally contact Amazon once more who then told me that they need to process the refund via a telephone call, so I proceeded with a telephone call for about 30 minutes of conversation to ultimately be told that the item is non refundable.

Dozens of mishaps resulting in infant deaths with a particular crib? That\'s what federal consumer protection laws deal with in the United States. If the lamps were resulting in house fires, actually that would be handled by a different department.\n\nAmazon rules are FAR more restrictive than federal consumer protection laws in the United States. But if we were to rank whose rules were the most restrictive, I\'d say California protection laws are actually more stringent than Amazon rules - in fact, California is the reason for much of the information you have to provide about products on Amazon. But the United States FTC? They care about whether Amazon is forming a monopoly - that\'s their pervue. Not whether a lamp you received might vary by a few inches. Not at all.\n\nSo sit down and take a breath. You don\'t understand what you think you do and you shouldn\'t be ripping apart people that dare disagree with your incorrect assertions. Try a gentler approach.\n\nYou are right that if the state and federal laws CONFLICT, then the federal law supercedes. However, the laws rarely overlap because the FTC has a vastly different mission than the state consumer protection agencies.', 'DonCBurr: ROFL...

If there is a law that states sellers must take back items damaged by customers, I\'d love to see it. You are utterly confused between corporate policies - both Amazon and bank card companies, and law. Law does not have nearly the impact on these things that you think it does.

End of story. They only engage when serious safety issues are at stake or fraud is being committed on a massive scale. They absolutely do not engage Chinese companies based on the height of their lamps. They just don\'t. And saying otherwise is just plain silly.

Maybe based on things you\'ve heard second or third hand or whatever. Or based on anecdotal experiences that happened a certain way.

For some specialized products or services, additional rules may apply."" -FTC\n\nHealth products, to which you randomly referred earlier, have their own set of regulations under the FTC: https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/health-products-compliance-guidance\n\nYou have a lot of reading to do that you obviously haven\'t done. I will help you with this. If you tell me you\'ve read all of this, you\'re lying. I know that based on the several things you\'ve made up here and presented as fact.  Read this before you reply again. It relates specifically to regulations regarding online advertising.  Also, if you don\'t know the difference between laws and regulations, you should familiarize yourself with that, too. Much of what you say is true if/when an advertiser takes them to the extreme. However, if the advertiser has clearly made an effort to be honest, Amazon won\'t be disposing of their inventory. They would simply have to pay the seller for it. They have very specific rules about handling inventory and disposing of it, even if you blatantly violate their policies, is not one of those reasons. It must either be requested by the seller or abandoned by the seller, or damaged in some way that poses a risk (like spilled chemicals or damaged batteries - and even then, if they were damaged after you sent them, you will be reimbursed if you used FBA ""ship to Amazon"" feature. There are no other circumstances when they will simply dispose of your inventory. They will, however, continue to charge you for storage until you stop paying, at which point the inventory becomes abandoned.\n\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/com-disclosures-how-make-effective-disclosures-digital-advertising\n\nThe PDF is 53 pages and it\'s only a tiny subsection of their rules.\n\nNote that their emphasis is on ""...educating businesses about their legal obligations and consumers about their rights."" \n\nTheir guidelines can be summarized as follows:\nWhen it comes to online ads, the basic principles of advertising law apply: \n1. Advertising must be truthful and not misleading;\n2. Advertisers must have evidence to back up their claims (“substantiation”);\n3. Advertisements cannot be unfair\n-----\n1. The above ad is truthful\n2. I\'m sure the advertiser can back up their claim that they might send you one and they might send you the other\n3. The advertisement doesn\'t seem to be ""unfair"" which is admittedly extraordinarily vague and I suppose *could* include anything either of us could think of.\n\nSince the OP posted that particular picture, I can only assume that he or she saw it. So in this case it would be difficult to argue that they didn\'t see the disclosure. And unless there is a third random product, I would assume they can back up their claim that you will get one or the other. Admittedly, the photo should be the first one. I don\'t know what your experience is, but in my experience, Amazon A/B/C tests the order of images and the seller does not have exclusive control.\n\nThe listing is shit. I think we agree on that. But a listing being shit doesn\'t necessarily rise to the level of illegal.\n\nIllegal activities on Amazon that have been targeted by the FTC  have been objectively unfair practices, such as exploiting the ability to merge reviews (a huge problem still), a substantial change of an item that has gained a good sales history (like taking lamp a that sold very well and replacing the ad copy, pictures, and description, to a totally unrelated product like speakers. It happens all the time. You often see these products listed under manufacturer names like QWWYTZTOO or some other nonsense. No brand accountability. Just move on to the other randomly created brand name with the exact same product.\n\nWhat I\'m saying is that as strict as they are with those of us who are honest sellers, they are not tracking and prosecuting sellers or manufacturers with home proving intent would be impossible. In the United States, a crime must have intent. There\'s no way to prove that the ad in question was placed with the intent to deceive. Not with a picture that clearly says you may receive one or the other. In fact, with that picture left out, I firmly believe very few people would even notice. So even though it\'s a shit ad and they SHOULD have created an ASIN with a separate product. But if the UPC is the same, trying to do that would present its own problems.\n\nSo based on the letter of the law, I don\'t see any way the FTC will be investigating this lamp anytime soon. And based on the absolutely horrendous support that Amazon provides and the absolute jumbled mess and countless shady workarounds in the so-called brand registry, I don\'t even see Amazon giving half a shit. If they do, the seller will just change the manufacturer name and put it back up.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong. There are tons of sleazy sellers on Amazon. Many of those who should be shut down won\'t be. I\'m not saying this product, seller, or manufacturer is reputable. But I find nothing about the OP that leads me to believe they have broken any laws (in the US). Certainly not one that anyone in the government would give a shit about. There are bigger fish to fry. You have to pick you battles. This is a battle only a fool would pick.\n\nMy suggestion: if both options are not acceptable to you, don\'t buy it. There are probably a hundred other listings for the exact same items either on Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, and countless other places. Having laws is no excuse for pretending you\'re an idiot and can\'t protect yourself.\n\nBTW, credit card charge backs in general as far as the FTC is concerned apply to cases of fraud over $50 - primarily fraudulent charges  Their rules do not apply to a consumer being dissatisfied with a purchase, although that additional protection may be extended by a card issuer.

Backstory: Prime member for years. Changed phone number, 2FA needed to be disabled to log in again. ID verification passed, but still needed to answer security questions to regain account access. Questions were wild (iykyk). Realized all I wanted now was to cancel my yearly $140 membership and be set free.

What the first three representatives failed to tell me, was that if you create a new account with them, they will automatically cancel your previous Prime membership and any subscriptions tied to the account! Basically, a win-win, because I wasn't trying to cancel all my active bank cards tied to the account or block bank access.

So I went ahead and made a new account while on the phone with rep #4 (Luis - an angel!) and he canceled my old membership. Your rep should be able to walk you through this, but it's important to create your new account with the same email as your last one.

Now, I've been set free! I am able to repurchase a Prime membership if I chose, however, not sure after this experience. Good luck to anyone going through this!"	0	[]

Shipping varies but if its over 25 bucks its free', 'lorelaimsmith: I wish the streaming stuff could be purchased separately and skip the shipping etc, for a lesser price.', 'MargiePal: We cancelled Prime one month ago - Actually we PAUSED it. Before I did that, I researched as much as I could. I thought perhaps getting rid of Prime might curb my online shopping, but so far it hasn\'t. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. If you have a Prime credit card through Synchrony Bank, you will lose it when you cancel. Your card will be downgraded to an Amazon Store Card (with the same number) on the very day your Prime expires. You will lose any Rewards points that you had saved up, so be sure to use them up before then. You won\'t get the 5% rewards on Amazon purchases anymore. I paid off my balance in full, but if you still have a balance, I believe you still have the same terms to pay it off with the downgraded card. However, I can\'t say for sure.\n2. You can still make Amazon purchases like before, but you won\'t get any ""special Prime deals"" on select items.  I know this, because it tells me when I can get a better price if I renew Prime. It really isn\'t much difference though and only on a few things.\n3. You can still get free shipping on orders over $25, but only on items sold by Amazon. These are the same items that had Prime free shipping before, so no real difference there, you just have to combine items to total over $25. Note that when you add items in your cart and go to check out, the shipping charges are added. You have to change the toggle selection to the ""free shipping"" option to actually get the free shipping.\n4. You won\'t get any free one-day shipping or two-day shipping anymore. Most things seem to take about 4 days to a week to arrive now.\n5. When you check out, the payment option will default to your Amazon store card, so you will have to manually change it to another payment option. For example, if you want to use a different cash back credit card to pay. This is annoying, but also workable.\n6. I didn\'t totally cancel my Prime but instead put my Prime on HOLD. I did this, because we watched some Prime streaming shows, and I didn\'t want to lose that history in case we add Prime again in the future. I\'ve heard all that history will be erased if you cancel Prime completely. I can\'t say what happens to your order history, but I think that would stay intact, but maybe someone who has actually canceled Prime will add their experiences.\n7. One other irritation is this glitch I keep running into (This may only be because I put Prime on hold, and because of MS Edge browser). Every time I go to check out, I get hung up on this ""Resume Prime"" page, and the only way I can get to my cart is to back up, save one item for later, close the browser window, reopen Amazon, add the item back in and then go to payment again.

Anyways, I got an order delivered but the seller didn't bother checking the item they labelled is actually said item now I want to return it, but now I have to go out of my way to drop it off or pay a fee for pick up. 

Maybe I'm a little entitled, but I find it ridiculous that I have to drive to a drop off location and waste and money just so I can get a refund for a mistake that they made. They won't even send a replacement, only refund. Granted, this is more of a seller issue than Amazon. But why should I put in extra effort of getting this fixed? What's the point of have prime if the convenience gets thrown out the window? At the very least they should offer free pickups on ordered that either the seller of Amazon screws up. They can asked for evidence for the screw up, which is very evident in my case.

I can understand paying for pickup if I decide I don't want the item, but this is not that situation.

Update: I found there is an option for a replacement instead of a refund. However, there's a good chance the seller have all of the same item mislabeled and I would get the wrong item again. I decided to return the item for a refund and get it from another seller, for a slightly cheaper price (but not by much). I still have to go out of my way to drop the package off though.

Plenty of time to fix it, though. After all, I did order them Monday night. Last week. They did not send the item out until I tried to cancel, this Monday. This is not the first time it\'s happened, it is, in fact, extremely common. It\'s happened on things I tried to cancel within the span of 24 hours, and things will often take this much time or more if I just patiently wait like I\'m supposed to. It\'s gotten to the point where I\'ve been tempted to game the system by cancelling products the day after I order in order to force Amazon to send the product, but I don\'t want to overwork their already slave-driven staff. In any case, for someone who\'s lived rural, I find it curious that you didn\'t consider how remote my location is, and why I would rely on e-commerce in the first place. \n\n2: Amazon is giving me a refund on an item that took forever to ship. It shouldn\'t take 3 business days to ship a Prime item. When it arrives, I have to send it back, wait for it to ship back to them, and then receive my refund. They will not give me my money back ahead of time, and I do not have the money to buy two pairs of boots. \n\n3: It was a prime item. It did take as long as I\'m claiming to ship. Not deliver, but ship. I live in Canada which may affect this, but if that\'s the case I strongly believe they should rephrase their 2-day shipping advertisement to be more accurate.\n\n4: I\'m more upset that it doesn\'t seem to matter to them that I\'m upset enough to cancel everything. They don\'t care. They don\'t need my patronage. I spent thousands a year on their overpriced crap because of their ""cUsToMeR sErViCe"" (which admittedly used to be amazing) but every time I need something from them recently it\'s ""Sorry..."" and patiently waiting for me to disconnect. The customer service representatives can\'t do ANYTHING to help me on any of my issues. I\'m not even mad at them, it\'s just frustrating that the higher ups give them so little power because they don\'t need to compete with anyone anymore.\n\n5: Your experience doesn\'t invalidate mine. I\'m struggling to see why this is being framed as a counter-argument. My experience has been that shipping is taking longer than ever, Canada Post strikes and Covid included, and the customer service doesn\'t seem to care while the ones that do care have their hands tied behind their back because it\'s cheaper than giving them the power to problem solve.\n\nI\'m remaining unhappy because I just spent the last of my food money on a pair of boots that will get me terminated the SECOND I enter the job site with them on my very first day, because they lack the proper safety toe and pierce resistance bottom. I practically bought a pair of lightweight trendy boots that I can\'t return until Monday of next week. I was willing to be hungry for a week if it meant having gainful employment and a cheque at the end of it.\n\nThanks, you\'ll have to take my word for it but I don\'t actually downvote anyone.']"

We finally got a blue Amazon locker, yet I cannot use it! We have Prime, and use a joint account with my partner (same address). My partner literally ordered something to this locker the other day and picked it up, yet I cannot 'see' this location on my account. The locker is not on the map, and I cannot find it anywhere. It cannot be that it's full because literally tried to order to another one and it said that one is full (but I can still select it). I tried contacting CS but they are as useful as a chocolate teapot. Any ideas?	1	[]

It was a bed, nightstand, and dresser from Amazon. Total came out to about $635. Cool. I placed the order and the expected delivery was March 20th. Awesome. Close to March 18th, I was notified that it was running a little late and the new delivery date was March 24th. It wasn't too big of a difference, so I didn't think anything of it. 

Bare in mind I've used Amazon for years and never really had any issues.

Well, on March 24th, there still was no updates past ""shipment label created"" and ""carrier picked up package."" I called Amazon, and they said that they haven't received an update, that they hated I haven't received it yet, etc. But this rep created a return label for something I never received without letting me know. She transferred me, and they said that the previous rep created a return label but didn't know why. The current one canceled it and said they put in a ticket. They advised me to reach out to the manufacturer because their system says they never received it from them.

There is no way to contact the manufacturer. All contact information provided by Amazon and Google ensures that you cannot reach support.

I called UPS to see if they had an update. They said that Amazon had only created the shipment label. But has not dropped off the package to be shipped.

Called back about 7 business days later. Same thing. Stated the previous rep had created a return label that was canceled and they ""recreated"" a ticket.

Called back about 5 days later. They started pushing for a refund and I said that honestly I just wanted what I ordered. I wouldn't have ordered it if I didn't need it. I said that I'm okay with a refund if there was no way of me receiving my product. Then proceeded to tell me that a refund was impossible because of the return label created and that I had to wait for the return label to expire. 

Now no one has given me any information. I was told I'd hear back by email for a resolution for 2 weeks now and I haven't heard anything. I don't believe a case or claim was ever created because they refused to give me any information on it.

I've asked them to escalate the issue. It's been almost 2 months. And idk what to do. I'm out over $600 and I need a bedroom set for my child.

At this point idk what else to do.

I ordered a bottle of Grande Lash Serum online, and it never came in the mail. I contacted customer service about it to track where the package had gone, and they said that they weren't able to give me a refund or a replacement because of this clause in their Conditions of Use policy that talks about risk of loss. In their response they quoted this: 

>""All items purchased from Amazon.com are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.""

The lash serum was super expensive (I splurged around 70 dollars on it!) and I'm really upset that customer service isn't doing anything to help with it. At this point, I just want my money back because I spent the money on a product that I didn't receive. I'm feeling a little lost as to what I can do now because I've tried to talk to customer service and they pretty much said ""too bad"" and left it there.

Has this ever happened to you guys? Also, is there anything else that I can do about this, because I feel like Amazon just cheated me out of my money."	45	"['Advanced-Cow-8190: This is some new shit that they are doing.

&#x200B;

I purchased a monitor from amazon that has been nothing but issues.  They cancelled my order first, delayed it two more times after re-ordering.  It arrived 3 weeks after.  When checking the status of my refund they told me the item was delivered.  I explained my conversation with support but they said the agent was ""mistaken"" and can't do that.  I already recycled the box and they are refusing to work with me.

&#x200B;

Looking for advice on how to proceed?  

&#x200B;

I don't want to purchase a box with my own money to send back. 

&#x200B;

Amazon asked me to put the monitor out front of my house on Monday to see if UPS will pick it up, I fear it will get stolen and then I really wouldn't get my refund.  Do I dispute charges with my bank?  When talking to support they eventually just repeat over and over ""We've already shipped you the box, it's not our fault you discarded it"".

&#x200B;

This monitor is 49""

Boxes are expensive."	1	[]

I don't know if my account was compromised but when I checked, it didn't seem to be, there were no unrecognized devices. I have 2FA enabled since the beginning using Google Authenticator, so that would be pretty difficult to bypass.

However the web interface doesn't inspire me with confidence. There's no way to see where my Amazon account is logged in, just how many places it's logged in. When I asked the Amazon rep which device had subscribed to those channels, he couldn't tell me. So I'm thinking of cancelling Prime and removing my credit cards because the security seems worrying.

&#x200B;

I have heard the horror stories about people receiving fake and used items on Amazon, but I thought it was incredibly rare and won't happen to me. I was also receiving 5% back on my credit card this quarter to order from Amazon, so I thought this would be the best purchasing option for me, boy was I wrong. So I ordered an expensive Item on Amazon ($1200) and when it showed up the box was empty, the Charger was in the box and a small screwdriver but the item itself was missing, You could even see an imprint in the packaging from where the item used to be but the Item itself was not there. It was as if someone ordered the item, stole it, sent it back to Amazon, and they restocked it and sent it out to me.  Once I realized this, I immediately called customer service, and they told me to ship the empty box back, which I did that day. A few days later, The item on my orders page went from ""return started"" back to ""delivered"" because Amazon thought I sent them back an incomplete return.  I called customer support a few times and each time I was told very shortly with no explanation that the Item would not be refunded until May 10th. I was finally able to get in touch with someone who could explain the situation to me, and apparently I was never supposed to have been issued a return label in the beginning, because this happened the warehouse received an item they were not supposed to and marked it as an incomplete return. Due to being marked an incomplete return for whatever reason, they cannot issue a refund until May 10th. She even reached out to 3 mangers above her, and no one has the ability to override the hold on the refund. So, moral of the story is, never order expensive Items on Amazon if you don't want to risk having your money held up for over a month.

1681962793.0	19-Apr-2023 20:53:13	I pre-ordered a book on January 27. It was released on February 15. It still hasn’t shipped and Amazon is telling me to buy it, more expensively, from a third-party seller.	Karnakite	17	12sl2vy	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/12sl2vy/i_preordered_a_book_on_january_27_it_was_released/	"The order isn’t canceled, it just stays in the “We’ll let you know when it ships” limbo.

I’ve heard of issues with Amazon keeping pre-ordered items in stock, like video games, but with books I usually hear the opposite - pre-orderers get them often on the day of release. This is a somewhat niche non-fiction book, so I don’t believe that the demand is quite so high that they can’t send it out in two months. The only way to purchase it on Amazon during those two months has been through third-party sellers for a markup.

When I first contacted Amazon Support, I was told that a “glitch” in their system had resulted in my nearest warehouse not having it in stock. Which seemed strange (why not just ship it from a different warehouse, then?) and that’s when they first suggested that I purchase it through a third-party seller and have them refund me. I didn’t wish to use a third-party seller since I wouldn’t receive it as quickly, and basically a lot of the guarantees I would get through Amazon would not apply without a lot more of back-and-forth afterwards if there was an issue.

I tried again to check up on the status of Amazon’s stock a week and a half or so later, and they won’t answer the question directly. They just keep telling me to cancel the order if I didn’t receive it and no longer want it (but I do), and to use a third-party seller to get the item and have them reimburse me the difference afterward (I don’t trust third-party sellers and pre-ordered and have Prime for a reason).

There's never really a point to it, unless you get some sort of amazing pre-order bonus, but it serves no purpose. Always wait for reviews first before purchasing. Just my 2-cents.

If so, Amazon is responsible to either get you the product or cancel the order due to being out of stock. I find it really odd they are telling you to cancel the order yourself.

Unless you had a really bad experience in the past, if the seller has a good rating percentage (over 90%), there isn't really anything to be worried about. Truth is, Amazon themselves would probably have under a 90% based on their rate of failures. Regardless if you order directly from Amazon or a 3rd-party, you're still backed by Amazon's A-Z guarantee. 3rd-parties have to follow the same rules as Amazon in regards to handling orders and support. If not, they will have a low rating.\n\nMy advice would be to contact Amazon support again and try your best to have them resolve it.

This time, I only used my card to sign up for amazon prime free trial, and that was fine, my account never got put on hold. I used a $25 gift card to purchase something and everything seemed fine, but then 5 minutes later i got an email saying the account was put on hold and I needed to verify my card. I didn't even purchase anything using my card, I even got a text when I signed up for amazon prime asking me if it was me, i said the purchase was authorized. Did i just lose my money? Is there any way to get the account back? I don't even know if I'm using the right bank statement. This is the picture i sent them (uncensored) and they said it was invalid. It includes my name, last 4 digits of the card, and my address, which is what theyre asking for. Is there a phone number I can call where I can get this resolved?

I just got off the phone with Amazon customer service about a charge I got this morning for nearly $100.It said that they were unable to accept the return of my textbook rental for the following reasons: ""Pages Damage"". And I definitely didn't damage the book, anything that would have been damaged was in transit.

They then went on to say that they would ship me the item within 30 days and it would apparently be mine to keep. Well the kicker to me, is I have an email saying they received this book in December of 2022, and they are JUST NOW noticing damages? They also just so happened to have announced earlier this month that they are stopping the textbook rental services. Seems rather.. Convenient? Anyways, I called customer service and luckily I was able to get a refund. The lady on the phone was really nice and understanding, and when talking about the charge mentioned that there are literally no damages and that it is just a random charge that is incorrect. The way she worded it was rather vague, but she mentioned that it's odd to receive a charge for it 4 months after they received it.

If any of you guys have purchased an Amazon rental in the last half year or so I would heavily suggest checking that you aren't charged for it recently! I don't really have any evidence to back it up, maybe it was just unlucky timing, but it really feels like they are just trying to get get rid of all their textbooks by charging people and sending them the copy now that they don't rent them anymore.

It's really frustrating because there's nothing I can really do to prove that, but I have to wait 7-10 business days to get my money back now because they can just charge my account at any time for no reason. And if I happened to miss that email I would be missing the money entirely, for a completely fraudulent reason.

Let this also be a good reminder to take pictures of your rentals before returning, I didn't have any and I was worried that it would be an issue when requesting my refund."	0	[]

When I called today the manager said the were going to charge me almost $60 to ship back. So then I said, ""well what if the item just doesn't work as I expected?"" Where she replied that then shipping would be free, but she would make note of my account of why I wanted a return.

I quickly hung up the phone and managed to print a free Canada Post shipping label via the app.

Question - will I get the full amount of the product back?"	2	['TeamStark31: Not sure if it works the same in CA, but in the US you’d get back what you paid.\n\nThere could be restocking fees or something like that.', 'Spicymimi42: In the US it would be the same situation.

So a few days ago, I decided to purchase an item, like I usually do. Later the same day, I got an e-mail stating my account will be closed and all active orders will be cancelled, because I ""continue to request refunds"":

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w842vysmpoua1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d5e282cb152d4d15222d611afff7c3989172a52c

I've been buying items from Amazon for the past 10 years, and I've only ever gotten a refund once some years back, for a low value item. I've purchased plenty of items, including some high value ones, without issues.

I sent them a response, letting them know this is possibly some kind of automated false positive, but they replied telling me they've ""previously closed an account of mine, for violating their terms"", which is not true:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a81z1wqgqoua1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e790e1446de9413d111ba114b30d41617187dd1f

Because of this, I had to take down my android apps I developed and published on the Amazon Appstore, but also migrate my website and e-mail from AWS. I've been using Amazon services for years, and been paying them monthly for all these services without issues.

Does anyone know how this could happen? I don't understand how they connected me to some other account that (from what I understand) displayed scammy behaviour.

Edit:

Some people suggested to look into the ""Messages"" section of my Amazon account. I still have access to that account, and when looking at the Messages, I couldn't see those e-mails at all.

I contacted Amazon Support through the live chat, and the Amazon Custom Support confirmed the e-mails were genuine. I asked them if there's anything I can do, or what options I have, and they mentioned they will contact the Specialist Team and take it from there.

I'm not sure if anything will come out of this, since the Specialist Team told me there's nothing that can be done in the first place.

Edit 2:

I received another email from Amazon, which was literally a copy paste of the 2nd email they sent (the second image of this post).

I have already migrated my website and email away from AWS, and taken down my apps from Amazon App store. The irony is I know pay less for my website and email hosting, I always assumed AWS is the cheapest option out there but I was wrong!

It doesn't seem Amazon is interested on resolving this at all, so feels like this is the end of the story. I just can't use Amazon services ever again."	88	"[""AKHwyJunkie: Interesting, those emails don't read like it was vetted through a legal or public relations department at all.

1681821068.0	18-Apr-2023 05:31:08	How can I STOP Amazon from using USPS?	senpaisai	4	12qlhol	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/12qlhol/how_can_i_stop_amazon_from_using_usps/	"As the subject says, I have Prime and I ordered two items within the next day delivery window that are now 1 day late because Amazon didn't put them in a blue Prime van for delivery like my last two deliveries last week. No, they fobbed it off to USPS. Now what's going to happen is USPS won't even attempt the delivery. They'll take look one look at my address and say, ""He lives in an apartment. This won't fit in his compartment. Since we're too lazy to walk up one flight of steps, drop it front of his door with a knock and leave, let make this bastard come to the post office,"" which defeats the entire purpose of throwing free money every month at Amazon for NOTHING, and I got to spend $2 for a 90 minute round trip on the bus just to go to pick up something from the Post Office that they should've never possessed in the first place ... 

USPS is more than capable of treating me (or anyone) like this without Amazon's spoon in the soup and without me financing it. They'll do in their own right. But Amazon Prime, FedEX, and UPS will either drop the packages at a tenant's door or downstairs in front the mailboxes (where they can get stolen) and I'm usually standing outside waiting when the Amazon driver is 2 stops away since the leasing office will no longer accept or sign for parcels because the ladies are sick and tired of catching COVID from every Tom, Dick, and Harry that waltzes in. 

Why in the Jesus H. Dice Collecting F--K was this package foisted on USPS in the first place has me livid because I'm on a deadline here and needed that package yesterday and believed I'd get it yesterday and would've if somebody didn't invite USPS into the mix. How do I stop this from happening? I have CANCELED USPS. Aside from tax payer financed junk mail, in no way, shape, or form do I EVER want to do business with them or want them handling my business, and I don't want to conduct any further business with anyone that'll outsource delivery to USPS at their own whim and against my will and wallet when I'm a subscriber to their exclusive service. There's got to be a way to stop Amazon from using USPS otherwise I'll cancel Amazon totally and take my business to NewEgg, B&H, etc. It's getting to the point where if I get a USPS tracking number in my email, I'll cancel the order."	25	"[""Border_Relevant: I had issues with Canada Post not delivering.

I live in a normal house with a mailbox at the street but every time it's using USPS I know there are going to be screw ups. \n\nNot only is the tracking completely unreliable and always seem to get delayed when its USPS but they'll do shit like stuff my mailbox with packages that shouldn't be in there and drop packages below the mailbox instead of at the door. This wouldn't be a huge deal but they drop it off at such random times like 7-9PM at night and the tracking isn't accurate so it may end up sitting exposed for a long period of time. \n\nThey haven't done it in a while, but it used to frequently happen where they would say they attempted to deliver something but I wasn't home, but they don't realize I'm working from home so I know they're full of shit. Happened frequently with USPS but as soon as I was about to report it it finally stopped."", ""J3ST3Rx: You can't. \n\nI talked to a manager and he attempted to deprioritize USPS, but he told me it is not a guarantee. \n\nNeedless to say it didn't happen and I canceled Prime after 15 years."", 'Maleficent-Clock8109: This is why i canceled prime.

We moved a year ago to a house where we had a PO box and no physical mailbox.  We had a street address for delivery by UPS/Fedex/etc., but the address for USPS was different so they wouldn't deliver to that.  This is in a VERY small town where the mail man knows everyone and could handle it if it got to them.  I tried every feasible way to put an address into Amazon that worked for everything that tried to include the PO box info in the physical address on another line and kept having packages get returned for invalid address before it made it to the local post office.  When this happened the order would disappear for a couple of weeks before showing up invalid, because there was no indication it was with USPS.  I gave up and put a physical mailbox in in order to be able to reliably get mail from Amazon.  \n\nIronically Apple also is unable to deal with a PO box with their credit card.  I had to put the physical address of the post office building into their system.\n\nIts amazing that Amazon and Apple are these massive technology companies and can't handle dealing with something as trivial as a PO box in your address.

After redeeming the cards I started spending until I was randomly locked out of my account. I’ve submitted clear evidence of the receipts multiple times. They have all been denied by the “specialist” in automated noreply emails as if an AI is reviewing the receipts. The receipts even have the same date that I was locked out of my account. All I need is to contact the specialists themselves via call.  Customer service claims that they can only email the specialist but myself as the customer cannot. I don’t understand this. I was a loyal customer to this company. I just want my gift card balance back or have them send the money back to us in some way. Falsely closing my account with a large balance sounds like a law suit. I can tell that a professional is not reviewing my receipts that we downloaded to the portal several times. My receipt pictures are very clear with everything on them including scratched gift cards.When I call CS & speak to the supervisors, they are zero help & all use the same script of “I will escalate this to the specialist” after telling them numerous times that the “specialist” is not accepting my evidence.

The day after I received it there was a sale on Amazon giving away a free pair of Oneplus Buds Pro 2 earphones with it, so I ordered again and sent the first phone back for a refund. 

Amazon have refunded the second item minus the relative cost of the earphones, so they have refunded me £671.56, when I should in fact have received a refund for £799. 

This is not a mistake on my end. I 100% know I sent back the first phone (and made sure of this as I was wary of this situation occurring). I spoke to customer service and they said that IMEIs are checked when phones are returned so there couldn't be a mistake. I have sent them proof of the IMEI of the phone that I currently have in my possession, but I haven't heard anything back for a while now.

I am tempted to just return the phone that I have now in order to receive another refund, but if they check the IMEI they will notice that this is not the first phone, and I might not receive another refund at all.

I am running out of time to return and not sure what to do.

TheGermanMarshal	3	12ni6z5	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/12ni6z5/packages_are_either_damaged_or_incorrectly/	"I've been using Amazon for the last 8 years now, and just this year, my packages (when delivered by USPS) always have a problem with them; at best, packages are opened, water damaged, or straight up punched in, at worst, not delivered but labeled as delivered.

When I contacted amazon for the damage, they tell me that ""you got the package, right? here's a 5-dollar inconvenience"". When I tell them that my packages aren't delivered, they tell me to ""wait 48 hours, and if it isn't, contact us back for a refund,"" but when I do, they don't refund. I always end up disputing the charge with Chase, but it's almost every other package at this point.

While packages that are 25 dollars or 7 dollars are still packages that should still be delivered, I usually don't bother, but I bought an Apple watch that was supposed to be delivered 2 days ago, and I'm yet to receive it. That's 400 dollars, dude. I saved up for 3 months to buy it and it mislabeled ""delivered"" when it clearly wasn't.

I disputed with Chase, and they gave me the temporary credit, but Amazon once again is telling me to shove it and that they aren't ""responsible"". But I'm worried that with all these mislabeled deliveries, I might get into trouble. I hope that changing my delivery address to my workplace would solve this problem, but what should I do when I order a 400 dollar item from amazon, do not get it, and then them telling me, ""sorry for the inconvenience but we are not responsible."""	14	"['kgiann: Have you contacted your local USPS branch to inform them of the continually damaged packages?', 'IndiaEvans: If you are in the U.S.A: \n\nDocument everything.

Out of hundreds of orders since November, my family has returned five orders.  Yet four of the returns played out as follows:

Amazon send's an email 6-7 weeks after the return was initiated stating ""We've issued your refund in advance for the item below, but we were expecting to receive the return by X date. Because we've not received the item yet, your original payment method has been charged again.""

I'll check the tracking of the return and it will show as successfully delivered to Amazon's receiving dock 5-6 weeks earlier, so I contact Amazon.

Amazon customer service says ""Sorry about that. I've fixed our mistake and I've issued you a full refund in the amount of X back to your original payment method.""  Despite that interaction, hours later I'll get an order refund email that says

Reason for refund: Account adjustment. Refund amount X.

And the refunded amount shown will only be half of the full refund amount that was promised.

Amazon has done this on FOUR separate occasions since December.  Each instance I'll contact them a second time and they say ""sorry, we'll fix it"" and do actually process the remainder due.

Yet, the last couple times they've refunded the remaining half balance due to me, I'm getting emails stating that it's a ""goodwill concession.""  Or the latest is emails noting UNRELATED orders are getting refunded to refund me the promised balance.  These are unrelated orders of which I never initiated a return to begin with and the Amazon reps are giving bogus reasons for that return like ""Reason for refund: Damaged during transit""

They said they don't work for amazon but they work for JB Hunt and contract with Amazon. The return tracker is still stuck on  "" picked up and on the way back"". If it wasn't for that I'd feel like I just got scammed -- and honestly maybe I did. Still no refund on my $1100. Never ordering anything serious from amazon again.  sigh.   


  
\*original post\* Hi y'all. Weird turn of events over here. I ordered a $1100 prime product (yes, triple checked it was Prime, but it was shipped by Amazon and sold by a third-party seller in China so i kinda fudged up on that one I think?) Either way, the thing is defective. It's a treadmill and is structurally lopsided, completely unusable. I started a return the same day I got it, left a one-star review with pictures of the very obvious defect on the product page, and Amazon told me the only pick up date was three weeks away, so I said fine, whatever. It's a big and heavy package, I get it. Today, a week later, I get a message from the  seller (through my Amazon messages portal, so not phishing), that they're offering me a full refund on the product and I just need to reply to the message saying ""Full Refund.""  I called Amazon customer service just now to see why the seller is contacting me when I've already set up a return through Amazon and whether I should procure my refund through them or through Amazon and we just could not understand each other. I'm US based and I don't think the reps were because they just could not get my confusion: I have already arranged a return and refund through Amazon directly, why is the shipper contacting me directly for a refund then? The Amazon customer service rep said it if I went through the seller and they didn't actually refund my money I would be shit out of luck because I side-stepped Amazon. He also said that I'd have to ship my product back to China, which costs like $700 since it is so heavy. I just don't understand why that is when I ordered a product that shipped from the Amazon warehouse here in Seattle? Or is that a bad assumption on my part?  I'm  anxious right now -- it's a ton of money and I just want it back. I've already re-packaged the treadmill and it'll be ready for pick up but after reading some posts on here -- y'all did I get got? I specifically chose a product that is shipped by Amazon so I would not have to mess with international shipping back if it was a bad product (which, surprise, it was). ETA: anyone go through this before? did you have to ship the item back to the seller's country of origin?"	12	"['AlmostRandomName: Never had this happen before, but if Amazon is handling the return I\'d just stick with Amazon.\n\nI know lately many sellers can offer ""Prime"" shipping and it sounds like the only requirement is fast shipping from the sellers. \n\nIt *used to be* that you\'d only get Prime as an option from 3rd party sellers if it was ""Fulfilled by Amazon,"" meaning the seller shipped it to Amazon.

I just recently signed up for Amazon prime a few days ago so I could get orders without paying per shipment shipping charges (which would apply on all inexpensive orders).  I then placed some orders on April 8th and 9th and expected them to ship promptly since the listed shipping speed is two day shipping. But they haven't shipped yet and the estimated arrival dates are like 2-3 weeks away.  I thought maybe there could be an issue because for some orders I used the subscribe and save option to save like 40 cents or because I selected to ship them to the post office.  So I cancelled my orders and placed them again to ship to my residence w/o subscribe and save but they are still showing far away delivery estimates.  What is exactly going on?  My orders from before I was a prime customer always shipped promptly.  This is in Canada if that makes a difference.\

EDIT: reordering and having the items shipped to my residence instead seemed to fix the problem.  Thanks for your help everyone."	14	"['UtimiUtimi: Could it be that the product is out of stock? You can ask the after-sales service directly.', 'AKHwyJunkie: Seeing the same thing here.  I suspect the issues are mostly regional.  You\'re at least lucky you get estimated shipping dates, I haven\'t seen a single estimated ship date since early March!    I cancelled prime and a bunch of orders last month, it\'s not what it used to be.  It has gotten so bad that Amazon is now sending me ""Do you still want this item?"" emails after they still haven\'t shipped items in over a month.', 'IndiaEvans: Welcome to our world. They don\'t care anymore. Prime is supposed to mean free, FAST shipping, but for a number of months Amazon has stopped shipping quickly to many Prime members. The last few years they decided 2 day shipping meant 2-ish days from whenever they get around to shipping it. Then around Christmas, they started this garbage, where nothing will get to you for 10+ days. Even then, things often get delayed or don\'t arrive on time. It\'s really bad.\n\nIn this sub you will see a lot of people experiencing the same thing and others who are still getting their shipments in ""less than 2 days!!!!!"" Some of the lucky ones refuse to believe the rest of us are having to wait extended periods of time to get items. \n\nA lot of people are also experiencing badly packaged items which arrive damaged. Customer service has gotten terrible, too. I don\'t know what else to tell you. Amazon doesn\'t care.', 'Ray186: ""Because I selected to ship them to the post office.""\n\nHow do you do that?', 'rinpun: Are y’all from Temu’s publicity team or smth?

Looking at my previous two orders this year in my account I placed one on Jan 16th and it was delivered on the 19th and the second was placed on Feb 13th and delivered on the 15th.  Anyways, what is the recommended action for someone in my situation, cause I'm basically just going to ask them to cancel and refund my prime?"", 'mkdota: When you checkout there is an option to select a ""pickup locationm"" instead.', ""knuckboy: You still have to look where it's being shipped from/by.

I have been a prime member for years and have, just within the last month, notice a significant decline in quality of service.', 'mkdota: So I was just chatting with CS and they said shipping my orders to the post office is what is making my delivery estimate so far away.  So I cancelled and reordered to my residence and now the new orders have an expected date of two days from now like my orders usually do.  So hopefully this works.', 'NemoJones: That will definitely improve your shipping estimates, but they will not reliably deliver.\n\nThis has been happening to me at least once a week for months now:\n\nSee an item, ships from sold by Amazon. Delivery estimate tomorrow or day after.\n\nCan\'t hit ""buy it now"" anymore cause now that defaults to ""Lower carbon delivery"" which is a couple more days out. I\'m hoping that can be turned off somewhere in settings but I haven\'t looked yet.\n\nThen the day it\'s supposed to arrive you get ""Carrier picked up package"", usually, so late you know it\'s not going to happen.\n\nThen ""package delayed in transit.""\n\nThen ""package delayed in transit.""\n\nThen ""package delayed in transit."" We\'re sorry, if it\'s not here day after tomorrow, you can come back here for a refund.\n\nThen at this point one of two things happens, either a) it actually moves to a shipping center in my area or b) it stays in package delayed in transit until I can request a refund.\n\nThen you have to chat or call, CS is always offshore, having multiple conversations at once, reading (poorly) from a script, asking for information you have already supplied, and then they find a creative way to mess it up further.\n\nIf I can purchase an item ANYWHERE besides Amazon, I do so.\n\nAmazon needs to be broken up and fade into history like Sears Roebuck and K-Mart, or purchased by someone that actually cares. They don\'t need to provide decent customer service because they\'ve put everyone else out of business and you have nowhere else to go. Their focus is IT services now and the retail is just a legacy product. I see them pushing health services, there is no effing way.']"

Is there any recourse as I (unfortunately) paid 100% in Amazon credits, so I can\'t do a bank complaint?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*PS: I\'m aware that Amazon has some sort of policy regarding high priced electronics; however, I\'m not sure if this applies to an order that wasn\'t picked up/returned by the customer. Regardless, I\'m not sure why the reps aren\'t able/willing to either refund or resend the item to my home address or Amazon hub counter.', 'iilordd: Those lockers suck. Twice already I had an issue where the app wouldn’t unlock it & another time the driver never set a code to unlock it… & also I had a similar valued item and took 60~ days before I saw refund…. all regular agents will keep saying same bullshit you’ll hear back in 24 hr and all that email will say is they haven’t received item.

They don’t take pictures of the state it arrived in so they don’t have any evidence.\n\nCurrently I have about 5 chargebacks against them. This is also why credit sucks, because you can’t charge it back via your bank. If you for some reason don’t get your money back (I think the absolute max they sometimes do is 60 days in total), then I would just order the item and…how will I put this…notice it has gotten stolen after delivery. And then file a chargeback if necessary. Never, ever accept Amazon credit.', 'BurntOrange101: FYI if it’s a “credit” and not a gift card, you aren’t going to see the balance on your account until you go to purchase an item that is sold by and fulfilled by Amazon.  It isn’t the same as a gift card and will not show up anywhere except in the checkout screen.

Standard reps don't really have much power to view or do anything really and they often don't fully know site policy and have no idea about how policies actually play out or why they are policies to begin with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of the other return every return is its own case. Who owns the item, who ships the item, what type of item it is all play a factor into whether or not the item would qualify for an instant refund at dropoff. That item being at a hub counter rather than a locker may also play a part since I'm assuming the human interaction element at a counter may speed that refund up in some cases if Amazon can confirm without a doubt that the item never left the possession of the hub counter. With a locker it's self service so in theory it's more likely something could occur with the package without Amazon knowing. For example in theory a customer could claim that the locker did not work when in fact it did and they just opened it and took the item from the package and retaped the parcel back up and stuck it back in the locker.\n\nGeneral rule for sellers/ retailers anywhere online is to wait until the item is back in their hands before issuing a refund because it was and still somewhat is a common scam attempt for fraudulent buyers to swap, steal, or claim in item late that is being held at a location by the carrier for pickup."", ""Throwingshead: That's a courtesy credit and those are usually capped at much lesser amounts than this situation. Legally that shouldn't hold up for something of this dollar amount and they are usually given out for delays in shipping."", ""noneintherub: > For example in theory a customer could claim that the locker did not work when in fact it did and they just opened it and took the item from the package and retaped the parcel back up and stuck it back in the locker.\n\nWow! I didn't know or think that was a thing. Hopefully not as the locker is located at an Amazon warehouse (main reason I chose it versus a 3rd party location). Thanks for the insight again""]"

Between the time I made the purchase and the time I returned it, the card I used to purchase the item was compromised and the credit to my account was blocked my bank because the card had to be deactivated.

Amazon sent me an email saying that I could receive the refund by mail or in the form of gift card balance, and that I should reply to the email with my preference. I replied, but received a response that the email address isn't set up to receive emails. Now I'm stuck.

Has anyone else experienced this? I tried to contact Amazon by phone, it took forever to get through to a human but there was a huge language barrier and they did not understand my issue.

Followed by:

Target is likely similar but they are only pissing off about 10% of what Amazon is so the problems with them aren\'t as publicly blasted because the amount of unhappy customers is so much smaller comparatively. \n\nJuggling a million orders per day is so much more of a logistical headache than the 100k or less that Target does. Amazon isn\'t perfect obviously but they are the ecom king and have been for a long time. No other company could accurately be compared to them because the scale is so vastly different. \n\nAmazon could really care less about other major retailer competition right now because they have been building something the others haven\'t even really attempted and that is their logistical delivery service. If Amazon didn\'t have it\'s own massive fleet of vans and trucks their orders would cripple shipping times for everyone with all deliveries for UPS and USPS.\n\nThe only real knock I would put on Amazon is their clear lack of funding in customer service and support which tends to exaggerate issues when they do come up for customers.

The problem was that my order tracking was not lining up with what amazon's website stated for the status of the ordered items.  So the customer service rep responded and claimed to have resolved the issue and that the items were just tied up in a distribution center and would be on their way.

Fast forward to today and the items are now designated as being lost and that I would need to have a refund issued for either some or all of the items.  This was pretty frustrating, not simply because the items i had ordered were not going to arrive, but because it felt like customer service had literally done me a disservice by claiming the items would be on their way.

So I was chatting with a different rep, discussing the problems I was having and they continually claimed that this issue would be escalated and resolved and that this would never happen again.  This was very frustrating to me as it felt so fake and manufactured.  I don't expect everything to work perfectly all of the time, I know mistakes happen.  But you tell me this will never happen again, I smell B.S.

So I mentioned that I didn't think this would happen if their workforce were unionized, and the rep pretty quickly ended our chat after that.  I guess I hit a sore spot?

After a couple more emails asking for further information they have stopped replying.

Do I have any legal rights in terms of seeking refund on return of these items? I technically should have until May and I now accept my account is banned, I just want to return these items.

What you are upset about is that your default payment got changed to a different credit card that you also have associated with your account.

It’s perk of doing business. If you don’t want to use a payment method, don’t hook it up to your account. And when it does happen and you didn’t notice at the time, the problem sorts itself out every time you make a purchase and confirm the payment. It’s the first thing listed under the order summary.

**LONG:** i got an ofm email, my first ever, about returns of items that were supposedly not in their original conditions. the email says, either damaged, clearly used or with missing parts. it also contains a ban warning.

i noticed the email was sent at the same exact time i got another email about a completed refund for a return i did today. 

i’m very ocd about sending items back as perfectly as i can. of course sometimes it isn’t possible to send them exactly as if they were unopened.

i wonder though if they regard opened items as “not in their original conditions”? that would seem odd though, because if i hadn’t opened them and used them, then i would have no reason to return them yet. 

otherwise i’m really not sure what to think. could it be that, since apparently this ofm thing is a bot, the email was in fact about too many returns (which i did do) and it mistakenly refers to damaged items instead? 

i tried to respond explaining everything as clearly and in detail as i could, but after about half an hour i got a pretty short reply that seemed like something chatgpt could have written, i.e. it felt half intelligent half automated. 

some of it was human i think, because it made reference to the fact i left my number in my reply (asking if we could solve the issue on the phone), and saying that they only do email. 

the tone of this second email is much more friendly, just saying they contacted me to “better understand the activity on my account and understand how to improve my shopping experience” (email not in english so i’m translating), and that they noticed i made several returns in the last months and some of the items weren’t in their original condition. 

i replied again after midnight (after which support closes) and i still have to receive a response, which is another thing that makes me think it wasn’t totally automated.

as i said, i did have to do many returns in the last 3-4 months, including high value ones, for various reasons, all of which i can explain. also, before doing each of some expensive returns, i called customer service every time, explaining why i had to do it, asking them for confirmation, and they always said it was totally fine to do it. but after this email i suppose what customer service said doesn’t count much.

side question - if they do ban my account, i guess i also lose warranty for purchases i already did, as well as my whole library of kindle purchases? (that’d be completely absurd, but by reading other posts i understand amazon doesn’t give a shit)."	39	"[""Throwingshead: >but always in perfect condition, although of course i have opened them and used them at least a bit.\n\nDepending on the product just opening it can devalue condition if it cannot be resold as new. Items with factory seals would fall under this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>of course sometimes it isn’t possible to send them exactly as if they were unopened.\n\nNone of those items would be deemed in perfect condition then and that is likely what they are warning you about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>as i said, i did have to do many returns in the last 3-4 months, including high value ones, for various reasons, all of which i can explain. also, before doing each of some expensive returns, i called customer service every time, explaining why i had to do it, asking them for confirmation, and they always said it was totally fine to do it. but after this email i suppose what customer service said doesn’t count much.\n\nSome return reasons have more of a negative impact than others but it doesn't really matter too much since ultimately all returns create a dead money cost for a retailer.

GROSS. DO NOT DO THAT.

Do not buy anything from Amazon that you put into your body or onto your body. You do not know what is in it and it could affect your health.

Amazon has a huge counterfeit issue. You think that doesn't apply to cosmetics and lotions and vitamins too? When you order from Amazon, you do not know whether or not you're getting the real thing. Who the reseller is doesn't matter, either, if it's fulfilled by Amazon, it all ships from the exact same bin. They do not have separate bins for fakes vs real. You can get really sick from counterfeit beauty products. It can permanently affect your health and your appearance. Don't take the risk.

Amazon does not have standards for food items. You think your candy has been stored at a correct temperature? You think it's been kept free of pests and vermin? Do you think Amazon cares? 

Ultimately, in the end, Amazon has structured itself so that there is very little liability on them as a corporation if you get hurt or killed from a product they sell. There is no corporate responsibility. Which means it's very Wild West- the onus is on you, as the consumer. Which is impossible with things like food and cosmetics and health supplements because who has a testing laboratory in their basement? If you go down the street to GNC and buy a supplement and it turns out the supplement is actually a knock off and it's full of poison, you have recourse against GNC legally. You do not have that against Amazon because Amazon is going to say they only fulfilled the order, you actually bought it from an independent reseller who is located in some foreign country and is untraceable. 

Do not buy anything off of Amazon that you are going to put into or onto your body. Just don't take the risk. Go to an established store with a corporate structure inside of the United States who has a vested interest in not killing or maiming you, the consumer. Just don't take the risk. It's not worth it."	13	"['squipysquip: Honstly I see your point but you can say this about any store...

I've thought the same thing about how sketchy some of the resellers seem. Especially when they are selling food products from a foreign country.

I'm sorry you are getting so many negative comments."", ""Throwingshead: Amazon isn't perfect but your post has a lot of assumptions that aren't true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Amazon has a huge counterfeit issue. You think that doesn't apply to cosmetics and lotions and vitamins too?\n\nAmazon is actually very strict about counterfeits and the problem is not as huge as you think. Sure if you by some random brand lotion who knows what you are really getting but if you buy name brand topicals they are quick to catch fakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Who the reseller is doesn't matter, either, if it's fulfilled by Amazon, it all ships from the exact same bin.\n\nThis is completely false and I'm assuming you read about this in one of the poorly researched online articles that don't know how the system works at all. You are referring to commingled inventory. Any seller can tell you whether or not their items are commingled. Many sellers do not commingle inventory so that they can ensure their products are authentic and the exact items they sent in. Only lazy/ cheap sellers commingle inventory and many stop after they realize the headaches that poor service brings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Amazon does not have standards for food items. You think your candy has been stored at a correct temperature? You think it's been kept free of pests and vermin? Do you think Amazon cares?\n\nAmazon does have standards for foods and yes they actually do have some limitations for candy specifically. Chocolate for example cannot be sent in after April/ May.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you go down the street to GNC and buy a supplement and it turns out the supplement is actually a knock off and it's full of poison, you have recourse against GNC legally. You do not have that against Amazon because Amazon is going to say they only fulfilled the order, you actually bought it from an independent reseller who is located in some foreign country and is untraceable.\n\nThis is also false. If you buy a brand name item from Amazon and receive a knockoff instead which caused damage to property and or caused a health issue you absolutely have recourse against Amazon if the product was fake. Amazon can evade liability and claim they are only a sales channel for branded products that are legitimate branded items but the items themselves caused damage or harm so the manufacturer would be liable."", ""neonturbo: So many Amazon items seem to come in non-authentic packaging.

Electronic components is another where I notice this, you get a couple resistors or capacitors in a baggie. Fake? Who can tell for sure. At the very least they are dividing up larger bulk lots, which may not be what the manufacturer intended. \n\nWith some items I do expect them to come in non-standard packaging. Nuts and bolts for example are often sold to a store in bulk, and even in a retail environment you pick and choose out of a bulk bin. But sweeper belts?

Clearly counterfeit. Wrong brand of zipper, the logo was attached incorrectly. I contacted Amazon and they told me they were not responsible.\n\nMay have been politely trying to tell you they don't believe you. It's not that uncommon for customers to claim things are counterfeit when they are not. IF you believed it was fake you legally have the right to return it if it's within the return period and state the item is not as described. If this happens on a sellers item they will request proof of authenticity for the item. If this was done on Amazon's item they will likely brush you off since they either work directly with Columbia and or Columbia was selling under Amazon's name. Customers are usually not product experts and the vast majority of counterfeit claims are not accurate.\n\nIf you purchased from a legitimate Columbia listing there is no reason to remove the listing since the brand is already heavily regulated on the site.

Both items were brand new , unopened , unused items still in factory packaging. Both had an extra exterior Amazon shipping box. \n\nSo why is Amazon blatantly lying about receiving damaged goods from the consumer? For 20 yrs I\'ve been extremely diligent keeping items in brand new state with all packaging , even the little black trash-bag like twist wraps for electrical cords and whatnot when returning the item. \n\n""However, the number of refunds for items received in a damaged condition in your account exceed the expectation"" -Amazon\n\nThey specifically said ""damaged"".

In fact I\'m kind of intimidated to even do any more returns for fear of getting cancelled. I do not like this feeling.

I usually return directly to a store, no questions are asked, and I get my refund right then and there.\n\nI also shop Target online (not as a member), but again, the selection is limited and sometimes not available for shipping.  \n\nIt isn’t necessary to be a Prime member to shop on Amazon, just like it isn’t necessary to be a member of Walmart and Target’s programs.\n\nI find it amusing that the OP’s line in the sand was $3.

I asked customer service to refund the difference, they refused. So I ordered the same product again at the sale price.

I followed all the rules and was even clear with them that I knew I could do this. They could have just credited me the sale price and made everybody happy. INSTEAD I still got the sale price and they paid to haul the extra order around in both directions. And it wasn't a small item. So they lost money and frustrated the customer.

It was like a handy shopping bookmarks tool for me, though the rest of the extension's features sucked and were annoying. Unfortunately, Amazon Assistant was discontinued at the end of March and I can't use this function anymore.

So I go to my Amazon wish list on the web to manually add instead, but I can't find any sort of ""Add"" button for non-Amazon links. Am I blind or did they take it away? You can still add Amazon products to wish list from the Amazon product page, but I can't find a way to add links from elsewhere on the web.

I purchased PS5 from Amazon and shipped it to my friend's address in Iowa to bring it with him when he come back home to Dubai. The tracking page says the package was delivered but he said he didn't receive anything or signed anything.

As you know, when you purchase ps5 from Amazon, on the review order page, you get this notice ""signature or one-time password required at time of delivery""​ so, I contacted UPS asking them to provide me a proof of delivery like a photo for the signature of the person who signed the package, they said we don't have this info and go contact Amazon.

I wanted a separate reading list, so I registered the Kindle to my personal Amazon account. Then I noticed that the screen was defective, so I used the household account's support chat to ask for a return.

The Amazon support agent set up a replacement to ship, but they scheduled the return on my personal account, not the household account. I did not want a credit on my personal account because I don't use it frequently for purchases. I told them this was wrong and asked them to cancel the return so I could schedule a return on the household account. Instead, the support agent scheduled a second return on my personal account. Eventually, I gave up and left the chat. I scheduled my own return on the household account and returned the device for a refund a few days later.

The net result was that I was given a refund for the Kindle and a replacement for free. It hadn't been my goal to get a free Kindle, but I wasn't about to complain.

A few days later, I received an email saying my personal Amazon account had been closed.

At first it said the shipping was delayed, but it would not allow me to cancel since it was ""close to shipping."" I selected the help option for the order and it recommended I contact the seller, so I messaged asking for the status or cancellation. I didn't think to check if the item was fulfilled by Amazon or not, so I guess that's my mistake, but the response I received from the seller surprised me. They said ""we have no idea when orders are filled or shipped by Amazon, you have more information than we do."" which, OK...? . Then they got a little hostile, adding ""upon reviewing you order history, there is a clear pattern of repeatedly ordering and cancelling orders"" and went on to say that they were working with Amazon to expose people who ""intentionally exploit amazon and our company"". I do have a lot of subscribe and save orders, and yeah, I frequently cancel the orders for whatever reason. I'm pretty sure Amazon doesn't have a policy against that or consider it ""exploitation"".  It also seems to be a fairly high-volume seller, since a lot of their items have 10,000+ review, so it seems strange to take cancellations so personally. So basically, I'm just confused. Has anyone else received a response like this before?

Oh and PS - the order ended up being lost and I was refunded."	10	"[""SilvitniTea: The part that sticks out to me is that they know your order and cancelation history.

Most people use Amazon and think that they can easily order and arrive home later to that nice little smiling box waiting on them (convenient). But, in the real world there is thieves and more. You have asked Amazon ""deliver my package at this address at this day"" and Amazon has done as you asked. Now should that package get stolen, why call Amazon? Amazon did as you asked, you sacrificed security for that convenience. Amazon states: 

Risk of loss: All purchases of physical items from Amazon are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.

Basically once Amazon delivers the package(s) to where you have asked, it is now your responsibility. Do you drive your car to a mall or store, leave the door open and engine running for the easiest convenience in getting back in after shopping and driving away? or are you secure and locking the doors/taking the keys with you. 

I hate Amazon as much as the next person (maybe a touch more), but honestly, if a package says it was delivered to your house....then that's your fault it was gone when you returned home. True at times Amazon can make a mistake delivering it to a neighbor's house. But then should that neighbor not hand you the package marked with  your name, that is theft. They stole it. 

Have packages delivered to PO boxes, have UPS hold it at their local location. This is the secure thing and ensures that the packages will get to you. True, it is less 'convenient' for you because you have to go pick it up, but isn't it better to take a few moments out of your life and get an item instead of calling Amazon and crying that someone stole your package.

So, recently I decided to buy a keyboard (gaming and work) for me and one for my wife. 

Believe it or not, it ends up I bought 11 keyboards in the raw and return 8! 4 didn't have a WIFI dongle, and another 4 were completely different models. It's like no one even checks returns and they just send them to the next customer.

The problem is that I am sending it back with a comment ""wrong item in the box"" (and I don't want to say anything else because that's exactly what happened), and I'm worried that it will appear that I am the one who took dongles and put the $30 keyboard in place of the $60 keyboard. It feels like I am potentially abusing the return and I do not know what to do. Should I just contact Amazon customer service and try to open a claim or something like that? Does anyone know how they check their returns and what is going on there? Thanks."	3	"[""Throwingshead: Amazon warehouse items are always a gamble.

I setup an account with  a virtual credit card because I value my privacy.

I am not willing to do this, and would rather shop elsewhere.

This  whole ""proving I am the owner of the card"" is to protect against fraud,  right? Nope! Amazon still processed the order after locking my account,  but I've since sourced the products elsewhere and no longer need them  from Amazon.

I ordered a Bissell carpet cleaner from Amazon tried it and it didn’t clean well at all so I hired professionals to come in and clean the carpets instead and I sent the item back to Amazon. 

3 weeks later I get an email from Amazon stating that I returned the wrong item and they won’t be issuing a refund. Confused so I call them and they say the serial number doesn’t match the box so they disposed of my item. I’m beyond confused at this point I tried everything spoke to every level of rep emailed jeff@amazon.com they couldn’t help either. I eventually after a week got a rep to provide the numbers they recorded and the numbers did indeed match but on the box Bissell put the model number before the serial number on the box. Contacted the manufacture (Bissell) and they emailed proof that this is indeed the case the model number is before the serial number on the box and my serial number does match. I forwarded that to Amazon and they refuse to reply.

My last course of action was a chargeback with my bank and to my surprise I just got an email from my bank stating that Amazon provided evidence and my claim has been denied. The evidence you ask? It’s that the item has been used and that goes against their return policy…. So NOW they’ve pivoted their entire reason to fit their narrative. I’m lost for words with this.

Even though the item may say Free Returns, there is now (in my area, anyway) a $6.99 fee to bring your pre labeled return to a UPS dropoff point or a $7.99 fee for UPS pickup. 

Seven dollars is several dollars more than it would cost me to send my small item back to Amazon using USPS the pirateship portal or stamps.com if I paid out of pocket. 

Of course if you call Amazon to object, chances are they will email you a free label for a UPS dropoff point, like they did me. 

But I do not want to have to call customer service every time I need to return something. I get why Amazon would charge extra for UPS pickup but charging Prime customers extra to bring their packaged and labeled return to a dropoff point is beyond the pale. 

If this is a new policy being applied across the board, I am not sure I will keep my Prime Account. I certainly won't buy anything from Amazon that Walmart carries, since Walmart is very near my house and allows returns for a full three months.  

It isn't just the drive to Kohl's/Wholefoods/UPS Store is too far. My nearest UPS store is poorly managed and has particularly unpleasant service (probably because their mgr screams abuse at them). They're nice enough at Wholefoods/Kohl's but the lines are long and sometimes they have to hunt for someone authorized to take the item.

Note: I do not know whether the 6.99 fee applies when you return a defective product. I was returning an unused bike pump I needed to inflate the tires of a dog stroller which I had to return because it couldn't be assembled (the drill-holes were in the wrong places). So when I returned the bike pump, I checked ""no longer needed"". 

But I also had to call Amazon just to get the defective 35 lb. stroller returned because the instructions said I was responsible for return shipping, so it seems to me that the convenience we are paying for is severely degraded."	15	"[""m0nsterhuntr: This has been going on for awhile near me as well. I live in a smaller area and the closest UPS store is 45 minutes away.

If you choose 'drop off at UPS location', your return will be free.  If you choose to have UPS pick it up, then you will be charged.  If Amazon had to pay to have UPS go to the customer's home to pick up a return, they would stop accepting returns.  Why should they pay UPS to pick up an item from you?  If you don't live near a UPS drop off spot (or a Kohls, etc), then don't buy from Amazon."", '4-me: You seem to have bad luck.', 'existence_xpose: I think it has been years ago that ups was an option with fees.

The only returns I have ever done were for either the wrong item being sent or a defective product. \n\nSo, this new system of charging people to bring an item to a UPS store is either regional, based on customer's return history or it only applies to return reasons other than wrong item or defective item."", 'DoubleCapable725: Actually that is what i used to do - mark it defective, but as of yesterday or so, even the defective option still says you have to pay 6.99 to drop it off at UPS.

The thing I’m most worried about not getting is the legend of Zelda tears of the kingdom pro controller because it’s very hard to pre order them and I don’t want to pay 140-300 dollars for one on eBay. 

The person at Amazon who I spoke with Told me that once they email or text me back I won’t have to send them a billing statement I will only have to provide the last 4 digits and the expiration date of the card used. 

But what I want to know is:

Is it most likely I’ll get my account back?

Is it likely my orders (especially the pro controller) will still be there? 

And finally, did they person at Amazon lie to me when they told me that once they email or text me back I won’t have to send them a billing statement I will only have to provide the last 4 digits and the expiration date of the card used?

Thank you for all your help in advance and I hope to hear from people soon. I’m sorry about bothering all of you and wasting your time, I just really really don’t want to lose my pre-order on such a hard limited time item to obtain."	17	"[""FFX-2: What did you do to get it locked?

I don't return many purchases, and when ever I would return via UPS store, I would get my refund an hour after the UPS store clerk would scan my item for return. This has always been the case. Recently I returned an item on March 26th at the same UPS store I always take my returns to. 5 days later and no refund. To make things worse it seems UPS has lost the package. The return is coming from Cali to Vegas and should have been delivered the next day. It has been 6 days now, and for the last two days the tracking # went from showing ""**Delayed**"" to "" **The delivery date will be provided as soon as possible**."" One UPS rep told me it's more than likely lost, yet another said ""**it's normal, it's still in transit, please wait**"". No help there.

I gave amazon a call early in the morning and was connected with a young lady who told me she will process my refund right away and that I should see it in 2-3 hours.  5 hours passed and no refund! However, she did close my return, and the status changed from ""return started"" to showing the original delivery date. Only made things more confusing!

Once again I got to chatting with another Amazon Rep, and now I'm being told they are waiting on the item to return and it can take 2 weeks and up to 30 days to process the refund. No help there! 

Did they recently change their return policy? I have never had to actually wait for the item to return to their warehouse to get the refund. What changed? And what do I do now? Both UPS and Amazon are giving me the run around. If the package is lost, I need the tracking to actually show it's lost or Amazon will just keep telling me ""it's in transit"".

You do not get refunded before the item is delivered and processed because it is a fraud prevention tactic.

Yesterday,   i requested a return for a couple items that i wasn't really happy   with, and the return request was accepted, i received an email by the   shipping service saying that they would come next week to grab the   packages, however, today, i received this email from [ofm@amazon.com](mailto:ofm@amazon.com),   should i be worried about it? Should i cancel my return request or  this  one is fine as long as i won't make new ones after this? I'm very   worried about it, i will definitely think twice before buying an item   from now on and maybe investigate more with reviews and stuff like that,   but what i'm wondering is if the return that i already asked and is   going to be picked up next week will be fine, or if it's better if i   delete it.

Also honestly i never  returned something with missing parts, obvious signs of use or not cased  in the same package... Yeah i made maybe too many returns lately (4-5)  but they were all returned in perfect conditions.

The order that amazon cancelled has been in transit back to them for over 7 days now. The customer reps on live chat keep telling me not to worry and to wait atleast 30 days, but they sound pretty dumb to be honest. 

If an item takes 3 days to get to me, it shouldnt take 8 days to go back, when it didnt even reach my door.

What should I do right now? Call the USA customer service?

Obviously even Amazon no longer gives a damn about Amazon...why should anyone here?

I've been a customer since 2002, the earliest of Amazon's days.  (I used to order actual books!  Still do sometimes!)  I'm vine voice and all that ""jazz"" of yesteryear.  I used to be in the ""top 5,000"" Amazon reviewers, but even that isn't even ""measured"" anymore.  I'd vent on Amazon's own forums, but pretty much every avenue of public communication are shut down.  Even r/amazon is highly curated, to protect the constant onslaught of their decline.

I've cancelled Prime twice before, when service goes to crap.  I've been through the ups and downs before.  It used to be that cancellation of Prime sent a message, especially when it comes from their so called ""prestigious"" customer base.  No one is listening anymore!  I think I'm finally done once and for all.

I've got a dozen orders, sitting in ""we will email you with a delivery date"" for at least three to four weeks now.  I contact customer service and they can't tell me anything the website hasn't.  ""Errr, the computer says we don't know?""  The only offered option is to cancel the order.

I really, really don't get it.  Here you've got Amazon laying off thousands of workers, shutting down entire sectors of their business...and yet they can't even perform the very most basic thing the website is supposed to do called sales?  Like, hello?

I know this isn't a systemic problem, and probably relates to geographic regions and the incredible complexity (and code/automation) they've built into ordering & fulfillment systems.  Yet, I order from other companies and it turns out they ship stuff to me!

I've cancelled anything important and that'll be my delineation from now on.  I'm calling it now.

When it\'s already past the scheduled delivery time, and I message them, they always assure me that it\'s going to arrive that day, and that it\'s just running behind, but it never has arrived when they said it would. I\'m tired of the lies. The reason I don\'t go to Walmart most of the time, is because amazon usually has ""Same-Day Delivery"" on the item I need, but in the past year and a half, I haven\'t even had a package arrive in less than 3-days, no matter what shipping option is chosen. I\'ve slowly learned that ""Same-Day Delivery"" is just a lie meant to drive business away from brick and mortars.\n\nI also think the general downgrade in quality of products on Amazon is staggering. They turned Amazon Basics into a logistical nightmare for the U.S. Patent Office by creating an AI that generates random company names, then applies for a patent under that company name, and then prints that logo on cheap, foreign, mass-produced products and then lists them, in an effort to create more business for themselves and reduce competition with their legitimate sellers. In essence, the majority of ""Sellers"" on Amazon, are just fake business\' that Amazon has created to maintain that the majority of searched items on a single page are from their own fake business\'. They own over 24,000 patents worldwide, of which, one would assume the majority are fake business\'.\n\nPersonally, I just can\'t stand listening to Amazon Customer Support lie, all the while knowing that I\'m being lied to, just so they can pacify the 200th irate customer of the day without going home and punching several holes in the wall. Trust me, 99% of us would do the same thing that they do. It all boils down to the fact that the company treats them like crap, so they don\'t give a crap about their job, that, once again, has proven a 100% success rate of screwing its\' employee\'s at every possible opportunity. It just sucks that, inadvertently, the paying customer catches the most flak as an innocent bystander in this weird, back-and-forth, retributive skirmish between management and worker-base.\n\nI\'m 100% going to Walmart from now on. I\'ll take the guarantee of being able to have the item in a known amount of time, and there\'s definitely something to be said about being able to physically pick up the item you want to purchase before you buy it and then take it home right then and there, if you deem it a worthwhile purchase.

GaymerZane94	28	1256yfw	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1256yfw/rant_wildly_inconsistent_customer_support_amazon/	"I've been an amazon customer for years and never really had issues until now. For context I've ordered plenty of small and a few expensive items before, so I didn't think twice about placing another order with them for an expensive item. 

So I've had an issue over the last few days with amazon. Bought a computer from them (huge mistake) for nearly £1,000 that was meant to arrive on the 23rd. On the day of delivery, the driver asked for the code, gave us two tiny boxes with random other orders, and drove off even after we told him the order was definitely wrong, the driver then lied on his delivery claiming he gave us the computer. 

I messaged amazon, sent photographic proof of the wrong order, and was told I had to return the £10 bath bars they sent wrongly to get refunded the money they had taken from me. They claimed it would take 2 weeks for the item to be returned to them, and 30+ days to process a refund. I then called up and was told the item would definitely arrive by the 25th, and if not I wouldn't need to return the random wrong order and could throw it away and would get a refund within the week. I was also told amazon had no way of tracking the item as it was sent by a 3rd party (I emailed said 3rd party, they sent me proof that it was distributed by amazon...) 

Fast forward to the 25th - no package. First I was told I wasn't due a refund, then I was told an investigation had to be raised (by the same agent) and not to contact them for 72 hours and to await a resolution. 

I call today, and I'm told the investigation isn't complete after over 72 hours and I'll be contacted shortly. (I wasn't.) I then went back to chat, to be told by two chat people that because I gave the delivery driver the delivery code, I wasn't due a refund even if I can prove they never delivered the item, both then ended the chat before I could ask any further questions. One tried to accuse me of lying, by saying ""why would you give them the code if they didn't have an item?!"" To which I explained I had 3 items coming, and he had a small box in his hand, and I assumed there were other boxes, because thats how amazon has always delivered to me before. One then sent an email saying that if I want a refund, I have to send back the item that I never received... 

At last I got through on the phone, and after 30 minutes on hold the agent asked sensible questions that nobody else bothered to ask, like ""whats the QA code on the wrong order box?"" The moment I gave her it, she immediately knew I'd been given the wrong item as it didn't match any order on my account. She said I'd definitely be due a refund within 5-7 days, they'd email me confirming it (they didn't despite being helpful which makes me insanely nervous) and to check back by the coming saturday if I have no refund. 

How on earth can I trust anything any of them have said though, when I have a whole bunch of emails saying different things from different agents, even within minutes of each other? The people on the calls are 100% more friendly and understanding than the people on the live chat by far, the people on live chat genuinely don't seem to understand whats being said, are outright aggressive, disconnect chats and just seem to read from a script. 

If I don't have the refund by saturday I'm going to have to do a chargeback as it's quite literally theft on amazons part to swap out an item for a wildly different one, then refuse to refund me for the item I paid for. I don't think I'll ever buy an expensive item from amazon again, or frankly any item from them again if I have to file for a chargeback. I work in customer service myself, and this has honestly been the most frustrating and disgusting service I've ever witnessed. I'm genuinely tempted to take it further than just a chargeback honestly. 

Has anyone else had recent experiences like this?"	22	"[""Ash_Draevyn: Thanks for posting…I think everyone needs to start sharing their Amazon shitshow stories. It is beyond ridiculous at this point. Amazon customer service has become synonymous with the collections department.\n\nAmazon contacted me via email to tell me I didn’t return an item and that they will be charging me again if it is not returned by March 31. I returned the item the very day it arrived (February 14).\n\nAnyway, the CSR noticed that I did in fact return the item, but then proceeded to tell me that even though I returned the item, the system will automatically charge me on March 31 due to system error and I am to call them back on March 31 so they don’t re-charge me or if they do, to get the charge removed.  Ok, fine. ..but I wasn't seeing why the onus was put on me.\n\nI told the CSR that is complete bullshit.\n\nTHEY contacted me about their fuckup and subsequently expect me to fix it? Hell no. I asked the CSR to hold on, got my recorder out, put him on speaker, told him I’m recording and to repeat everything he has said from the beginning (Amazon has their recordings; I also wanted my own).  He complied, then he put me on hold.\n\nWhen he came back…magically…all was fixed. He told me I wouldn’t be re-charged. Apparently someone “with higher access” was able to rectify the situation. Always check your invoices/statement..I’ll be making sure they don’t charge me come March 31.\n\nFinally, I asked him to put everything in writing and to email it to me, which he did.\n\nOh ya, early in the conversation he started to panic for some reason and was escalating his voice and temper. I had to tell him to calm the fuck down (not in those words) and to explain properly. He admitted he was confused by the situation. Ok…it was a return, that was returned and somehow that wasn’t recorded. If Amazon trains their CSRs properly, he shouldn’t be confused by the concept of a basic return.\n\nBe very careful with Amazon…they’re not the same company as they were 10 years ago. They created a rental service which people abused and actual customers have to deal with this shitshow. Their business plan with regards to Alexa failing...massive layoffs...and now they’re trying to scrape money from honest buyers.\n\nThey should be going after the ones they know are screwing around. I.e. the people buying a large screen TV for a super bowl party then returning it when they were done with it, as an example.\n\nDo not abuse chargebacks, if you're honest about how things went down with Amazon when speaking with your financial institution rep...they'll get to the bottom of it.

Basically I assume Amazon allows customers to preorder based on how many copies they expect to get, but it might not necessarily know at the time if youre nearest/default Fulfillment Centers are going to get that game. So you can preorder a game with 2 day delivery and release date might hit and Amazon might go, ""Oh, there\'s actually no inventory for this in Moxley\\_56\'s nearest FC, it\'s gonna take 2-4 weeks now""\n\nI\'ve preordered games and had them arrive way late, probably because of this mismatch between Amazon\'s promises and Amazon\'s logistics.\n\nIf you want to preorder a game, I\'d recommend going through a more reliable retailer for this like GameStop or Best Buy in the US. Local stores will typically only allow customers to preorder as many copies as they\'re going to get on launch day, so if you preorder a game from the physical store you know you\'ll get it. Online sales with those retailers are usually reliable too, you just have to wait for shipping.\n\nSo yeah ultimately to answer your question, I\'ve had this issue, and it\'s not surprising. Can you talk to customer service? Well, they won\'t be able to get it to you any faster, they may recommend you cancel and reorder the game, and they might offer you some credit as a consolation.', ""katehenry4133: Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't 'pre-order' mean that it's not available yet and will ship when it is available?"", ""IndiaEvans: I had this same thing happen with a book. It was out on March 14. I preordered it in February. In the past they would ship it to ARRIVE on the release date. It wasn't going to arrive to me until the 20th, a week away. Absolutely ridiculous."", 'Derwurld: I have the same issue lol I pre ordered RE4 remake for PS5 and it said it shipped though. But never any tracking and after a week of contacting Amazon one rep told me that it was lost and they ordered a replacement. At least here in Canada it seems that Amazon is having difficulty getting the PS5 version while the xbox versions keeps coming up in stock. They gave me a 10$ promo credit for the inconvenience. \n\nNot sure if you are in Canada but you are not alone. I am only sticking with this pre order because I used some bank CC points that enabled me to get 20% off the game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOdd thing is that I have never encountered any issues with Amazon pre ordering until this year. Dead Space remake they told me it would come the following week but it arrived on launch day. Metroid Prime they said it would be middle of march but i received it the day after launch. Their tracking system is all messed up.', ""Moxley_56: Yeah, I understand. But what's frustrating is that the point in pre-ordering a game is to get it either the same day or the following business day. Or else, why the hell would people do it via amazon.

You reserve to make sure that when you arrive at said time you have a table. If not, then WTF is the point of making a reservation?"", 'sibman: It does.', 'Moxley_56: Yeah, I ended up receiving the game Monday night.

Was when they caught onto me sending the wrong shit back…\n\nI was 100% stealing from them. I admit that. But I spent close to 13,000 a fucking year with Amazon. I figured I could pull a fast one on them.  Welp they caught on and billed me back for all the wrong items I sent back.  Now when I try to do a return or report a problem I get a totally different attitude from their customer service.  I probably have a red flag in the system, and rightfully so.   I’m just sharing my experience, there’s usually more to the story because Amazon has NEVER done me dirty until I started trying to scam them.', 'zoomiepaws: It could be the people delivering the product.

I received the items the next day bc my neighbor had them.  Thanks Amazon.', ""Throwingshead: This isn't a delay tactic it's a difference in cause. Amazon will have geotracking and what they feel is accurate proof the item was delivered successfully so in their eyes the issue is either theft or the recipient being dishonest. The police report is something that can be done to persuade them into giving a courtesy refund if they can verify the report is legit because again in their eyes it can only be theft after delivery if the recipient did not get the item which would be out of Amazon's control. The long investigation period is usually to give them time to contact the police department to confirm the case is legitimate which can take time depending on how responsive the local pd is.\n\nSo Amazon sees this is a police issue, they do not expect the police to do anything more than make a report. Amazon wants a report made to show the customer story is accurate since anyone committing fraud in this case would obviously not take that step.\n\nCommon misconception is that chargebacks have a 60 day limit which is only true for billing errors or fraud in the case someone unauthorized used the card. For issues with a product or service the banks usually have a 120 day limit for these types of cases so even with Amazon's delay that wouldn't matter since there is still plenty of time to file.\n\nWhere OP could screw their chances is if they file a CB way too early as that would make them look more like a fraudulent buyer if they do not let the policy play out and the odds of winning the CB case isn't as ironclad as the OP would assume since Amazon likely has the gps delivery confirmation on their end that would show it to be correctly delivered.

We were told we couldn't unless it was cancelled within 30 minutes. So we just went to return it. UPS told us it would be $116.99. called Amazon was assured all we had to do was pay the shipping send a copy of the receipt and they would cover it. (I made them email proof of that). The seller received the item February 15th at 11:46 AM.  First refund was denied because the seller said the heater was in good condition and they needed picture of the defective heater or copy of the tracking number.  (Was not sent back as being defective).  FIVE apeals later and we are now being denied because third party seller is saying they don't have the heater.   Every time I call the supervisor tells me there is nobody above them and it has to be re escalated to the A to Z team for an appeal and to wait for the decision. Which I do and guess what... DENIED!  I do this every 3 days. What can I do?  I can't find any information on the third party seller which I doubt would help anyway since they are obviously just trying to keep the item and the money.  Amazon refuses to do anything other than send another apeal to the same department with the EXACT SAME INFORMATION.    How can they say they didn't receive it when the first denial was ""Based on the outcome of our investigation, the package was delivered in good condition.""????

Chat customer service has been horrendous to deal with, but phone customer service has spent a lot of time trying to figure out what's going on with prime orders for those based in Hawaii, as it appears to have become a major issue.

From what I've gathered, the issue is the new alleged fulfillment center based on-island, which automatically designates orders made in the islands to that specific fulfillment center, rather than those we were designated to previously (usually California or Las Vegas). Because the fulfillment center is new and likely understocked (didn't even know we had one yet), many of our orders are being processed then cancelled by the Hawaii fulfillment center because they don't have the items in stock in the warehouse. Because of this, our orders are waiting to be ""picked up"" by the next available fulfillment center, which is causing a huge backlog.

The last estimated delivery I got from CS was 2 months after the most recent order, which would be some time in May. This is probably because Amazon is trying to cut back on shipping costs and trying to put Hawaii orders on a boat to the on-island fulfillment center, with freight also experiencing massive backlogs.

Currently trying to order each item individually to see if it makes any difference, as CS said it may make it easier to ship from multiple fulfillment centers; I guess ordering multiple items on a single order gets designated to your closest center and they won't process it or cancel the transaction if they can't fulfill it. 

If I don't get my items within the next 7-10 days, this still be the catalyst for me to cancel my membership and be done with this company. This is the worst experience I've had in over 10 years of hundreds of orders; sad to see how bad things have gotten."	22	"[""tofuflower: Do we know if all Hawaii prime members are affected yet?

Wth? \nI canceled all of my orders except for that order and ordered them all separately, thinking each source couldn't ALL be delayed. Same problem.\n\nSo I took a closer look and saw the same thing as others. To get the items by a reasonable time, I would have to select expedited shipping at $6.99 PER ITEM! To see if it was just Hawaii, I had a friend in Californnia mimic my order.\n\nGuess what? He had next day delivery to California, but when he changed the address to my address in Hawaii, up popped the $6.99 to get it by May 5th. And he added two more items ad the $6.99 was added THREE TIMES! \n\nFor now I'm placing a big order to get to my niece in California to save on the $6.99 per item charge. Instead she can put them in two large flat rate boxes and mail them to me. The only problem is the HIGH CALIFORNIA TAXES!! UGH!\n\nI hope that this isn't Amazon's permanent policy.

What's worse is that A LOT of items sold on prime are literally the exact same Chinese-made items sold on sites like Temu and Vevor, which believe it or not are actually shipping in rapid times because they use USPS. \n\nTo give you some examples: I ordered a 66# blacksmith anvil from Vevor for about $170 including shipping and I received it within a week. The same anvil (literally the exact same one) was selling for $179.99 plus $50 shipping and it stated it would take 1-2 months to arrive. I also ordered some cricut supplies on Temu that were the exact same items on Amazon. 6 12x12 mats for $2.89 each w/ free shipping. 3 of the exact same items on Amazon were $18.99 and no expected delivery date.\n\nOnly remaining benefit I now see with Amazon is the return policy, but they are trying to make it harder to return items. It's almost like Amazon is investing in losing money and wanting the company to crash these days. I went from 99% of online purchases with Amazon to probably 10% and find eBay, vevor and Temu to be the new go-to marketplaces for the exact same products at far cheaper prices."", ""norse_torious: I've received a few orders, but these were shipped via USPS.\n\nI'm wondering if Amazon is running into issues with FedEx, UPS and/or commercial airliners that carry their products to the islands?"", ""punkdigerati: I will escalate it the next time I call.

Social Media might create some negative buzz faster than individuals calling CS who have no pull. 😉"", 'norse_torious: I\'ve chatted with about 6 reps and spoken to 4. The last I spoke with was a manager, who gave me a bunch of info on the situation, as well as what an ""escalated case"" really is (essentially it\'s issues brought up in meetings).\n\nBest advice they gave was having customers with issues file complaints because they won\'t take action until it\'s a larger issue with the potential for mass membership cancelling.\n\nPersonally, I think the issue is shipping carriers and they are fully aware of the problem; just haven\'t said anything because they know people will start cancelling if 4-8 week waiting times become the norm, just so they can save a few bucks off the billions they made over the past 3 years.', 'MerleChloe: I did speak to customer service and was told that ALL of my items except one was definitely in stock and they\'re just waiting on the ""source."" So I canceled 90% of my orders and ordered them all separately. Surely all of their ""sources"" couldn\'t ALL be having issues. Ordering them separately without the $6.99 expedited fee left me in the same situation. Only now, my orders are starting all over. I canceled everything and reordered them late last night sending to my niece in Southern California. Some of my orders are already there! I\'d rather pay for two , maybe 3 flat rate boxes than to give Amazon $6.99 per item x 28 items.']"

Has anyone else been running into this? Seems like it started happening a lot in the last couple of months in particular.

Edit: To be clear, the item never leaves the Amazon facility. 

The last thing I ordered was in stock and waiting to be shipped for a month before I finally canceled it, since my card hadn't been charged. It showed in stock but the price had doubled between the time I'd ordered it and then. 

Before that, an item had ""shipped"" and my card charged, but it was only ever scanned at the Amazon facility and never left. This remained the case for a mere two days before Amazon sent an email saying they'd issue a refund if it didn't arrive by the end of the week. No offer to send a replacement, though it was still in stock. Only a refund. Only the price had then increased by $10 by then.

Maybe it was the only one left or the remaining stock was no bueno, so they canceled.\n\nPrice fluctuations happen constantly anyway so I don't have any speculation there other than perhaps Seller decided to up price based on demand or to recoup costs from lost or damaged stock.

Of the two I purchased, one arrived broken. So in the end, I ended up with one clamp at a great price and a defective one, which they refunded.

It doxxed me.	frooburst	61	121sq9l	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/121sq9l/psa_never_redeem_cards_from_a_friend_online_it/	"I have this kinda weird clingy friend I've known for a few years who sometimes gifts me games on steam and what not. I mentioned wanting to buy something from amazon offhand to them and they sent me a amazon giftcard. Heh, strange but thanks I'll use it no harm can possibly come from this right?


WRONG, they talked to amazon support and was able to get my FULL name from them. First name, middle initial and last name. They then messaged me my entire full name. They knew the state I lived in so they were also able to find my facebook.... They also offhand mentioned possibly being able to find my address from that.


I now have what I would call a stalker trying to add me on facebook and calling me my name and trying to find my address for gods sake all because I redeemed what I thought was a harmless gift from them. It's absurd that amazon is willing to give out entire full names just by you talking to support and having the giftcard code. It's not worth saving the $100 when so much can be found out by knowing your name/state. Keep yourself safe."	48	"[""kgiann: I think the person got your name a different way and is lying to you. \n\nLast month, I noticed a pending charge from Amazon on my bank account that I wasn't expecting. I thoroughly explored my Amazon account (including archived orders) and couldn't find anything for the amount of the pending charge. I contacted Amazon customer support to see if they could tell me what the charge was for. They were able to tell me that it was a different account, but nothing else. They confirmed the other account wasn't in my name and encouraged me to reach out to friends and family that have access to my debit card. It turns out it was a subscription my husband signed up for to use at work and had forgotten to tell me, but Amazon wouldn't even tell me that despite my husband and I sharing a last name and address."", 'BurntOrange101: Highly likely they’re lying and got it some other way… I gift/have been gifted amazon cards on the regular, even e-gift cards…  they’re very private about it.

You\'d be surprised how many people go throughout life not ever having that talk with people because most people around them assumed they knew already, but on a social upbringing level they never did learn the skill or able to read the vibe from others. Especially if this gift came from a guy.

Several years ago, before Prime Family reduced the number of adults allowed on one membership (2015 or so?), I had tacked my father onto my account in addition to me and my husband.  No problems.  I added my teenager a couple of years ago as well. 

In the last year, my father has passed away and my teen is now 18 and considered an adult.  

Because my father had been “grandfathered” in (haha) as an allowed third adult, is there any way to “transfer” his account (linked to his credit card, address, etc.)?  I’d like to make his (he’s obviously no longer using it) my daughter’s.  

I’d of course update the credit card info and shipping/mailing address to hers.  

I would just be moving the third adult in household to a different adult, but since they’ve limited it to only two adults now, I don’t think they’ll let me.   Is there a work-around?  

I’d obviously have to log into my father’s account (which I have access to) and change the name, address and payment info.  I could and would still be using “his account” just changing/updating info.  

THEORETICALLY, my father could have gotten married, changed his name, changed address and gotten a new credit card.  Right??

I know this is confusing, so I hope I’ve explained it correctly.  The need to get an additional Prime Membership so that we can enjoy the privilege of providing them with a new and very lucrative profit source.  Not like Daddy is ordering anything lately, and I assure you my kid is and will.  Essentially, his account is just sitting there, completely unused.  

I’ll provide any additional info if it’ll help.  I’ve scoured the Goog and can find no answers.

I checked today and realized that if I ordered the items today (March 21) the expected shipping is still March 28. This made me believe that everything has been sitting around in the amazon warehouse for a week for no apparent reason. For reference the closest amazon warehouse is under 1 hour drive from me. 

&#x200B;

So after getting a rep and being told I was having 'issues with my bank', grouped shipping was causing the issue or the items were not at the distribution center, I threw all 3 items back in the cart and tried a zipcode about the same distance from the amazon distribution center that I was, which said that the items could be there in 4 days. Some items would be there next day if I did not do group shipping. When confronting the customer service they just said that the zipcode/location matters (which makes no sense because we are the same distance apart and there is a 4-7 day difference in shipping). Am I really going to have to ship items to my family's house and drive to get it in order to get fast shipping? Its kinda ridiculous that I am paying for prime and its taking over a week to get items when 30-45 minutes away I could be getting items next day. In this area we used to get the 2 day shipping because of how close the amazon facility is, but everything randomly started to take more than a week.

&#x200B;

I've heard people had luck with prime business, but that does not include prime video.

&#x200B;

I've posted my chat as a few screenshots since I am not sure how to do the whole reddit thing.

Thanks!

But Amazon says the returns facility hasn't received it??	jumanjidice	1	11vuj2m	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11vuj2m/returned_an_i9_13900k_72956_on_february_8th_with/	"Hello legends, I'm trying to help out a friend of mine with this matter.

The item was purchased to Israel. It was later returned through DHL, and tracking says it was received on February 8th already, yet Amazon customer supports keeps saying they can't help because the returns facility hasn't 'scanned' the item yet. What do? Keep waiting or are there other things that can be done first? 

**Timeline of events:**  
\- January 10th: Purchased an Intel i9 13900k $729.56  
\- February 6th: Package was sent back to Amazon Returns using DHL  
\- February 8th: Package arrived in destination  
\- March 19th: Amazon customer supports claims to not have gotten it still  


I will now upload pictures and links, hopefully they could be useful:  
\- [DHL Tracking for tracking number 2343053963](https://www.dhl.com/il-en/home/tracking/tracking-express.html?submit=1&tracking-id=2343053963) please do note that at the bottom of the page there are 'More Shipment Details' and 'All Shipment Updates' sections.  
\- [Electronic Proof of Delivery by DHL](https://www.docdroid.net/rLnKbV3/proofofdelivery-2343053963-pdf) \- It seems to have been signed by someone called 'Marco G'  
\- [DHL Delivery Receipt](https://www.docdroid.net/hTYFaTJ/dhl-delivery-receipt-pdf) (whited out personal info)

&#x200B;

Some quotes from Amazon online Customer Service:  
""... **right now we are unable to process a refund  in our system, we need to wait our facility to process your return item**.Once return center processed your return item your receiving an email confirmation about the refund. ""

""... **we will not be able to provide further insight or action on this matter.We are unable to process your refund here  because return facility is the one who process your refund** and I kindly ask you to wait .""

""**As per checking here, the item has still no scan on it**.   We can only confirm if we received the item once it has been processed or scanned on our end.""  


Could anyone ever so kindly please assist with what should be the next move. It seems like waiting it out isn't doing anything as the person has already waited over 5 weeks since the DHL Tracking shows it was delivered to the returns warehouse. Customer services keeps giving the same answer and saying to ""wait it out"". Any suggestions..? 

Thanks !! :)"	0	[]
1679243125.0	19-Mar-2023 09:25:25	Amazon sent me a returned game, that was the wrong game with a sticker on it. And I can't get a replacement.	TheNinjaDC	8	11vpnnz	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11vpnnz/amazon_sent_me_a_returned_game_that_was_the_wrong/	"I'm completely baffled about what to do with this situation.First, I was sent a pre-owned version of this game (Violet), when I ordered a new copy.

But the second, and bigger issue, the pre-owned copy was switched out with an older Pokemon game (Sword). Seemingly, they switched the sticker on the game, and sent the older game back in the new game's box. When I inserted the game, I was met with a Pokemon Sword load screen. This isn't the game I ordered, but a faked returned copy.

I ordered Violet in January, but never got around to testing the game till it was out of the normal return window as I was waiting for a late Feb patch before playing the game. I have photos of the fake product, and still have the plastic repackaging plastic with attached bar code it came in.

I contacted the sub-seller. They informed me of this:

""We are experiencing the same problem right now with Amazon. Here's a background to the issue. A seller has 2 methods of shipping: 1) Merchant Fulfilled -- this is when we ship the package directly to the customer, 2) FBA (fulfillment by amazon), this is when we ship our inventory to amazon and pay amazon a fee to process and ship the orders on our behalf. Since Christmas, we have received returns through FBA and the games do not even belong to us! I have opened so many cases with amazon to complain about this issue. What I believe has happened, is other sellers have shipped their bad merchandise to FBA and Amazon has commingled everyone's inventory. Commingling is when amazon takes everyone's game and puts them in a communal bin. Therefore, when customers return this game to FBA -- amazon begins to return these games to us, and now we have realized the garbage other sellers have been trying to sneak into FBA and amazon never caught the problem.""

&#x200B;

They recommended I contact Amazon for the replacement as it was FBA fault. But Amazon keeps sending me in an automated loop that either rejects my return for being over 30 days past, or occasionally seems to offer a generic return. But I'm hesitant to do that as I don't want to pass on this hot potato and be blamed for it.

So I need help contacting AN ACTUAL PERSON! So I can return this defective/fake product in a way it won't be re-entered into the pre-owned game stock (at least before being properly relabeled), and get me my replacement (new) copy I paid for.

&#x200B;

I was able to do so  by getting to request a phone call, answering yes to  the first question (is this you?), then just being  absolutely quiet.

1679151457.0	18-Mar-2023 07:57:37	Ordered AirPods, received empty box, Amazon giving me the runaround	LudwigVan17	26	11uqmn4	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11uqmn4/ordered_airpods_received_empty_box_amazon_giving/	"I ordered AirPods Pro 2nd gen from Amazon because they were $50 cheaper than the Apple store. They arrived in a completely untampered with Amazon box but the AirPod box inside was not wrapped in plastic and the Airpods and case were missing. I contacted Amazon support and they said they would ship me a new pair and sent me an email confirmation on the reship. I asked them to cancel the AppleCare and issue it to the new AirPods and they started saying things like ""you can just use your order number for the applecare"" which I looked into and is not true. The AppleCare immediately attached to the serial number of the original stolen pair which was confirmed by email. I let the customer service rep off the hook and thought id just deal with it when the replacement pair arrives.

Two days passes and I log on to my account to check the delivery status of the replacement AirPods and the replacement order had been cancelled!! At this point I was pretty frustrated so I contacted amazon chat again and explained the situation. The rep could not explain what had happened but she issued me a refund. The email confirmation says that she ""requested a refund"" and there is nothing on my amazon account that actually confirms a refund has been issued. It still says my original AirPods were delivered. No ""return pending"" or anything like that on the site. She also said the the AppleCare would be refunded as well to which she never sent me confirmation on. I asked her to email me AppleCare return confirmation and a copy of our conversation and she immediately ended the chat.

I contacted apple support and they were an absolute joy to deal with after dealing with the Amazon support. Apple issued a refund for the AppleCare. I want to go to the Apple store and purchase the AirPods today but im still skeptical about my Amazon refund actually coming through.

I know theres nothing anyone here can do to help but i guess i just wanted to rant. Moral of the story is order Apple products from Apple.

TLDR: Ordered AirPods from Amazon. Empty box shows up. Amazon issues a replacement pair to be sent. Amazon cancels replacement order and lies about AppleCare. Amazon then says they will refund me but I dont know if believe them due to past shady acts."	37	"[""zombiecaticorn: Definitely avoid ordering Apple products from anyone other than Apple.

1679086717.0	17-Mar-2023 13:58:37	Amazon closed my account with no explanation	hichaam2	7	11u3krn	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11u3krn/amazon_closed_my_account_with_no_explanation/	"So after being an Amazon customer for a long time, and investing on their ecosystem, Amazon decided to close my account with no explanation.

It all started last week with an SMS that my account was put on hold because of a suspicious activity, so I tried signing in, and as requested, I submitted a bank statement downloaded from my bank's mobile app, after few hours I received an email that says ""we were unable to verify ownership of your visa payment ending in XXXX because the document provided does not contain any name"", it actually did, but whatever, I said it should be just not clear, so I signed in to my bank's web app, and I found out that the bank statement there is better organized, so I downloaded it, and I attached a picture annotating the placement of my name and address and the transaction, then I submitted it, after few hours, I received another email that says ""We have reviewed the information you provided but we were unable to verify ownership of your MASTERCARD payment ending in YYYY because the document provided did not prove card ownership"", I said, oh good, at least we are advancing, now I just need to prove the ownership of the second card YYYY (it was a backup card, and Amazon asked for documents for the payment method used in last transaction, so I didn't expect they were asking for it too), anyway, I attached a bank statement of this card, and same as before, I attached an annotated picture explaining the placement of the information, after few hours, I received another email, and it said ""we were unable to verify ownership of your visa payment ending in XXXX because the document provided did not contain any transactions"", and I said what?!!! now we are back to the XXXX credit card, I said, maybe I need to attach both documents at the same time, and that's what I did, and I even attached a picture of my passport next to both credit cards, and I said now I provided everything, but few hours later I received the famous email:

>After a review of your details, we have determined it is necessary to close your [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) account. Any pending orders have been canceled.  
>  
>We may not reply to further emails about this issue.

This was a shock to me, I provided all the information they requested, so I still don't understand what's the reason, I called customer service many times, and they were of no help at all, and all they could do is file an appeal that resulted in nothing so far (it has been 4 days now).

Now I lost access to all the ebooks that I bought in Amazon, I can't access the Kindle app on my phone, my Kindle tablet is on life support, and my son's Fire tablet as well, I really regret buying anything from Amazon now, and I'm just glad I never saved anything on their cloud storage, otherwise I would have been locked out of it, having the fate of ""your content"" in someone's hand means it's not your content, and now I learnt it the hard way.

Updates:

- three days after my last call to the customer service, I received an email that says: 

>""Hello,
>
>We received your most recent communication.
>
>We had already implemented the appropriate resolution and >sent you an email with further guidance."",

I assumed this meant that they are not looking into solving my issue.

- 2 days after receiving the above email, I receiced an other email that my account has been reinstated, I have no idea what helped in solving the issue, whether it was the customer service call, or the multiple emails I sent to jeff@amazon.com and investigate@amazon.com and account-alert@amazon.com.
Anyway, I'm glad my account is open again, but still I would be extra careful about buying digital content on Amazon going forward, I don't like the idea that my content is in the hand of a team of non-comptent people who might decide to close it when they can't read properly my evidence."	5	"['2Adude: Open a new account.

Context: my Amazon prime account just expired and I had no intention of renewing it this year. Said no to all of their promos etc. The card on file from past years was my husbands and it expired so we thought it was taken care of. 

Over the past two days, Amazon Prime has attempted to charge two separate credit cards of mine ( both associated with my Amazon account, but never used for prime membership) $150 each for a subscription. My bank flagged BOTH transactions as fraud and declined them. One was charged& declined last night, the other was charged this morning and also declined.

Had a rough call with Amazon customer service who insisted this was merely a “simple glitch” and that Amazon would never charge me without prior authorization. I said but that’s exactly what happened right? And they said yes BUT “it was just a glitch”. I insisted that if my bank didn’t flag this I would have been charged without my authorization, there is no evidence or backend for this available on my account. They just kept insisting it was a glitch that will never happen ever again. I’m pretty dissatisfied with this answer as my main concern was finding out if my card numbers were actually compromised at some point. They of course refused to patch me through to a higher up.

Curious if this shady shit has happened to anyone else? This really smells like Wells Fargo secretly opening unauthorized accounts to hit their sales goals in 2016."	2	['RedMapleBat: Did you actually end your membership (Your Account > Prime Membership)?

They were $18 solar entry glands . I ordered extra just in case I needed more than one and was planning on returning what I didn't need. A rep from the Solar system manufacturer came by to make suggestions and said I only needed one. So I requested a return label for the 2 I didn't need. I packed them up still sealed in there original packaging. Put the return label on the box and dropped it off at a UPS store. Got a receipt. A few days later Amazon refund the 2 items. Then 4-5 weeks later Amazon recharged my credit card for 1 of the items with no explanation? I called Amazon they said they only received one? After a month they decided something was wrong. The first person I spoke to gave me the usual Dont worry we will fix this . Then days later nothing? So I called again and they had to transfer me to another department? They then insisted they only got one back? These were 2 small plastic parts costing $18 each not much value to anyone that's doesn't know what they are for.  So I called my credit card company and they found in my favor after providing all the documents showing when Amazon received the return a month before hand.  Now a few weeks later Amazon sent something to my. Credit Card company that had them reverse the charge yet again? I'm not sure what's going on at Amazon? Someone didn't count the return properly. Or dropped one of the items. I am now going to cancel my Amazon account over this . A company this size that can't figure out a mistake was made somewhere a month after the fact is pushing for $18. It's not about the money it's the principal of it.  They put a lot of effort into this for no reason! I know both items were sealed in that box when. I handed it to the UPS store.  What happened after that I have no control over.  What if this was a more expensive item? I've purchased stuff costing thousands of dollars through Amazon before.

Aggravating_Bet1026	4	11t3rdu	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11t3rdu/beyond_fed_up_with_customer_service/	"On 03/06, I start a return on a MacBook Air as I no longer wanted it. Used the prepaid label provided by Amazon and proceeded to drop the item off at my local UPS store the same day. Got a copy of the return receipt. 

Item was delivered back to Amazon’s Fulfillment center located in Lexington, KY as of Friday, March 10.

A week passes by and I have not received any update regarding the status of my refund so I chat with Amazon customer service and have been told to wait 60 days for a refund from several representatives. 

On Monday, I chatted with a Rep who told me that they were able to issue a full refund on the order and that it would reflect back on my card within 3-5 business days. I was unsure whether to believe the Rep or not, so I reached out to support again to verify whether a refund was indeed issued or not, and I’ve been told no. 

Today I chatted with another representative who also told me that they manually issued me a full refund. I was having doubts as I’ve already been told the same thing twice this week, so I requested this Rep to send me an email confirming that they issued a refund and they did. 

This whole ordeal has led me to filing a complaint on Amazon through the BBB and emailing both jeff@amazon.com & andy@amazon.com. 

Received an email from someone at Amazon’s Executive Customer Relations Team advising me to wait 60 days, and that any additional inquiries on the matter won’t receive a response. 

I’ve got screenshots of all the chat communications I’ve had with representatives promising me a refund but never honoring it.  

Refer to screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/KOs7y8F

I’ve always received refunds on orders no more than 7 business days. When trying to explain this to Reps, they would keep advising me to waiting 60 days.

Returns or packages aren’t weighed along the way no time for that with literally thousands of packages circulating through a warehouse at any given moment.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve delivered packages that were poorly package and then at the end of the day seeing loose items that I have no idea where they came from or from what package I just turn them into the office to see if someone might call about it but mostly so I’m not to blame. Sadly most of the times I’ve seen customers leave packages with a single strip of tape covering an opening and I don’t have the time to retape it(or the tape gun to do it) and just let the system take its course. The few times I do talk to a customer and I tell them I can leave the label for them to drop off at a ups store (for customers who call a pickup) and they declined and I explain “alright if the tape doesn’t hold and the contents fall out UPS isn’t liable for your refund I’ll leave a note that taping/packaging isn’t sufficient” some get upset but I tell them it’s in the return info they are responsible for.

I have talked to the UPS store about tracking/package details if they get weighed in somewhere along the transit, but they said they couldn't pull it. Only whoever owns the label can.

I had this zippo custom engraved for him as a birthday present, and he always keeps it in one of the two places he smokes the most: 1. his car or 2. on the coffee table on the front porch.

He had a package delivered recently and the delivery photo has the zippo in the frame, but when he got home his package was there and the lighter was gone. Has anyone else gone through something similar?

Again, not impossible, but that would be a lot of coincidences.

i got the email stating i should file a police report for the missing package.

problem is.

I wanted a Citizen watch, and saw there were few used listings in buying options, all sold by amazon directly. I figured why not let's give it a go. Safe to say this would be my last time trying that. The watch I got in package was not only used, but also an obvious fake (missing side pusher, wrong dial layout, etc.). Returned it the same day but have been waiting for refund since beginning of the month.

After that I have bought the same watch again, this time new, from amazon. I love the watch, and 100% sure the first used one was a fake. 

Amazon's CS has been nothing but a waste of my time so far. It also seems their CS quality has gone wayyyyy down. Difficult to understand, confusing answers, and contradicting each other... frustrating! 

Now I am out of 300 bucks and not even sure whether they will actually refund that or not. I am sure I am not the first one got backfired by amazon used item.

Today they sent me an expensive bike pump with a gauge in a comically oversized box (size Q2, 34x22x13.5 -- I could literally fit inside it), again with ZERO protective packaging at all. No bubble wrap, no air bags, not even some paper. You could have fit a half a dozen or more of these things in this giant box.

They just let my expensive item rattle around. I'm so mad I haven't even checked if it's broken yet (I will tomorrow, though). Regardless, I just can't believe the lack of care and stupidity of doing something like that.

These are 2 fairly long stories but I'll make them as short as possible.

I first ordered an S22 ultra from Amazon and had an issue with the auto brightness and was sent a replacement which was fine (I  also sent back the original) until I began having other issues with the replacement. I sent it back, waited 30 days and no refund appeared which was very odd considering I used to get refunded within 7-10 days on other returns. I contact support and am told they cannot refund me until the original phone was sent back, but I sent it back months ago and they never contacted me about not receiving it when I would have had the proof of tracking number and receipt. They also said that the phone I had just sent back was damaged but I had pictures of the phone and packaging before I sent it so I filled in a form they wanted me to and attached the photos of the condition of the phone (which had a screen protector and case on the entire time and had no damage or even scratches) they then confirmed this even though they didn't care about the picture evidence. They still insisted that I did not return the original phone even though I had months ago and said to me the reason for not contacting me was because they ""Brushed it under the carpet"" and ""Trusted me"" which is not my problem. Anyway, I eventually managed to get the tracking code after hours of digging through photos trying to find a single QR code then they told me they had it all along but it wasn't working and I explained to them Hermes had rebranded to Evri and so some tracking information may have changed. They didn't accept this and this continued on for weeks. Eventually, I spoke to someone who refunded me after all that hassle none of which was my fault.

Recently I returned a pair of galaxy buds because I didn't want them anymore - within 14 days. I took a video of me packaging them making sure the box was fully protected because of my previous incident and even recorded myself putting the box into the amazon locker for return. I contacted their support after 30 days of not getting a refund and they tell me I sent back the wrong item and as per amazon policy, they disposed of the item accordingly and are waiting to receive the item. I HAVE VIDEO EVIDENCE OF IT ALL but they don't care, they are assuming I have tried to lie to them which is not the case. 

At this point I don't think I am ever going to buy from Amazon again, their customer service used to be so good and actually sort things quickly but I feel like something is going wrong over there especially when I ask to speak to a supervisor and I am told that they have the same access as the normal workers its very disappointing.

Sorry about the rant, I've just had enough now!"	1	[]

AnonAmazonHelp	1	11nssd7	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11nssd7/question_is_anyone_else_suffering_split_luck_with/	"I had to create an account because I was not seeing anything else like this online. 

Roughly since 2023 started, I’ve been having 50/50 luck with Amazon. I will note I live in an apartment complex.

I’ve had 50% luck with my packages actually being delivered, with a good photo and nothing is wrong. 

The other 50% has my packages lost, at a Amazon local center, says delivered with black screen as the photo, or delivered to the store downstairs who are experiencing agitation due to having multiple residents’ packages delivered to them. All of our packages state clearly OUR addresses. 

Just today, my package states it was delivered and I cannot find it anywhere. There is no picture, I’ve called customer service (have to wait a day, I’ve heard it so many other times from them), looked around my complex, called the local amazon center, and will call the downstairs store. 

What can I do for this issue? What do the drivers see on their end on how to deliver? There’s information on how to enter our building."	2	['123confusion: Mine was left along with other peoples packages(assuming these packages are part of the same apartment complex as me) by the street recently(they had the gate code and apt number). I happened to see the notification at the moment it was delivered at 5am because my husband was getting ready for work and had been louder than normal due to being sick(coughing). I was pissed when I saw the picture as the gate in question is on the sidewalk that leads directly to a small shopping lot that has a bar, grocery store and a few other small businesses. It was also highly visible from the street as well because it’s a fire hydrant outside the gate making it more visible because if the no parking zone.']

“Hello,

One or more of your posts were found to be outside our guidelines. In order to help our customers make informed choices, we encourage them to review the product and contribute information about it. However, Community content that violate our guidelines or Conditions of Use will be removed.

Please consider this a first warning.”

They of course don’t tell me what the hell they’re talking about. 

By “posts” I assume they’re talking about reviews? There aren’t really any Amazon forums anymore, are there? 

I submit maybe one review a year. The last one I wrote was six months ago, and was basically “the pictures show that this product is sparkly, like it has glitter on it. It is not sparkly.”

And that’s the typical content. I’m not snide, political, whatever, just stick to the facts of the actual product.

Would it be safe to assume that some seller of a product in the distant past put in a dispute of a bad review I submitted years ago, and managed to somehow get me in “trouble” in the process of removing bad reviews?

I’m slightly annoyed (blah blah longtime Prime customer blah), but mostly perplexed. They include a link to their “posting” guidelines, which are thus:

> so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of ""spam"" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages. 

Needless to say none of that applies to my “the product picture is sparkly but the product itself isn’t sparkly-style reviews … unless writing a bad review is now “defamatory”.

So dumb."	19	"['I-Am_9: I think if a company takes the time to say you ""violated"" their ToS, then being vague and ambiguous is counterintuitive.

I bought a 700$ tablet on Amazon, it was an international order. After changing my mind, it was too late to cancel the order.

The associate on the phone called UPS to start a stop and return. It showed on the tracking, but somehow,  the item still reached me. I had already got my refund.

I refused delivery and called Amazon, a member of the leadership team said i can keep it, and sent me an email confirmation.

This was back in december 2022. In february i received an email from the account specialists that was messed up (codes, hyperlinks). I replied to it and they said it was just a mistake.

Yesterday i got an email saying my account was closed because i've already been warned about return/refund policy. Which is not true. I appealed to it and they ended up reopening my account but only restricting it to digital purchases.

Any help guys? I have like 1800$ of gift credit and out of 70+ orders i have max 5 refunds."	3	['Snoo-11928: take them to small claims court for the money they owe you, amazon are bullies and wont bother assisting you AT all. dont waste your time messaging them.', 'jixpixel94: Account specialists are the worst']

I often order from Amazon because of the cheap cost and speed of delivery, but at this point, I am more than ready to jump ship and just pay more for better service. They don't care if you have prime, delivery drivers and people in the warehouse still treat the products like they are footballs or soccerballs and kick/toss them around. 

  
I have had so many items arrive damaged that I have become painfully tired of complaining and trying to get some sort of compensation, let alone shipping them back for a return. Amazon has helped a few times but a lot of the times I have just given up on saying anything. I had a big order of brand-new books/manga arrive from Amazon today and 7 out of 10 of them were damaged to varying degrees. Rips on covers and spines, but worst off all were three of the brand ""new"" volumes being completely bent in half, another with the cover torn up along with the first six or so pages. 

  
After actually talking to a real person with amazon over the phone for once and making a tiny bit of a fuss and expressing my frustration with just how often I receive severely damaged and very poorly packaged products that just get thrown at my door, they gave me a whole 5% refund on a couple of the items, which is obviously not nearly enough to compensate but they said its the best they could do. 

I know the workers aren't paid enough, but this is a multi-billionaire dollar company we are talking about here. The fact that local shops and even *other* giant corporations care enough to at the very least put some thought into packaging just shows how garbage amazon is and how it's not worth it.

I only knew about it because my bank sent me a text saying I would go overdrawn as I have an alert on my account for large purchases.

I immediately phoned Amazon and managed to get it stopped and it was delivered back to the warehouse. They originally refunded my account and I requested it back as a giftcard balance so I could just use it when I wanted to buy something.

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks later, they locked my account while they investigated it. Despite me sending numerous emails and phone calls, I could not get my account back. I more or less gave up as it gave me too much anxiety.

A couple of weeks ago, I was looking for an Amazon order for a printer cartridge that I had originally bought on my old Amazon account and saw my ""sent"" emails regarding my account closure, so on a whim, I resent them, specifically to [Jeff@amazon.com](mailto:Jeff@amazon.com). Two days later, they reinstated my account!

I was over the moon but then when I actually got back into my account, my giftcard balance of over £500 was zero, with ""Balance Withheld"" as the reason. I have sent more emails since then asking for my gift card balance to be reinstated but haven't heard anything, what do I do now?

&#x200B;

Edit:  So I sent more emails last night and this morning, less than 6 hours later, I received an email that said they will be reinstating my balance but it might take a couple of days!

&#x200B;

I will only believe it when I see it in my Amazon account but if this has happened to you, don't give up, keep emailing.

I added another email address to my list yesterday and I don't know if this is the one that had an effect but I did get an automated reply to say they would look into it so its worth a go.

The email addresses that might be helpful for other people in this situation :

[jeff@amazon.com](mailto:jeff@amazon.com)   [dave@amazon.com](mailto:dave@amazon.com) and the one I think got me a reply is

Then they will cancel your whole order without explanation, by email, if you exceed your mysterious limit; they won’t even move the items to your regular cart… they’re just gone. 

Happened to me today. Try getting through to the damn automated chat customer service with this problem. “Need help with something else” over and over again. Finally connected with Akbar, who escalated me to Kazadi, who told me I must have a $300 limit (my order was $800). (He says it’s in the terms and conditions—couldn’t find it, must be buried, clearly not obvious.) One of the items I was ordering is $345. This is so stupid. The order goes through— Amazon doesn’t tell you it’s cancelled right then. You get an email later. Why would they even let the order go thru if there’s a limit (that you don’t know about)???!!Then chatted with Miko, who just kept saying “oh I see” then she escalated me to Desmond, apparently a higher level of customer specialist, who confirms that he has no way of knowing what my limit is! Who the hell knows then? Can you tell me before I waste time filling my cart?! He suggests breaking the order in 2. Which could be two orders of $400 each—-wouldn’t they both be cancelled???  He says one will probably be cancelled and hopefully the other will go thru.  Spin the wheel. That’s the advice of Amazon. That’s when Desmond admits “there are issues” with this service.

Their score on there is like 1.9 and that’s pretty low for a BBB. PayPal is doing the same thing though. I swear, they took advice from PayPal and it’s going to come back and bite them in the butt.

It really is time to start finding another place. I know a few places that are currently being advertised and from what I understand they’re pretty good and they make items here in the US and sell them. I might give them a try. Anyhow. There is a lawsuit going for Amazon right now and I’m going to try to see if I can get in on that. I have proof I just have to see if I can contact that lawyer.

Considering whether to renew my Prime subscription and came across the fact that they offer photo backup.  I do have about 2TB of RAW files (NEF) which I wouldn't mind backing up to one additional location, apparently there is no size limit and NEF is a supported format.  Though I have a couple questions:

1. I assume I can upload from my PC?
2. Will the backup retain folder structure?  Usually photos are nested either one or two folderes deep
3. Are these photos at all secure?  Or does the EULA give Amazon the right to train their AI algorithms on our photos and shit?
4. How is the restore process?

Thanks for any info!

Also, do you guys subscribe year round or on a month by month basis?

They can just return it damaged to the warehouse for re packaging if they didn't want it. Rather to give the customer a damaged packages again. If they were going to steal your package you will never see it.. plain and simple.. I can tell you how they do it. Here's the scenario every time your package goes from one location to another it is scanned even when we get it to put it in the van we have to scan your package. So these people that want to steal your package they won't scan that particular package so you will see it as scanned as last location which would have been let's say the warehouse so you never see it out for delivery so most likely you will see it at the last location it was at before delivery you will never see that package and it'll just sit there and sit there and sit there even though it's already been on the van and the guy already probably took it home you will never see it. And after a few days you're going to question it why has not left the warehouse yet and you're going to call for a refund or or another shipment and they will report it as lost or missing and either send your refund or send you another package. An Amazon can't tell since it was never scanned into the van that it even left the warehouse. or they report it missing and it's will reprocessed and another item would be reshipped. Not everyone is a thief, but Amazon is good on issuing refunds and replacing packages. I have never had a problem with them when it comes to that. I understand that if happens more often than not. But I hope these idiots would not risk their jobs to steal a shirt that they decided they didn't want. And delivered an opened package.. I am sorry this happened.. but I would not want a customer to report me that I had opened their package without proof as to that is what happened without a doubt. I feel conflicted to deliver a cut package. But I only had one item that was damaged to the item from the box cutter out  of say 10 packages cut. Most customers would rather have it if it wasn't damaged to the item inside.  And I would be very upset after delivering a cut package with no damage to the item and getting reported for opening a package I would stop delivering to those houses as I don't feel safe and return all packages to warehouse.. until that address was blacklisted."", 'Helpful_Maize1308: Oof that last part doesn’t sound too good but at least they would be notified it’s off?

1678117065.0	06-Mar-2023 07:37:45	Second fraudulent order through Amazon. I have zero trust in Amazon. Cancelled my Prime.	Wallytooters	1	11k248b	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11k248b/second_fraudulent_order_through_amazon_i_have/	"This has been the 2nd time someone has gained access and ordered large items. In October I noticed a bunch of tiny orders placed on Amazon, tons of registration emails to throw me off. I believe it's called brushing to test if any orders are placed with my card. They attempted to order a $1k electronic gift card. What I didn't catch until months later was an Xbox trade in through Amazon. They got an electronic gift card sent to them right away, and since I don't even own the xbox to ""trade in"", Amazon eventually charged my card when Amazon didn't receive my xbox. Also the $1k order was put into Archived Orders so it doesn't show up on your normal Orders page. 


Before any of this happened, I had 2FA setup. Amzon told me I needed to set it up - I already had. That was their only tip and said they'd look into it. *Sure*. From this point I started using Bitwarden for everything and I don't even know my passwords. Now they are something like 'j2!ll_*_jhMN81IIll(^dsm6xkfi' I don't share my accounts with anyone. I set tighter alerts when any purchase is made from my Visa card.  My biggest question is WTF is my 2FA notification / OTP code?


Last weekend I woke up to a $700 charge from Amazon. Saw about 70 registration emails""Fcuk a duck"".  An iPad was ordered and being sent to some place in TX with same day shipping. With a gift receipt and a note saying ""Enjoy the gift"". I've read scenarios that this address is just an innocent bystander. And a delivery driver will go to that location to pickup the iPad to ""return"" the item. That's where the theft happens.  Funny thing is the delivery address in Texas was only 2 miles from an Amazon warehouse. So either the driver simply doesn't deliver the iPad to the address and drops it off at a different address or car. Or makes the delivery and comes back with all of the Amazon clothing and possibly the Amazon truck. When Amazon barely pays their employees - I wouldn't put it past them. (I never got a delivery email or photo, but probably because I cancelled my Prime before it would've arrived. )


I chatted with Amazon about the fraud and asked them to refund my recently renewed yearly payment for $136. I saw the Prime membership pending return right away on my banking app. I'm done. I've never had problems with fraud on my card until this past year and Amazon is the pattern. Not worth it. I'll be using Sam's Club, Walmart online, Target pickup (within 2 hours) or online orders, or just buying elsewhere. We live in the city and pass by the stores every day. Amazon is no longer worth the hassle of changing cards, calling my bank, calling Amazon. Especially when the 2 day shipping turns into 4-7 days. Bye Jeff!"	5	"['RedMapleBat: Did you change your email and Amazon account passwords after each hack?  I don’t really understand your sentence about the OTP code.  Are you saying you never received such a code?  If not, did the hacker change your phone number in your account?  It’s hard to say for sure how the hacker got into your account, but I understand it’s hard to do when 2FA is enabled, unless your device has been compromised or you’re using insecure Wi-Fi.\n\nYou could still use Amazon, but instead of leaving your cc on file, delete it.  Enter it (and then delete it) whenever you want to make a purchase.  Unfortunately, you run the same risk using the other retailers you mentioned, if you leave your cc on file.  \n\nI find it interesting that the hacker didn’t change your Amazon password.  You still had access to your account.', 'GlobetrOtterEric: 2FA is secure, no offense but could be a family member with access to your device(s) or compromised devices', ""Wallytooters: I changed my email and passwords back in October after the first fraudulent happening.  \n\n\nBoth fraudulent issues in October AND last week didn't send me an OTP code. Phone number is still the same. My wifi is secure and was updated after October too. I did remove the card after a few orders, but left it in there after the last order in mid February and then it happens again. I don't save any passwords on my browsers nor iPhone keychains. \n\nI'm open to more suggestions."", 'Wallytooters: None taken. Wife only orders through me and doesn’t use the Bitwarden app.', 'RedMapleBat: A while ago, I read a Reddit that sounded similar to yours.  The poster enabled 2FA, but still had a problem.  The poster then discovered that the hacker had gotten in through a TV and was still logged in.  The 2FA didn’t log the hacker out.  I don’t know the technical details of how that can lead to access to an Amazon account.\n\nBut, if you’re getting OTP codes when you sign in, but not for the hacker, it suggests to me the possibility the hacker is still signed in.  Or, the hacker is getting the OTP to go elsewhere that you don’t see.  In my Amazon account, I see under Login & Security there is a Compromised Account button.  I’ve never tried it, but I guess that’s an option.   Also, there is a Messages button (Account > Messages).  You could scroll through the messages, which are copies of every email Amazon ever sent to you, to see if you notice messages you never actually received.  That might suggest an issue with your email.  Having your email set up with 2FA is a good idea.\n\nBeyond that, I’m out of ideas.  I guess you could start fresh with a new Amazon account in which you set up 2FA right from the start.  Also 2FA on your email account.']"
1678086810.0	05-Mar-2023 23:13:30	Amazon Canada was once a great service, but has steadily gone downhill. It is now at a level where it's gotten so bad that it is almost unusable, and has gotten downright exploitative.	DustinPooparski	29	11jrma2	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11jrma2/amazon_canada_was_once_a_great_service_but_has/	"Cancelled my prime membership today for various reasons, but I am frankly disgusted with the direction Amazon has taken their business in the past few years. I have been a prime member since 2014, which is almost a decade, so I have a lot of experience with it. I've made thousands of purchases, most of which were great, but the past few years several things have reached the level of unacceptable and I just cancelled my prime service today.

here's what has been bugging me:

More and more items are taking over a week to deliver, despite being prime. I live in a populated city in Canada with a population of a million people, and there is an Amazon warehouse right outside the city. A few years ago when the warehouse was built, Amazon actually started moving towards having more one day guaranteed delivery items, which gave me hope for the future, but somehow things have gotten worse since the warehouse was built. These days when I buy an item, it usually takes 4-5 days to deliver, sometimes a week, even if it is a legit Prime and not a ""fulfilled by amazon"". A few years ago they also started offering ""free delivery for prime members"" items, rather than outright prime items, which as you know are items that aren't really prime, and are actually sold by a third party. I am not talking about these items, I am talking about actual prime items. (although I will add that it is a little annoying that Amazon doesn't have a way to filter \*actual\* prime items from these ""free delivery for prime members"" items when you search.

Delivery dates on prime items are dishonest on the website, and feel like a bait and switch a lot of the time. You can see this for yourself on many items. Perfect example is one that happened to me today. I'm looking for a certain item and before i actually put in my cart, it says that it will be delivered by ""Tuesday March 7"". However, when you go through the checkout, the earliest shipping option you can choose is ""Wednesday March 8"". It really seems like they want to paint a prettier picture about the delivery date before you decide to buy an item, then as you are actually buying it, they do a sleight of hand trick and suddenly change it. Even if you go back and refresh the listing, it still clearly says ""Tuesday March 7"", it even has the count down of ""if you order in the next 6 hours and 32 minutes"", but in the actual check out, they add a day. And on top of that, this date can actually change even after you mutter under your breath and begrudgingly agree to buy it. This exact thing happened today, which was actually the straw that finally pushed me to cancel prime. I ordered this item, listing said Tuesday March 7, checkout said earliest is Wednesday March 8. I agreed to buy it. I check the orders page an hour later, and my delivery date was changed from March 8 to ""March 28 - April 1"". WTF. I guess the item isn't actually in stock or something? I go back to the listing, and it's still being advertised as ""get it Tuesday March 7"". This incident in particular made me wonder how they can be doing this at all, and what am I even paying for? It's bad enough that prime items went from being delivered in two days to three days, to four, to five, and the fact that they are now being very deceptive about the delivery dates, but adding a whole month to a two day purchase? I feel like I am going crazy. Maybe this was an extreme case, but I just feel completely disrespected by this type of thing, it just feels like they are treating me like a sucker, and it kind of feels like some kind of cheap bait and switch parlor trick.

Customer service has gotten more and more stingy, to the point where now, they have removed almost any possible way for you to contact customer service. Everything is automated options that give you certain options and that's it. Most recently I received a used item, which is clearly used by a previous owner - it's opened, and damaged inside, parts are missing. However this item is not available anymore, so my only option is to return it or to exchange it for a different item. But the thing is, this item is hard to find, and I would actually gladly keep it if they offered me a partial refund. I just feel like a sucker paying full price for a used and damaged item, so I kind of have to either give up on the idea of owning it altogether, or just live with being ripped off. Partial refund is not an option anymore apparently.

I keep getting items that are broken, damaged, or not as described. Being a member for 9 years it's very noticeable how many listings now are just deceptive and dishonest. I recently bought some vacuum cleaner attachments that were listed as fitting the model vacuum cleaner I have, but the item I received is generic and doesn't actually fit my specific vacuum cleaner, despite specifically stating the model in the listing. The item I was sent is actually downright garbage. It legitimately belongs in the trash. It's a product-shaped object rather than a product, just an absolute scam.

Prime fee went up from 7.99 to 9.99 a month, and I wasn't even notified about it. But when I went to cancel my prime membership, they put me through three pages of ""are you sure you want to cancel?"" I am not kidding. After clicking cancel, they directed me to a page that is basically a sales pitch summarizing all the awesome benefits of prime, and gave me three options - remind me three days before membership renewal, proceed with cancellation, or remain a prime member. I clicked proceed with cancellation, and they took me to ANOTHER page where they AGAIN gave me a sales pitch summarizing all the awesome benefits of prime, and offered the SAME three options. I clicked proceed with cancellation, and they took me to a THIRD PAGE with the SAME same sales pitch, and the SAME three options, but this time they were actually arranged differently (possibly to trick me into clicking the wrong one, kind of like the cups and balls trick). So I had to click on the original cancel prime membership link, then I had to go through THREE ""are you sure you REALLY want to cancel?"" pages before they finally let me cancel. I swear, this tactic is intended to make people believe that they have cancelled their membership, when in actuality they didn't. After the first ""are you sure?"", and the second ""are you REALLY sure?"", some people will probably just assume that after they click ""yes, please friggin cancel"" the second time that their membership really is cancelled. But no, they make you do it a THIRD time. It's unbelievable how disrespectful and exploitative this kind of tactic is. I wonder how many people have had incidents where they genuinely believed they cancelled prime, only to find it still being charged to their credit card when they get their credit card statement. It really seems like a deliberate tactic to squeeze out some extra payments from people who aren't paying attention.

Also, Prime Video and Prime Music aren't great. Aside from a few good shows on there most of it is crap that you can get for free on apps like Tubi or other free streaming services. It's really not any kind of incentive to be a prime member in my opinion. Although I did watch all of The Mentalist on Prime, which is a great show."	7	"['Ash_Draevyn: I hear ya. Also in Canada. It’s quite obvious how terrible it has gotten. And how fast it got that way. I’m lucky, I guess, I receive my orders relatively fast. But it’s not like before.\n\nWhat really pisses me off is the amount of damaged items I’m receiving.  If I’m ordering a gift for someone or if it’s a collectible item…Product boxes are damaged 7/10 times; nevertheless, arriving in immaculate Amazon boxes.

What the hell? \n\nI usually just exchange for the same item…when the replacement arrives it’s in perfect condition with much better packaging!! So they know exactly what they’re putting into the boxes. (It also arrives much faster)\n\nWhy are they intentionally shipping out this stuff when they know it’ll be returned, then subsequently make the return process horrible for the customer? \n\nThe assholes who used Amazon as a rental service for years has made it hell for honest consumers. Is this Amazon’s retaliation? They’re only shooting themselves in the foot. \n\nDaily posts on account banning, people cancelling their membership and Jumping ship to Best Buy and Walmart. I don’t blame them. I think in the US they have Walmart +….no equivalent in Canada yet. I don’t think. \n\nBut, ya, it is like they’re intentionally trying to go under.', ""zealousmajor: Also in Canada. Hate how impossible it is to contact them! Tbh I didn't even know you COULD contact them."", 'J3ST3Rx: Not in Canada but I canceled after being a member for 15 years. Similar reasons, mostly ridiculously long shipping and sudden terrible customer service.', 'TehPurpleCod: I’m in the USA but I agree anyway. I still pay for Prime because my entire family uses it (different address) and I do have some niche items I can’t find elsewhere. But overall, Amazon’s service has gone down drastically. I ran into many situations where one day delivery ends up being two or more days. The warehouse near me is known to have bad logistics and lost packages constantly. Customer service is really bad too and also, I ran into so many sketchy third party sellers so I stopped buying third party. For electronics, if it’s less than $100, I’ll buy off Amazon Prime. If more, I take myself to a retail store.\n\nEdit: I’ve been a Prime member for I think over ten years too. They banned me from writing reviews about a year ago for a false reason then when I reached out to them to resolve the matter, customer service told me they’re not obliged to reinstate me.', 'LibraryFunny149: Agree with all of your points.\n\nAnother thing I’ve noticed is that they’ve started to ship both heavy and delicate items in those cheap thin plastic envelopes. Quite often the items arrive damaged, since the packaging provided barely any protection. To make matters worse, when you reach out to customer service, they just tell you to ship it back (as if it’s easy enough). \n\nGoing through the inconvenient process of returning an item isn’t a big deal every now and then, but when items constantly arrived damaged and you’re denied the opportunity for a replacement, it becomes a deterrent to even order from Amazon in the first place.', ""Just_Low_1294: I have cancelled my annual subscription and left amazon music now that they have basically made the free to members totally unusable. Back to Spotify, plus they want an extra £16 a year for membership, then add on £9 a month for amazon unlimited,,, no way, they've lost me for life."", 'DustinPooparski: 100%\n\nStupid shit happens sometimes too. One time I ordered a \'used like new\' blu ray of Lord of the Rings, but I didnt watch it right away. When I finally went to watch it, I thought ""why is the quality so bad.""

Each of the store deliveries was easy to schedule for when I was home, and it arrived either the same or the next day. One time they even delivered the same day about 2 hours after ordering. They blow Amazon out of the water regarding delivery times. The only thing I find a bit ""offensive"" for lack of a better word is that they ask for a delivery tip on top of the subscription fee.

First thing you need to select is the Grocery & Gourmet Food Department. After that you can leave it in the bigger main Department, or also select another smaller more targeted one like Pantry Staples. \n\nAfter selecting the Department scroll down all the way on the Filters and you'll see a section for Seller. You'll see it shows [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), Whole Foods, and a bunch more. If you don't want to deal with 3rd party seller/shipper then just select [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) but don't click Whole Foods. \n\nIt should filter out items that can't be shipped then.

Only they can provide tracking information back to Amazon to then push to you. They are not required to provide detailed shipping information, however. \n\nBut if it’s the latter…everything you do is tracked. Obviously every order and return are tracked. Who the retailer, shipper, returning company, or anything like that are is irrelevant. Literally everything you do is tracked. Your searches, your time spent on any given page, your keystrokes, everything. There is nothing you do with Amazon on their site that isn’t tracked. It’s also all automated, so it’s not like a person is manually flowing you around as you make your way through the site. If you want a simple example of what goes on, play around with a web app called Lucky Orange. It’s a more basic version of the kind of recording that Amazon can do, but optimized and made more pretty for small businesses. \n\nAnd it’s not like some dude is on a computer somewhere pulling your file to make some grand decision to ban you or perhaps give their blessing on a return. Everything is automated and triggers are created to start an action. If something causes a person’s account to get locked, for instance, something that they did with the account (on purpose or accident) automatically triggered that locking to happen.', 'Mea0521: Yes, all returns are documented.  Be careful.', 'T2LV: Wondering about the return itself being tracked. Ie. If amazon decides you are returning too many items they will close your account. I am wondering if all returns regardless or reason/seller, count towards this tally.', 'amerifolklegend: Yeah, doesn’t matter who the seller is.  A return is a return.']

As I mentioned in the Shipping Rant Megathread, up until about three months ago, I had the filter option in my Amazon searches for Prime and Prime One-Day.

The One-Day search filter option disappeared quite suddenly, and along with it, NONE of the items I looked at, no matter how basic or ubiquitous, lacked a One-Day option.

On top of that, anything I ordered with Prime Two-Day completely ignored weekends as being real days. Would never set the delivery for a weekend, and would always start the delivery timer from the next day no matter when I ordered it. (Countdowns are also absolutely gone.) Like, I would order something completely normal on Prime, like batteries, pens, or light bulbs, on a Thursday afternoon, and it would set the delivery date for the following Tuesday.

Three months ago I contacted Amazon support through phone, chat, and email multiple times to get this sorted out. Escalated my calls to supervisors at least twice, but to no avail. There was absolutely nothing they could do to bring back my fast Prime shipping options and search filters, and that was that.

Fast forward to today when I'm just buggering around on the Amazon site deciding to take another crack at it... and to my astonishment, I managed to get delivery dates for THIS SUNDAY. (Apparently Saturday still doesn't exist,) but WOW.

How did I accomplish this? Black magic you ask? No... I went to my digital content settings and clicked on my region to ""change it"". Filled in my address and everything, and lo-and-behold, now TORONTO shows up to the left of my search bar on the home page, along with my still-truncated postal code. (Something about Amazon's website absolutely loves cutting off the last digit of Canadian postal codes, and I have not found any way to fix that, nor has Amazon apparently.)

Anyway, small small small victory, I know. But if you're a Canadian Amazon customer and you've been going through Hell trying to get decent shipping options to show up for your address... try restating your region in the Digital Content preferences. Maybe it'll help, maybe it won't. But I'm excited that weekends exist for my account again."	0	[]

Since the receipts clearly state they cannot be used for returns, after a week I tossed my receipts and physical gift cards.

Now, after placing my first order, nearly 4 weeks later, Amazon decides to suspend my account until I can produce proof that the gift cards were purchased by me with a receipt.

I don't have a receipt (and who does 4 weeks after purchasing), so I tried to negotiate by telling them the location and date I bought the gift cards, in case they monitor where each of their gift cards are sold. They give no explanation but decided to close my account. I'm out $500 now.

Anything I can do at this point? Filed a report with Better Business Bureau. Otherwise - a PSA for all folks out there:

Keep your receipts for Amazon Gift Cards Until they are spent. If you are given gift cards from someone else (no receipt), redeem the minimum amount each time that you need to buy whatever you're buying, so if Amazon decides to steal the money, you don't lose the entire gift card balance but only the amount you redeemed.

Update 3/7: I stopped by Whole Foods. With Google Maps tracking the exact time I bought the receipts, I gave them the date and time and they printed out a receipt for me!

Now trying Amazon again. Will update once I hear back.

Update 3/14: Amazon has stopped responding to me and still refuses to honor or refund the $500. Posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/11rfooh/need_help_filing_small_court_claim_whole_foods/) about trying small claims court. "	6	"[""RedMapleBat: Were it me, I might take them to small claims court (and I've never done that so far in my life).  $500 is a lot of money.  If they want receipts, they should state that they require proof of purchase at the time of redemption, not weeks later.  And, it should state on the gift card that a receipt is required in order to redeem the code.\n \nThis is assuming you purchased the cards from an authorized seller (like a drug store or grocery store)."", ""AHeroToIdolize: Did you buy it with card? Try doing a chargeback and include the email from amazon saying they can't verify it without a receipt and then shut down your account. I usually don't encourage this bc Amazon will retaliate by closing/banning accounts for chargebacks, but since you're already in that bucket there's nothing to lose. \n\nI had a similar issue with another store a few years ago, where I bought about $250 of gift cards but then that store had some kind of gift card scam and they invalidated the ones I bought. When 5 weeks went by and they didn't refund me like they said they would, I then filed a chargeback and got my money back. My bank was really easy to work with and they said having those letters/emails saying there was fraud concern from the store really helped my case."", ""throwaway1335352: Appreciate the suggestion, I'll look into it."", 'throwaway1335352: I bought with cash.

Thanks.	btadams1971	7	11hbrxx	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11hbrxx/please_give_me_feedback_thanks/	Hello drivers. I’m just curious as to how things work. I’m in Park City , Utah. I have moved here from Los Angeles where if I ordered an item overnight it would arrive. Now, in Utah, the last 5 items I have ordered overnight have not arrived. They have shown out for delivery, but then I get a notice that Amazon is sorry for the delay, but it won’t arrive today. It then takes 1-3 days to arrive. I’ve even had one not show up at all. On regular orders I will on probably 20% of my orders have it show up as delivered, but then isn’t until the next day. Talking to customer service, which is never in the US, they can never do anything to help. What steps should I take? I love some advice. I can’t let this keep happening. 3 overnight orders ago I actually lost a contract because I couldn’t give a presentation. The item I needed didn’t arrive the day it was supposed to, and not even the next day when I needed it. But I was promised up and down it would, and that Amazon was taking it seriously. They don’t seem to care. It’s never UPS or USPS. It’s always Amazon delivery. I’m hesitant now to order from Amazon, it’s always a hassle. Which it never was in Los Angeles. Who can I call that isn’t in India or the Philippines? They are call centers who never help, never. They say Amazon Logistics won’t talk to the public. I am confident it’s because they do such a poor job that they can’t handle the volume. Please help me figure this out. Who do I call? Thanks.	2	"['Animal-Crackers: Volume of orders per zip matters a lot to Amazon. And they only have one “same day” fulfillment center in Utah.

I received a notification that my package was delivered, with a picture of it sitting on the front porch of my apartment building. When I went downstairs to get it, there was nothing there and since my building supervisor is in the front of the building I asked if he saw anything. He said the Amazon delivery guy just put the package down, took a picture and started taking it back to his truck when my building supervisor came out and asked where he was going. The delivery guy said he needed to take it back to the warehouse. On my end, I didn't get anything about the package going back to the warehouse. it's just marked as delivered with the picture. I requested a call with customer service and they refunded the order.

AHeroToIdolize	3	11gbk4y	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11gbk4y/amazon_trying_to_charge_me_for_returns_from_a/	"I know lots of people have had issues with returns lately but mine is going really far back!!

I had fraud on my Amazon account (items bought on the site through my Amazon store credit card) in November ‘22 and it took a month of constant calling and escalation, but they finally fixed it. Then I got emails saying I needed to return items from the fraudulent orders in order for the refund to process, which obviously I can’t do since someone else ordered them. I closed my Amazon credit card when the fraud happened and didn’t renew my prime membership because of the fraud and how difficult they were. Amazon finally said they wouldn’t charge me for the fraudulent items and I assumed everything was finished since I closed all my accounts. This was all settled back in the end of December. 

Now, in the last two weeks I’ve gotten over a dozen emails telling me items I returned over a year ago need to be returned or else they will charge me. Obviously I returned them, but CS and returns told me they can’t help me at this point since it’s passed the 30 day return period (duh, I returned these items in the end of 2021). It’s a sizeable amount that they’re looking to re-charge me in the next week or so if I don’t return the items. 

I only had my Amazon credit card on my account the last few years and since it’s closed I’m wondering how they think will charge me if it’s closed? I don’t really care if they ban my account since I haven’t used it the last couple of months,but should I be worried that they will send this to collections? 

Another weird thing is that a few days ago Amazon issued me a refund for an item I never even bought?? And it refunded onto my closed Amazon credit card. I called synchrony bank which houses the Amazon credit card and they said refunds can’t be overturned now that the card is closed so I should ignore their emails…but idk if I can trust the representatives since they didn’t know how the refund processed on the closed card (and yes, it fully processed it’s not just pending). 

Has anyone dealt with this? Should I be concerned?"	1	['Username-dumb75: Don’t have a clue…..but Amazon just gets shittier and shittier.  Good luck with this.']

Sounds good, I go for it.  When I tried to redeem the coupon, I get the message ""The offer is not valid"".  I check the email I got before I received the call, and it turns out the offer was valid until Feb. 18th and I signed on the 21st.  However, I received an email from an employee that day sending me the link and stating I was entitled to the coupon.  
When I complained and said I was going to cancel the business account, the employee just gave me the link.  I asked him: ""I'm surprised you have no problem with an employee lying to me"".  He said that was unacceptable, but basically, we had to follow the terms and conditions.  (Even asked me ""Didn't you read the terms and conditions?"" and did not apologize when I told him I did not appreciate his question).

If 15-20 of their agents overseas have spent a collective hour on the phone that cost them more than five bucks.  If you never get any compensation then quit Prime.  You can still buy hard to find things for 35$ total or more and then wait.

If you have half a million at a bank the person answering knows that as soon as they pull up your account.  You get better treatment the more you spend (airline and hotel programs are obvious).  One thought is to band together with trusted friends and family and just have one account and pay only one fee.  As you can have multiple shipping addresses use that.  But pick one person\'s name and one credit card to use.  Yes, that\'s a pain.  The other option that I already use for bulky items is but at a local retailer.  It is already cheaper now.

saw that it was just a white empty amazon envelope and the package said 5 pounds, i quickly told the delivery driver i want to refuse the package cause it was nothing, handed the envelope back to the driver and told him to call amazon or his company, he said he would do it but just speed off without any answers 

now the packaged is marked as delivered and i dont have a gpu and out over $860, 

in the back of my mind i knew this 3rd party seller was kinda fishy for trying to sell a msi trio x 4070ti for msrp $799, or it can be down the chain line but i have my doubts,

called amazon and they told me to wait to see if the delivery company will mark my item as refuse to accept and return in the next day, asked what would happen if they wont do it, all i got was a really lame suggestion to file a police report

Recently I ordered a pair of JBL wireless headphones and some C4 Preworkout which were supposed to arrive in the same package, instead I only recieved a little girls braclet making kit lol, the braclet making kit even has a sticker on it claiming to be C4 Jacked Preworkout lmao.

The issue is that customer service is having a serious hard time understanding my issue, they keep asking me to return the items for a refund which I can't do because I never recieved them in the first place — eventually one rep seemed to understand and told me to send back the braclet making kit and issued me a return label but that label is indicative of a JBL headphones it comes with a battery hazard sticker and everything; I don't want to send back this braclet making kit only for them to say I sent back the wrong item and not issue my refund. 

CS has spammed me with over 20 emails with basically the same copy and pasted please send back the item for a refund, and I can't get a clear answer as to if they want the JBL and C4 I never got for a refund, or to just send back this stupid toy for my refund. 

When I check Amazon it says ""Return started"" your refund will be processed when we recieve the item. But the wording makes it seem like they want me to return JBL headphones for a refund (which I never got), the fact they aren't saying anything about the $30 Preworkout missing to is also annoying ugh.

FourWayFork	0	11csloo	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11csloo/what_is_the_process_when_there_is_a_product/	"Twice within the last month, I have gotten emailed notices that there is a recall on a product I ordered.  Both have been well outside the return window.  One was a foot product that we had used maybe a quarter of.  The other was an assistive device we bought for my mom four years ago that she uses daily and was recalled for a safety issue (people have been asphyxiated using it because it collapses if you put weight on it in the wrong way and they have pulled it down onto themselves and died ... which is pretty scary).

In both cases, Amazon emailed me a recall notice with a link to https://amazon.com/your-product-safety-alerts and both of the recall notices are listed there.  (This wasn't some weird phishing attack or something ... it was a legitimate notice from Amazon.)

Both of the recall notices say to return the product to your retailer for a refund.

In both cases when I called Amazon support, they kinda fumbled around not sure what to do and then eventually just issued a partial refund for a completely unrelated item that I bought in the last month.

I feel like that's not the right process and that was just a support person who couldn't figure out the right process using the tools they have available.

What is the right process when there is a recall?"	1	['Famous-Perspective-3: you can still contact amazon and in some cases they will refund you in full or you can go to the products website and file for a free replacement.   \n\nSee if the company that makes the product has their own reddit sub and a lot of times, you can find more info there.

1677346960.0	25-Feb-2023 09:42:40	PSA: Don’t buy AirPods on Amazon. Scammed out of $200	Dekemyster	29	11bqtri	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11bqtri/psa_dont_buy_airpods_on_amazon_scammed_out_of_200/	"UPDATE: For anyone who cares, Amazon has denied our appeal twice and their decision is final. Gonna have to go the bank chargeback route. Hopefully that goes through.

My girlfriend ordered some AirPods Pro 2nd Gen for me, shipped and sold new by Amazon. They were clearly fakes and none of the serial numbers (on box, on AirPods, in iOS) matched up. We explained the situation to support and returned the fakes, but we just received an email saying an “incorrect item” was returned and no refund will be issued until the correct item is sent. They’ve also discarded the “incorrect item”. 

Chat support has been no help, so we’ve emailed the returns team and are waiting for their reply. What else can we do in this situation? I realize we don’t have much proof and it’s Amazon’s word against ours, but it’s ridiculous that we received fakes in the first place, let alone have our refund refused. Amazon has essentially stolen $200 from us."	74	"['halcyondread: Amazon’s the Wild West these days.

I don't recall the seller (ie, sold by,) but it wasn't Thinkware-- it was shipped by Amazon.\n\nThe first order arrived and the box was smaller than I expected. The reason for that was that instead of the dashcam, I had a nicely boxed and shrinkwrapped... gift card for a Chinese web site I'd never heard of. Denomination unknown (needed to scratch off for code-- I did not do that.) Mistakes happen, so I returned it and tried again... also don't recall sold by \\[again, not Thinkware,) but shipped by Amazon.\n\nI got an identical boxed gift card-- again. It wasn't the same one I'd received and returned, but an exact copy in every other way.\n\nAt this point I'm concerned that they are going to think I'm scamming *them*, so this time I called. Person I spoke to seemed concerned and that it indicated there was a problem in their warehouse. Returned it-- got a refund, again. Decided I was done with trying that... and the price went up to $520.\n\nFast forward a month... it went back down to $320... sold by THINKWARE, shipped by Amazon. Okay, I'll try this... it's been a month.\n\nMy husband was there when I got the package— we were on our way out and he said “Make sure you got the right thing this time” — so I opened it.It was a sealed Thinkware U1000 with front and rear cams. I did not open the box. I set it aside and we went out.\n\nFast forward two weeks— I open the box after breaking the factory seal. There is a used suction cup, a $30 generic dash cam, and a jumbled up power cord. No manuals, no plastic baggies, no factory packaging beyond the outer shell. WTF?\n\nCalled Amazon. They— strangely— didn’t seem as alarmed. Fortunately, I got my refund.\n\nI’ve since purchased the camera from Best Buy for $340 for pickup at my local store. I opened it in front of the cashier— and I finally have my dash cam.\n\nWhat's really crazy is that I've been buying from Amazon for more than 20 years and have bought quite a few much more expensive items (MacBooks, iPads, Airpods, etc) and I have never had this happen before.

I know Amazon will notify you if the person you're sharing with adds one of your cards to their wallets, but can they immediately use it at that point, even if the shipping address differs from all previous addresses used with that card? I know if I change my shipping address, Amazon requires you to re-enter your card info---does that also hold true here?

Also, does anyone know if the zero liability clause of credit cards (specifically the Amazon Prime card) applies in this circumstance? I guess you're authorizing the user by entering them into your household, so I'm worried that there are no consumer protections whatsoever and that even asking Amazon to simply cancel/return the orders may not go through because you've authorized the individual but simultaneously don't have access to their orders, etc.

Can anyone weigh in? Could I be liable for Amazon orders up to my credit limit with no recourse?

For a bit of background amazon warehouse is you can get the item a bit cheaper I.e the box will be damaged etc. 

When the item arrived the box was damaged and the airpod case had marks on it (more than described) it was supposed to be 1-2 marks but this was deep dents. 

Anyways contacted Amazon said I wasn’t happy and they said that’s fine you can return it. I sent it back they received the item a week later, still no refund I chased and chased. 

And yesterday they’ve told me they cannot refund me cause I’ve not sent them the item back? I’ve responded saying can you provide me with photographic evidence you have not received the item and they just said it’s our policy to discard it?

You’ll be fine, but Amazon won’t help you. They don’t document anything when they receive an item, so there is zero proof they can offer on what product they received. I’m not sure why they do it like that (I guess, again to save time and costs), but it creates this scenario where they can claim something that is incorrect. \n\nTo that end, when you return something, I’d also take pictures of the item, to show the condition.

A letter from Amazon's CEO
Amazon welcomes One Medical
Dear Customers,
Today, getting great health care is often too difficult and inconvenient. Typically, you have to find a doctor, make an appointment a few weeks in advance, and drive 15-20 minutes or longer to the doctor’s office. When you get there, you wait in the reception area for a while, get called by a nurse into an exam room, wait another 10-15 minutes or so, and eventually see a doctor for only a few minutes who often then prescribes a medication. Finally, you drive 20 minutes or more to the pharmacy and wait for the medication to be ready—all while you or a loved one you’re caring for aren’t feeling well. It’s a lot of work; and let’s face it, the system isn’t working for customers or clinicians.
At Amazon, we’re trying to improve the health care experience for customers. We started by building Amazon Pharmacy, with a broad selection of medications sent to you with reliable, free delivery. We then added RxPass, a new Prime benefit from Amazon Pharmacy, which for $5/month lets Prime members get as many medications as they need from a list of 60 medications frequently used to treat many common conditions—and shipping is free. We also recently launched Amazon Clinic, which offers a convenient, personalized, and affordable way to get medical advice and treatment for over 20 conditions (like migraines, allergies, sinusitis, and more) simply by messaging with a clinician—no appointments, no travel.
Today, we’re excited to announce that One Medical has joined Amazon and our mission to make it dramatically easier for customers to get what they need to stay healthy. With One Medical, customers can connect with clinicians 24/7 via video chat or messaging if that’s most convenient. Or, customers can choose to make an appointment same day or within days to visit any of One Medical’s offices in many U.S. cities. If you need a specialist, One Medical works closely with lots of hospital systems and can help you get a referral and an appointment quickly. One Medical works with most insurance providers, and while you can of course get your prescription filled anywhere that’s convenient for you, you can also choose to have it delivered to your door by Amazon Pharmacy. This is how primary care should work.
For a limited time, to celebrate One Medical joining Amazon, you can now join One Medical with a discounted annual membership of $144 for the first year (a 28% discount), the equivalent of $12 per month, for new U.S. customers.
We’re just at the beginning of what’s possible. Customers tell us there is a need to radically improve the health care experience, and we think we can help. At Amazon, together with One Medical, we’re determined to help make it easy for you to get the care, the medication, and other products and services you need to get and stay healthy.
Wishing you good health,

I immediately logged into my online banking account to check it out and it showed two processing transactions from Amazon, one depositing $1.50, and then another charging me $1.50, so my current available balance remained the same. I contacted Amazon support and they weren't able to tell me why I was charged for this. First I was told it was because I added shows included with Prime onto my list (I didn't even watch them just added them to my list btw) even though that's included with the Prime free trial and I should not be charged for watching them. Then I was transferred to someone else to help me and he couldn't because he needed the order ID number to see what the charge was for which I did not have. This charge doesn't show up in my order history on Amazon and the ID doesn't show up in my transactions on my bank account either. He told me to get it from my bank and I'm having trouble getting in contact with someone there so I just want to know if anyone here has any idea what this is about or if they've had a similar experience? The only explanation I can come up with is this transaction happened to make sure the card I used was valid, but when I asked them about that they seemed to ignore that comment and gave me the aforementioned responses. I specifically started the free trial so I could watch a new show that's coming out but now I feel a bit hesitant to use it after this. 	6	"['OnionTruck: That\'s not unusual for ""free"" trials.

I was eligible for a month long free trial of prime and a week long free trial of the hbo max add on.

The hbo max add on was supposed to renew on 1/30, and I thought I had the payment method set so it would charge my gift card. I used it for 3 weeks and then suddenly got an email saying the charge had been unsuccessful. 

I've tried to change the payment method but it won't seem to let me set it to my existing, already redeemed gift card balance at all. It will only let me use a credit card (and frankly, I am poor so I really needed to use the gift card), or redeem a *new* gift card, but gives me no option whatsoever to use my gift card balance. I tried contacting support and they just said I can't use my gift card balance to pay for prime video add ons, but that seems at odds with the fact that it gives me an option to use a new gift card (just not an already redeemed one), and with this page that says people in the US (which I am) can now use gift cards to pay for prime channels https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=TZti7yJP0CwBRPyc2R

Does anyone have any advice on how to get this sorted out? I still want to pay for another month with my gift card if I can but am unsure how to get my digital payment method to change to that. The extra frustrations are first of all, I had prime for years and it was CONSTANTLY using my gift card balance to pay for it, even when I didn't want it to. And now it won't let me do it when I *do* want to?

Just miss the lowest price for the accessory and wait until the state changes of the order.

(about 700 USD)	Jazz-Noir	1	1183glb	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1183glb/i_was_billed_for_prime_for_4_years_without/	"I'm Canadian and back in the day, I used to order stuff that wasn't available on Amazon Canada from [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), cross the border and pick it up there. With Canadian customs becoming more and more difficult to deal with, I stopped doing that in 2017. I don't recall being Prime USA but I always was a Amazon Prime Canada member.

Fast forward to this month, because of Netflix new policy and the impossibility to share passwords, I redownloaded Amazon Prime Video so I supposed it promped a notification telling me I was billed this month for ""Amazon Prime US""... So I make my research and discovered Prime US and Prime Canada were 2 different things... so 2 different bills.

I go to my billing account in Amazon USA and discover I've been billed 13.99$ or 14.99$ USD for the last... 48 months. So in total, since January 2019 I've been an American Prime member and never knew it. It's about 700 USD.

I recognize I have some responsibility in this but since I was paying double (Canadian & American) membership, and never used the US account, it seems to me I should get a full refund on this one.

I called the customer service yesterday and they accepted to refund 27 months on the 48 total. I didn't push to talk to the manager and see how I could get a full refund. But thinking about it, I'm wondering if I should have. What do you guys think ?

I have prime so it was supposed to come the next day (February 17th, Friday).

So I’m home waiting, they’re two stops away. I’m getting happy and then it hits me with delivery attempt, they never came to knock or anything but they did ask for a code over text which you never ever do. it has to be in person. So I believe they wanted to steal it or were  too lazy to deliver my package and drove past . So I call Amazon to reschedule my package delivery because I won’t be home. I tell them I need it delivered on the 22nd (Wednesday) and they say alright and change the date. The weekend passes and today it says “Package being processed at carrier facility.”   But with no location to which facility. I call them they all give me different answers one guy says it’s today another says tomorrow and the last person says it’s Wednesday. I don’t know if I’ll ever get this package but one thing is for sure: prime is butt.

My Prime membership renews every December. I also pay for Music Unlimited, which renews every October. And I often pay for various Amazon channels for a month or two here and there.

I recently went back to school and thought about switching to the student membership. I know that if I switch now, I'll get a pro-rated refund of my membership fee that I paid in December. I also know that the 6 month free trial of Student Prime does not include prime music or prime video.

So my question is - even if I don't have Prime Music for those 6 months, will I still have Unlimited since I paid for it in October? And even if I don't have Prime Video, can I still sign up for Channels? I see that Student memberships can sign up for Showtime for 99 cents/month - can I do that during the 6 month free trial or do I have to wait until I'm on the paid membership?"	1	['None: Can I have a student membership at UC?

My main account got hacked, twice, and unauthorised orders were done on it. First time the account was 'temporarily suspended', I contacted them to let them know it wasn't me and shortly after I could use it again. Second time around, they kept it shut (which is fair enough but still annoying) and support advisers on the phone advised me to create another account. Which I did and lasted for another few months fine.

A friend later that year gave me a prepaid card as a present, which he showed he could use on his USA Amazon account; mine is a UK one with a UK billing address. I tried it anyway after persuasion, which again, got it suspended. Getting in contact with them was useless and no matter what I tried to cancel the order, my friend didn't have sufficient proof (no billing statements - only physical photos). Again, Amazon wasn't having it and that account got shut.

Again, yet another Amazon account had to be opened (as I need Amazon, they have good items on there and good deals). No matter what I do, I can't open another and I can't use my cards - they always get suspended as they say the same message that ""it's related to another Amazon account that got shut"". The fraud team is a separate designated team (according to Amazon reps, manager confirmed it after calling with much frustration) and always send emails from a noreply email not giving me a darn chance to explain anything.

Their reps or managers can't touch accounts and apparently the Amazon risk team can only do that. What do you advise I do? If I call them up and tell them there's a misunderstanding I feel like I'll get the \*shrug\* response with ""there's nothing I can do"".

Are you sharing the accounts with others?  Staying logged in somewhere?  \n\nThe best advice I got from my bank after a scammer got my debit card number and tried buying stuff in South Korea (I'm in U.S.) is:  get a credit card through your bank that you only use for Amazon.  It's easier to get help and reimbursement with a credit card than debit card.  And then you can control your purchases through that one account without throwing the number around elsewhere.  Make sure you transfer money to pay it off each billing cycle to stay good with them.

You admit to have used a tender that was not valid in the UK to make a purchase.

I  decided right away to make a big purchase with it ($600 worth) and  decided with paying it off monthly instead of 5% cash back.

Anyways, I decided I want to return the product. But I'm confused as to whether I  should refund it back to my original payment method which is the Amazon  Prime Visa Card or should I return it to my amazon account balance.  Will there be negative consequences choosing one over the other?

Also, I used the $100 gift card amazon gives you when applying for the card  to pay for part of the purchase. If I choose to refund it back to the  Amazon Prime Visa Card, where will the $100 go to? Will it add money to  the card or will go back to my Amazon account balance?

been a amazon prime member for a good 3-4 years at this point, had zero account or payment issues whatsoever.

then a week ago i tried to log into prime video, told me there was an issue with my account and that i need to switch regions and re login.

i followed the instructions and apparently my account has been suspended/locked for no reason, didnt receive an email regarding this matter either.

i tried using the form, uploaded my bank document with bits covered to ensure i dont run into any issues and even explained to them that the original card used for my account is dead and i had a new card sent out that same week.

Prior the only negative experiences I had with them was their in house delivery service constantly mis-delivered my packages to neighboring houses around me. There were periods were up to 30% of my orders would be placed in front of someone else\'s unit. Same townhouse complex so wasn\'t too hard to locate missing packages. Many times my gatehouse security guard would ring me up letting me know a neighbor dropped off a package that was mis-delivered to their home.  I feel around the time Bezos stepped down it all went to hell. I was having more frequent mis-deliveries and on top of that anything I purchased that was heavy and bulky would be left down the bottom of stairwells and never delivered to my door.\n\n I had to drag a 100+ lb treadmill, a Mini washing machine, & a massage chair up 3 flights of stairs that measured 22 stairs in total. I don\'t necessarily have an issue with them refusing to deliver it to my door what was enraging is that nowhere did it indicate this would be the case while placing the order for these items. Also when I called about it the CS would all play dumb claiming they had no idea why packages were not being delivered to the door rather than just outright informing customers that if there are stairs involved their freight shipments would not be delivered to your doorway unless you pay for white glove delivery service or something of the sort. Mind you none of the large items I purchase I don\'t recall being given an option to pay for additional delivery service.\n\nI purchased a Motorola razr 5G phone brand new from them in december, its now april and the main internal screen cracked down the middle rendering it an expensive useless brick unless I forked out more than what I paid for the phone to Motorola to replace the screen. This is of course no fault of Amazon. After mourning the loss of my original phone I painfully decided it was better to repurchase the phone rather than trying to repair the one I had so I placed an order for a second (Like new) device this time.  A box that was suppose to contain the phone was delivered to my door 2 hrs ago. \n\nWhen I opened up the box which was repackaged since it was suppose to be a ""like new"" item all that was in the manufacturer\'s box was the black pouch containing the charging brick, charging cable, and the headphone adapter thingee. The phone itself was nowhere to be found. I have been through a lot with amazon but this was definitely a first for me. I have no idea if the original purchaser stole the phone and sent back an empty box as the return or if more disturbing the phone was stolen by one of amazon\'s own employees. \n\nThe upside is I was not put through any hassle as far as refund they refunded me immediately and told me no need to return the empty box with the accessories. This just makes me feel as the OP says, that the company has taken a turn for the worse. There are always going to be issues with any company that handles sales and logistics but there has definetely been an uptick in these types of incidents and when you call in to complain or resolve issues the level of concern is lacking.

A few days ago, it became no longer invite only so I ordered it and this time got USPS tracking.  

It was marked delivered yesterday around 1pm but I had no motion alerts and it wasn’t on my porch.  

I checked with neighbors and walked down a few houses to see if any packets were on any porches.

I’m afraid Amazon isn’t going to believe me.  At least the first one stayed in their system and was never marked delivered.  I let USPS know but it was just a claim that takes 72 hours to investigate.

Interesting to hear the problems extended to the selling side too.\n\nIt’s a real shame tbh because Amazon are in such a great position to make life really easy for their customers if only they’d be willing to invest properly in the staffing required to maintain the content of their platform and fix things that go wrong on purchases and sales.\n\nShutting down a customer service call / chat because it doesn’t fit with an agent’s desired result or assumptions is so completely inappropriate in itself but it’s made so much worse by the way customer service is designed at Amazon. They have such limited routes to contact them and once an issue like a return is marked as closed it feels impossible to address.\n\nThat said - I had the horrendous experience of trying to get a return processed via eBay during the start of COVID and discovered they had absolutely zero ability to call a customer service agent or use online chat at the time - only fill in a short form and wait indefinitely. I don’t know if it’s the same today but it was embarrassingly bad. I try to avoid eBay ever since. So as you say, there are plenty of platforms doing similarly poor business practices.

I returned a phone back in December to amazon and still have not received a refund. It was returned with UPS pickup as instructed by amazon. UPS picked up my package and left me a receipt. Many weeks pass and I contact amazon numerous times about the status of the return. Every time they give me the same response saying to wait 60 days to see if the return will process. Well tomorrow is the 60th day so I reached out again asking about the return. They told me they received the package but cant locate the item. I'm very confused by this because why would I send them an empty box.

I asked them to provide the tracking details. They did and it shows that the package was delivered. I even told them that it states the weight of the package, proof of delivery, etc. They didn't make any comment about that and just told me to contact the carrier about the problem and abruptly ended the chat with no other solution. If I contacted UPS they would probably just show me the package was delivered.  

 I feel stuck as I have no control of what happens at the amazon return center and If they lost my item or something. What should I do?"	3	['InsertBluescreenHere: call call and keep calling. keep asking to be transferred.\n\nthose tier 1 people are there to make you give up and just kick the can down the road till its too late to do a chargeback. amazon keeps the phone and your money - they win.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbe polite but firm with these morons.']

I've since received them and everything was fine. 

Last night I sat down to purchase tools for a job I have coming up. I was met with a screen requesting that I change my password. I didn't really want to change my password. They do this every other time I log in. So I click the button and I'm redirected to a page where I'm supposed to input a code that they are supposed to email me. 

The email never came. 

So I would spend the next several hours on the phone with customer service and my bank. 

They tell me I'm locked out of my account because of too many attempts to enter my account. 

They ask really nonsensical questions during the security test they administer in order for you to regain access to your account.

One of the security question items was a transaction ID in which case this was when I began having to look into my online banking and talk to my bank. 

The transaction ID is supposed to be a 9 digit alphanumeric code. 

There are no such codes in my online banking and no such codes that my banker can see. 

Another one of their questions is ""name an item in your saved for later"" 

1 I don't use save for later.

2 I don't know how to.

3 whenever I'm interested in something I just add it to my cart and I go back and buy it later.

4 I don't remember everything that I save in my cart.

Yet another stupid security question was

 ""when did you first subscribe to Amazon prime?""

Now considering the first time I had Amazon prime was almost a decade ago and the fact that every time I've had Amazon prime I just ended up with it because of something I bought and I didn't make the decision to get Amazon prime and I'm never emailed about Amazon prime other than the fact that my prime subscription has expired... How in the hell am I supposed to remember this? 

So I eventually gave up and I created a new account. 
I got all the items I needed and put them in my cart and I proceeded to check out and they were on the way, great right? 

Nah, not so fast. 

The transaction gets canceled. Then I'm locked out of that account too. When I try to regain access to the account I met with a screen asking me for a bank statement as part of their verification process. 

I upload the document and then I call customer service and they tell me it's going to be 24 to 48 hours before I can access the account again. 

I wake up this morning to check on all of this and I have an email requesting that I send them a utility bill as part of their verification process. 

1 I travel for a living and do not have utilities. 

2 isn't this a bit much just to buy some tools? 

3 If a bank statement is good enough to verify my new account why wasn't I asked for one when I was having issues with my old account?

4 wtf is going on with these people and this company?"	1	"[""Throwingshead: On your payment method statement the Amazon charge will show up as something like AMZN mktp and then a a bunch of random characters after that in the charge description and that is your transaction ID.

This is a fraud protection measure and is necessary for them to prevent what they deem to be bad buyers from just making new accounts and repeating the same things that got the original suspended in the first place.

No photo attached though. As I went round the back to get it, I noticed that there wasn’t any obvious parcel, I looked around there and back round the front of my house only to find there was no package. I spoke to my neighbours and my housemates to see if they’d seen anyone delivering from Amazon during the day, to which both parties said they hadn’t even seen a van. 

I attempted to report this to amazon that day, and was told to wait until Tuesday 14th. I waited and came back to report it then, only to be told that there’s nothing to be done and that I must file a police report if I wish to get my money back. 

So I call the non-emergency line (101) and explain to them what’s happened. I’m told in no uncertain terms that a non-received parcel is NOT a police matter and for the amount of the items (1 item) missing (~£50), it’s too small for them to file a report anyway. I explained to Amazon that I don’t even know if it’s stolen so how can I report it as such and am told that until the item is physically in my possession, it remains the property of Amazon and if they believe it’s been stolen then you need to file the report. The police told me it’s more of a civil matter and my best chance would be letting my bank sort this as a dispute.

Until I receive the parcel, it can't be stolen from me, and seeing as I don’t have it, how can it have been stolen from me. Amazon have a sales contract to deliver the items I ordered to me. How is this not their issue to solve?

I cancelled my monthly membership and received the refund for it immediately only for them to charge my bank for a yearly one.. 

Now I never sign up for yearly memberships and I am not illiterate with tech so I know for a fact I didn't randomly sub for a year after cancelling because who would do that. 

&#x200B;

Well I contacted my bank and they were forced to close the card I had on file for amazon because they suspected fraudulent activity. Which ended up being Amazon's fault I just didnt know it yet,

Now I am trying to receive the refund from Amazon and it keeps getting declined from my bank because the card is no longer active

The card that is no longer active because of Amazon. So now Im having to go back and forth with Amazon and my bank to fix an issue that was not even my fault. 

Amazon is now trying to send me a check instead. But i am also being told they cannot send me a check? this is so frustrating."	6	"[""Throwingshead: There can be glitches with any renewal subscription when cancelling and it's happened with others on Amazon before. Mistakes happen and you kind of cancelled your card prematurely which isn't Amazon's fault and really is your bank's fault if they cancelled it before asking you to confirm the charge with Amazon first. Most major cards have a pause function so if that was possible they should have done that before assuming fraud. You basically yanked Amazon's ability to correct the mistake easily."", 'moonbeam127: Can amazon credit that monthly amount to your amazon account like a gift card?

When they told me they were obligated to cancel I actually asked her not to do that but she basically was like sorry too late which has now fucked me over completely. All I told her was I didn't authorize that charge because well I didn't and then she automatically assumed that meant fraud. I have first financial bank i'm not sure how major of a bank they are.\n\nTrust I was def not trying to make it more difficult on Amazon's part. When I initially thought I resolved the matter I mentioned to the Amazon support that my card was no longer active and asked if that would be an issue.. he told me no, well now here I am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts entirely annoying the bank is refusing to help me now.\n\nI've now talked to at least 4 different amazon support who have just kept telling me they are going to re send the refund to processing after I've told them hey that card youre sending to is inactive.\n\nI go to my bank and they tell me hey they cant do anything about it.\n\nWhat now? my card is cancelled because my bank assumed fraud and amazon wont do anything but refund to that specific card.\n\nIt's so frustrating I am having to do all this back and forth over a glitch\n\nEdit also: One person told me they could send me a check.. but then the next three people after that acted like they did not know what I was talking about when I tried to mention that as an option... has anyone gotten a refund check from amazon?\n\nI just disputed the charge through my bank but who knows if that will be approved. Im at a genuine loss now and can't even afford to lose that money hence why I cancelled my monthly in the first place"", 'chrlsPbac0n: Honestly, I’m surprised they haven’t tried to do that to me. But personally I don’t want Amazon credit especially for something that happened where they took money from me I never authorized. I haven’t used it since Christmas really and have other important things going on in my life that requires that money they took which was a lot for me ($139)', ""Throwingshead: Yea my whole take with this is again that mistakes happen but I would personally be more pissed off at the bank for cancelling the card that fast. Not sure if they have a freeze/ pause feature but usually anything on Amazon subscription wise is easy to get refunded especially if it's within the first 3 business days of a new subscription so it usually can be fixed fairly fast. \n\nIf you didn't authorize the charge and you told them that I would think that would mean that they are going to file a claim against the charge already since it was deemed unauthorized. I think Amazon may be able to issue a check for some instances but that may ultimately depend on the payment method that was originally used.\n\n If you put yourself in Amazon's shoes now it makes sense why they shouldn't issue checks for this because you paid with a credit card and you can now dispute the charge directly with the bank. So if Amazon mails you a check and then you dispute the charge via chargeback with the bank and get refunded through that they may double refund you if you were to then cash the check after the dispute is closed.\n\nFor this case specifically a chargeback is likely the easiest way to handle this if your bank can get their stuff together because it shouldn't be that difficult, but for Amazon I don't see anything they can really do that makes sense.""]"

I tried it:  Ordered 4 items, they arrived in 2 deliveries, my ""try"" period started when the last order arrived (sunday- ugh) I already knew from the first delivery at least one item was going back, ends up 3 are going back.  I log on Monday night to get the return started, all is fine, of course its 2 separate QR codes but whatever. Something needs to be boxed but not labeled. This is getting slightly annoying and the other 2 items just brought to the UPS store.

Usually for returns I immediately get the QR codes in my email.  Those didnt arrive so I 'chatted' with help, 'help' said to wait 4-5 hrs, uhhuh fine whatever, still no QR codes this am.  I ended up taking screen shots so I can return this damn stuff.

The good: the try period of 7 days starts when your last item arrives.

The bad: the hassle of returning all this in multiple boxes, QR codes and now it seems even getting those QR codes is impossible.

[Now, one would assume that the Stoughton USPS is the facility that will receive the package from Amazon and it will be delivered there through Amazon's own delivery network.

Lost_Piccolo_2102	0	112ct6p	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/112ct6p/japanese_account_locked_for_suspicious_activity/	"I wanted to buy some Japanese exclusive Kindle ebooks that are not sold in my region, and the only way was to create an [amazon.co.jp](https://amazon.co.jp) account and fill in the billing info with a random Japanese address and phone number. There doesn't seem to be any other way to buy from Amazon Japan and this is the commonly used method everywhere I ask.

I made some purchases with my credit card and everything was fine, since it was only digital books for Kindle. and the actual physical address didn't matter whatsoever. But around 15 hours later, I wanted to buy another ebook and immediately got logged out. When I logged back in, I couldn't do anything or even access the stuff I already owned. There is a ""suspicious activity"" warning demanding me to put in the fake Japanese address, the phone number and the bank receipts to confirm it's me and not someone else stealing my account and going on a shopping spree.

Is there any way to resolve this with just the bank receipts, or will Amazon actually try to send me a code to the made up number or something, making it impossible to recover the account?

I don't understand what exactly caused it. It wasn't a big amount of money, so maybe it was the amount of individual purchases? They were little 200 yen books, three in a row at the beginning and then a fourth 15 hours later. That one didn't go through and immediately triggered the ""suspicious activity"" thing.

Is there a definitive way to avoid this in the future, in case I have to make another account from scratch? It sucks that I have to fake an address and number in order to buy region locked digital books at all, but once a warning like that is triggered for whatever reason, I lose access to everything because all the contact details are made up by necessity.

In short, does anyone know how to keep this ""suspicious activity"" thing from EVER triggering? Maybe waiting a day or two between purchases? Is that a guarantee?

Thanks."	5	"['glbltvlr: Amazon accounts are common across all Amazon stores. Attempting to create a duplicate account at another store raised flags and caused the lockout you observed.

The stuff I wanted to buy is ultra obscure material from an already obscure author that barely anyone cares about in his home country.

Seems like its all "" + Import Fees apply at checkout. "" from within Canada? (so many foreign sellers now)

Prime says 2 day shipping, but as soon as its purchased, its now 5 or 7 days actual shipping time.

Returns are near impossible with ""foreign sellers"" as they don't fully cover return shipping and is just much more of a hassle. You might get dinged import fees, you might not...

No way of filtering out foreign sellers either...

I bought a ceiling fan just after XMAS. Was $416.00 3 day's later it was 60 bucks cheaper, and now, 3 weeks later it's $140 cheaper. A local shop would honor the price difference, but amazon doesn't.

Maybe it's just time to give up on it?

Packages used to arrive in 1-3 days, now it's ALWAYS 5-9 days, no matter what for the last 6-7 months. I have also noticed they do not use Prime vans to deliver to us anymore, it's always 3rd party services like USPS, FedEx etc, which I assume is why the delivery has tripled in time. When I ask about this, they say they do not have information about that.

I have talked to customer service multiple times, there has been no change. Most recently the supervisor was incredibly dismissive - to which I told them if they don't have a solution then we'll have to cancel. He had no problem with it, so I did. He kept repeating himself about how there's other benefits besides fast shipping, which I thought was odd as that was not the issue.

Has Amazon taken a new stance on dealing with Prime customers? We've always had such a good experience but we're pretty shocked how little they cared about keeping us as a customer.

Amazon looks at their system and sees that they\'ve got the same product from another third party seller sitting in their FL warehouse, and so they\'ll ship that out to them, only giving you the sale. \n\nOn paper, the idea looks good - sending whatever goods are closest, but it assumes that all third party goods are actually what they say they are, and we all know that Amazon is full of any third party scam or fly by night vendor that can get in.', 'nooo82222: Because amazon is all about numbers. They want their workers to produce x amount of packages to ship out', 'diezel_dave: Both of these face mask packages I got were completely sealed and had no sign of tampering so I have to believe the warehouse did it.

No way that's an accident or coincidence."", 'Wills4291: I would call your state attorney generals office.', ""buxzythebeeeeeeee: The thing is, from Amazon's point of view, the intentional wrong-item-return is a super common scam.

That's the logic."", 'bgeerdes: No, the OP said this was shipped and sold by Amazon.

So I was wondering, does amazon jp prime apply to international shipping? And if not, is there a method to lower the cost of the shipping price when using amazon jp? Please tell me anything you may know and have a nice day! Thank you.	2	"[""Throwingshead: No, shipping is expensive especially internationally with customs fee and taxes involved. There is really no way to avoid that. Prime benefits are region specific so you would need to have a delivery address in Japan to use them and prime global shipping only applies to a very select amount of items so manga and or books likely wouldn't apply.""]"

I am so pissed and stressed dealing with this for a few days now, I have been on multiple chats and phone calls, and escalated to their executive customers relations team multiple times for days, and every single time, they say, the original item was not received and no refund will be issued, and this is final and completely refuses to do anything about it and and won't refund me 595, for a product I already returned..

I dropped off the package at UPS on feb1st, the package was weighted and scanned with the item inside, so it had a accurate weight at drop off. I have my receipt for this, I requested amazon to send me photos or videos of what they received, and to check the weight of package vs what i dropped it off at, they refuse, and probably do not have anything like this to provide regardless. But they continue to say I did not return the item when I infact did, I have been a Prime member for over 10 years, and have 100s probably 1000s of orders, and this is the first return this has ever happened with. 

So it seems amazon refuses to do anything, they will not look into this issue, I went back to UPS and talked to the store i dropped the package off at, they said I cannot do anything from my side since this was an Amazon label, and Amazon has to be the one to try and make a claim on the missing product, which apparently amazon doesn't even care to do since this was never an option i even mentioned this to them and they really didn't care, from what i read online my only option is to credit card charge back, which I contacted them and they were very confident that I would be getting my money back with the proof i provided, but then from that comes the possibility of getting my account banned, I have a primary family account which is used by many family members, we have our movies, our music, or photos, books, everything that we payed for saved on our accounts, So i am terrified of getting a ban from what I read online, we use these accounts for personal and business ,so that would suck really bad to lose all this stuff. 

If anyone has any insight, information, and advice how to go at this, please let me know, I have been so stressed and upset with having to deal with this, since it was completely out of my control, whatever happened to my package happened between UPS and Amazon, but im being blamed and theres not much I can do about it from what it looks like."	10	"['Electronic-Fix2851: You’re getting scammed. Simple as that. Somebody in the Amazon processing center saw your item, decided to pocket it, and claim it was the wrong item. It’s happened to me too (although with way cheaper items). You honestly hav Erin go via your credit card company. Amazon, I think, purposely doesn’t take photos of the items it has received, because they know it will create even more work on their end. They expect most buyers to just give up.\n\nYeah, there’s a chance you lose your account. I’ve eaten the cost on a few low value items, as a result. But for something like this, I’d just go to your credit card company.\n\nAgreed with the other poster that UPS can’t do anything here. The tracking data indicates all their involvement, and if that looks good, it is the way it is.', 'Throwingshead: You are misunderstanding the issue based on what you have stated.\n\nAmazon is not saying they did not receive the item you sent back. They are stating that what was sent is not the correct item they believe they sent originally and you sent them the wrong thing back. This is between you and Amazon and not UPS. To prevent this you would have needed to take pictures of the item when received and record the serial numbers and or any other identifiers of the product and make sure they sent the correct item back. This product in particular is a high fraud item so they will be very strict with this if you send them back an opened unit.', 'TheAlmightySkeletor: Start a better business bureau claim and dispute with your bank. After sending in my gpu three days ago and being told that it was there and then wasnt there, being told wait a month and if its not there then wait another month i got fed up and opened a claim, the next morning the refund was processed. 30 days is a joke and to top it off it’s only like this so they can scam you.

Just asking for advice how I should go forward with this."", '2BoraBora: I started one and called my bank. my bank was very confident should have no problem getting money back, but my accounts status is what im worried about afterwards', ""Throwingshead: >i wouldnt be sitting here trying to fight this for nearly a now week if i did have the item still, the only place where this could have got messed up is at UPS or Amazon.\n\n\\*\\*\\*That is not what I am saying you are still not understanding what they are telling you if you still think this is the issue.\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis has nothing to do with UPS so honestly forget they are involved.\n\nAmazon is not telling you that they received an empty box so shipping weights are irrelevant because that's not the issue. Amazon is telling you that the item you returned is not the one they believe they sent, they are not saying you shipped them nothing they are saying you sent them another type of unit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Just asking for advice how I should go forward with this.\n\nPretty much explained this also previously. Basically there is not much you can do at this point but plead with them and create potential doubt in the original item they sent. 99% of this specific type of issue occurs because the item they sent to you was a previous return where the buyer switched out the original unit with another item or identical unit with a different serial code and then ships it back to Amazon resealed so they think it is still good to sell new again since it was seemingly unopened. The best way to fight this would have been to treat it like it had a problem once it arrived and record every product identifier for the unit you actually received so that if something like this comes up you would have some level of proof to support your claim with Amazon."", 'TheAlmightySkeletor: If you’re worried about that start a BBB claim even after processing my refund my account is in good standing condition.

P_Cakes_84	1	10zh1rj	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10zh1rj/if_im_ordering_an_item_around_230am_and_i_have/	"I already completed the order and went with ""Today"" to be safe. My friend and I were thinking that ""Overnight"" might not be as soon as the two times listed under ""Today"".

On the one hand, Overnight times are listed below Today's times and we wonder if it would look any different with us reviewing the order later in the day. I just checked again now and it said the order had to be completed in under 3 hours (by 6am) to get the ""fastest same-day delivery of 2-6pm"". Also, the overnight delivery times are the same price as today's afternoon/evening times. All of that makes me think that choosing overnight 4-8am means delivery of 25-29hrs from now instead of 1-5 hours from now.

On the other hand, it should list tomorrow's date for Overnight if it were not those times of the same day as the order. I looked into this a bit and saw that Amazon does sometimes deliver packages within a few hours. I am in a major city, so it is plausible. I included pics below (ignore the blue highlight over 7-11am).

The last thing I bought on amazon prime was an HDMI splitter on november 18th.  Around this time I also got afflicted with a Flu that lasted until late December. After that, I had a car crash. I wasn't paying much attention to what was happening as I paused my prime account, and saw no reason to check my statements; and being exhausted mentally from consecutive events.

BOY, WAS I WRONG. Somehow, despite even my amazon account page showing no prime charges since July 5th, I was charged:XX#### PURCHASE 11/09 01:55 Amazon Prime\* HB8 Amzn.com/bill WA 00000000 072207. And similar statements each month on the 9th. I finally realized this today when I went to buy something for 40 bucks, thinking I had more than 40 in my bank account, only for it to keep denying me. I look in my account and oh look, 16.08 from an amazon prime purchase yesterday. I haven't even opened the amazon web page to shop since november 18th. How. HOW?  


  
UPDATE for those who ever have this issue and are trying some google fu for a solution in the future: Get ahold of the customer support on the website and open a chat. After some prompts and such, you can chat with a real person. Have them check what accounts are linked to the card, because somehow my father's account was linked to this card. He was having some issues from a really bad diabetes scare in november, and it seems very possible my card was used on accident. Unfortunately, since this means it was a legit purchase, I won't get the money back from Amazon itself, but at least I know what happened, now. tldr; customer support call for seeing what accounts are linked to the card.

Issue resolved.

Overall I buy a ton of stuff from Amazon every week. So every week I make 1-2 returns of small things. Usually under 50$ for couple hundred bucks worth of order. 

This morning I got an email for an item I returned, stating the serial number was wrong. It was in same condition I received. Same item, open box. Working and no cosmetic damages. Reason for returning was because it was Incompatible with my laptop. It’s a 400-500$ item. I replied to the email to appeal because the email said I could. The account specialist gave me a generic reply saying incorrect item was sent. Send in the item for refund. And decision is final that I will not be getting anymore replies. I paid with Amazon gift card too so I couldn’t exactly contact bank. 

I tried Amazon customer service, they couldn’t do anything and got escalated to the manager who basically told me to reply to the email that I was told will not be getting anymore response. The guy typed so fast and left chat. I couldn’t even read the whole message. Very unhappy with the experience. Was also told the item I sent will be disposed when I asked for it back if refund couldn’t be issued. 

What the world is going on? I know economy is bad lately but this is ridiculous. The email I got also said that I tried to return incorrect items repeatedly. This was the first time I heard of this. All my other returns went through no problem. Also after talking to account specialist I got email from customer service saying “sorry you didn’t receive your item”… to file police report and stuff. I never said I never received the item. Issue was not that I didn’t receive my item. It’s that they wouldn’t accept my return or give me back the item and holding my money hostage

Should I go to small claim court? How do I proceed with this? I’m pretty much ready to close my account after using Amazon for many years. This is pretty unacceptable

Update:

It’s been a month so just giving you guys an update on the situation. I gave up on the 400-500$ item that I lost through gift card purchase / return. Was planning to use my recently renewed Amazon prime membership for music and videos but few days after the incident I started to receive email reminders to return items that I already returned over 2 months ago (got return confirmation email of item received and refunded). I went to customer service and was told item received and come back if I do get charged. So I went back the following week after being falsely charged. 20$ item. Just extra from a multiple unit purchase of Christmas gifts. Very small things. I got accused of sending back an empty box. Same thing. No one wants to helps, tells me to return item for refund and ends conversation. In rage I immediately permanently deleted my account. I called bank to dispute and provided evidence. The bank gave me credit back on card immediately and a week later I see on my statement, Amazon provided a refund for it too. Now I got double the amount of 20$. I kind want to call bank to figure out but at the same time I didn’t want bank and Amazon both to uncorrelately reverse that refund. Long story short. Still at loss of the 400-500$ item. I’m going to consider the extra 20$ a small recover of my recently renewed membership and will not be using Amazon anytime soon.

It cost me time and gas to run back and forth to post office but I understand crap happens sometimes when you buy things online. For example, clothes don’t fit properly when you order your usual size. Different brands make them differently. Amazon has a lot of cheap stuff that you can get for 99 cents on eBay. But we all pay a lil more for convenience sometimes and forget about the quality\nAlso please do your research before making assumptions. Amazon sell refurbished and used stuff. There’s a whole section for it.\n\nThis is not a third party sell. This is a sold and full filled by Amazon item. You can “wonder” all you want. Take the side of refund shouldn’t be issued but where’s my item now?\n\nThe point is not about who take advantage of returning or what. It’s taking the returned item and refuse to issue refund and dispose the received item and still keeping the money. Not issuing refund is one thing but just toss a 400-500$ item without communication that is not right. Not only financial losses on my side but if you are worried about wastes and legal logic. It’s just totally wrong from every aspect\n\nAlso don’t confuse Amazon customer service with account specialist. Different department.

I just renewed my membership in beginning of the year, so I was like I’ll just use prime video and music till membership end and delete my account for good. But no, they wouldn’t let me have peace. I bought a lot of stuff over the Chrismas holidays. Talking of thousands of dollars of small items. Due to COVID, it’s a lot easier to shop online than going to line up at stores. Long story short, I bought multiple of same items. Like calendar and stuff. I returned 1 unit of the calendar. Which is 20$. Got notification, item received and refund issued. It was a done deal for a few month. Then after that incident I had, I’m starting to receive return reminder emails. I think someone is messing with me because I ruined their day or something by pushing to figure out the initially disposed 500$ item. Anyways, I went to Amazon and asked about the return reminder. They are like oh don’t worry about it. We got the item. Just haven’t processed yet. If you get charged come back to us. I’m like ok. I’m probably just overthinking. Then of course I got charged and I went back. They said I sent back an empty box. No evidence no nothing. They reversed a refund from 3 months ago and recharged me. There’s another one in a few days. So far I got 2 emails. I got so furious I just deleted my account. I called my bank to dispute because this is a matter of principle to me. I’m very positive that I’ll get that 20$ back. Not that the money matter. I got evidence of the conversation and everything. But I hope they won’t start like a wave of returns from all my years and then some how generate enough crap to send to a credit collection. I am financially stable. I don’t need to scam Amazon for small time items, like returning a box of 1 unit out of many i purchased.

1676029770.0	10-Feb-2023 03:49:30	Supervisor hung up on me, what do I do?	RecognitionEvening98	2	10yq0m4	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10yq0m4/supervisor_hung_up_on_me_what_do_i_do/	"This is one of the first times I've chased an issue to this extent. An item advertised as a prime item, a £90-ish pair of Sony headphones, which I ordered on the 3rd of January. The estimated delivery time I got was 17th of Jan - 14th of Feb, given the fact it's Friday the 10th and the item hasn't even been dispatched, I think it's unlikely I will recieve them by Tuesday. 

What irks me is that Amazon has readvertised the item with a far sooner estimated delivery date. I will have wasted nearly a month and half waiting for an item I pretty much use everyday. Since Amazon is the one who advertises items as 'Prime' and NOT the manufacturer (Sony), this seems to be an issue on their end. Upon ringing, being transferred 3 times (first 2 colleagues were fine) the supervisor told me that there was nothing I could do but wait, before I could ask whether it would be best to do this or cancel and replace the order, she spoke over me 'I'm going to hang up' and then cut me of practically mid sentence. I was naturally annoyed at the fact I've been waiting this long for my item to arrive, but I was in no way rude. Would never raise my voice or swear or anything like that as I've worked in customer services myself and know what it's like to deal with the dreaded 'Karens'. 

Additionally, she told me that there was no email associated with my account, but that I would be sent a feedback form. Hilarious.

TLDR: I asked questions about the status of my order, was told that the people who should know had no idea, talked over, and hung up on. I hate complaining, but should I call another department? Is there even another department who deals with this thing? I just want my 'prime' Sony headphones I order nearly a month and a half ago..."	8	"[""IndiaEvans: That's absurd.

They also use third party carriers to ship products, often and especially when, shipping *to* outside of the US, *from* inside the US.

Next, there are FOUR days left before the end of the delivery window closes. I don’t know how you can assume it’s unlikely to get there when we are still four days to go. You don’t even know where the product actually is. It could be at the final mile logistics company right now. We don’t know. And finally, you CAN cancel and reorder right now. Go for it if you believe that’s the best opportunity. \n\nThe reality is, I do feel for you. While it’s not exactly the same thing, I HATE when I can see something available to me currently for a cheaper price than what I paid when I ordered it yesterday. It sucks. When that happens, I usually cancel and reorder (or send it back and order again at the new price.) Your item truly may not get there on time. It’s your choice to cancel and reorder or not. But that doesn’t at all change the fact that they are still within their delivery window and there’s not much they can - nor need to - do about it.']"

Can\'t get out of the house? Realize you forgot to pick up something? With FREE Two-Day Shipping from Amazon Prime, your shopping problems are solved. You get unlimited deliveries with no minimum order size, and with 20 million eligible items, the options are practically limitless. From big to small, A to Z, home to office, and everywhere in between, satisfying that shopping itch (or need) is just two days away. Prime members also get FREE Same-Day Delivery on over a million items when shipping to selected metro areas across the US.  \n>  \n>Learn more about all the Prime shipping options\n\nNow ordinarly I\'d say the apologists were right, particularly with their current emphasis on pointing out that nowadays it means 2 day shipping from the time the order is dispatched. But these parts here:\n\n>*Need a last minute gift?*  \n*Realize you forgot to pick up something?*  \n*satisfying that shopping itch (or need) is just two days away*\n\nis definitely indicative that the deal was originally 2-days from time of order. Plain and simple. Not 2 days plus however long it takes us to ship. Two days away.\n\nIn fact, they sold this to people for years, even in 2018 they were selling it with the language:\n\n>*""Get your order in two days or faster.""*\n\nSo there\'s no misinterpretation on our part. The deal was very clearly two days from the time you placed your order. It was part of the offer itself. 100%.\n\nIf that\'s not the intended way for it to be meant, then that\'s just simply false advertising because any reasonable consumer is going to see it that way.\n\nAdditionally, if they aren\'t pushing that you\'d have it in 2 days, then it\'s not a selling point. There\'s nothing special about ""You\'ll have it 2 days from when we ship it. We may take 10 days to ship it.""\n\nThis was clearly the intent. You order it, you have it in two days.\n\nAnd finally, this here when you follow the link that says ""Learn more about all the Prime shipping options:\n\n>*If the item you\'re ordering is out of stock or unavailable to ship immediately, the shipping method time starts when the item ships. For example, it will take two business days after an item ships to reach you with Two-Day Shipping.*\n\nThat is saying that you can expect your delivery two days from the time you place the order, unless it\'s out of stock or unavailable to ship immediately. It\'s literally an If/Then statement.  \n""If the item is not in stock or can\'t ship immediately, then it\'s 2 days from the time it ships.""\n\nI\'ve even had someone try to tell me ""See, it says \'For example, it will take two business days after an item ships to reach you with Two-Day Shipping.\' so that means that applied to everything!"" disregarding the basic If/Then element that is literally saying that everything ships same day with 2 day shipping unless it\'s out of stock or for some reason can\'t ship same day.\n\nWe were specifically told and sold the deal in the agreements that Two Day Shipping actually meant two days from the time you placed your order. This only didn\'t apply if the item was out of stock (as marked on the item page) or was unavailable to ship immediately (also was on the item page). Otherwise, it\'s very clearly stating that the two day shipping starts immediately.\n\nThey may have changed terms since then, but for god knows how many people, they literally sold it to us as 2 day shipping from the time you placed your order.\n\nAnd frankly I have looked through all of my emails and haven\'t once seen an email from Amazon telling me they were making a change to the Two Day Shipping benefit to remove that very valuable sales point that sold it to me and god knows how many others who joined Prime for it. But they\'ve certainly made me pay more for it with membership fee increases, haven\'t they?

If they don\'t advise us of changes, how do we even know to cancel our subscription? Automatically renewing something with no notification of changes that affect the perceived value does not mean we agreed to the changes that we knew nothing about.

With shipping involved there is some unknown potential for things to go wrong in shipping but to prove it was sent faulty you would need to build evidence of that. \n\nThere are details that would be needed to understand things further but as its stated the return reasoning would play a big part in the claim eligibility and Amazon does protect you if you returned the item with the correct claim status and they side with you. If you feel you should have received a full refund you can file an a to z for the rest of the refund amount. Whether or not that is awarded it up to the investigator. Sellers can't pull this often and there is no real point to do that intentionally. Sellers will usually only charge a restocking fee if the return is out of policy or they are very sure the item sent back was not in the condition they sent it in because there are significant risks involved that would easily outweigh an $85 restocking fee. \n\nYou should be able to contact Amazon or start an A to Z claim for the remaining refund you feel is necessary but with that claim nothing is 100% guaranteed."", ""IndiaEvans: Document everything.

That means they saw the item as it was, and shipped it anyway. If it looked damaged to them and used at the time, idk why they sent it.\n\nCondition can be subjective. What the manufacturer considers as ""new"" is usually not what a customer would consider ""new"". It could be a blatant overlooking by the seller but new products purchased from a manufacturer don\'t always arrive in perfect condition since shipping tends to be a rough environment for products. Obviously there is a limit to how damaged something can be but maintaining a pristine condition for an item when shipping is involved is not always easy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So either they’re lying about inspecting it, or someone opened the shipped package and fiddles with it. Doubt the latter, so leaves the former.\n\nMost of Amazon is a volume game so inspecting items is usually very fast so things can be missed, and mistakes happen. If the seller is actually charging a restocking fee and sticking to their belief then there is a decent chance that they truly believed the item was sent in the correct condition. Restocking fees usually carry a lot of risk for a seller to impose so most won\'t do it unless they feel they are absolutely in the right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As far as plastic goes, all of the manga box sets ive ever received from stores or amazon have had plastic wrap around the box to prevent anyone opening them and reading the manga or taking them. This was the first time I’ve received a manga set in this bad condition.\n\nAnything purchased that is fulfilled by Amazon will likely have some sort of protection to keep the item together since everything must be ""warehouse ready"" so plastic wrap whether done by a seller or coming that way from the factory would likely be present for those orders because of that requirement. Items coming direct from another source may not because that additional requirement is not necessary since it\'s not going to a busy warehouse. Condition of the item is one thing but the lack of plastic still wouldn\'t necessarily point to condition depreciation. Imported items have a much higher chance of being received without any plastic because of the shipping process if the manufacturer even sealed it with such.', 'LearnDifferenceBot: Bye ImpossibleMagician87.

Very difficult question apparently for ESL Amazon's Customer Support Team to decipher, lol.

Would you know if you choose gift card balance, does it stay that way? Like, if I chose gift card balance because I wanted the balance available more quickly, and THEN I decide to return the items that I purchased with gift card balance back to Amazon, would I still be able to choose credit card balance at that point in time(?), or is it not retroactive like that? Hopefully that made sense, lol...

Again, If I choose gift card balance, is it forever stuck to gift card balance or I can return something that I purchased with gift card balance and since I don't want to keep the item yet again, choose credit card balance instead..?

(\*I'm testing out true wireless earbuds, fit + comfort + proper seal, etc., so I'm likely only going to keep one model and return all the rest. So, hence why I'm trying to pool my resources together almost immediately so I can batch order another 5-10 models, test them, then return all the others with poor fit geometry, essentially I just don't want to have to wait 1-2 weeks to get my ROI.

There’s only one gift card balance.  You can’t designate funds for one child and funds for another child within your Amazon account.  You’d have to keep track of what’s spent on each child on a piece of paper or spreadsheet or something like that.  Since a purchase would be bought through your Amazon Prime account, then Prime shipping would apply if the item is eligible for Prime shipping,', 'corinne822: Thank you.

Looking through my emails I can only see, in the past 3 months, 2 parcels that have gone missing.

I got this today after not receiving a parcel I apparently should have gotten during the week, but honestly forgot I ordered. I was told by the rep that my 'refund was issued' but I'm guessing that was a lie, as I haven't had any confirmation and instead had this. It says that ""As a result, we can no longer compensate you for any additional issues with your shipments."" Does this just refer to if I loose a parcel?

You have to ask for them to ship the product in Amazon packaging, or they'll ship it in the original package.

It seems now if you order a single item they won't box it or put in a shipping envelope. Everyone will see what you've ordered, and it won't have any protective packaging. Not even a shopping bag.

Update: This used to be applied only to boxed items that were packaged for shipment, such as many TVs. But now they're applying it to everything that comes in some kind of container, even if all the container is is a plastic sleeve with a zipper. This is what's new.

I ordered some decor for my home and it was delivered to the wrong house. Amazon refunded me and I placed the order again and included very specific instructions to get to my house. Some of the packages were again misdelivered even though Amazon told me the issue had been fixed. I was confused because of the fact some have made it just fine while others are not. 

I went to the house they were delivered to (which is 2 miles from my house) and asked if they had them. They claimed they never did, though I don’t really believe that. Anyway, I contacted Amazon today told them I have photos of the packages at the wrong house and that the pin showing my location is wrong even though the address is right. They said no refund or replacement would be given because their tracking shows it went to the correct location. I said that must be because the pin is wrong, but he told me it is right.

After thinking about it for a while, I realized there is little I actually get out of the service. 

Plus, there has been quite a few changes recently:

* Prime cost increase
* Removal of Amazon smile
* No free shipping on grocery orders
* Two day shipping is gone, and now everybody gets the same shipping on orders over $35 (unsure about same day, but doesn't matter much)

Looking at the other features, idk if it is worth:

* Prime gaming is meh and useless if you aren't a gamer
* Prime music is awful. Amazon music unlimited is okay at best as it is
* Whole foods discount doesn't even apply to all items, and how many of us shop at whole foods?
* Amazon is flooded with cheap aliexpress items. It is hard to even sort through most products to find something quality.
* With everything so expensive nowadays, hitting $35 for free two day shipping really isn't too hard, eliminating a lot of the need for the free shipping benefit

The two main benefits I see worth maintaining a prime sub is the prime card for 5% cashback, and prime video, but that just isn't worth the soon to be $15 a month for me.

So what benefits keep you on prime?"	75	"['Laura9624: Shipping is still good and convenient for us. Large household so cheaper per person.  I like the Kindle benefits.

Any help?	machu_peechute	1	10qyufd	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10qyufd/amazon_wont_replace_600_bladeless_fan_i_bought_on/	"Hoping I could get some help here, as I spoke all the way up to a ""supervisor"" last night and they only said they couldn't offer a replacement, with no explanation. Just that the system would only allow returns. I bought an LG Aerofan air purifier that came in last night. It was shipped via UPS through Amazon. I opened the box before noticing the damage on the side. As I set up the fan, I noticed a dent on the lower back of the fan. Looked at the box and the damage lines up. Plugged the fan in and everything works except the rotation motor; just clicks and rocks like it's missing teeth in the gear. And the contamination sensor is all over the place, and resets itself to 999 everytime it gets to moderate, kicking the fan into overdrive. I bought the fan on sale for $300, and now it's back up to the $5-600 range five days later. Not sure why i get hassled on a $30 knife magnet or a $600 fan everytime something is wrong, but people are always talking about Amazon telling them to keep $1500 graphics cards. To be clear, I'm not looking for a freebie. I'll gladly return the old one, but I really want the fan, and I don't want to refund it just to turn around and spend an extra $300 for a replacement. And the only return option is UPS pickup at home, when I'm not there. I'm going to try chat or calling today during normal business hours to see if I can make anymore progress. But any extra tips or help would be appreciated.


UPDATE: Thanks for all the suggestions!  I spoke with their CS through chat during normal hours. They said they couldn't replace as the sale ended, but they're letting me keep the old one and credited sale price to my credit card to use as a discount towards a full-priced replacement. Now to find a place in Colorado that can repair LG fans so the bad motor isn't a fire hazard."	8	"[""Throwingshead: If the sale has ended they can't send another at that price.

On 1/20/2023 I decided to open a chargeback against eGift card $100 to save part of hold founds

Today 2/1/2023 received email:

How they removed access to my account 4 days before I decide to open a chargeback?

Amazon has the great ""feature"" of only allowing me a ""UPS pickup"" option instead of bringing it to a UPS store or UPS drop off point. 

How exactly is this supposed to make things easier for the customer? You have to worry about when the driver will show up (which they never do most of the time and you'll randomly find the return label in your mailbox or left at the conceirge, and no one tells you, or the UPS driver doesn't even leave the label so you have to spend a whole second day trying to coordinate and worry about when the guys is going to show up.

Each time they did, they apparently rolled up, looked around, and left without contacting me. I called them and they indicated I should just leave it on the street. I told them how crazy it was, but it was all they could offer. This was a $1000 return. So I contacted Amazon. They said UPS pick up was the only way because of “security” reasons. I told them how crazy it was, but they insisted. \n\nSo took screenshots of all the conversations (in case it got stolen and I needed to do a cc chargeback) and put the box out there.

Ups never comes in time here either — took 2 days and an irate call for them to finally show up at 730 in the evening. \nAmazon support told me they think it might be because of the value of the items…both were around $100.

CJ_Southworth	0	10q8iod	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10q8iod/amazon_keeps_getting_more_and_more_bizarre_were/	"Over the weekend, I came across a deal on season 3 of Titans that I couldn't pass up ($14, free shipping, new).  I ordered immediately.  Later on, since I was on the app already and, even though I am trying very hard to kick my Amazon habit, I noticed that a number of items on my wishlist were also showing dramatically reduced prices (also $14, free shipping). I thought it might be some sort of flash sale or something, so I added some of the items to my cart.  When I went to the cart to check out, some of the items were missing.  I re-added them, and they disappeared again.  Finally, I gave up and just emptied the cart.

Cut to today, and I have one email telling me that Season 3 of Titans has shipped, but there is no tracking number.  A few hours later, I have another email saying the order has been cancelled and refunded with no reasoning.  But in my account, it still shows it as having shipped.  

Were they hacked by someone who changed prices?  Was there an error in the system that they aren't acknowledging?  I have no idea if the blu ray set is going to show up or not, but if the company was hacked, that should be something customers are made aware of, yes?  At the very least, I'd like something in the way of an explanation as to why the order was cancelled if it was cancelled.  

Honestly, it's becoming difficult to even shop on there anymore.  Many of the items I search for (I mostly order physical movies and music) only come up with weird search terms.  For instance, when I was looking for The Menu, it wouldn't come up no matter what I typed in.  I finally accessed the listing by going through a review site that linked to it, and it turned out it only came up on a search if you typed ""The Menu Feature Film.""

1675180938.0	31-Jan-2023 08:02:18	After a week of no updates, Amazon says UPS finally picked up my package, except UPS says they never did. What’s going on?	chrixar	1	10q2qsi	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10q2qsi/after_a_week_of_no_updates_amazon_says_ups/	"I ordered a camera on Amazon last Monday, and made sure it was being shipped and sold by Amazon. At the time the prime delivery was Thursday. Thursday came and went and there was never any update and the item never shipped. I messaged Amazon and they said to wait 48hrs. On Saturday I message them again after no updates, but this time they said it would be shipping next day air via UPS with a delivery of Tuesday (today). Tracking updates on Sunday with UPS that a label was made, and Amazon’s tracking says “package picked up by carrier.” The shipping address on UPS is a fulfillment center 10 miles from my house, but it still says next day air.

Now it’s Tuesday, and nothing has updated since then. When I talked to Amazon they said it was picked up Sunday, but when I talk to UPS they said they’re still waiting for it and to open an investigation. I’m now stuck in limbo until Friday, which is when Amazon says they can look into it again. 

After hearing buying/returning horror stories on other websites, I decided to go this route to avoid any issues, but I guess this is the last time I use prime for something like this again."	2	['Throwingshead: Shipping issues can happen on any order from any company. It happens everyday. UPS is very strict with that service level specifically and if a driver accidentally puts that package in with normal ground packages it can get mixed up very easily since all air service is usually handled separately within the UPS center it arrives at. Prime is telling you they scanned and released this to the carrier but the carrier may have misplaced this and not scanned it in their system properly but all of that is pretty much in front of you and you have no liability concern right now other than a delay so it is not a Prime specific thing since this could happen again to any company when a package gets fumbled.', 'chrixar: Thanks for the info! That’s actually super helpful. I was trying to understand that process but UPS wasn’t really able to tell me anything. We’ll just have to see what happens.']

1675175701.0	31-Jan-2023 06:35:01	Has Amazon Prime customer service become incoherent? Or just me?	Supawoo	28	10q0l28	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10q0l28/has_amazon_prime_customer_service_become/	"I feel like amazon CS has progressively become less coherent lately. Two examples of recent interactions:

My account had been hacked, and the hackers requested a gift card balance refund on an order, totalling around $200. When I secured my account, I chatted AND called them, explaining that I was hacked and don't need the $200 gift card balance. Their response was ""Yes, the refund was issued already"". Me: ""again, I was hacked, order is fine, I don't actually need the refund"", CS: ""The full refund was issued and is reflected in your gift card balance"", Me: ""I understand, BUT I DONT NEED IT, I WAS HACKED, IM TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE MONEY BACK"". They eventually removed $150 of the balance, but left me with $50 in gift card balance for some reason, saying there's nothing they could do about the remaining $50. Fine. Lol.

This week, I had three orders delayed in shipping on Amazon's end. I let them know that USPS had not received the package, even after the guaranteed delivery dates. Their reply: "" I understand, we always give the carrier a chance to deliver it to you"", me frustratedly: ""again it's not the carrier, they have not received the packed from Amazon. Should I just charge back the purchase on my card and keep the items if they actually arrived since delivery date is showing as unknown?"", CS: ""Yes, that is correct"", me: ""So you're saying it's alright with you if I charge back the amounts from these three orders (gives me my money back) and just keep the packages?"", CS: ""Yes, I assured you we will take care of this. And regarding the money, you won't get charged for it.""

Ooooookay, your losses Amazon, lol.

Edit: corrected their response in paragraph 1.

Update: they refunded all three orders from example 2 since the rep prior was a goofy. And let me keep the items."	25	"[""diezel_dave: Most of the time I chat with them, I wonder if I'm talking to a really bad chat AI or if I'm have a stroke.

Received the order, and it was all fine, the package was a teared, we could see the inside. Opened it and had the CPU and the makeup kit. We can check the cpu from the outside, the seal was not broken but the CPU inside said 3700 not 5800. I opened Amazon and informed it was the wrong item, they scheduled the pickup and was All good. They received the order and didn't sent me a new one neither the refund. Later I got and email saying the item was different from the one they sent... Yeah the item really was different also from the one I bought. 
Now they refuse to communicate with me, and say I need to return the right item. What Iam supposed to do ? 
I returned what I got... Iam really mad about this, it was 300€ and right now I have nothing.

It\'s not possible to track a package since the system doesn\'t know when that specific item will be shipped in a specific consolidation box ahead of time.\n\nSometimes the tracking was updated so a customer could ""track"" the shown but more often than not, it wouldn\'t update and just say label created.

I’ve also noticed there’s variation of speed at which refund is processed for the level of price. I’ve noticed things under $10 usually get processed the day of delivery. $10-20 it’ll get processed after 1 day. If it’s up to $50 it’ll take 2-3 days. If it’s $50-100 it’ll take guaranteed up to a whole week after delivery. If it’s $100-200 it’ll take guaranteed 2-3 weeks to process after delivery. I haven’t bought anything above $200 that I’ve had to return so I don’t know how long that’ll take. So it’s always best to watch out for your transactions and contact cs after a week of delivery not getting a refund as i think if they see you’re keeping a tight look out they’ll be more prompt.', 'Mundane-Performer433: Good call.

I attempted to order 2 items, one arriving Tuesday with 2 day Prime shipping, and one arriving Friday. Upon checkout Amazon forced the shipping date to Friday with NO other options presented like they would usually do to allow both items to arrive separately. I had to work around this by placing two separate orders. 

The next day, my wife attempted to purchase an item via Buy It Now, the estimate showed Tuesday on the page, but it was forced to Wednesday when using the Buy It Now option. She had to actually add it to the cart, and manually change the date back to Tuesday for delivery. 

Unfortunately, it seems Amazon continues to make it more and more difficult for us to get the service we're advertised.

Iam a amazon.es user and buyer since 2018. Do orders all the time no issues at all.

2 weeks ago I bought a CPU to gift my brother. He is building a new computer, and got him the Ryzen 5800 3d.  In the same order I had a makeup kit ( for kids) and was all sent together.

Received the order, and it was all fine, the package was a teared, we could see the inside. Opened it and had the CPU and the makeup kit. We can check the cpu from the outside, the seal was not broken but the CPU inside said 3700 not 5800. I opened Amazon and informed it was the wrong item, they scheduled the pickup and was All good. They received the order and didn't sent me a new one neither the refund. Later I got and email saying the item was different from the one they sent... Yeah the item really was different also from the one I bought. 
Now they refuse to communicate with me, and say I need to return the right item. What Iam supposed to do ? 
I returned what I got... Iam really mad about this, it was 300€ and right now I have nothing.


I found on Reddit that this is not the first time happening this kind of stuff.

I remember last time HBO licensed some of their series it was the last time those deals were being done because HBO Max was already on the horizon.

Amazon fire has a 25% share of the streaming market, and is setup to very conveniently allow access to third party streaming system.  Point is that if Amazon doesnt list your streaming service, you won't have a streaming service for very much longer.   \n\nThis gives Amazon the power to dictate the terms of any contract they sign with any streaming service.  Therefore, if they wanted to, Amazon could have demanded a provision in the HBO contract that properties that existed on Amazon at the time a Prime member signed on would be retained for that prime customer.  It wouldn't be a difficult thing to code up either.   \n\nIt would have demonstrated loyalty to their early adopting Prime user base, esp given that one of the biggest selling points in early Prime was access to HBO shows.   \n\nNow I am not saying that they are required to show loyalty to longtime users or even considered a provision like this.

New bank accounts get the new toaster.   \n\nNow, economically it may not make sense to show love to your long time customers.

Does a streaming service live or die by being featured on it? Probably not. Is Amazon’s Fire devices reach bigger than Apples with billions of devices activated and Apple customers historically and still spend more money than Android customers? And if you go to Android then we can start with Samsung and work our way down for customer reach. On the streaming side as far as impact on other streaming platforms success I wouldn’t say Amazon is the most important. They certainly are in the upper echelon for what companies have the most total value though. \n\nAs far as HBO and or HBO Max not burning up the charts as far as customer base. At this point it’s a much bigger picture. Initially you would be looking at Warner Brothers as a whole as they owned them both. And now with the merger you’re looking at Discovery. At one point Discovery was considering folding HBO Max into its Discovery+ service, as bonkers as that sounds. \n\nAt this point just about any company that has its own streaming service will be bringing content they own to it to add value. If they haven’t already then certainly once existing deals come to an end. Logically it just wouldn’t make sense to keep renting your titles to a competing service cause you’re shooting yourself in the foot. \n\nI agree it would be great if a service kept titles they had when you signed up. Cause it’s a pain in the ass having to subscribe to so many streaming services to be able to have access to everything you might want to consume. Apple with select movies does a rotation now. With the Apple TV+ subscription. Something that started in the last few months but generally there is now 5-10 movies that they don’t own that are included with the service for a limited time.']"

amazon locked my account - without any reason; in the email it was state just account is locked. I tried to contact their customer support via phone/email - they constantly lying and cheating - and saying its responsibility of security team and that there is no email/phone to that team. Basically i am constantly receiving emails that i have no wait/ then no response, operator on the phone verified me, was talking about some ticket etc no response just lying / cheating with no action.

I sent them email with art 15 GDPR request, these morons posted me usb-stick with all my data / orders / even voice recordings from phone calls etc.

But still - account is locked - and I am not able to see how to force unlock. I never thought how amazon is just a group of liars and cheaters - and apparently they do that intentionally as per some internal guidelines.

&#x200B;

Apart of the above mentioned I had \~ 400eur in gift cards loaded on my account. The GDPR dump contains pdf where is track of all gift cards top ups and there is a column  lockedOrSuspended ; no card has True within that column.

&#x200B;

Any idea? I am serious desperate here - as I said amazon personnel - even the phone calls are recorded is laying constantly - and there is apparently no contact/ anyone where I can further escalate it.

I was using account since 2015 - many orders were paid with my debit/credit card so i really dont understand such an behavior/ how can one company steal money from customers and remove access to my orders/data in general - and there is no escalation point ... nothing.

Thanks"	1	[]

I recently tried Amazon’s Try Before You buy option on six bras. Three didn’t fit and I laughed hysterically at the other three. They most definitely weren’t going to fit. Everything had the tags, worn for all of 30 seconds, and put back in the original packaging. Returned them the next day and got confirmation that said they were returned. That was in November. 

Last week I got an email saying the items arrived damaged and they would be charging me later this week. I’ve talked to Customer service five times now. Including the two hour conversation I just had. All they say is that they were damaged and I’m being charged. No one knows in what ways they were damaged and they don’t return damaged items. I’m being charged (putting my account in the negative) for items that I returned two months ago with no proof of damage and I can’t have the items back. 

None of this makes sense. Looking online this seems to happen a fair amount with bras in particular. People are getting told the exact things I am. This was my first time trying bras with Amazon and it’s certainly my last. Just wanted to give a cautious heads up to anyone thinking about Amazon. Also, if anyone has any help ideas.

But, out of the literal number of  19 calls I have had to deal with this:  


They could not help me,  either saying that the account is locked and no one can access it, only to get an email the same day saying the password has been changed.  


Verified my information to remove two factors, and when it try to sign in, guess what, account was locked.  


Was told to make a new account and delete it, did not work,  


Was told that I would be getting messaged to be helped by fraud or another account. Nope, did not work, and never got a message back from those higher-ups.  


My information is perpetually at risk and Amazon, with their multi-billion dollars is just shrugging this off...or will straight up lie to me or not even know how to approach this.

My use of prime escalated during the pandemic and Wally has upped their online & shipping services.

Over the 15+ years of my membership, returns and customer support have become less convenient.  The ease of returns declined when they started forcing me to go to either Whole Foods or the UPS store which is the next block over from Whole Foods.   Neither shipping location is convenient to my home.  It used to be easy to open a chat window with customer service but over the last few years, doing so has become an archaeological dig in their nested links.  It feels as if their goal is to avoid direct interaction with customers unless they're on the receiving end of a financial transaction.

The last return I had to contact CSR to get the refund manually because it was showing as received in the tracking and it had already been a week... and now again I returned another case and it was scanned but not received yet.  But I usually get an email from Amazon saying my refund was issued the next day.  Has this happened to anyone, could there be something up with my account?  I used to use a family members prime account and they have a massive purchase history (more than 20k most likely - shopping addict) but also a lot of returns over the years (definitely not anywhere near close to the amount purchased, the hoards in my house can prove it), I decided to get my own prime on my account about 3 months ago so it's still pretty new (the prime, not the account itself), but it's the same address and names on the accounts.  I've heard horror stories of people getting banned from doing too many returns, so I'm paranoid.  I'm going to stop returning from now on and just get stuff from other places unless I'm 100% sure of the item."	4	"['LetsPlayItGrant: Their new return policy is that you have to wait up to 30 days after they receive it.

StampinHannah	1	10l48k6	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10l48k6/were_sorry_we_cannot_ship_your_order_to_your/	"I'm located in Washington state (lower-48, USA) and have ordered a product without any issues from several other companies/websites in the past (Wal-Mart, Target, Staples, etc.) but for some reason, Amazon is saying they can't ship the item to my address?  Anyone else have this issue?

I'm trying to get Clorox wipes, but no matter what style/variety of Clorox wipes I choose (Lemon vs. Fresh vs. one of the ""Scentiva"" scents, or individual packs vs. 75-ct containers vs. the big 700-ct bucket/tub), or what seller the item is coming from (direct from Amazon or from third-party sellers), I keep getting the same error message.  I've reviewed all of Amazon's FAQs under the ""Shipping and Delivery"" section, including their more detailed ""Shipping Restrictions"" sections and none of the bullet points or potential scenarios they have referenced in any of those FAQ sections applies to my address or to the product.

* My shipping address is a street address (not a PO box).
* I live in a reasonably populated area (along the I-5 corridor, I can get to I-5 from my house in five minutes, and can get to either Bellingham or to the Canadian border in around 10-15 minutes, depending on traffic, trains, etc.). 
* We get literally EVERYTHING else from Amazon without any issues or trouble at all (lithium batteries? yep.  other chemicals/shop supplies? also yes.  liquids ranging from fabric softener to cases of energy drinks? again, yes.). 
* Additionally, I know it's not any kind of state/regional/local restriction on the items themselves, because I've been ordering these from aforementioned other companies/websites (mostly from Wal-Mart, because they're usually the least expensive, but occasionally from Staples, Office Depot / Office Max, Target, etc.) without any issues at all.
* In fact, to further illustrate that it's not any kind of product restriction, I can order ANY of the other Clorox products out there without getting this error message.  Whole bottles of bleach? Yes.  Multi-packs of spray cleaners? Yep.  Wet mop pads, toilet bowl cleaners, pool chemical tablets? All of them, yes.  It's ONLY the wipes that produces this error message.  Like, what?
* Lastly, I also tried shipping them to my work address, which has a different zip code, so I know it's not just a glitch with my specific zip code, since the error message shows up for my work address as well.

I just want to get them onto one of my Subscribe & Save orders so I don't have to keep track of how many I have left at home, and then also remember to place a separate order for them, which then means I end up spending more money at these other websites that I wouldn't have spent otherwise (either on shipping costs, or to get other items to get free shipping - either way, it's money I wouldn't be spending if I could just get them from Amazon along with all of my other household stuff).

The first time I encountered this error message on Amazon's site was probably around a year ago, and while I know many retailers put restrictions on certain items during the height of C-19, this was after vaccinations were widely available and (as I mentioned above) I was able to purchase/receive them from several other places.  I chatted with Amazon inquiring about the error message at that time, and was told they were going to look into it since that particular agent wasn't sure what the problem would have been.  They said they'd put a ticket in and to check back after a couple of days - but my brain was already somewhere else, and I never did get around to trying to order these from Amazon again...Until just earlier today, when I ran into the same error messages as before.

The rep I chatted with this time told me they weren't able to give me any kind of ticket number due to ""Security Reasons"", but they assured me that the ticket had been 'escalated' and that I could check back after 48 hours for an update.  They gave me a $10 credit (unprompted, but Bezos can afford it, so I didn't turn it down) for the inconvenience...but I'm gonna be honest and say that I'm not particularly optimistic that it's actually going to get resolved.

So, has anyone else been experiencing this same problem for items &/or address that shouldn't be an issue? Or is it just some weird glitch with my account specifically?  Halp?"	11	"[""NotNow_NotEver_: I see 3 options:\n\n- it's a bug and needs to be fixed\n\n- they don't have those items nearby or can't ship them within reasonable cost\n\n- the package weight is too heavy for drivers to handle\n\nIt's understandable because a regular city delivery already costs Amazon $10-$20 to deliver, and if it's a heavy item to the countryside, Amazon's costs could easily come up to $40 for a package."", 'gr8teeth: The next time you get this error, especially cannot be delivered to the address listed, ask that your question be escalated to the representative at the delivery station.

I don't think Amazon cares \\*which\\* of their warehouses something is in, as long as it's in \\*a\\* warehouse they'll ship it.\n\nPackage weight is also obviously not an issue, because we get MUCH heavier items/packages without any issue at all - If they can deliver 40lb (and 26lb) boxes of cat litter, or 24-can flats of 16oz energy drinks, or multi-pack gallons of windshield washer fluid, I can't see any logical/reasonable/understandable reason why they couldn't also deliver a package of Clorox wipes.\n\nAs far as the difference between a city vs. 'countryside' delivery, I'd say we're more suburban than 'countryside' where we're located.

It was a bit overpriced, but I needed a CPU and upon installing it I started getting a lot more BSOD and other issues. I went to the entire troubleshooting gamut and determined it was the new CPU. I decided to get a 5600G since it was about the same price as well as being little faster. Normally with Amazon returns, I drop the item off and few hours later I get an advanced return back to my card. I decided to go with Store Credit, since I was planning to get the new CPU from Amazon and wanted to have it before the end of the week. 

I dropped it off yesterday afternoon at my local UPS store and they gave me a confirmation receipt. I still haven't gotten anything from Amazon. I reached out to the useless chat this morning and they basically read out company policy that it takes 14 days for a return. And I understand that the advanced returns don't always happen, I asked the chat if they could just change my refund type back to the card, and they said they can't. Nor can they even confirm that they are seeing it on there end.

So now I have 2 concerns. 1. The item got lost by the UPS store and 2. It's going to take 2 weeks to get a refund and then it will take time to get a new CPU. Also I've noticed AM4 CPUs frequently coming in and out stock on Amazon, so they might not have it in stock by the time I get my refund. And I'll be without the computer for 2 weeks.

I tried em out for a while and decided that it wasn't worth the money that I had spent on them. So after about a week or two of owning them, I talked to an Amazon support agent and they said I was good to return it. I was doing another refund somewhere else at the same time and unfortunately switched up the labels on the packages. I didn't find this out until contacting support multiple times and repeatedly getting the same answer of ""wrong or counterfeit item returned."" I asked if I could receive the item back and they said that this wouldn't be possible. Understandable considering the volume of returns. I talk to another support person and they say that I can make another return of the correct item. They then scheduled a UPS pick up time without telling me and I have to impromptu pack it and give it to the person.(very annoying) The item was returned to the refund facility around mid October and I talk to support who say it can take awhile to refund. So I wait about two weeks, checking in periodically, and get no refund. I then contact support who tell me that I have to wait like 30 more days and if I haven't received anything by then, to contact again about a manual refund. After 30 days, nothing. So I contact them again, and the rep has the fucking balls to tell me, ""We stopped doing manual refunds a few weeks ago,"" and that since it had been over a certain amount of time, they couldn't do anything. Over the past few months, I've been calling and emailing support lines but have heard the same myriad of excuses multiple times. Its always some version of, ""its been too long,"" ""I can escalate this to another department,"" ""there's nothing I can do,""(followed by getting hung up on) or ""Contact the carrier,"" even though I have and we both agree it is an Amazon problem. Its especially annoying having to explain to reps that I have made a second return and that I know the first one was incorrect. The return specialist team has emailed me saying they wont be doing anything or responding to me anymore, and I was later told by someone else that they'd return the item to me. The tracking ID that they gave me for their return was the same one that I provided for my second, correct return, so I doubt Ill get it. I have spent hours on calls and said the same thing over and over on different chat logs. It is now been too long to do a dispute through my bank(even though I've heard that's been iffy with others on this sub). Is there anything I can do? Amazon's support has been so shitty lately and I just want my money back.(I am especially annoyed at the fact that they cant send items back due to the fact that they've sold them in return pallets already)"	4	"[""LetsPlayItGrant: Honestly dude if you messed up the labels, they went to incorrect warehouses and Amazon won't do a thing for you.  You're going to have to dispute it with your bank if you ever want to be refunded honestly."", 'InsertBluescreenHere: probably nothin you can do unfortinately.', 'ThMuchoMan: Nah but they gave me a new label for the correct return and knew it was coming.

Nvidia said it's Amazon's responsibility. Amazon said to wait for it and it never showed up, then they said I should've bought direct from Nvidia if I wanted it. Nvidia confirmed it was Amazon that was supposed to give it to me because they send all the promotional codes directly to their partners. Amazon still doesn't want to send it to me. I've spoken with like 8 different support members and supervisors and they all just tell me it's not their problem. The thing is that AMD was having a similar promotion with their CPUs and Amazon DID send me the code for that, so I'm not sure what's going on with this one as the promotion isn't over yet.

EDIT: Spoke with Amazon again, they told me I need to ask the manufacturer directly for it.

Talking through chat gets me a return label, but I'm concerned about this.  Does this mean Amazon is restricting my returns?  Is everyone getting some kind of bug like this?

Your product keeps getting recycled through the building for some reason or another. \n\nHere’s what happened with mine:\nI ordered the item from a third party and it was not shipped or sold by amazon. I had the product shipped to a amazon locker outside of my amazon warehouse. I also ordered other items that were shipped and sold by amazon. So I’m assuming amazon received the package from the third party somehow and they grouped all the items together to be sent to the amazon locker outside of my work. \n\nSo three days in a row it was processed through the delivery station warehouse where I work at. It was put onto a amazon van to be delivered, only to be brought back by the driver. The item I ordered was not able to be placed into a amazon locker because it was not a item shipped and sold by amazon. \n\nBecause I work at amazon and realize how things work at the delivery station here is the conclusion I came up with. Since they grouped all the items together and one I ordered is not suppose to be put into the amazon locker the computer system would not give the driver permission to put the item in the locker outside of my work so he brought it back to the warehouse everyday. \n\nWe use devices that track everything and tell us where to put things. When the driver tried to place the item in the locker it’s likely that the system wouldn’t allow it to go any further. So to get around it he marked the item as delivered to the front door so he could continue on to his next package. If he didn’t do that he would have likely had to mark the item as missing, and marking the item as delivered to the front doorstep and brining it back to the warehouse at the end of the day was probably his best option even thought it actually wasn’t so he could continue on with his day and deliver the rest of the items for the day. \n\nWhat you’re experiencing is probably due to some glitch in the system. If your package was small and was place into plastic/bubble wrap shipping container it’s possible the item was scanned in and no one noticed the package was open and the item was missing from it. \n\nI sort packages and sometime I scan packages that are empty without even knowing it. The items in the plastics are sometimes so light you can’t tell if there is anything is in it, a example being a set of earrings. I realized this from sorting packages for a year now. Sometimes the plastic bubble wrap packages aren’t exactly sealed right at the fulfillment center and it causes the item ordered to fall out of it. \n\nWe work in a very fast paced environment to get packages delivered on time. When the package isn’t sealed properly and is open I rarely notice because it still appears to be closed a lot of times. I don’t have time to inspect every package for this problem. I sort a minimum of 2,000 packages each night, and sometimes over 3000 when demand is high in six and a half hours usually. To break it down for you, that’s 300-500 packages sorted per hour. 300 being the lowest, 500 being the high. It’s usually around 400 each hour. The demand on the people at the fulfillment center is very high too.

I've been compensated, but I don't understand what happened, or why Amazon's behavior around the shipment was so fishy. Amazon claims that delivery was attempted, and nobody collected the item. 

When I check the USPS tracking number, it claims that a label was created and that the item left the shipping partner facility, but it also says that the USPS never took possession of the item. I double-checked with Amazon, and they assert that the USPS tracking number AND that the associated tracking info is correct. 

Amazon tells me to contact USPS. USPS informs me, as I already know, that they don't have possession of the item. 

So, what the heck? Why is Amazon telling me that a delivery was attempted? Why do they tell me to contact USPS, when USPS is clearly incapable of figuring this out? Why does Amazon tell me that the USPS tracking info is correct if it directly contradicts what Amazon is saying?

Is there an internal Amazon logistics tracking system? Are Amazon support agents conflating the status of the shipment from Amazon to USPS with the USPS leg of the shipment?

So in the middle of November, my Prime account was the victim of fraud through being able to hack my account. Two Laptops were sent to addresses in Florida that I had no affiliation with a few days apart. Didn't notice for a few day because they immediately archived my orders (didn't even know that was a thing) and because it occurred right after I received a large lump sum as severance from my employer.

I contacted both Amazon and my bank the day I discovered. About 4 days later I received notice that Amazon had ruled in my favor. When I logged back in, I had notice that my bank had done a chargeback and I needed to either refund the money or to write an explanation. It wasn't like I received double funds, so I wrote and explanation. I received a message that my account would be reviewed in and they would get back to me within 48 hours.

Nothing has changed in 7 weeks, still get the same message when I log in and can't seem any of my account records. I've called no less than 7 times, each time getting a similar response of  ""I can't see your account because it is locked, but I have escalated to the correct person and you will hear within 24 hours.""

Currently, my HBO Max subscription is run through Amazon (yay, they finally got it back). Been that way for a few months, because of utilities and tools that I use to access the account. Never had a problem, until today that is.

HBO has the ability to login with provider, as many do. Pretty standard stuff. It's worked since, always. Worked before they took Amazon away, worked after.  Until today, that is. I went to login to their site, and while I could login, it showed my membership as expired

My first thought? Reach out to HBO. I mean, it's their site, right? Of course, since they don't manage the billing side of things, they are helpless and say reach out to Amazon

To start with, there is, literally **no way** to reach out to amazon support for this. Like, literally none. I had to 'fake it' by reaching out regarding an order and going back to 'contact associate'. 

The first associate I got? Completely helpful. Actually think she was in the US (shockedface)! Unfortunately, she was in 'customer service', and , well, as helpful as she was, she couldn't do anything about my actual issue. Was on with her about 5 minutes and she transferred me.

Next guy (??) I got , completely opposite.  he asked me to repeat what the problem was 3x, even after taking 5-10 minutes to 'read through the previous chat' (translation: talk to other customers). VERY broken English, clearly wasn't understanding anything. Kept insisting ""I can help you"", but clearly wasn't actually capable of solving anything (likely failed at basic comprehension) . FInally I had enough and pulled the 'supervisor' card. I HATE that card, but it is what it is

Supervisor came on, to avoid him having to read through what had gone on, I summed it up quickly for him

* subscription managed by you
* your site says it's fine
* hbo says it's expired
* I need this synced over so I can use it there

Literally, this guy argued with me for 5 minutes about 'we can't do that'. Imagine my shock. I mean, they obviously CAN sync subscription statuses over (they do every month when they renew). I asked when the problem will be resolved, when I'll be able to actually access my HBO account? Yeah, I can't tell you that, he said

So, basically, Amazon is charging customers for a service they can only PARTIALLY provide, and when it's broken, they can't (won't) fix it. Not only that, but we're paying $100+/yr just to have the privilege of subscribing to this service through their site.

My spouse needed to be logged into their account, and have me enter my userid and password on the ""enable payment sharing"" screen that they brought up in their account. Looking later, Amazon vaguely explains it somewhere but a) there's no error message or any indication that you've entered the wrong info on the ""enable payment sharing"" screen if you don't do that and b) that's a f'ing ridiculous way to do it.

We already have Amazon Household set up; it's asking for me to Enable Payment Sharing and then failing to accept me giving the correct email and password.

I went to watch something on Prime Video, and Amazon tried to charge me. I share a Prime account with my spouse; they created the account. The first time we encountered this, we set up an Amazon Household. I've had no problem ordering, getting Prime delivery, or anything else. I've watched Prime Video before. Now it wants me to ""enable payment sharing"". Fine. I think it's BS, but whatever. I click it, it asks me for my login details, I enter them, click the Verify Account button, and it just takes me back to the same screen - nothing about my password being wrong, no error message, just returns me to the same screen.

Turns out Amazon has changed their definitions to cover what they’re doing.

Two Day Shipping now means the item will arrive two days *after* it leaves the warehouse. This does not include the time between when the order is placed and when it makes it out the door.

FREE Prime Shipping equals Standard Shipping without a $25 order minimum. Two Day Shipping is not/no longer available to your area.

Standard Shipping is free with a $25 minimum order and takes 5-21 days.

If you are like me and have noticed a sudden, drastic increase in shipping time, it’s likely you’re not in a Two Day Shipping-eligible area anymore. Amazon seems to be struggling and is shrinking its Two Day coverage areas and changing the definitions of its offered services to hide it.

What I intended to be the main point is that Amazon is severely downgrading the services they provide without notice, explanation, or reduction of cost. \n\nBefore, a Prime subscription bought delivery of orders faster than Amazon’s competitors could provide - you were paying a premium for a premium service. Now, if you are outside the shrinking Two Day Shipping zones, $140/yr buys a waived $25 minimum, which is not of much value since $25 is not a difficult threshold to reach if you shop online with any regularity.\n\nSince most of Amazon’s big competitors have similar offers of free standard shipping over $X and the same standard shipping speed, Amazon no longer has a premium service to offer those outside their Two Day Shipping service areas. The Two Day Shipping boundaries are being re-drawn, yet Amazon is still charging customers the premium service price after excluding them from the premium service areas.\n\nMy chief concern is that Amazon discontinued the main service I was paying for and still continued to take money for a premium service they would no longer provide, all without a single notification of this fundamental change. I also believe the change in definitions and verbiage is a deliberate attempt to obfuscate the matter and mislead their customers into thinking they are still receiving Two Day Shipping.

Instead, the only free return is The UPS Store which is 4 miles further than Kohl's.

The UPS Store is 11.3 miles away from my house.  
Kohl's is 8.8 miles away from my house (and near other stores we frequently visit).

**If I fake my address to the Kohl's store itself then I see the Kohl's Drop-Off option.**

I also understand that not all items are eligible for Kohl's drop-off, but I've proven it's not the item(s) I'm trying to return because I can fake my address and it allows me the option.

I've spoken to customer service but as expected they can't help at all.

Is it possible to actually contact somebody at Amazon who can explain or possibly fix this?"	5	"[""_khione: Hi! I'm from Amazon customer service.

As of the moment, we don't have a relevant team or a specific department that we can make requests like this yet.

Okay.

At this point i call **FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!**

You promised A.

You do NOT deliver A as promised.

In germany that is literally ILLEGAL.

If you promote Fuel for 10 cent per Liter you HAVE to sell it like that.

Not wait until the customer filled his car and go ""oh sorry, its actually 9,99€ per liter"" after.

Feels great as long-time customer to be screwed for trying their 100% clear offer.

""Watch with prime 30d free, join now"". Right on the page. NO way a customer could misunderstand this. Its not ""just promoting the anime channel"". It's fraudulent.

I do have prime since day 1. I did join the anime channel they asked for too. Nothing.

I contacted phone service at lest 10 times before I got an email from the account specialist. They changed the account email back and disabled the password, but never disabled the 2fa... So I wasn't able to do anything, the hacker called in and got the email changed again. This time after they regained access, they changed the account name. I saw also that they spent some of my $400 giftcard balance, and amazon did nothing to stop the delivery. So I contacted again, same thing happened. They changed the email, but they never removed the 2fa. Same thing happened today too, but instead I talked to the supervisor behind the account recovery team. They told me some bs that I had to confirm my ID before I could regain access to my account, but it seems they don't have the common sense to just check who is truly the original owner of the account. And so the hacker changed it back again. Honestly it's just a game for Amazon. I have Amazon prime + giftcard balance on the account that has been accessed by some random guy named ""James"" for 15 days.... Honestly my best bet is to pursue legal action against the hacker, or just yell at customer service next time I call.

As of right now the issue is not resolved, if anyone has any tips, I will be open to advice


Update: Can confirm after blasting them on the phone whilst showing them several recordings, I am back into my account. Changed everything, and added authenticator app + my phone number. From the $400 in Giftcard balance on the account, only 83 remains. I will contact them again to see if they can revert all charges past December 28th. (Didn't need to provide my ID).

To anyone who gets hacked: ask the supervisor of the account team to send a request to the manager of the account specialists, therefore response times are much faster. Also so they actually read into the issue"	8	"['shillyshally: When you regained control, did you change the phone number to your phone for 2f?

However the packages have been taking over a week to arrive.  When I looked into the tracking it shows USPS being the carrier and not Amazon.  My mother in law lives about 5 miles away and if I select her address I can get the items the same day delivery.  I'm curious why in the same city everything is now being shipped USPS to my specific residence.  For us it defeats the entire purpose of prime.  I'm literally saving no money using prime except the convenience of delivery.  USPS can't guarantee that the package will even be delivered in a timely manner and our city uses cluster boxes for mail delivery.  I hope USPS will at least try to deliver the package to my doorstep since they'll be too big to fit in the tiny cluster box.

Is there any way to have Amazon not use USPS?  Amazon trucks are all over my area."	5	"[""Throwingshead: Amazon likely doesn't have a route for your area yet if it's new construction.

This happens when new homes start and amazon does not have a GPS location.  Once they start getting complaints you show up on the delivery route and get amazon services.  its a huge pain and takes awhile.  \n\nIf you feel like it, delivery to your MIL house is an option or getting a secure box elsewhere ; your office, UPS store etc is always something to look into', 'gboro9: Thank you, that makes sense.
