(trigger warning; mention of DV (domestic violence)	Silver_County4621	1	13h5hq3	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/13h5hq3/help_trigger_warning_mention_of_dv_domestic/	"Hi. I'm in a very toxic, abusive relationship. I'm a stay at home mom to our toddlers. I have no source of income and he controls 100000% of the finances. 
I want to leave, and I'm working on leaving. Having money is essential for me to leave (no friends bc not allowed and family lives far away). When my toddlers were gifted $500 in Amazon gift cards from a family member on my significant other's side, I used it to be some necessities for them and then I sold the rest to get cash to stash away. 

He is going to be asking about the cards. He will know I took them and I'm really anxious and it's making me sick. 

Is there ANYWHERE I can buy fake/blank Amazon gift cards? I could at least convince him maybe there was an issue when loading the cards and the money was never put on it. 

If anyone has a better idea, please do tell.

DexterTheInspector	41	13gy5qn	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/13gy5qn/always_get_a_gift_receipt/	"As an Amazon Sort Center employee, the best advice that I can give to everyone that orders from Amazon is firstly, to **ALWAYS GET A GIFT RECEIPT!!** If your box or bag gets damaged, (and it will) or the label comes off, gets caught in a conveyor, or whatever, the gift tag is the last resort that we have to relabel (or replace) your package and get it to you on time or as quickly as possible. There are 2 labels on the outside of each package. If the shipping label gets lost or damaged, we can reprint your address label from the small bar code label. But if BOTH are gone, AND you didn't ask for a gift receipt, your order gets thrown into the boxes on a pallet that get sold or auctioned. 

Secondly, **ALWAYS** make them put your item in Amazon packaging, whether it be a box or a bag. Some items will ship in their ***product packaging*** and most of the time, it is ***not suitable for a*** ***shipping carton***. Seriously, they will ship clothing in a Ziploc baggie and slap a label on it. (Insert eye roll here) I am not defending Amazon in any way, but some of the shit that I've seen come through the Problem Solve department is unreal!! Shit happens, and when you're sorting 60K-100K packages in 5 hours of all shapes, sizes, and weights, jams are going to occur, boxes get smashed, labels get ripped off, or end up stuck to another package. Any added protection you can add to your item order is HIGHLY recommended!"	7	"['Stromberg-Carlson: we need more cats like you that work on the inside to  say things like this. when you say you sort out that many items a day, it should make some of the people here complaining about why they dont get their refund in a timely way see the bigger picture that they are not the only ones returning things.', ""IndiaEvans: Thanks for the tips!

It went past the date on the original email so I contacted them again to see where it was at and how the repair went. ""The repairer has confirmed they have not received your item"". I got confused and sent the receipt from Royal Mail showing I sent the package... -No response-

Except... now when I go onto the item in 'My Orders', it has had its ""sent for repair"" status removed (It used to ask me if my repair has arrived yet with a yes or no box, clicking no would send me to the support page).

I would get it on maybe 10% of my orders and I order a LOT on Amazon. It was very rare and exciting when I would get it. 

Then I didn’t get it at all for like 8-12 months. I thought they stopped the program, which made sense to me because it seemed totally insane to have to predict that on top of all the other sophisticated tracking. 

For the past few months though the MAP is back, but the TRACKING isn’t. When I go to track a package, I see a map helpfully indicating where my house is. Thanks Amazon! No indication whatsoever of where the delivery truck is. 

This map appears long before the “out for delivery” status too, so I assumed it’s not for tracking anyway. 

Does anyone know what the purpose of this map is? I see it both on desktop on Chrome and on the iOS app, which is fully updated on my phone. My only guess could be that maybe it’s a quick and easy reassurance that I didn’t put the wrong delivery address in by mistake?

I have bought thousands of books on kindle, I cannot access my whole library. I have been an amazon user for over a decade and cannot think of a single viable reason for closing my account.

>your account is directly linked to another account that we previously closed for violating of our Conditions of Use

This makes me think they tied my account to another that used the same address. I used the address for a freight forwarding service to forward a package that would not deliver to my location. As far as I am aware, using forwarding services is not against their policy.

>Any digital content that you purchased with this account is still available to you.

I cannot log into my account, my kindle library is inaccessible, what do they even mean by this. 

Has anyone else encountered the issue? Was anyone able to reinstate their account?

Edit: My account was closed apparently due to: “consistently asking us to issue refunds for a large number of your orders.” No prior warning, no explanation given and now I’ve lost thousands of $ in books I’ve purchased over the years. Criminal behaviour from amazon, however I can’t do a thing since it’s stated in their terms and conditions. 

Asking for any further explanation from Amazon produces an identical response - literally the exact same email. 
Other posts detailing the exact same issue have mentioned being able to regain access to their accounts through contacting support through specific email addresses or numbers, process of getting accounts reinstated seems ridiculous; providing passport ID…

This digital content that is supposedly still available to me is not, the links lead me to a sign in page, which of course is useless as the account has been closed. It’s been suggested I try remove the DRM with calibre.

I selected that option and the purchase went through. In my mind I thought they would charge just the amount due for this month.

Will the order get canceled, will just generate an overdraft on my account?	7	"[""Hybr13: Chances are the purchase will eventually get blocked. Once it's blocked, you could ask for a credit limit increase. Once your limit is high enough, you can try purchasing again. The total amount hits the credit card, and you pay it off in 12 monthly installments. If you end up not paying off the full amount in 12 months, they will hit you with all the interest that would have hit all at once. To avoid any sort of mistake, I usually do the math to pay off interest free monthly installment plans 1 month in advance of their actual terms.

Jensgt	4	13e88d2	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/13e88d2/would_you_be_ok_with_having_this_happen_and_being/	"Friday evening I got word of a new promo with Amazon and their Prime credit card which gave 10% cash back on select Canon products. I've been waiting for a deal like this on a new camera body so I applied and approved for the card and ordered the camera with 3 other items to go with the camera.

Yesterday I got an email that I needed to use a different payment method. I thought maybe it was an error and re-ran the payment through the new Prime card. Again it was declined.

I contacted Amazon chat that told me I needed to speak with Chase regarding the purchase to confirm my identity. Ok sounds reasonable. Now my experience is when this happens my bank (NFCU) contacts me, not the other way around, and freezes the entire purchase until we speak. I had to track down the number for Chase amazon and call them at noon today. I answered her questions and she told me that it was all good that she had approved the purchase.

At 8pm I check and it is declined again. So I decided this time I will call instead of chat. I'm pissed but I was very nice to the woman. She told me I needed to speak to Chase because they want to confirm identity. She can't do anything. So I ask to speak to a supervisor to see if they have any ability to contact Chase themselves....since they are partnered and clearly me doing it myself has not accomplished anything.

Then I get transferred to Don...and Don is a peach. (Sarcasm). He cut me off several times, told me that I need to understand there is nothing that can be done. I said I understood that I will have to call Chase in the morning, but I asked is there any way they can communicate so this does not happen again...or if there was any way to expedite the order once it is finally approved to which he gave me a rude ""NO"". He was very hostile and I matched that energy...what can I say. I am starting to get pretty mad at his attitude when he says to me that he wishes he could ""grab me by the shoulders and make me understand"".

I asked him to repeat himself and he says ""I am just trying to say....we can not do anything"". I asked to speak to HIS supervisor and he says there is none. I asked him if he is the boss of Amazon. So I got his name and ended the conversation.

Meanwhile the other 3 items in my order, paid for with the same Prime card...have been delivered to my house...so if they are concerned about the legitimacy of my order...they have a funny way of showing it.

\*\*Just want to add to this that in 2013 I ordered a $2100 canon lens through them. I was contacted by their concierge dept who kept me in the loop throughout the entire process. This camera is $5500 and I guess they don't have the concierge service anymore but the fuckery with which they are handling this is a huge departure from what I am used to. I guess this is just how they operate now."	10	"[""DoAndroidsDrmOfSheep: If Chase is declining the charge (and I can understand them having some concern with a $5500 charge on an account that was JUST opened), the only one that can do anything about it is Chase.

1683682840.0	09-May-2023 18:40:40	Can I do anything about a permanently full hub locker delivery problem?	Deadline_Zero	12	13dcrgw	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/13dcrgw/can_i_do_anything_about_a_permanently_full_hub/	"TL;DR - Is it true that Amazon can't change delivery destination for an order being delivered to a permanently full Hub Locker? If not, is there anything I can have them do at all besides refunding me and waiting a full month for a reorder?

So I ordered an item a few days ago and chose to have it delivered to one of Amazon's hub lockers near my house. I'd selected this hub locker a few months ago and my delivery was delayed by a full week before being returned to Amazon. Customer service told me the locker was full or broken, so the package couldn't be delivered. I believe they also mentioned someone was being sent to deal with it.

Since then I'd used a different locker down the street, but chose the old one again this time because it's conveniently located near my new job. Unfortunately, it seems this location hasn't improved 5 months later - it's supposedly ""full"". It's been out for delivery every day since Saturday, and finally today they ""attempted"" to deliver it to a locker twice at 10 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon.

The delivery is now ""on hold"" with this message: ""Unfortunately, **we weren't able to complete your delivery and need additional information** to try again. We're sorry for the inconvenience."". The last tracking message also says, ""Package held by carrier. **Please contact the carri**er.""

Now that sounds a lot like I should contact someone to get something done, yeah? Since the carrier is Amazon, I contacted them again. Got redirected through like 5 reps (this is just them saying ""let me look into this"" over and over without asking anything), until finally, someone got clever and said they need to send me to an Amazon.ca rep. I don't live in Canada.

Canada rep spent 4 minutes, said they'll try again tomorrow and declared the matter resolved during the minute where I wasn't looking. They then closed the chat.

I've previously asked customer service to simply deliver it to a different hub locker 3 minutes down the street instead, but was told that they can't do that, for some reason. I basically want to know if this is true, and if it's worth my time to even attempt to contact customer service about this again.

The end result of this is going to be that my order gets sent back and I'm forced to just take a refund, but the product I ordered can't arrive again until next month (it's not in stock anymore). So a 5 day wait is going to turn into a month long wait, which you might imagine is kind of inconvenient, and seemingly unnecessary by all indications.

\--------

**\*\*\*Update\*\*\*** So I contacted them again today, since the order is sitting there on hold and all. Went with call instead of chat right off the bat for once. Got redirected once or twice until I got a girl with a hispanic accent on the line (new and unexpected, honestly). She seemed to be under the impression that I was calling about an order that had been delivered to a locker and that I needed instructions on how to get it. As soon as I started speaking to explain what was actually going on, the call ended. I figured it was more Customer Service mind games and started to go about my day, but she called me back directly after about 2 minutes.

She proceeded to spend the next 20 minutes or so making some calls and found that the locker has been decommissioned. Every rep prior has insisted that the locker is ""full"" and nothing is wrong with it (yet the order is on hold due to a problem delivering to the locker). She also spoke to a superior about redirecting my package given the circumstances. They tried to do it 3 times apparently, but the system wouldn't allow them to do it.

She said she'd try contacting me again about any updates on the situation, since tomorrow is the last day anything can be done about it (before it just gets shipped back across the country..).

I thanked her for being honest and actually looking into the problem unlike literally every other rep. She issued a $10 credit in the followup email. I gave her a perfect review, though I assume those don't matter given that everyone else I talked to clearly doesn't care what kind of review you give them.

I don't know if she just checked the order and decided to tell me what she thought I wanted to hear, or if this all really happened, but I appreciate it more than what was going on beforehand by far. Felt like what I remember Amazon customer service being like in the past - minus the part where they ultimately resolve the problem anyway. But I can't blame the workers for Amazon having a moronic, broken system for dealing with their own failed locker deliveries I suppose. I just wanted them to stop telling me they're going to deliver the package and wasting my time day after day, when it was clearly never going to happen.

you all are rock stars

so i just wanted to give some update  
which makes amazon even much much worse then they were before  


so i managed to get in touch with the shipping company (finally)  
and they said they did indeed lost my item  


and that they alerted amazon that the item is lost  
and paid them the value to them  


gave me proof and everything.  


And of coures i contacted amazon again told them all of that  
the guy on the chat said.. i see the tracking information as delivered to the costumer so i have nothing todo, even if you will show me the proof you have, and directed me as usual to that item loss ... section   


so i called them i told them... the shipping company talked to you.. and paid you the value of it.. dont you pay it to me when they paid you ?  
so the guy moved me to a specialist who simply read that item loss category and hung up the call

Both of them were parcelled together. It arrived today but was scheduled to arrive tomorrow. I pick up the box and it feels lighter than what I had expected.

The new phone has everything on it, but the used phone came in a box with a charging cable, headphones, and user manuals but without the phone and the adapter. The box was sealed with a plastic (aftermarket) cover, but the box itself looked old and obviously, the seal was broken.

I immediately contact Amazon support, both chat & call and they told me that the issue had been ""escalated"" and a 3-day investigation was required, and contact them only after that.

After the call ended, I got an email that reads:  ""...It appears that Canada Post has recorded your package as delivered on May 8, 2023 to the correct location with the correct weight. Please allow 3 days (72 hours) while we investigate this matter. If you haven’t received your item by May 11, 2023 until 12 PM please let us know...""

I've read many posts about recent issues with missing items not being refunded. The used phone was just over CAD 120, but I'm a grad student and that amount can still cause a dent. The seller is ""Amazon.com.ca Inc,""

TL;DR: One of the 2 phones I ordered arrived with an empty box. Amazon investigating. Anxious.

It's not been 3 days but I'm anxious about the worst-case. Do ya'll think I'll get the refund?

I’ve been ordering on Amazon for the past 8 years or so, and I don’t abuse it. However with this being said, my purchases over the last few months have been quite a lot, and could be true reason why I’ve been ordering more and also returning more items relatively

I’ve seen other posts in this subReddit saying that their accounts were banned soon after receiving this email 

Can I delete my account before they end up banning it so that I can later create a new account in the future? Any suggestions would be appreciated"	21	"[""TheGodlessPotato: Most companies, especially large ones like Amazon, will likely have safeguards in place to prevent people from making new accounts if they are banned. It could be as simple as banning your delivery address or credit card, or as complex as banning your home internet IP address. Even both. \n\nIf for some reason Amazon doesn't have such a system in place, then of course there'd be nothing to stop anyone from just making a new account. But that almost makes any ban pointless if it were that easy. You can get around the IP issue by logging into a VPN network, but that assumes Amazon didn't also ban your delivery address and/or whatever payment methods you have on file. If that's the case, getting around that will likely not be possible unless you use both a VPN and a different delivery address. It can also affect anyone else living at your current address.\n\nUnfortunately I just do not know what they'd actually do. If I were in your position, I would call Amazon's customer service number and ask to speak to a manager (because a general representative usually has little power to do anything and usually no more information than you have). Sometimes if I call during business hours, and I'm really lucky, I'll get transferred to someone in the United States. Either way I do NOT recommend using chat for a situation like this. You need to talk to someone on the phone. And you may need to call them several times until you get the answers you need.\n\nBased on my understanding, since I am constantly paranoid about getting banned since I actually DO make a lot of returns, Amazon has an algorithm that calculates your spend/return ratio. What that ratio is is not public information. In other words, if the total value of refunds equals more than actual money spent over a certain period of time, it's likely to trigger a red flag in their system. So if all you've had is a warning, then at least you can work with that. After enough time has passed that refund/spend ratio will reset. Just make sure you remain vigilant and keep your own spreadsheet if you need to keep track of actual spend totals and refund totals to analyze that balance.\n\nThe only reason I've been able to get away with making so many returns is that I spend a LOT of money at Amazon. Basically, they make more money from my patronage than they lose. And that's really what they're looking for. But what gives me anxiety is not knowing exactly what ratio they use to base their decision on. \n\nThe point is, it explains why some people can seemingly make a large amount of returns without a problem, and why some people only make a few returns and are threatened with banishment. It's all about that ratio. Someone who makes 10 purchases a year, but returns 4 or 5 of those items, would suggest Amazon is losing money from that customer. But a customer who makes 1,000 purchases a year, and returns 100 of those items, is still considered a profitable customer. A lot more returns, but equates to a 10% return rate vs 40-50% with the other.\n\nBut seriously, call them. I would. Especially if anything I've said doesn't apply to you. That indicates something is wrong, or, they've recently changed a policy I'm unaware of."", 'katehenry4133: You can do that.

Within a day, this individual attempted a $9k transfer out of my savings account. They also purchases some $10k worth of motorcycle parts and accessories. But what was strange is they were able to make these purchases without them appearing on my orders page. In fact I received No text or email about the purchase. They were also able to add their addresses to my authorized addresses. Again, with no heads-up from Amazon. By the time I was able to hunt down these transaction, most of the items had already shipped (but not yet delivered). The first thing I did was reach out to customer service. I spent a good 45 minutes to an hour identifying each of the transaction. The customer service response was what you would expect ""Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Do not worry. You will not be liable for any of these unauthorized purchases."" At this time I made sure that Amazon and my bank were aware of the ship-to addresses. Which happened to be within 2 miles of my house. This made me wonder which approach they took to hack in my system which already was fairly secure.

This is when things really got weird. A couple of days later I received several emails from Amazon, actually one per purchase. The content of these emails was to inform me that my account will be frozen until I make good on these purchases. Remember when I said every purchase was for motorcycle stuff? Well I happen to be disabled. I am completely unable to ride a motorcycle. This was the gist of my initial response. Well that and the fact they already told me over the phone that I was not liable for the unauthorized transactions. That did not seem to matter with this customer service representative, assuming it was not an AI responding. Here we are some 3 weeks later. Not only am I completely locked out of Amazon but I had several hundred dollars from recent returns sitting in my account. I have no access to this money nor access to a live customer service agent to discuss the finer points of this unnerving situation. I have spent well north of $100K on Amazon.com going back to when they only sold books. Not of this seems to matter.

This company used to really be on their game. Before this, I had NEVER had a bad experience with Amazon. Now I will never spend another dime with them. Additionally, I will happily spend my days posting for everyone to read and possibly rethink their future purchasing decisions."	3	"['BowenoftheLore: The reason you don\'t have email confirmations is that is how the hackers get in.

1683572874.0	08-May-2023 12:07:54	"The era of ""free"" returns is coming to an end at Amazon and other retailers"	TheGodlessPotato	39	13c1hei	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/13c1hei/the_era_of_free_returns_is_coming_to_an_end_at/	"I've been complaining about the dramatic changes in Amazon's return policy for a while now. I even posted about it a few days ago in this sub to see if anyone else had noticed these changes too. It got very little response and so I just assumed that either I was overreacting, or that the changes were only occurring in certain regional areas like mine and not nationwide, or perhaps both. There was also another possibility: maybe most Amazon customers noticed the changes but don't seem to have a problem with it. Perhaps I was conveying a minority opinion. 

The gist of my complaint was this: in the last 2 years I have noticed gradual changes in Amazon's return options. Specifically, they did away entirely with return options that involved SHIPPING a return back to them. There is no longer the option to print a pre-paid USPS label, nor an option to ship and pay yourself (an option in which Amazon would reimburse your shipping cost). UPS pickups were also once free. 

To be clear: this wasn't the case for EVERY return reason. ""Free"" was largely if the item you received was damaged, defective, had missing parts, etc. In other words, the reason was not the customer's fault. If the return reason was because you simply changed your mind, it didn't fit, or it didn't meet performance expectations, you may have been expected to pay for the return yourself. I think that's fair. But now Amazon's customers are responsible for shipping costs regardless of the reason. If you ordered a blender but they sent you a pair of shoes by mistake, you will need to pay $7.99 for a UPS pickup by having that amount deducted from the total refund. 

Again, just to clarify, I'm speaking SPECIFICALLY of return SHIPPING. That is what Amazon did away with, with the exception of a UPS pickup option at the customer's expense. The only ""free"" option now is to bring the item to one of their authorized return centers like Kohls, Whole Foods, UPS Store, and a few other places. It is the equivalent of returning items to the store. Historically speaking, returning items in-store was just an obvious thing to do if you purchased it in-store. But, if you happened to purchase an item from that store's website and had it shipped to you, in most instances they'd provide a free return shipping label (though you'd still have the option to return in-store if you preferred). 

Well, I did some research and turns out this is an actual thing. I thought it was just Amazon, but it's not. Lots of major retailers are changing their return policies to exclude free shipping options. In some instances, they're also reducing their return windows. It's no coincidence that these changes began in the wake of the pandemic. Each year since, customers are returning more and more items. Those returned items oftentimes cannot be resold, and they're piling up in warehouses. Some retailers are literally running out of room. 

Eliminating free returns ISN'T because of customers necessarily ""exploiting"" a return policy; that's a false conclusion but also the most prevalent belief. People have exploited policies since the dawn of time. The reason we're seeing such dramatic changes now is because more people relied (and still do) on getting things online when going to stores was either not an option (due to closures) or just a risky (health-related) one. Combined with fears of inflation, retailers changed their policies NOT to save money on shipping costs, but to actually deter customers from returning items. They're making it either so difficult or so expensive that for all intents and purposes they want customers to consider all purchases final.

I wanted to post a bunch of news articles about it here, but not sure if that's allowed. If anyone can confirm, I'll update this post with links. Otherwise, it's really easy to find them on Google by just searching ""free returns are going away"". Some of the articles mention Amazon specifically, others do not. But the point is that this is turning into common business practice everywhere. It's not just Amazon. It's either they charge for shipping, or they increase prices. According to their own research, they find customers are more put off by increased prices than a return policy that isn't free. 

But here's my question for you all: how will these new return policies change your shopping habits, if at all? What do you personally find more important: low prices or free returns? Assuming you couldn't have both, of course. What goes into your overall decision to buy from one retailer, but not another, assuming they all had the same item at the same price? Loyalty? Habit? Return policy? Trust? No judgment, just genuinely curious. In any case, all of the bad experiences I've had with Amazon lately I think are for the best. It has woken me up and forced my to evaluate my shopping decisions and choices. I hope to become a smarter, more educated consumer moving forward."	107	"[""DesignHead9206: Well, for me it's simple.

I just thought it was a topic worth discussing, especially since there are so many news articles about it.\n\nI haven\'t accused any retailer, including Amazon, of being ""wrong"" to change their policies. I\'m only pointing out that the policies changed, regardless of what I or anyone else thinks about it. And also that similar changes are likely to be implemented by more retailers. I also shared their reasoning behind it and what prompted those changes. I specifically brought up the pandemic and the increase of online sales which ostensibly leads to an increase in returns and a decrease in space for retailer warehouses. \n\nThe ONLY opinion I gave was my feelings about customers being expect to pay return shipping on items that arrived damaged or defective. And since that is an opinion, those who don\'t agree with my opinion should absolutely downvote it. If I\'ve misstated facts and peddling misinformation please downvote me. Or better yet, let\'s discuss what exactly it is I\'ve gotten wrong so I can correct myself. In any event, I apologize if people are offended by this post.

The pandemic created a surge of online sales, especially in the beginning when many stores were closed. Still, even when they re-opened people had concerns about their health.

Whatever the reasons, people got used to the idea of shopping online as a less-risky choice: get stuff online or go to a store in person. For many it seemed like a no-brainer. \n\nAnd I have no doubt that today, three years later with WHO only just recently in the last week declaring the pandemic no longer a global health emergency, people maintained their online shopping habits. For some they even became overly dependent on it. That didn't change even as the COVID risks lowered over time, including when vaccines rolled out over two years ago.

SOURCECODE01	1	13bfve6	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/13bfve6/am_i_going_crazy_amazon_video_not_playing_all/	"I swear I feel like I'm going crazy, I can't find anything else online about this problem.

I've been watching House MD for the second time and I've noticed a bunch of times, certain audio will be straight up missing. Usually these missing audio clips will be two or three words, making it hard to tell if the subtitles are the ones that are wrong or not. I was brushing it off as just my imagination, or that the person transcribing subtitles was adding flourish to the sentences. It doesn't help that the subtitles occasionally are ""incorrect"" in that they convey the same meaning as a spoken phrase but don't match up word for word. Enough reasonable doubt was instilled into my mind that whenever I would notice a phrase missing I would chalk it up to the subtitles being wrong, not the audio. 

However in Episode 13 of Season 3, at around 10:30, Foreman is supposed to say ""I get it, but right now..."" and he does not. The subtitles are correct, and you can see the actor's mouth move, but what is played is ""...But right now..."" completely omitting the ""I get it."" All the audio that is played is still in sync with the video, it's like someone just muted Foreman's mic for a second or two. It's also not an audio bug or a headphone problem, as replaying does not clear it up, and the background music and noise in the show does not cut out. I've no clue why someone would do this to the show. Bad edit job? But why are we randomly editing out dialogue?

It's not a major issue, but I find it really strange, and it happens enough to be slightly distracting. Both audio sources have the issue- English and English with audio description. Can anyone else test to see if the audio works for them, or if this is a problem on their side of things?"	1	"['spisHjerner: Guess the new ""transition to monolith"" system by Video Quality Analysis team didn\'t catch this: https://www.primevideotech.com/video-streaming/scaling-up-the-prime-video-audio-video-monitoring-service-and-reducing-costs-by-90.

1683417090.0	06-May-2023 16:51:30	Why did Amazon have to overly complicate their once easy returns process?	TheGodlessPotato	0	13a6e0e	amazonprime	https://i.redd.it/ydvqblzabcya1.jpg	"I get it, I'm sure every company would love to never have a customer return a purchase. But if you're in the business of selling goods, and you establish a return policy, then returns are an inevitable part of that business. At one point Amazon truly had a hassle free return process; but now it seems like they're doing everything they can to deter returns for ANY reason by making it as inconvenient as possible for customers. Maybe this isn't the case for every region nationwide, but in mine it certainly has.

Here's an example: let's say I purchase a ceramic vase and it arrives broken and in pieces. Naturally, I would want to return and/or exchange it. Two years ago I would have had several options for doing so, including the ability to print a USPS return label. There was even an option to select ""I'll pay and ship myself"" and Amazon would reimburse your shipping costs. UPS pickups were also free as long as the reason for the return was because it arrived damaged or defective - not if it was fine but you just didn't want it anymore or it was the wrong size, etc. 

Fast forward two years later today, and again, at least in my region there are NO return options at all that allow you to ship a return. USPS isn't even an option anymore, nor is offering to pay for your own return shipping. The exception is UPS pickup. That option is always available, but it costs $7.99 regardless of the return reason. If you don't want to pay $7.99 to return a broken item you only paid $20 for, then your only other option is to travel to one of their many drop-off locations: Kohls, Whole Foods, Amazon Locker, UPS Store, etc. 

At first glance it appears as though Amazon is giving you LOTS of return options, but really what they're doing is giving you lots of locations for exactly ONE ""free"" return option: drop it off yourself at one of their authorized establishments. Your new ceramic vase arrived broken through no fault of your own? No problem! Just get in your car, fill it up with gas, drive to one of our stores, wait in line, hand over the return, and drive home!

To be clear, I have no issue with drop-off being a return option. I'm sure for some people this is actually easier and more convenient than a shipping arrangement. But not everyone wants to do that, and for some maybe not even possible due to disability or no access to transportation. And if that's you, then you MUST pay the $7.99 fee for a UPS pickup. Or pay for an Uber to get you to a drop-off place. The point I'm trying to make is that Amazon no longer offers (at least in my area) free return shipping for ANY reason. They just won't pay for return shipping... Period. At one time they did, but no more. 

But it's not just about the inconvenience of going somewhere to drop it off. What I really appreciated about returning with USPS or UPS is that you get a real life honest-to-God TRACKING number that allowed you to follow the return. You could verify the package was in the courier's possession, and the exact date and time it was delivered. As far as I'm aware you can't do that at any of their drop-off locations. Yes, they give you a receipt, but that's not the same as being able to track it yourself. With that receipt you have no idea where in transit your return is at this very moment.

Maybe my perception is all wrong. Maybe I'm unjustifiably annoyed by their ""free returns but not really"" policy. Or at how what they've done is taken choices away from customers who may have unique circumstances and/or limitations. I totally understand if Amazon doesn't want to pay return shipping if I ordered the wrong size by mistake, but I DON'T understand why literally any other retailer with a return policy, upon learning that an item they shipped arrived broken, would immediately email you a pre-paid return label but Amazon won't. This multi-billion dollar giant corporation wants YOU, their customers, to deal with the damaged goods yourself. 

Take a store like Target or Walmart for example. If I go to the store and buy something, but want to return it, then I will need to go back to the store and return it. But if I buy something from Target or Walmart online, and they ship it, they WILL set up a return label to ship it back. But they ALSO give the option to return in-store if that's more convenient for you. This makes complete sense. But with Amazon, it would be like if I ordered something from Target or Walmart online but if I needed to return it my ONLY option is to physically drive to the store or pay eight bucks for a UPS pickup. 

I'm sure some of you may not think this is a big deal, or perhaps think Amazon's policy is fair. That's ok. I'm just pointing out that it has changed significantly and those changes appear to solely benefit Amazon's ability to save on shipping costs but in absolute terms. It's just something I personally find infuriating. Sorry for the lengthy rant."	11	"['nycmaxima: ""abusing"" the return policy is inevitable imo. When i buy on amazon that little ""free returns"" tag is important to me. I need to try on clothes to see if i like them and need to also try electronics to see if they are worth keeping. Even if i shop from other websites i tend to aim for the ones with free shipping  and free returns. They cant expect us to keep everything we buy online sight unseen. Thats why we pay for prime membership. I dont hesitate to buy stuff on a whim to try out and return. These retailers want to save money by not paying employees and not having physical stores and when they do have physical stores they dont have much items in the stores. I end up having to order online anyway. Point is if you want to make free shipping and free returns a selling point for the prime membership then you cant expect people not to use that perk they are paying for.

1683390324.0	06-May-2023 09:25:24	Does anyone else get randomly charged by Amazon for returns you made MONTHS ago?	TheGodlessPotato	40	139ulxc	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/139ulxc/does_anyone_else_get_randomly_charged_by_amazon/	"This has been an ongoing issue, at least for me, over the last year or two. Here's an example of what happens: you place an order, but it arrives damaged so you set up a return. After you drop it off at one of Amazon's authorized return locations, or it is picked up by UPS, Amazon issues an advanced refund. This advanced refund is, of course, conditional and they'll re-charge you if the return is not received by their deadline. All that seems fine until... 

Three months later you get an email from Amazon informing you that they never received your return and that your credit card has been charged. You think to yourself ""Wait a minute, I know I returned that!"". If it was returned via UPS, you check the return tracking number and sure enough it shows that it was successfully delivered to Amazon's return address approximately one week from when UPS received it.

So here's the issue: this is NOT a case of sending back an item that was somehow lost in transit. Tracking information shows the return was delivered and received by Amazon's returns center in Lexington THREE MONTHS ago. Nevertheless, for whatever reason receipt of that return isn't registered in their system. Your card is charged and an automated email is sent to inform you of this. Naturally, you contact customer service, they apologize for the mistake and re-issue the refund.

Now imagine that this happens to you several times a year. This isn't a one-off mistake. A return you thought was settled months ago and had forgotten about by now is suddenly an issue again. 

But here's what makes this particularly problematic : 

1) Items are typically expected to be returned within 30 days, but the re-charge (at least for me) almost always occurs 90 days after the initial return is set up. 

2) The re-charge notification email contradicts the return status displayed on your account when viewing the order in the app/website. In other words, the email says ""not received"" but the order in your account says ""received"". 

In fact, when you go to start a chat RE: this return the automated bot says ""We've received your return, thank you."" But since you've been charged anyway, you have to say ""I need more help"" and chat with an agent. But what's really bad is that unless you diligently check your emails, or notice the re-charge on your credit card, it could easily be missed. Why? Because you know you returned it and aren't expecting a problem three months later. 

3) I can't imagine that I'm the only one who has this issue, because the agents obviously have a boilerplate response to it. It's the same every time, something like ""we're very sorry that this happened, it appears that your return was not scanned properly. I'll issue a refund right away."" It's always blamed on a scanning issue. Maybe that is what actually happened, but it's still weird that the status doesn't sync with the status shown in my account and that it triggers an automatic re-charge of my credit card. 

So ok, at least they take care of it immediately, but that doesn't make this any less of a problem. I have to go through this routine with them several times a year. One time I had this happen twice in just a week. But it's not SO frequent that you become paranoid about every return. Most returns are processed just fine. But the re-charges happen often enough that it becomes noticeable. 

4.) Depending on your personal financial situation, an unexpected re-charge like this could mess with your weekly or monthly budget. It could even put some people overdrawn and potentially receive a penalty fee from their bank. That's worse case scenario. In any case, refunds can take anywhere from 3-5 days, maybe longer, to show up in your account. For small amounts maybe it's no big deal, but if you were re-charged for a large amount, that could cause some people a real problem. 

Again, I wouldn't make this post or bother worrying if this was just a one-off thing. I almost put together a collection of all the emails Amazon has sent re-charging me for items they'd received months ago. This was not something I'd ever experienced with Amazon prior to two years ago. I don't know what changed, but it really concerns me to think of how many people out there might be getting charged by Amazon for returns they made a while ago and not even realize it."	29	"['caffeine1004: Happened to me a number of times.

1683387151.0	06-May-2023 08:32:31	My Shocking Experience with Amazon Italy: $3,000 Held Hostage	vintage-th	1	139t3l4	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/139t3l4/my_shocking_experience_with_amazon_italy_3000/	"I wanted to share my experience with Amazon Italy, as it has left me feeling frustrated and utterly shocked.

I reside in Germany and purchased an expensive photo lens from Amazon Italy. The lens arrived in poor packaging – just a paper bag around the original box. It's important to note that Canon's original packaging is loose and not designed for courier transportation. Although the external paper bag appeared intact, the original box looked like someone had used it to play football. The worst was the deformed foam inside the box, which was supposed to hold the top of the lens securely. Nobody would ever buy a ""new"" high-end lens in this condition, and I can't trust that it will work properly or meet warranty requirements if it breaks later.

I immediately took photos of the box and contacted Amazon Italy's support. Unfortunately, the chat option was only available in Italian, so I wrote them a message in English. They replied with an email, again in Italian, and only offered to initiate a return. I went through the process on the Amazon website, even selecting the option to send me a replacement lens. However, the website only allowed me to choose a refund in the next step.

The labels provided by Amazon weren't return labels but customs declarations (unnecessary since both countries are within the EU) and internal Amazon labels. UPS refused to accept the parcel because the labels weren't valid for returns. After further communication with Amazon Italy (now in Italian, thanks to GPT), I was told to send the item as a standard private parcel and later claim reimbursement. I went back to UPS, convinced them to follow these instructions (there was even a guy he could read Italian), and paid the costs for shipping.

A few days later, UPS tracking showed that the parcel had reached Amazon Italy. However, when I contacted customer service to request a little of special care for this expensive return, they were unhelpful. Despite the website claiming that refunds are usually issued within 5-7 days, customer service kept repeating that it might take some time after passing the return to the courier and advised me to wait until May 26th (a whole month!) before contacting them again. My questions about the discrepancies between the website and their response, and the unacknowledged fact that the parcel had already been at Amazon's facility for a week, were ignored.

I was polite throughout the entire process, with GPT helping me write clear and concise messages. However, I was met with no empathy. To make matters worse, I discovered similar stories on Trustpilot. People living in EU countries faced comparable issues with Amazon.It, particularly with expensive returns. The same pattern emerged: a customized return process, long waiting periods, and a **refusal to issue refunds** due to missing proper Amazon labels.

I would usually think twice before ordering expensive items from abroad, especially without PayPal protection, but I didn't expect to encounter such issues with Amazon. They sent me a poorly-packaged item that appeared to be of B-ware quality, and their handling of the situation has left me wondering whether I'll ever see my money again. It's unbelievable.

I've already started a claim with my bank for the Visa transaction (surprisingly, there's a dedicated category for returned purchases). Someone on Trustpilot mentioned that they only got their money back through the free help of the European Consumer Centre, which might be my next step."	1	[]

What the driver did is ridiculous even if the door can be open and nothing happens to the parcel. And if this is really happening again and again I can totally understand her being so pissed off to impulsively exaggerate a safety hazard (IF she is exaggerating. As said, we do not know her personal situation. If she is a granny, she definitely might be unable to open that door, as also to escape from the window).  \nIn the best case scenario, she can open the door and the parcel will fall from the porch with a 80% of probability.  \nIn the perfect scenario, she needs to push the door (potentially a lot, if the parcel is really heavy), and the parcel will move next to the door, right where the f@cking idiot should have left it in the first place.  \nIn other words, why are you attacking the victim and not the perpetrator?  \n\n\nI am not trying to prove you wrong. I am trying to prove her not wrong."", ""Shadow99688: Worked construction, doors on older apartments/homes were 30 to 32 inches wide, I'm also very aware of US building codes as had to comply with them. for someone to live in an apartment or to sell a house there is REQUIRED to be multiple exits.\n\nYou missed that OP claimed that box was 5 foot tall in reply, that destroyed OP credibility in addition to other claims, people will believe the false stories and repeat them damaging credibility of others with legitimate claims.\n\nThere is already enough issues with credibility of posts"", 'DesignHead9206: I missed the 5 feet thing, true.

Place an order where the item is to be delivered tomorrow.  Verify the date at each step.  Find out it has been rescheduled for 10 days later.  You can STILL order the item for tomorrow's delivery.

Or place the order for an item at one price, and have the price change just as you hit the submit button.  It's still listed at the lower price.

Items are out of stock....I understand....then stop listing them as available.

This is their Standard Operating Procedure.

To complain, you must get through 20 menus.  Then spend a half hour or longer on a call with sound quality so poor you cannot understand.  Each person tries to gaslight you by saying it shows  up at a later date or higher price.  If you are lucky, with in an hour someone will offer you $5. 

People give up on complaining.

But Amazon tracks items knowing exactly where they are and has some of the most sophisticated software around.\n\nI care about the marketplace, not Amazon. I could almost guarantee I\'ve been screwed over by Amazon more than most on this sub and Amazon deserves nothing from me. Amazon lacks transparency which creates rumors and toxic assumptions within the customer base, my goal is to try and limit that when possible before it becomes a bigger headache for me later on. A more educated customer base in how the marketplace works helps improve the marketplace as a whole.\n\nI\'m not giving any benefit of the doubt and my take comes from the seller side and direct experience. Amazon has fulfilled many of my items over the years and their inventory system is no where near as accurate as you believe and a big reason for that is due to their scale. There isn\'t a software in existence that could perfectly manage the inventory they have moving around all of the time. Seller items in Amazon\'s warehouses get lost all the time within their system and they usually don\'t realize an item is not accounted for until they go to pick it and it\'s not where they thought it would be. There are also other factors that could impact this like damaging inventory prior to shipping when someone runs over inventory with their forklift or a conveyor decides to eat your item on it\'s way to packaging, things happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Inventory is updated every second including on hand, reserved for an order, out of stock, and ordered (with delivery date). If this happened one our of 10 orders, it would be one thing, but it\'s over 75% of the time. Amazon doesn\'t ""believe"" about inventory....it knows. I\'ve seen their inventory system first hand. They can even track it within a square foot as it moves around their warehouse. They know.\n\nAgain this is just not reality and you think they are way more organized and accurate than they are. If they can track items so accurately they can pin it within a square foot why do they give out thousands of seller reimbursement everyday for lost inventory? If what you claim was the case reimbursing lost inventory wouldn\'t be a thing but it happens a lot. Sure inventory is updated constantly but that doesn\'t mean it\'s in real time. Any change a seller makes to their inventory is met with a 15 minute disclaimer to take effect. If there wasn\'t a chance of lag within the system there would be no need for that disclaimer but not everything is always updated instantly, the system is not perfect. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You are right that it takes courage to fight Amazon, and it will take time...,and the AG\'s will be out of office by then and will not benefit from it. Isn\'t that a shame?\n\nAgain what are you even trying to fight? Nothing stated has any chance of having a legitimate case. AG aren\'t going to waste their time unless there is something Amazon is actually doing wrong but your 2 scenarios don\'t show that especially since they assume way too many things that aren\'t fact.']"

1683310432.0	05-May-2023 11:13:52	Just Canceled My Membership After 15 Years. I'm DONE.	TheGodlessPotato	148	138wr5v	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/138wr5v/just_canceled_my_membership_after_15_years_im_done/	"I really needed to rant about this and hoping this is the appropriate sub for it. Canceling my Prime membership was something I had been considering since last year, but I begrudgingly renewed it this past February because, to be honest, I've become overly dependent on them for just about everything. 

That's actually one reason I wanted to cancel: I feel trapped like I'm in an abusive relationship with Amazon that I could never leave until I realized yes, I can. Sure, there are no equivalent ""one stop shop"" alternatives, but I can certainly get everything I need elsewhere, just not as conveniently. 

Still, quitting Amazon was not an easy decision nor one I made impulsively. It just got to the point where I realized that they've increased Prime membership by $20 each year for the last 2 years and instead of getting more, or at least the SAME services, it's gotten measurably WORSE. Why am I paying more for less? I just couldn't justify that anymore. 

I think Amazon KNOWS that they have a monopoly and that many of their customers (including me) are trapped because there's no like-for-like competition. Sure, customers might complain, but most are probably not going to cancel. As long as people are still paying, they have no incentive to change. 

Amazon used to be pretty reliable and had some VERY attractive benefits and features. Here is everything I've lost over the last two years despite annual increases in membership fees:

1. Free grocery delivery. When they started charging a $10 delivery fee for Whole Foods, I wasn't happy BUT I understood their reasons for it. Honestly my main concern was for the delivery drivers and how their jobs might be affected. But now Amazon is charging for their Fresh service for orders less than $150. Side Note: why couldn't they do the same for Whole Foods? If I spend $150 at WF I still pay a $10 delivery fee. 

2. Deliveries are increasingly being shipped and delivered late, whether it's same day, next day, or two day. They get away with this by adding ""ESTIMATED delivery"" dates after submitting your order. In other words, they don't guarantee you'll get it when you expect it. I've also had several orders lost in transit and orders delivered to the wrong address. 

3. Expensive purchases are risky. Last year I purchased a $5,000 OLED television from Amazon and a $1,000 blu-ray player. Because these are high value items, Amazon marked them as requiring a signature upon delivery. That's a GOOD thing. However, they delivered the blu-ray player to the wrong address without a signature. I was livid. The TV was delivered to the correct address, but instead of knocking or ringing the bell they just dropped it off on my porch and left. Imagine a brand new 77"" OLED just sitting on the porch in broad daylight for everyone to see. Luckily we were home so we brought it in immediately, but that's not the point. They were supposed to get a signature for it. I stopped purchasing anything from Amazon if the value of a single item exceeded $500.

4. They got rid of the ability for customers to cancel shipped items in transit. To be clear: these were items that were shipped by Amazon and whereby Amazon Logistics is the delivery agent (not USPS or UPS). For years I was able to cancel those types of orders from my account if I changed my mind. It was EXTREMELY useful and reduced the number of returns I'd have to set up. I've never been able to cancel orders once they've received a ""shipping now"" status, but now I'm unable to cancel them when they've actually shipped. Again, this was a feature once available to me that is now gone. 

5. UPS Pickups are no longer free, even if the item is damaged or broken. The only ""free"" way to return anything is to drop it off yourself at either an Amazon Hub, UPS Store, Or Ross. That does NOT help me since I am disabled. It is preferable if returns can be picked up at my home. Luckily I have a husband that is able to make those drop-offs, but what if I didn't have him? If I was on my own I would not be able to return items unless I paid $7.99 for UPS to pick it up. Again, this is even if the item arrived broken or defective. Which happens often. 

The list goes on. Too many issues to list here without this post turning into War and Peace. But I needed to vent my frustration. I've been a loyal customer for 15 years and we spend $50k plus a year at Amazon (groceries, pet food, furniture, electronics, and basic supplies). Losing me as a customer won't hurt them at all. I won't be missed. But my hope is that if enough people are just as outraged, then more people will cancel and THAT is what would get their attention. Not losing a few thousand dollars a year, but a few million.

I was having a hard time with amazon return stuff. 

Firstly, my kid played my phone and ordered some items from Amazon (2 orders worth $1500 wtf). By the time I realized that it was already shipping. The CS told me to refuse the delivery and will refund me automatically after that. I did so and surely I was not refunded. 

I entered the chat with the CS again and said they need the items returned back to the seller before issuing refund. However, the shipping company (SF, as I live in HK) reported that they need both seller and buyer confirmation to start shipping. And the amazon staff that work with them told them NOT TO RETURN and KEEP THE PACKAGE IN THEIR WAREHOUSE FOR 3 MONTHS. (According to their policy, the package will be destroyed after 3 month.) I keep telling this incident to the CS and they again refused to look into that and talk to the shipping company. 

I am absolutely shocked and reach out again to Amazon CS. They suggested me to receive the item first and then they will issue me the DHL drop off label for me to  return. Then I followed the instruction and ask the CS to issue the DHL drop off label for me. They REFUSED and only provide me mailing label and only offer$150 refund after receiving the parcels. (The shipping fee from HK to US is sky high...) I had a bad time with self ship label before. I shipped with my own fee and delivered. They refused to acknowledge the receipt and denied my refund request. I would not want it to happen again!!

Now what should I do? Keep banging the CS and hopefully they can get me prepaid label? Or can I put the other items inside the parcel with DHL prepaid label (can get one for 1 out of 5 items) and ship it back? 

&#x200B;

Any suggestion is appreciated....."	1	[]

I was home waiting for a package all day. No alert for item is X stops away just a random delivery message an hour after delivery it was put in a safe place. I live I an apartment complex with 500 units and have never had a problem with stuff at my front door. Even after getting home from work hours later. There is not other safe place. My office does not accept deliveries. No picture of the item in this ""safe place"". I'm waiting redelivery today. Hoping the driver doesn't steal my shit this time. I insisted to make a complaint against the driver. Amazon just wanted to send another delivery without doing any internal investigation.

Second thing. I have an Amazon store card for the rewards points. I've been using it extra hard lately because I got a decent tax refund. Buying anything I can think of so I'm good for the next year. Get my tax money and pay the balance. Three days later I look at my bank account and I'm overdrawn by $900! The Amazon cc double charged my payment of $1500. I call them up and they can't just re-tranfer funds to the bank account I use to make payments. WTF! All they can do is mail a check for the positive balance in 7-10 days. Luckily I had money to transfer in my bank to not overdraft or I would be screwed. My advice don't get the Amazon card. The 3% reward on purchases is nice but it's way to easy to overspend. Customer service is terrible too."	2	"['NihilisticRage: I have the same “safe place” delivery issue, with no picture.

How can I even make a report when I don’t even know where the package was left? The CS agent simply stated that it was scanned at “my address” (I live in a gated apartment complex and they have the gate code in my delivery instructions, as well as other instructions to leave packages in front of the window with a camera. No video evidence, either) and that it had the correct weight when it left the processing station. \n\nI’ve had some missing deliveries before, mostly in the past five or six months, and Amazon had no issue with refunding or sending another item in its place, but this is the first time that there was zero evidence of a delivery and they wouldn’t touch it.

Which is nice, for some, but that doesn't solve many problems at the source. Amazon being as strict as they are aside from the rando reps that are hit and miss is a result of how targeted they are by those that want to scam them.

&#x200B;

'Dear \[me\],

&#x200B;

Thank you for being a valued member of Amazon Prime. We are writing to you about an upcoming change to your membership.

&#x200B;

Since launching Amazon Prime in 2018 we have continued expanding Prime member benefits. So we can continue growing the offering, Prime membership fees are changing to $79 per year for annual plans. The new price will apply from June 28, 2023, on the date of your next renewal. With your Prime membership you have access to shopping and entertainment benefits, including Prime Video and Amazon Music.'

&#x200B;

Seems like a bold move from Amazon Australia, people are struggling with the cost of living here and it's a massive increase.

They are just adapting to increasing costs for them as well. They anticipate losing members every time they have to increase the membership price but they clearly can't keep losing as much as they are on prime benefits so they either increase the price, remove costly perks, or terminate the program in your region totally.

Since then they have removed some perks and added fees to services that used to be included with the subscription which, to me, just hints that they are having difficulty estimating future costs and the past few years have been chaotic for that. USPS literally increased their rates 3 times last year so shipping has become more expensive, minimum wage laws continue to increase, oil prices are fluctuating frequently, inflation rates are higher than decades prior, etc. It all adds up and has a ripple effect that eventually impacts Amazon to a point where they can no longer afford to eat all of the costs at their current rate.\n\nAmazon is greedy in many places but I have a hard time believing that prime memberships could honestly be a profitable venture on sub fees alone.

About two months ago I ordered a pair of Sony XM4 headphones in blue. Upon getting this item, it was the white model. I went to Amazon to file a return and scheduled a pickup. Weeks go by and they finally tell me they got the item. However, they claim that they got the white headphones when they were expecting the blue ones. Obviously anyone who looks at this will realize it's impossible for me to sent them the blue ones. I emailed Amazon and started countless live chats only to be told that this matter is ""final"" and they will NOT be refunding me.

This is unacceptable. What can I do to actually get them to refund me?

&nbsp;

First the autoplay of trailers which nobody has ever liked, instead of letting us look at posters and read descriptions. Then there was hiding useful headings like ""movies"" and ""tv"" in order to promote buying more subscription channels and renting/buying movies that aren't on Prime. Since you know, it's never enough that you're already paying for Prime. Then those awful ""skip intro"" buttons that appear during a tv theme song/intro credits. Crimes against humanity. But at least in some measure or form the website was readable. You could see many different things at once from a glance. But that was just too non-shitty enough for Amazon. They needed to break the shit ceiling and go one notch lower. So now, congrats, you can barely see anything appear on screen as giant vertical boxes appear instead of small horizontal ones. It's so poorly programmed that you can't even zoom out to see more tiles in the grid. It will always display the same 5 tiles per row, just make the text smaller. Gee, thanks.

&nbsp;

Edit: Amazing, now there's not even a ""free to me"" section, because why would we want the stuff we paid for? Hell no, we're paying for more ads, let's force people to buy, buy, buy! And the auto-trailers are so pernicious you can't even read the description of the movie unless you move the mouse to hide the video every 2 seconds.

This concession was insulting, because a) it\'s not ""free"" it\'s just actually getting the service you\'re paying for instead of more ads, b) everything should be ""free to me"" in the first fucking place, and c) it makes sections for tv vs movies pointless because now the only way to see stuff without ads to buy more is in the ""free to me"" section, where everything is lumped together.

Then I’d go and cancel all of the S&S items I didn’t need more of.

Honestly it could very well be costing them more money as they have to ship each time out expedited for 2 day delivery whereas with the S&S bulk shipment it all usually arrives in a single big box.

I was having an issue where when I place orders, it won't process the order. No charge is made to my card, it just sits there on Not Yet Shipped.

However - when I go into the order and manually update the shipping speed, it immediately will process and I get a delivery date.

I couldn't get anyone to really believe it was an issue until I was talking to their Key Delivery department, and I had an order I had placed earlier that day. She told me there was not inventory and the order would update when it was available. I then changed the shipping speed an immediately got an estimated delivery date, order processed, and my card was charged. I guess that was proof enough because she called out to another department.

Apparently there is an internal issue they're working on. They didn't really have a workaround or information on a fix, but at least it was confirmation there is an issue

Last week I decided to upgrade from my 2080 ti to 4070 ( no judge xD ) , ordered it from Amazon ( amazon is seller and dispatcher ) , item box got delivered it in Amazon paper bag . And what was my surprise when I opened and there was no GPU inside.  Item box had no seals (film) or stickers on at all . I contacted Amazon straight away where CS asked me to file police report and send them back. 

Yesterday went to the police office and asked them what to do , they just looked at me and said I should deal with Amazon as item was lost with them not stolen from my possession. So I contacted Amazon today once again told them all the limbo and once again - they said they will transfer chat to concerns team , they are not available and will respond within 24-48 hours . After 4 minutes I got email stating same thing again . That based on similar deliveries they believe that item was delivered .

BrockPlaysFortniteYT	23	133mgc4	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/133mgc4/filed_chargeback_account_locked_amazon_says_i_win/	"Hey guys I filed a chargeback after my account was hacked and someone ordered apple watches to a different address I've never used before in LA. I called 3 times over the course of 8 days and each time was told to wait 24-48 hours for an email from amazon which I never got so we finally called the bank and filed the chargback.

Today my account was locked and I got an email from amazon saying someone had filed a chargeback to which I replied explaining everything and this is the latest email I got.

 Hello,

  
We have requested your card issuer to close the dispute in your favor. Therefore, we no longer need to charge your account for this order.

  
If you need more information about the dispute or the credit card refund, contact your card issuer.

It’s about the money fraud, dimwit.\n\nAnd, filing a police report is just what it’s called.  The police aren’t likely to even be involved.  It’s clerical, unless you CALL THEM TO YOU TO DO THE CLERICAL WORK, which in some locals, they won’t and will make you go in for the clerical people that work for the POLICE (DEPARTMENT) to take the report.\n\nI surely hope you never get your identity stolen, get hacked and have money stolen, get your vehicle side swiped in a hit and run, or you know any other type of thing that involves a police report being filed (at your request, for your benefit) because you are a lost cost if so.']"

First, as I said, we\'re paying for (or trying) a service. We should receive what we\'ve bought as promised, WHEN promised. Secondly, our money is already tied up, since we have done our half of the contract by paying. Third, Prime was offered as free and FAST shipping, which was perfect when you haven\'t time to run to stores to find something. Items no longer arrive quickly though. When they do arrive, they are usually damaged. \n\nThe point of these posts is to discuss issues already happening.

If so, I wouldn\'t rely on Amazon, let alone Amazon prime. While thinking they stand behind what they say / offer. PS prime is not really what\'s all cracked up to be, unless you are maybe using every ""perk"". \nYou could just cancel your order, then cancel your prime.

Were we in a proper free market I would agree that going elsewhere is a viable option, but there are many factors why one would chose to buy from Amazon.  The fact that they waited to the last second to update my order with ""Not shipped yet"" on the tracking is a spit in the face, especially since it says that it is Shipping on the summary page.

It's not obvious what happens after that date. Do they automatically refund or do I have to now go through some complicated dispute process to get the refund?

Sometimes they deliver to my door, sometimes they throw it over the gate, and sometimes they leave it outside the gate.

If they throw it over and it lands near our trash, sometimes our trash guy will think it's trash and throw it away or maybe take it for himself?

Card doesn;t arrive, everything gets locked, I start getting these ""someone may hav e1337 haxx0rd ur account!"" emails from Amazon that tell me they locked it down and I should be able to log in and make a new password; yet every time I do, I can't because it asks me for the expiration date of a card that I literally do not have. If I did its an old card I never removed from the account because I do not have this stupid card. Of course it picks THE one card that I don't seem to have in my little card book (why wouldn't it just ask for the primary or a recent card?)  


Call center guy says nothing can be done if I cna't answer that question, and yet asks me for all my info like address, phone etc which is all answered correctly; but still says its up to some dudes in some other department that might answer yes or no in another department.   


What kind of company wouldn't unlock an account when someone is 

1. Calling from the registered phone
2. Answers all verification questions correct
3. Succesfully confirms 6 OTP to the registered email

My question is that the day I subscribed to the Prime Gaming service (Not the free trial period.) and as soon as I clicked on the ""Activate"" tab, I received this message: Oh no! We are unable to enable Prime Gaming on your account.

It looks like there was an error activating Prime Gaming.

Common problems include problems with the credit card used to sign up for Prime, where the credit card may be invalid or declined. To manage your Prime membership, including updating your credit card information, click here. For other common problems, click here.

I don't think the problem is with the bank (OTP), because you have already paid for Prime.

I tried it, then I read that the error could be that the amazon account and twitch account are not linked, but they were already linked."	1	[]

I don't think they were new. They came in a small bubble envelope. I went to set up a return and found that the only options now are to bring it to Whole Foods, an Amazon store, Staples ,or Kohls, sans packaging and they will package it up and return it for me for free.

But since none of those options are close to where I am-- and the nearest locker is a couple of miles away-- my choices are to pay $6.99 to drop it off at the local mom and pop mailing shop that I've always used before and is a block away, or have UPS come to my house to pick up the package for $7.99. 

I get they are trying to save on costs, but this seems a bit extreme, especially since the item is defective. I don't know if these are static return costs, but if you buy a $10 item and it's defective, you'll get about $2. back after you pay to return it. That doesn't seem right.

I was explicitly told that this was acceptable to share.

Long rant:

Hey folks, so on march 10th, I ordered a pull down green screen. It was a third party seller, but amazon fulfilled. after 10 days of the delivery getting pushed back, I reached out ot customer service and was transferred from indian call center to north american based support, who said it would be [shipped by the 28th or I'd be refunded or it'd be replaced.](https://i.imgur.com/oEe6gqe.png) 

Some time after this, it was simply cancelled. I noticed it in my cancelled orders and called repeatedly asking for them to reship etc, and it just wasn't happening. When asking to speak to north american customer service again, i was told this is impossible and no human on earth has this power. I asked why it was cancelled, asked them to uncancelled it, etc, but nothing could fix this. The indian service was useless and could offer nothing. I was hung up on, sent a [blank email at one point](https://i.imgur.com/8lihqts.png) and I was stern - but not screaming, not yelling, not swearing. Just ""I was told this one thing, and I want this thing I was told to be honored."" 

After wasting 5+ hours on phone calls and escalations and finding it to truly be pointless, I set out to find another way to contact amazon. I found Vincent Duong and doug herring's contact information publicly listed on linkedin and other places - C levels at amazon USA, so I reached out to them directly. I did not receive a reply, but I did receive a call from Amazon.com Executive Customer Relations and their reply email was ecr-replies@amazon.com rather than just CS-reply@amazon.com

This person was legitimately helpful. they pulled the actual call audio and listened to it and stated that it was very clear in the call you would receive the product if it wasn't shipped. they said the cancellation was a misunderstanding by an ""outsourced service department"" and that resulted in an unsolvable situation. After we talked it over and I was given a 50 dollar credit (item cost was initially 100ish) and was assured this wouldn't happen again, as is generally the case with these things, but it was nice that he had all the information and was able to understand that I was told something so they should honor it. Which... they didn't. but it was better than nothing after waiting more than a month for something I could just order from aliexpress for 60 bucks and also wait a month. I asked, repeatedly, if I could share any contact information for this department and he said there was no way to call in, but that I was free to share how I escalated it. I made it very clear that the email addresses were public, but I emailed C-levels directly to get further engagement on my issue, and he said that is appropriate. 

This was not the end of my frustration, though. I wanted to order a large TV to celebrate a personal milestone, and placed an order earlier this week for an 85 inch LG, scheduled to be delivered today. I was called and told the packaging was damaged, so they could just ship a new one tomorrow unless I wanted to inspect it, but I told him that was just fine as long as they could ship another - as someone less tech savy would be receiving it under instructions to reject any serious damage or if the TV was visible through damage, which he said it was. So that's great, they'll reship. Large/heavy item handling is much less frustrating to deal with, it seemed like. I get a call from an extremely noisy indian call center 20 minutes later, informing me of a refund to my card, it will take 3-5 days to process. I say I don't authorize this, I want it reshipped as I was told would happen, one is still in stock and this should be doable. The price has been fluctuating up as much as 300 in the last few days so I want it for the price I paid, and I planned my weekend around picking it up and installing it, and was told ""oh well the refund is already pushed sir you must purchase again"" 

Well the card I used has a good interest rate I wanted to take advantage of, but not a high enough limit to just throw another 1700$ TV on it, so this just does not work. I was told one thing, and then immediately had the rug pulled. I thought I could follow the same procedure as last time, but I figured at this point I'm just tired of amazon. I cancelled my prime and found the same TV at best buy for the same price I paid, for pickup on sunday. 

And I just don't want to deal with spending hours on the phone with amazon, again, to find out that someone who says something has absolutely no responsibility for what they say whatsoever. In general it seems like amazon isn't always the cheapest option anymore, and they certainly don't have even remotely useful customer service. 

So I wanted to rant about all that, and share what did work for me, for those who may want a solution. I was explicitly told, again, by exec CS that this information was OK to share. And if anyone else has any information on moving away from amazon, I'd love to hear it. Newegg seems terrible these days but generally it seems like best buy has competitive pricing for large items, so I imagine that's the case for a lot of things you might typically order - less one stop shopping, but not really paying more, generally."	13	"['IndiaEvans: Thanks for sharing!

So that left like a handful of orders a year that i would of had to pay shipping on. Those shipping charges dont add up to even 1/4 of what prime cost me a year. Add on i never used kindle books, never used music, never used photo storage or any of the other dozen perks that i have no interest in and amazon prime video just became shittier and shittier - some months you have to pay for certian shows others not, or pay for certain seasons or episodes  and constantly changed out what movies were free or not. Also the bullshit $5 rental on a 30 year old movie when you can buy the fucking DVD off amazon NEW for $2 is an absolute joke.\n\nSo yea i was absolutely right to dump it. They didnt even try to persuade me when i called and wanted a refund of my remainder of my prime subscription. They were just like OK sorry you havent been enjoying it and that was it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSO i suggest anyone reading my rant - actually sit down, pull up past order history, remove anythign over $25, really analyze and think about the under $25 items you could of bundled together as you didnt need them right then and there, and see whats left. Then ask yourself is it really worth paying $150 to get those items? If you factor in that $150 cost - could you of just bought them locally or whatnot?']"

My interior decorator had my AMEX card on her Amazon account to use when she purchased items for me. It was NOT her default payment. I started getting $14.99/month charges on my AMEX for Prime and I had no idea why. I pay for my membership annually, and I couldn't find these charges anywhere on my account. After several chats with AMEX and Amazon that went around in circles the charges got reversed. About a month later my decorator texted me that she was horrified that her Prime membership was being charged to my AMEX! She had no idea how it had happened but she immediately removed my card from her account.

Fast forward a few months to March and my mother gets an Amazon Prime $139 charge to her Discover card. She doesn't even have an Amazon account so she contacted Discover, got it reversed and got a replacement card. Then she calls me yesterday that it happened again in April! I go to my account, because I have her card saved to it and I start wondering if my membership is going to her card. I find on my account that my last payment was $139 on April 4 and **my preferred payment method is my AMEX**. She contacts Amazon and they tell her that sure enough, it's my membership that got charged to her Discover. WTH? I didn't even have her new number in my account. And nowhere on my account is there a receipt showing it was charged to her Discover.

I contacted Amazon, got it reversed, and removed her card from the account completely. My AMEX is my default card, it shows as my default card for my Prime membership, and I literally charge to it EVERY DAY so I know there wasn't a problem with it.

So, be careful. Amazon is charging your Prime membership to random cards on your account for no reason."	9	['khmara9: no this is user error', 'Vendicated: You have those cards in your account, I don’t understand why you’re so shocked that they were charged lol just remove them if you are not using them.', 'infinityandbeyond75: This happened to me as well.

Because I have a Amazon prime store card plus my bank card on file.

Most likely her card got declined and Amazon uses the back up.', 'Spicymimi42: The charge was declined on the preferred method and then rolled over to the next card on the account. I see it every day.', 'imnotoxic33: This thread makes me feel better. Same thing happened to me, I updated my default payment method (jerks keep hacking my card) knowing the charge was coming. It was charged to the wrong card. My husband was pissed as Amazon is the perk for extra rewards on the card that should have been charged. The only way to accommodate was to cancel, issue a refund, and then resubscribe. What a giant pain in the ass. Luckily I got a free trial month when resubscribing for the yearly annual fee.', 'ElegantYellow933: I guess because if Amazon allows you to have a preferred payment method for your recurring charge then there is an assumption that they are going to use that one? Seems logical.', 'ElegantYellow933: This would make sense, except I haven’t used my mom’s card in a long time. I think I just used it one time few months ago to order something for her.']

So I did. 

I get connected to somewhere in India where the person says, ‘No worries, you’re in the return period. We can process a return’ and then proceeds to create a return label (!?). I asked them it can’t be because I’ve had the wire for 6 months. We’re having this conversation when the line drops.

Couple of weeks back received an email from them stating ""After a review of your details, we have determined it is necessary to close your [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) account.""

I tried logging in and was asked to send payment card info. Did that and they responded stating ""Thank you for writing back regarding your [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Gift Card activity. We sent an email on xxxx informing you that your Gift Card usage is in violation of [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Gift Card Terms and Conditions and we closed your account.""

The strange thing is I have used gc's for less than 0.01% of my purchases and nothing in the last 4-5 months was purchased using GC's. Another thing is in 2022, I purchased about $1 mio worth of stuff across 3 household accounts and this year (Jan - Mar) I have done less than $10k total, primarily because had no time and none of the purchases was using GC's.

Called to request a review but nothing happened. I used these accounts primarily for BG purchases using Amazon Prime card but there were minimal returns and no charge backs, so not sure what the real reason is. I am well aware of many others doing much bigger volumes than me or atleast similar volumes so not sure what triggered this. 

They even refused to return my Amazon prime annual fee which seems pretty rough considering they closed the account without any actual reason being given.

They have changed the definition of it and now things don\'t arrive in 2 days, even a week after you\'ve ordered.', 'nikkococo1998: I live in a mid size city in the central United States', '2Adude: There you are using the term wrong yet again.  \nGo learn the definition of gas lighting.   Seriously , stop looking like a fool.  \n\nIt has always been , the shipping time is when the item ships , not 2 days from the time you order it.  \nSometimes , it would come early.  Of course everyone is happy when it does.  \n\nBut that’s always been that way.  Perhaps, you were not aware of that fact.  Educate yourself.', 'PotentialEssay9747: That helps. They are like everybusiness this year optimizing costs.  Losing departments are not being subsidized by profitable centers.  So fewer warehouses outside larger population areas.  Less redundant stock. So chances your item not close by is high.', 'recklessmoonlight: Sorry but you’re wrong. Their biggest selling point was the fact you could order an item and receive it in 2 days. They just changed their definition of prime within the last year.', 'Brisketta: You are correct about terminology but you are being very intentionally being obtuse in ignoring the fact that while making a purchase, shipping is being calculated and present to the consumer as an estimate and that it is further presented as a fact. \n\nRarely does a product have an estimated shipping time that included an extended preparation time within the warehouse. \n\nMany people look at shipping and delivery as part of their decision making process. When Amazon says a product will be at your home the next day if you order within X hours, that’s an implied guarantee. To receive that item 3 days later not only invalidates the contract of Prime membership but also violates the promise made at purchase. \n\nAmazon will likely be facing a massive class action lawsuit over these changes as they are changing contract terms while within a contract with god knows how many people. They used to be able to deliver on the 2-day promise. Why not now? They crushed their competitors. They’ve put merchandise/fulfillment centers in every state. It’s up to prime members to stop accepting these late deliveries and insist on the adherence to the contract. Previously, Amazon would give an extra month of Prime for any violation of the 2-day promise. But only to those who called and complained. You have to assert your rights and don’t just suck it up. \n\nBut this idea of simply rolling over as a consumer reeks of a corporate plant. Why would you ever voluntarily defend one of the worst monopolies in the world.', ""electricjonah: I'm having the same issue and I'm dead center of the third largest US city — I don't think this is exclusively a geography problem.""]"

Out of nowhere my account was put on hold.

When logging in I was then asked to provide my credit card statement with a few requirements like blocking out all except the last 4 digits of my card number.
The requirements also listed that my address needed to be visible, my name, as well as my phone number.

My statement doesn't list my phone number. It just doesn't. I've never seen a statement that does.

I uploaded my statement and put in the note that my statement doesn't list the phone number.

After a review I received an email saying the hold could not be removed and to upload the same thing.

So I did.

Again, the hold was not removed.

I received another email saying to upload my credit card with only the last 4 digits visible.

I went to log in again, on the website it didn't ask for the credit card but for the card statement again.

So I uploaded both.

Again, I received an email saying the hold could not be removed and to upload the credit card. And it said if this wasn't provided the account would be closed.

On the website it again asked for the statment. I uploaded just the credit card this time.

I then received an email saying that the hold could not be removed and that my account would be closed now. That's it. Gone now.

WTF???

Now, after all of this I decided to just open a new account. Once I wanted to buy something and went to check out, bam, account on hold. And I then went throguht the identical experience again, account closed.

A complaint regarding this product on Amazon would not even raise an eyebrow at the FTC. In fact, unless thousands of people complained about it, it would never even be seen by a human eyeball.\n\nConsumer protection laws in the United States are much more focused on large scale consumer fraud and business to business fraud.\n\nThe majority of more consumer protection laws exist in, and are enforced by, individual states. If you\'d like to see a good example of this, look at consumer protection laws in California, which are so extensive, they are silly. It\'s the reason you see on just about EVERY product in the United States, ""this product is know by the state of California to contain materials that cause cancer..."". The state level is where these consumer protection laws exist for the common citizen.\n\nThe United States Federal Trade Commission cares absolutely not at all about this product on Amazon. 0%. If you wanted to sue them over it, you would be suing them in a state court. You\'d be promptly laughed out of a federal court.\n\nAirbags not deploying in a particular car? Dozens of mishaps resulting in infant deaths with a particular crib? That\'s what federal consumer protection laws deal with in the United States. If the lamps were resulting in house fires, actually that would be handled by a different department.\n\nAmazon rules are FAR more restrictive than federal consumer protection laws in the United States. But if we were to rank whose rules were the most restrictive, I\'d say California protection laws are actually more stringent than Amazon rules - in fact, California is the reason for much of the information you have to provide about products on Amazon. But the United States FTC? They care about whether Amazon is forming a monopoly - that\'s their pervue. Not whether a lamp you received might vary by a few inches. Not at all.\n\nSo sit down and take a breath. You don\'t understand what you think you do and you shouldn\'t be ripping apart people that dare disagree with your incorrect assertions.

For some specialized products or services, additional rules may apply."" -FTC\n\nHealth products, to which you randomly referred earlier, have their own set of regulations under the FTC: https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/health-products-compliance-guidance\n\nYou have a lot of reading to do that you obviously haven\'t done. I will help you with this. If you tell me you\'ve read all of this, you\'re lying. I know that based on the several things you\'ve made up here and presented as fact.  Read this before you reply again. It relates specifically to regulations regarding online advertising.  Also, if you don\'t know the difference between laws and regulations, you should familiarize yourself with that, too. Much of what you say is true if/when an advertiser takes them to the extreme. However, if the advertiser has clearly made an effort to be honest, Amazon won\'t be disposing of their inventory. They would simply have to pay the seller for it. They have very specific rules about handling inventory and disposing of it, even if you blatantly violate their policies, is not one of those reasons. It must either be requested by the seller or abandoned by the seller, or damaged in some way that poses a risk (like spilled chemicals or damaged batteries - and even then, if they were damaged after you sent them, you will be reimbursed if you used FBA ""ship to Amazon"" feature. There are no other circumstances when they will simply dispose of your inventory. They will, however, continue to charge you for storage until you stop paying, at which point the inventory becomes abandoned.\n\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/com-disclosures-how-make-effective-disclosures-digital-advertising\n\nThe PDF is 53 pages and it\'s only a tiny subsection of their rules.\n\nNote that their emphasis is on ""...educating businesses about their legal obligations and consumers about their rights."" \n\nTheir guidelines can be summarized as follows:\nWhen it comes to online ads, the basic principles of advertising law apply: \n1. Advertising must be truthful and not misleading;\n2. Advertisers must have evidence to back up their claims (“substantiation”);\n3. Advertisements cannot be unfair\n-----\n1. The above ad is truthful\n2. I\'m sure the advertiser can back up their claim that they might send you one and they might send you the other\n3. The advertisement doesn\'t seem to be ""unfair"" which is admittedly extraordinarily vague and I suppose *could* include anything either of us could think of.\n\nSince the OP posted that particular picture, I can only assume that he or she saw it. So in this case it would be difficult to argue that they didn\'t see the disclosure. And unless there is a third random product, I would assume they can back up their claim that you will get one or the other. Admittedly, the photo should be the first one. I don\'t know what your experience is, but in my experience, Amazon A/B/C tests the order of images and the seller does not have exclusive control.\n\nThe listing is shit. I think we agree on that. But a listing being shit doesn\'t necessarily rise to the level of illegal.\n\nIllegal activities on Amazon that have been targeted by the FTC  have been objectively unfair practices, such as exploiting the ability to merge reviews (a huge problem still), a substantial change of an item that has gained a good sales history (like taking lamp a that sold very well and replacing the ad copy, pictures, and description, to a totally unrelated product like speakers. It happens all the time. You often see these products listed under manufacturer names like QWWYTZTOO or some other nonsense. No brand accountability. Just move on to the other randomly created brand name with the exact same product.\n\nWhat I\'m saying is that as strict as they are with those of us who are honest sellers, they are not tracking and prosecuting sellers or manufacturers with home proving intent would be impossible. In the United States, a crime must have intent. There\'s no way to prove that the ad in question was placed with the intent to deceive. Not with a picture that clearly says you may receive one or the other. In fact, with that picture left out, I firmly believe very few people would even notice. So even though it\'s a shit ad and they SHOULD have created an ASIN with a separate product. But if the UPC is the same, trying to do that would present its own problems.\n\nSo based on the letter of the law, I don\'t see any way the FTC will be investigating this lamp anytime soon. And based on the absolutely horrendous support that Amazon provides and the absolute jumbled mess and countless shady workarounds in the so-called brand registry, I don\'t even see Amazon giving half a shit. If they do, the seller will just change the manufacturer name and put it back up.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong. There are tons of sleazy sellers on Amazon. Many of those who should be shut down won\'t be. I\'m not saying this product, seller, or manufacturer is reputable. But I find nothing about the OP that leads me to believe they have broken any laws (in the US). Certainly not one that anyone in the government would give a shit about. There are bigger fish to fry. You have to pick you battles. This is a battle only a fool would pick.\n\nMy suggestion: if both options are not acceptable to you, don\'t buy it. There are probably a hundred other listings for the exact same items either on Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, and countless other places. Having laws is no excuse for pretending you\'re an idiot and can\'t protect yourself.\n\nBTW, credit card charge backs in general as far as the FTC is concerned apply to cases of fraud over $50 - primarily fraudulent charges  Their rules do not apply to a consumer being dissatisfied with a purchase, although that additional protection may be extended by a card issuer. It is not a law in the United States.', ""mreed911: Amazon does, in fact, publish their seller terms and they're easily google-able.

Amazon will also issue a chargeback to the manufacturer for the lost inventory as it would be declared defective.\n\n> The FTC ""cracking down"" on Amazon for allowing things that are not illegal is highly unlikely.\n\nDeceptive practices is exactly what the FTC chases and many of Amazon\'s changes over the last few years are in direct response from FTC warnings. Most recently, the FTC called out 700 some odd companies for advertising claims. And in response, Amazon is now being more strict about anything I upload in their advertising space.

Backstory: Prime member for years. Changed phone number, 2FA needed to be disabled to log in again. ID verification passed, but still needed to answer security questions to regain account access. Questions were wild (iykyk). Realized all I wanted now was to cancel my yearly $140 membership and be set free.

What the first three representatives failed to tell me, was that if you create a new account with them, they will automatically cancel your previous Prime membership and any subscriptions tied to the account! Basically, a win-win, because I wasn't trying to cancel all my active bank cards tied to the account or block bank access.

So I went ahead and made a new account while on the phone with rep #4 (Luis - an angel!) and he canceled my old membership. Your rep should be able to walk you through this, but it's important to create your new account with the same email as your last one.

I added $650 in gift cards to my wallet. Amazon closed my account because I told them they were a gift. I complained on the phone and they reinstated my account. I tried making the purchase again later because they said it should be fine, and it was closed again. I called and they said it is permanent, and I said what do I need to do to get my account back? They said the system already determined the cards were fraudulent and my acc will not be reinstated? I had to ask my friends for the receipts which they got reprinted from Best Buy and I sent photos to amazon. They won’t reply to my emails and all supervisors do on the phone is give me the same lines. What do I do?	3	"[""buxzythebeeeeeeee: Yeah, sorry, but this really doesn't sound plausible.

What kind of new shipping charges would I likely see?	41	"['InsertBluescreenHere: Saved and wishlists stay as do past orders. Shipping varies but if its over 25 bucks its free', 'lorelaimsmith: I wish the streaming stuff could be purchased separately and skip the shipping etc, for a lesser price.', 'MargiePal: We cancelled Prime one month ago - Actually we PAUSED it. Before I did that, I researched as much as I could. I thought perhaps getting rid of Prime might curb my online shopping, but so far it hasn\'t. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. If you have a Prime credit card through Synchrony Bank, you will lose it when you cancel. Your card will be downgraded to an Amazon Store Card (with the same number) on the very day your Prime expires. You will lose any Rewards points that you had saved up, so be sure to use them up before then. You won\'t get the 5% rewards on Amazon purchases anymore. I paid off my balance in full, but if you still have a balance, I believe you still have the same terms to pay it off with the downgraded card. However, I can\'t say for sure.\n2. You can still make Amazon purchases like before, but you won\'t get any ""special Prime deals"" on select items.  I know this, because it tells me when I can get a better price if I renew Prime. It really isn\'t much difference though and only on a few things.\n3. You can still get free shipping on orders over $25, but only on items sold by Amazon. These are the same items that had Prime free shipping before, so no real difference there, you just have to combine items to total over $25. Note that when you add items in your cart and go to check out, the shipping charges are added. You have to change the toggle selection to the ""free shipping"" option to actually get the free shipping.\n4. You won\'t get any free one-day shipping or two-day shipping anymore. Most things seem to take about 4 days to a week to arrive now.\n5. When you check out, the payment option will default to your Amazon store card, so you will have to manually change it to another payment option. For example, if you want to use a different cash back credit card to pay. This is annoying, but also workable.\n6. I didn\'t totally cancel my Prime but instead put my Prime on HOLD. I did this, because we watched some Prime streaming shows, and I didn\'t want to lose that history in case we add Prime again in the future. I\'ve heard all that history will be erased if you cancel Prime completely. I can\'t say what happens to your order history, but I think that would stay intact, but maybe someone who has actually canceled Prime will add their experiences.\n7. One other irritation is this glitch I keep running into (This may only be because I put Prime on hold, and because of MS Edge browser). Every time I go to check out, I get hung up on this ""Resume Prime"" page, and the only way I can get to my cart is to back up, save one item for later, close the browser window, reopen Amazon, add the item back in and then go to payment again. Annoying, but I\'ve figured out a way around it, so it\'s not a problem anymore, just irritating.\n\nI\'m happy that we ""cut the cord"". We saved $140. We would miss Prime video, but we feel like we already watched every show worth watching anyway, so it was time for a break. We just watch Netflix more now, and a lot of old DVDs we never got around to watching before.', 'jpporcaro: I canceled it the year that all those ""amazon prime users more likely to spend a lot of money on amazon"" articles came out, maybe 2018ish?

The number of 'sorry, but your package is undeliverable' episodes has gone bananas over the last six months or so. Even when already out for delivery, items will simply not show up and become 'lost' thereby obviously 'undeliverable.' I'd say close to one in 10 orders now just vanishes prior to delivery. Just a wild crazy guess on my part, but I'd say there's a major theft problem along the supply line with a lot of Prime vendors in the area, and due to staffing challenges (and other reasons) it can't be fixed.

Plenty of time to fix it, though. After all, I did order them Monday night. Last week. They did not send the item out until I tried to cancel, this Monday. This is not the first time it\'s happened, it is, in fact, extremely common. It\'s happened on things I tried to cancel within the span of 24 hours, and things will often take this much time or more if I just patiently wait like I\'m supposed to. It\'s gotten to the point where I\'ve been tempted to game the system by cancelling products the day after I order in order to force Amazon to send the product, but I don\'t want to overwork their already slave-driven staff. In any case, for someone who\'s lived rural, I find it curious that you didn\'t consider how remote my location is, and why I would rely on e-commerce in the first place. \n\n2: Amazon is giving me a refund on an item that took forever to ship. It shouldn\'t take 3 business days to ship a Prime item. When it arrives, I have to send it back, wait for it to ship back to them, and then receive my refund. They will not give me my money back ahead of time, and I do not have the money to buy two pairs of boots. \n\n3: It was a prime item. It did take as long as I\'m claiming to ship. Not deliver, but ship. I live in Canada which may affect this, but if that\'s the case I strongly believe they should rephrase their 2-day shipping advertisement to be more accurate.\n\n4: I\'m more upset that it doesn\'t seem to matter to them that I\'m upset enough to cancel everything. They don\'t care. They don\'t need my patronage. I spent thousands a year on their overpriced crap because of their ""cUsToMeR sErViCe"" (which admittedly used to be amazing) but every time I need something from them recently it\'s ""Sorry..."" and patiently waiting for me to disconnect. The customer service representatives can\'t do ANYTHING to help me on any of my issues. I\'m not even mad at them, it\'s just frustrating that the higher ups give them so little power because they don\'t need to compete with anyone anymore.\n\n5: Your experience doesn\'t invalidate mine. I\'m struggling to see why this is being framed as a counter-argument. My experience has been that shipping is taking longer than ever, Canada Post strikes and Covid included, and the customer service doesn\'t seem to care while the ones that do care have their hands tied behind their back because it\'s cheaper than giving them the power to problem solve.\n\nI\'m remaining unhappy because I just spent the last of my food money on a pair of boots that will get me terminated the SECOND I enter the job site with them on my very first day, because they lack the proper safety toe and pierce resistance bottom. I practically bought a pair of lightweight trendy boots that I can\'t return until Monday of next week. I was willing to be hungry for a week if it meant having gainful employment and a cheque at the end of it.\n\nThanks, you\'ll have to take my word for it but I don\'t actually downvote anyone.']"

It was a bed, nightstand, and dresser from Amazon. Total came out to about $635. Cool. I placed the order and the expected delivery was March 20th. Awesome. Close to March 18th, I was notified that it was running a little late and the new delivery date was March 24th. It wasn't too big of a difference, so I didn't think anything of it. 

Bare in mind I've used Amazon for years and never really had any issues.

Well, on March 24th, there still was no updates past ""shipment label created"" and ""carrier picked up package."" I called Amazon, and they said that they haven't received an update, that they hated I haven't received it yet, etc. But this rep created a return label for something I never received without letting me know. She transferred me, and they said that the previous rep created a return label but didn't know why. The current one canceled it and said they put in a ticket. They advised me to reach out to the manufacturer because their system says they never received it from them.

There is no way to contact the manufacturer. All contact information provided by Amazon and Google ensures that you cannot reach support.

I called UPS to see if they had an update. They said that Amazon had only created the shipment label. But has not dropped off the package to be shipped.

Called back about 7 business days later. Same thing. Stated the previous rep had created a return label that was canceled and they ""recreated"" a ticket.

Called back about 5 days later. They started pushing for a refund and I said that honestly I just wanted what I ordered. I wouldn't have ordered it if I didn't need it. I said that I'm okay with a refund if there was no way of me receiving my product. Then proceeded to tell me that a refund was impossible because of the return label created and that I had to wait for the return label to expire. 

Now no one has given me any information. I was told I'd hear back by email for a resolution for 2 weeks now and I haven't heard anything. I don't believe a case or claim was ever created because they refused to give me any information on it.

I've asked them to escalate the issue. It's been almost 2 months. And idk what to do. I'm out over $600 and I need a bedroom set for my child.

At this point idk what else to do. Any advise or help would be greatly appreciated"	6	"['constantly-confused9: Charge back on your credit cards.', ""BlueberryNo5849: Can't Amazon block you from making purchases moving forward if you do that?"", 'constantly-confused9: People have said that, and others seem to not have an issue at all.

I ordered a bottle of Grande Lash Serum online, and it never came in the mail. I contacted customer service about it to track where the package had gone, and they said that they weren't able to give me a refund or a replacement because of this clause in their Conditions of Use policy that talks about risk of loss. In their response they quoted this: 

>""All items purchased from Amazon.com are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.""

The lash serum was super expensive (I splurged around 70 dollars on it!) and I'm really upset that customer service isn't doing anything to help with it. At this point, I just want my money back because I spent the money on a product that I didn't receive. I'm feeling a little lost as to what I can do now because I've tried to talk to customer service and they pretty much said ""too bad"" and left it there.

&#x200B;

I purchased a monitor from amazon that has been nothing but issues.  They cancelled my order first, delayed it two more times after re-ordering.  It arrived 3 weeks after.  When checking the status of my refund they told me the item was delivered.  I explained my conversation with support but they said the agent was ""mistaken"" and can't do that.  I already recycled the box and they are refusing to work with me.

&#x200B;

Looking for advice on how to proceed?  

&#x200B;

I don't want to purchase a box with my own money to send back. 

&#x200B;

Amazon asked me to put the monitor out front of my house on Monday to see if UPS will pick it up, I fear it will get stolen and then I really wouldn't get my refund.  Do I dispute charges with my bank?  When talking to support they eventually just repeat over and over ""We've already shipped you the box, it's not our fault you discarded it"".

&#x200B;

This monitor is 49""

Boxes are expensive."	1	[]

I don't know if my account was compromised but when I checked, it didn't seem to be, there were no unrecognized devices.

However the web interface doesn't inspire me with confidence. There's no way to see where my Amazon account is logged in, just how many places it's logged in.

The next day I had realized ordered the wrong band size so I ordered the right band size (it was too late to cancel). I figured I’d leave it in the locker for them to take back and receive a full refund. I never took possession ofThe Watch. It was returned back to Amazon on 3/20. About 2 weeks afterwards I called and they said it could take up to 30 days and to call again on 4/20 if I still have not received a refund. Bummer. But whatever. 

Fast forward to today, 4/22 and still no refund. I called and they are refusing to give me a refund since they haven’t received it yet. Again, I never took possession of the item!

&#x200B;

I have heard the horror stories about people receiving fake and used items on Amazon, but I thought it was incredibly rare and won't happen to me. I was also receiving 5% back on my credit card this quarter to order from Amazon, so I thought this would be the best purchasing option for me, boy was I wrong. So I ordered an expensive Item on Amazon ($1200) and when it showed up the box was empty, the Charger was in the box and a small screwdriver but the item itself was missing, You could even see an imprint in the packaging from where the item used to be but the Item itself was not there. It was as if someone ordered the item, stole it, sent it back to Amazon, and they restocked it and sent it out to me.  Once I realized this, I immediately called customer service, and they told me to ship the empty box back, which I did that day. A few days later, The item on my orders page went from ""return started"" back to ""delivered"" because Amazon thought I sent them back an incomplete return.  I called customer support a few times and each time I was told very shortly with no explanation that the Item would not be refunded until May 10th. I was finally able to get in touch with someone who could explain the situation to me, and apparently I was never supposed to have been issued a return label in the beginning, because this happened the warehouse received an item they were not supposed to and marked it as an incomplete return. Due to being marked an incomplete return for whatever reason, they cannot issue a refund until May 10th. She even reached out to 3 mangers above her, and no one has the ability to override the hold on the refund. So, moral of the story is, never order expensive Items on Amazon if you don't want to risk having your money held up for over a month.

We would be instructed, by the client themselves, to salvage and re-box (if needed) returned, non-faulty units.

Unless there were some stock issues, I don't particularly see why a warehouse would care one way or another besides having the client use more pallet spaces to the tune of a quid or two every day. And of course, if the client didn't want that, they'd make it known to save to money.\n\nSimilarly, a brick and mortar store is going to be doing it too.

1681962793.0	19-Apr-2023 20:53:13	I pre-ordered a book on January 27. It was released on February 15. It still hasn’t shipped and Amazon is telling me to buy it, more expensively, from a third-party seller.	Karnakite	18	12sl2vy	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/12sl2vy/i_preordered_a_book_on_january_27_it_was_released/	"The order isn’t canceled, it just stays in the “We’ll let you know when it ships” limbo.

I’ve heard of issues with Amazon keeping pre-ordered items in stock, like video games, but with books I usually hear the opposite - pre-orderers get them often on the day of release. This is a somewhat niche non-fiction book, so I don’t believe that the demand is quite so high that they can’t send it out in two months. The only way to purchase it on Amazon during those two months has been through third-party sellers for a markup.

When I first contacted Amazon Support, I was told that a “glitch” in their system had resulted in my nearest warehouse not having it in stock. Which seemed strange (why not just ship it from a different warehouse, then?) and that’s when they first suggested that I purchase it through a third-party seller and have them refund me. I didn’t wish to use a third-party seller since I wouldn’t receive it as quickly, and basically a lot of the guarantees I would get through Amazon would not apply without a lot more of back-and-forth afterwards if there was an issue.

I tried again to check up on the status of Amazon’s stock a week and a half or so later, and they won’t answer the question directly. They just keep telling me to cancel the order if I didn’t receive it and no longer want it (but I do), and to use a third-party seller to get the item and have them reimburse me the difference afterward (I don’t trust third-party sellers and pre-ordered and have Prime for a reason). 

Is there any chance that Amazon will finally ship my book? Is this normal? Or do I have to bite the bullet and go through a third-party seller and get a refund of the excess cost?"	20	"['moonbeam127: can you order from another website, barnes noble, indie bookstore etc?\n\nyou can just use some thing other than amazon.', 'IndiaEvans: So frustrating.

Then have Amazon refund you.  \nIt's absolutely nonsensical for them to not have your book available since you pre-ordered it.  \nI know, years ago, I pre-ordered a video game from Amazon and everyone who ordered from Gamestop got it before me.  Not only did they refund me but they added an additional $5 credit for the trouble."", ""cozalt: In general, I suggest shying away from pre-ordering. There's never really a point to it, unless you get some sort of amazing pre-order bonus, but it serves no purpose. Always wait for reviews first before purchasing. Just my 2-cents. This goes especially for Amazon who have a track record of screwing up pre-orders royally time and time again.\n\nWas your initial purchase done fulfilled by Amazon? Also, were you charged? If so, Amazon is responsible to either get you the product or cancel the order due to being out of stock. I find it really odd they are telling you to cancel the order yourself. I would get on the phone with their support again and complain. The initial representative you spoke to likely doesn't know anything, so hopefully next call gets you someone competent. But if this is the continued answer you get, your only option may be to cancel.\n\nWhy do you not trust third-party sellers? Unless you had a really bad experience in the past, if the seller has a good rating percentage (over 90%), there isn't really anything to be worried about. Truth is, Amazon themselves would probably have under a 90% based on their rate of failures. Regardless if you order directly from Amazon or a 3rd-party, you're still backed by Amazon's A-Z guarantee. 3rd-parties have to follow the same rules as Amazon in regards to handling orders and support. If not, they will have a low rating.\n\nMy advice would be to contact Amazon support again and try your best to have them resolve it.

Is there any way to get the account back? I don't even know if I'm using the right bank statement. This is the picture i sent them (uncensored) and they said it was invalid.

I just got off the phone with Amazon customer service about a charge I got this morning for nearly $100.It said that they were unable to accept the return of my textbook rental for the following reasons: ""Pages Damage"". And I definitely didn't damage the book, anything that would have been damaged was in transit.

They then went on to say that they would ship me the item within 30 days and it would apparently be mine to keep. Well the kicker to me, is I have an email saying they received this book in December of 2022, and they are JUST NOW noticing damages? They also just so happened to have announced earlier this month that they are stopping the textbook rental services. Seems rather.. Convenient? Anyways, I called customer service and luckily I was able to get a refund. The lady on the phone was really nice and understanding, and when talking about the charge mentioned that there are literally no damages and that it is just a random charge that is incorrect. The way she worded it was rather vague, but she mentioned that it's odd to receive a charge for it 4 months after they received it.

If any of you guys have purchased an Amazon rental in the last half year or so I would heavily suggest checking that you aren't charged for it recently! I don't really have any evidence to back it up, maybe it was just unlucky timing, but it really feels like they are just trying to get get rid of all their textbooks by charging people and sending them the copy now that they don't rent them anymore.

It's really frustrating because there's nothing I can really do to prove that, but I have to wait 7-10 business days to get my money back now because they can just charge my account at any time for no reason. And if I happened to miss that email I would be missing the money entirely, for a completely fraudulent reason.

Let this also be a good reminder to take pictures of your rentals before returning, I didn't have any and I was worried that it would be an issue when requesting my refund."	0	[]

So a few days ago, I decided to purchase an item, like I usually do. Later the same day, I got an e-mail stating my account will be closed and all active orders will be cancelled, because I ""continue to request refunds"":

I've been buying items from Amazon for the past 10 years, and I've only ever gotten a refund once some years back, for a low value item. I've purchased plenty of items, including some high value ones, without issues.

I sent them a response, letting them know this is possibly some kind of automated false positive, but they replied telling me they've ""previously closed an account of mine, for violating their terms"", which is not true:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a81z1wqgqoua1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e790e1446de9413d111ba114b30d41617187dd1f

Because of this, I had to take down my android apps I developed and published on the Amazon Appstore, but also migrate my website and e-mail from AWS. I've been using Amazon services for years, and been paying them monthly for all these services without issues.

Does anyone know how this could happen? I don't understand how they connected me to some other account that (from what I understand) displayed scammy behaviour.

Edit:

Some people suggested to look into the ""Messages"" section of my Amazon account. I still have access to that account, and when looking at the Messages, I couldn't see those e-mails at all.

I contacted Amazon Support through the live chat, and the Amazon Custom Support confirmed the e-mails were genuine. I asked them if there's anything I can do, or what options I have, and they mentioned they will contact the Specialist Team and take it from there.

I'm not sure if anything will come out of this, since the Specialist Team told me there's nothing that can be done in the first place.

Edit 2:

I received another email from Amazon, which was literally a copy paste of the 2nd email they sent (the second image of this post).

I have already migrated my website and email away from AWS, and taken down my apps from Amazon App store. The irony is I know pay less for my website and email hosting, I always assumed AWS is the cheapest option out there but I was wrong!

It doesn't seem Amazon is interested on resolving this at all, so feels like this is the end of the story.

1681821068.0	18-Apr-2023 05:31:08	How can I STOP Amazon from using USPS?	senpaisai	5	12qlhol	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/12qlhol/how_can_i_stop_amazon_from_using_usps/	"As the subject says, I have Prime and I ordered two items within the next day delivery window that are now 1 day late because Amazon didn't put them in a blue Prime van for delivery like my last two deliveries last week. No, they fobbed it off to USPS. Now what's going to happen is USPS won't even attempt the delivery. They'll take look one look at my address and say, ""He lives in an apartment. This won't fit in his compartment. Since we're too lazy to walk up one flight of steps, drop it front of his door with a knock and leave, let make this bastard come to the post office,"" which defeats the entire purpose of throwing free money every month at Amazon for NOTHING, and I got to spend $2 for a 90 minute round trip on the bus just to go to pick up something from the Post Office that they should've never possessed in the first place ... 

USPS is more than capable of treating me (or anyone) like this without Amazon's spoon in the soup and without me financing it. They'll do in their own right. But Amazon Prime, FedEX, and UPS will either drop the packages at a tenant's door or downstairs in front the mailboxes (where they can get stolen) and I'm usually standing outside waiting when the Amazon driver is 2 stops away since the leasing office will no longer accept or sign for parcels because the ladies are sick and tired of catching COVID from every Tom, Dick, and Harry that waltzes in. 

Why in the Jesus H. Dice Collecting F--K was this package foisted on USPS in the first place has me livid because I'm on a deadline here and needed that package yesterday and believed I'd get it yesterday and would've if somebody didn't invite USPS into the mix. How do I stop this from happening? I have CANCELED USPS. Aside from tax payer financed junk mail, in no way, shape, or form do I EVER want to do business with them or want them handling my business, and I don't want to conduct any further business with anyone that'll outsource delivery to USPS at their own whim and against my will and wallet when I'm a subscriber to their exclusive service. There's got to be a way to stop Amazon from using USPS otherwise I'll cancel Amazon totally and take my business to NewEgg, B&H, etc. It's getting to the point where if I get a USPS tracking number in my email, I'll cancel the order."	25	"[""Border_Relevant: I had issues with Canada Post not delivering.

I live in a normal house with a mailbox at the street but every time it's using USPS I know there are going to be screw ups. \n\nNot only is the tracking completely unreliable and always seem to get delayed when its USPS but they'll do shit like stuff my mailbox with packages that shouldn't be in there and drop packages below the mailbox instead of at the door. This wouldn't be a huge deal but they drop it off at such random times like 7-9PM at night and the tracking isn't accurate so it may end up sitting exposed for a long period of time. \n\nThey haven't done it in a while, but it used to frequently happen where they would say they attempted to deliver something but I wasn't home, but they don't realize I'm working from home so I know they're full of shit. Happened frequently with USPS but as soon as I was about to report it it finally stopped."", ""J3ST3Rx: You can't. \n\nI talked to a manager and he attempted to deprioritize USPS, but he told me it is not a guarantee. \n\nNeedless to say it didn't happen and I canceled Prime after 15 years."", 'Maleficent-Clock8109: This is why i canceled prime.

I tried every feasible way to put an address into Amazon that worked for everything that tried to include the PO box info in the physical address on another line and kept having packages get returned for invalid address before it made it to the local post office.  When this happened the order would disappear for a couple of weeks before showing up invalid, because there was no indication it was with USPS.  I gave up and put a physical mailbox in in order to be able to reliably get mail from Amazon.  \n\nIronically Apple also is unable to deal with a PO box with their credit card.  I had to put the physical address of the post office building into their system.\n\nIts amazing that Amazon and Apple are these massive technology companies and can't handle dealing with something as trivial as a PO box in your address.

After redeeming the cards I started spending until I was randomly locked out of my account. I’ve submitted clear evidence of the receipts multiple times. They have all been denied by the “specialist” in automated noreply emails as if an AI is reviewing the receipts. The receipts even have the same date that I was locked out of my account. All I need is to contact the specialists themselves via call.  Customer service claims that they can only email the specialist but myself as the customer cannot. I don’t understand this. I was a loyal customer to this company. I just want my gift card balance back or have them send the money back to us in some way. Falsely closing my account with a large balance sounds like a law suit. I can tell that a professional is not reviewing my receipts that we downloaded to the portal several times. My receipt pictures are very clear with everything on them including scratched gift cards.When I call CS & speak to the supervisors, they are zero help & all use the same script of “I will escalate this to the specialist” after telling them numerous times that the “specialist” is not accepting my evidence. Then after I tell them this, they say “wait 24-48 hrs for an email from the same automated-seeming “specialist” denying my proof via noreply email. Am I tripping ?

My Amazon account got blocked after I used legit gift cards and sent them to the “gc-address-verification@amazon.com” email.
I used 5 gift cards and I sent them the physical pictures of them with 4 receipts (lost one)
After sending them and talking with the customer service that told me “yea it will be enough for evidence” I received one day after email saying my account is closed. (????)
Now I got 1000$ locked in.
Please what I can do release it? Maybe any email address for some1 in Amazon that will actually care about something instead of randomly closing accounts.

Any help will be appreciated 🙏🏼"	2	"[""SirSlenderPhoenix: They're not usually legit when you purchase GC codes in bulk and making this same topic multiple times won't help you.""]"

The day after I received it there was a sale on Amazon giving away a free pair of Oneplus Buds Pro 2 earphones with it, so I ordered again and sent the first phone back for a refund. 

Amazon have refunded the second item minus the relative cost of the earphones, so they have refunded me £671.56, when I should in fact have received a refund for £799. 

This is not a mistake on my end. I 100% know I sent back the first phone (and made sure of this as I was wary of this situation occurring). I spoke to customer service and they said that IMEIs are checked when phones are returned so there couldn't be a mistake. I have sent them proof of the IMEI of the phone that I currently have in my possession, but I haven't heard anything back for a while now.

I am tempted to just return the phone that I have now in order to receive another refund, but if they check the IMEI they will notice that this is not the first phone, and I might not receive another refund at all.

I am running out of time to return and not sure what to do.

When I tell them that my packages aren't delivered, they tell me to ""wait 48 hours, and if it isn't, contact us back for a refund,"" but when I do, they don't refund.

That's 400 dollars, dude. I saved up for 3 months to buy it and it mislabeled ""delivered"" when it clearly wasn't.

I disputed with Chase, and they gave me the temporary credit, but Amazon once again is telling me to shove it and that they aren't ""responsible"".

Out of hundreds of orders since November, my family has returned five orders.  Yet four of the returns played out as follows:

Amazon send's an email 6-7 weeks after the return was initiated stating ""We've issued your refund in advance for the item below, but we were expecting to receive the return by X date. Because we've not received the item yet, your original payment method has been charged again.""

I'll check the tracking of the return and it will show as successfully delivered to Amazon's receiving dock 5-6 weeks earlier, so I contact Amazon.

Amazon customer service says ""Sorry about that. I've fixed our mistake and I've issued you a full refund in the amount of X back to your original payment method.""  Despite that interaction, hours later I'll get an order refund email that says

Reason for refund: Account adjustment. Refund amount X.

And the refunded amount shown will only be half of the full refund amount that was promised.

Amazon has done this on FOUR separate occasions since December.  Each instance I'll contact them a second time and they say ""sorry, we'll fix it"" and do actually process the remainder due.

Yet, the last couple times they've refunded the remaining half balance due to me, I'm getting emails stating that it's a ""goodwill concession.""  Or the latest is emails noting UNRELATED orders are getting refunded to refund me the promised balance.  These are unrelated orders of which I never initiated a return to begin with and the Amazon reps are giving bogus reasons for that return like ""Reason for refund: Damaged during transit""

My package got picked up-- but not by amazon men, but amazon contractors? It was so weird because neither one of them gave me a sticker or any kind of tracking info, nor were they wearing the amazon vests, nor did they have their delivery truck nearby; instead they just said they're returning to the warehouse at 5 pm so that's when it'll get back. They said they don't work for amazon but they work for JB Hunt and contract with Amazon. The return tracker is still stuck on  "" picked up and on the way back"". If it wasn't for that I'd feel like I just got scammed -- and honestly maybe I did. Still no refund on my $1100. Never ordering anything serious from amazon again.  sigh.   


  
\*original post\* Hi y'all. Weird turn of events over here. I ordered a $1100 prime product (yes, triple checked it was Prime, but it was shipped by Amazon and sold by a third-party seller in China so i kinda fudged up on that one I think?) Either way, the thing is defective. It's a treadmill and is structurally lopsided, completely unusable. I started a return the same day I got it, left a one-star review with pictures of the very obvious defect on the product page, and Amazon told me the only pick up date was three weeks away, so I said fine, whatever. It's a big and heavy package, I get it. Today, a week later, I get a message from the  seller (through my Amazon messages portal, so not phishing), that they're offering me a full refund on the product and I just need to reply to the message saying ""Full Refund.""  I called Amazon customer service just now to see why the seller is contacting me when I've already set up a return through Amazon and whether I should procure my refund through them or through Amazon and we just could not understand each other. I'm US based and I don't think the reps were because they just could not get my confusion: I have already arranged a return and refund through Amazon directly, why is the shipper contacting me directly for a refund then? The Amazon customer service rep said it if I went through the seller and they didn't actually refund my money I would be shit out of luck because I side-stepped Amazon. He also said that I'd have to ship my product back to China, which costs like $700 since it is so heavy. I just don't understand why that is when I ordered a product that shipped from the Amazon warehouse here in Seattle? Or is that a bad assumption on my part?  I'm  anxious right now -- it's a ton of money and I just want it back. I've already re-packaged the treadmill and it'll be ready for pick up but after reading some posts on here -- y'all did I get got? I specifically chose a product that is shipped by Amazon so I would not have to mess with international shipping back if it was a bad product (which, surprise, it was).

I just recently signed up for Amazon prime a few days ago so I could get orders without paying per shipment shipping charges (which would apply on all inexpensive orders).  I then placed some orders on April 8th and 9th and expected them to ship promptly since the listed shipping speed is two day shipping. But they haven't shipped yet and the estimated arrival dates are like 2-3 weeks away.  I thought maybe there could be an issue because for some orders I used the subscribe and save option to save like 40 cents or because I selected to ship them to the post office.  So I cancelled my orders and placed them again to ship to my residence w/o subscribe and save but they are still showing far away delivery estimates.  What is exactly going on?  My orders from before I was a prime customer always shipped promptly.  This is in Canada if that makes a difference.\

With a locker it's self service so in theory it's more likely something could occur with the package without Amazon knowing. For example in theory a customer could claim that the locker did not work when in fact it did and they just opened it and took the item from the package and retaped the parcel back up and stuck it back in the locker.\n\nGeneral rule for sellers/ retailers anywhere online is to wait until the item is back in their hands before issuing a refund because it was and still somewhat is a common scam attempt for fraudulent buyers to swap, steal, or claim in item late that is being held at a location by the carrier for pickup."", ""Throwingshead: That's a courtesy credit and those are usually capped at much lesser amounts than this situation.

Between the time I made the purchase and the time I returned it, the card I used to purchase the item was compromised and the credit to my account was blocked my bank because the card had to be deactivated.

Amazon sent me an email saying that I could receive the refund by mail or in the form of gift card balance, and that I should reply to the email with my preference. I replied, but received a response that the email address isn't set up to receive emails. Now I'm stuck.

Has anyone else experienced this? I tried to contact Amazon by phone, it took forever to get through to a human but there was a huge language barrier and they did not understand my issue.

Followed by:

**Update:** I sorted out the refund through their customer service phone line, but that still doesn't explain the confusing email system. I asked about it, and the representative I talked to said that someone should still see my email responses, but they also didn't have any record of my responses and I waited almost two weeks for a response to them.

The problem was that my order tracking was not lining up with what amazon's website stated for the status of the ordered items.  So the customer service rep responded and claimed to have resolved the issue and that the items were just tied up in a distribution center and would be on their way.

Fast forward to today and the items are now designated as being lost and that I would need to have a refund issued for either some or all of the items.  This was pretty frustrating, not simply because the items i had ordered were not going to arrive, but because it felt like customer service had literally done me a disservice by claiming the items would be on their way.

So I was chatting with a different rep, discussing the problems I was having and they continually claimed that this issue would be escalated and resolved and that this would never happen again.  This was very frustrating to me as it felt so fake and manufactured.  I don't expect everything to work perfectly all of the time, I know mistakes happen.  But you tell me this will never happen again, I smell B.S.

So I mentioned that I didn't think this would happen if their workforce were unionized, and the rep pretty quickly ended our chat after that.  I guess I hit a sore spot?

It took 5 attempts just to get chat help.  Their chat system is shameful.  Then they sent me around to 3 divisions to look into the matter.   i would like that person charged if possible.  They hacked and changed my default to an amazon card.  

Is it a crime for anyone or any company to hack into my amazon account and change my default card to their own credit card, without my knowledge or permission, so the amazon charges will be made on the default card,  and any interest will go to the bank and possibly amazon.

It is easy to do during the purchasing process.   There are also several valid reasons why the default will change from the card expiring, not enough funds available and more.    The reality is, who in their right mind will prosecute just because the default card was changed.   It is YOUR responsibility to make sure the proper card is charged when making a purchase.', 'amerifolklegend: It is, in fact a crime in the US to hack your credit card or account. If that happened, absolutely contact authorities and report it. \n\nBut let’s get to the topic you are talking about since none of this has any relation to a hacking of your credit card. What you are upset about is that your default payment got changed to a different credit card that you also have associated with your account. YOU have an account in THEIR system, not the other way around. Them accessing your account is not hacking. Hacking is breaking into your account against your will or permission. As a user of Amazon’s service, you agreed to an account when you signed up - just like any other membership you may be signed up with. Them accessing your account isn’t a hack, it’s just how memberships work. \n\nNow, there are a handful of ways your default payment got switched to a different payment method. You could have agreed to it by paying for an item in the past using the other card, you could have agreed to switch the default card when you signed up or recently agreed to an updated TOS, you may have accidentally switched it, a rep could have accidentally switched it, if you are using a gift card and it can’t cover the payment, a different (valid) method will be chose, and plenty of other reasons.\n\nBut the fact is, switching the default payment system isn’t a crime or anything close. It’s perk of doing business. If you don’t want to use a payment method, don’t hook it up to your account. And when it does happen and you didn’t notice at the time, the problem sorts itself out every time you make a purchase and confirm the payment. It’s the first thing listed under the order summary. Simply switch the payment method and it’s fixed. Additionally, whenever you DO switch the payment method or delivery address, you are prompted to switch to that combo permanently. So even when the payment method IS switched, it’s the user’s fault if the purchase still happens.

GROSS. DO NOT DO THAT.

Do not buy anything from Amazon that you put into your body or onto your body. You do not know what is in it and it could affect your health.

Amazon has a huge counterfeit issue. You think that doesn't apply to cosmetics and lotions and vitamins too? When you order from Amazon, you do not know whether or not you're getting the real thing. Who the reseller is doesn't matter, either, if it's fulfilled by Amazon, it all ships from the exact same bin. They do not have separate bins for fakes vs real. You can get really sick from counterfeit beauty products. It can permanently affect your health and your appearance. Don't take the risk.

Amazon does not have standards for food items. You think your candy has been stored at a correct temperature? You think it's been kept free of pests and vermin? Do you think Amazon cares? 

Ultimately, in the end, Amazon has structured itself so that there is very little liability on them as a corporation if you get hurt or killed from a product they sell. There is no corporate responsibility. Which means it's very Wild West- the onus is on you, as the consumer. Which is impossible with things like food and cosmetics and health supplements because who has a testing laboratory in their basement? If you go down the street to GNC and buy a supplement and it turns out the supplement is actually a knock off and it's full of poison, you have recourse against GNC legally. You do not have that against Amazon because Amazon is going to say they only fulfilled the order, you actually bought it from an independent reseller who is located in some foreign country and is untraceable. 

Do not buy anything off of Amazon that you are going to put into or onto your body. Just don't take the risk. Go to an established store with a corporate structure inside of the United States who has a vested interest in not killing or maiming you, the consumer. Just don't take the risk. It's not worth it."	13	"['squipysquip: Honstly I see your point but you can say this about any store...

You think that doesn't apply to cosmetics and lotions and vitamins too?\n\nAmazon is actually very strict about counterfeits and the problem is not as huge as you think. Sure if you by some random brand lotion who knows what you are really getting but if you buy name brand topicals they are quick to catch fakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Who the reseller is doesn't matter, either, if it's fulfilled by Amazon, it all ships from the exact same bin.\n\nThis is completely false and I'm assuming you read about this in one of the poorly researched online articles that don't know how the system works at all. You are referring to commingled inventory. Any seller can tell you whether or not their items are commingled. Many sellers do not commingle inventory so that they can ensure their products are authentic and the exact items they sent in. Only lazy/ cheap sellers commingle inventory and many stop after they realize the headaches that poor service brings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Amazon does not have standards for food items. You think your candy has been stored at a correct temperature? You think it's been kept free of pests and vermin? Do you think Amazon cares?\n\nAmazon does have standards for foods and yes they actually do have some limitations for candy specifically. Chocolate for example cannot be sent in after April/ May.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you go down the street to GNC and buy a supplement and it turns out the supplement is actually a knock off and it's full of poison, you have recourse against GNC legally. You do not have that against Amazon because Amazon is going to say they only fulfilled the order, you actually bought it from an independent reseller who is located in some foreign country and is untraceable.\n\nThis is also false. If you buy a brand name item from Amazon and receive a knockoff instead which caused damage to property and or caused a health issue you absolutely have recourse against Amazon if the product was fake. Amazon can evade liability and claim they are only a sales channel for branded products that are legitimate branded items but the items themselves caused damage or harm so the manufacturer would be liable."", ""neonturbo: So many Amazon items seem to come in non-authentic packaging.

Electronic components is another where I notice this, you get a couple resistors or capacitors in a baggie. Fake? Who can tell for sure. At the very least they are dividing up larger bulk lots, which may not be what the manufacturer intended. \n\nWith some items I do expect them to come in non-standard packaging. Nuts and bolts for example are often sold to a store in bulk, and even in a retail environment you pick and choose out of a bulk bin. But sweeper belts?

Clearly counterfeit. Wrong brand of zipper, the logo was attached incorrectly. I contacted Amazon and they told me they were not responsible.\n\nMay have been politely trying to tell you they don't believe you. It's not that uncommon for customers to claim things are counterfeit when they are not. IF you believed it was fake you legally have the right to return it if it's within the return period and state the item is not as described. If this happens on a sellers item they will request proof of authenticity for the item. If this was done on Amazon's item they will likely brush you off since they either work directly with Columbia and or Columbia was selling under Amazon's name. Customers are usually not product experts and the vast majority of counterfeit claims are not accurate.\n\nIf you purchased from a legitimate Columbia listing there is no reason to remove the listing since the brand is already heavily regulated on the site.

Both items were brand new , unopened , unused items still in factory packaging. Both had an extra exterior Amazon shipping box. \n\nSo why is Amazon blatantly lying about receiving damaged goods from the consumer? For 20 yrs I\'ve been extremely diligent keeping items in brand new state with all packaging , even the little black trash-bag like twist wraps for electrical cords and whatnot when returning the item. \n\n""However, the number of refunds for items received in a damaged condition in your account exceed the expectation"" -Amazon\n\nThey specifically said ""damaged"". I even responded to the email with order numbers stating that the items were sent back in ""factory sealed boxes"". They doubled down with their response. \nThis is just kind of creepy to me.\n\nI\'m gonna start taking pictures of returns from now on. In fact I\'m kind of intimidated to even do any more returns for fear of getting cancelled. I do not like this feeling. Amazon had been great up to this moment. \n\nThey practically beg you to try on clothes for free which I did only one time in all 20 years and I kept all but 2 items of clothing. So it\'s not like I\'m a serial return abuser. \n\nTheir algorithm is got a glitch or something. I may cancel prime since I really don\'t care if I receive the items in 1-2 days. I don\'t feel like paying extra and getting harassed through emails by ofm dept. \n\nIt may be time for another Amazon-like retailer to enter the space and have some sort of ""verified returns"" center to alleviate the too many returns fiasco.\n\nAmazon did it to themselves by making returns almost way too easy.

It was like a handy shopping bookmarks tool for me, though the rest of the extension's features sucked and were annoying. Unfortunately, Amazon Assistant was discontinued at the end of March and I can't use this function anymore.

So I go to my Amazon wish list on the web to manually add instead, but I can't find any sort of ""Add"" button for non-Amazon links. Am I blind or did they take it away?

I purchased PS5 from Amazon and shipped it to my friend's address in Iowa to bring it with him when he come back home to Dubai. The tracking page says the package was delivered but he said he didn't receive anything or signed anything.

As you know, when you purchase ps5 from Amazon, on the review order page, you get this notice ""signature or one-time password required at time of delivery""​ so, I contacted UPS asking them to provide me a proof of delivery like a photo for the signature of the person who signed the package, they said we don't have this info and go contact Amazon.

Eventually, I gave up and left the chat. I scheduled my own return on the household account and returned the device for a refund a few days later.

The net result was that I was given a refund for the Kindle and a replacement for free. It hadn't been my goal to get a free Kindle, but I wasn't about to complain.

A few days later, I received an email saying my personal Amazon account had been closed. The email had no explanation other than ""we previously closed an account of yours for violating the terms of our Conditions of Use agreement."" I tried to contest it and explain, but got the same message. When I contested again, I was told I had made too many returns, which was when I figured out that this was probably related to the Kindle.

At first it said the shipping was delayed, but it would not allow me to cancel since it was ""close to shipping."" I selected the help option for the order and it recommended I contact the seller, so I messaged asking for the status or cancellation. I didn't think to check if the item was fulfilled by Amazon or not, so I guess that's my mistake, but the response I received from the seller surprised me. They said ""we have no idea when orders are filled or shipped by Amazon, you have more information than we do."" which, OK...? . Then they got a little hostile, adding ""upon reviewing you order history, there is a clear pattern of repeatedly ordering and cancelling orders"" and went on to say that they were working with Amazon to expose people who ""intentionally exploit amazon and our company"". I do have a lot of subscribe and save orders, and yeah, I frequently cancel the orders for whatever reason. I'm pretty sure Amazon doesn't have a policy against that or consider it ""exploitation"".  It also seems to be a fairly high-volume seller, since a lot of their items have 10,000+ review, so it seems strange to take cancellations so personally. So basically, I'm just confused. Has anyone else received a response like this before?

Oh and PS - the order ended up being lost and I was refunded."	10	"[""SilvitniTea: The part that sticks out to me is that they know your order and cancelation history.

I live in a big building in the city with a front desk and security doors. Amazon packages are supposed to go in the parcel pending lockers and we are supposed to get texted a code for the package.

Most people use Amazon and think that they can easily order and arrive home later to that nice little smiling box waiting on them (convenient). But, in the real world there is thieves and more. You have asked Amazon ""deliver my package at this address at this day"" and Amazon has done as you asked. Now should that package get stolen, why call Amazon? Amazon did as you asked, you sacrificed security for that convenience. Amazon states: 

Risk of loss: All purchases of physical items from Amazon are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.

Basically once Amazon delivers the package(s) to where you have asked, it is now your responsibility. Do you drive your car to a mall or store, leave the door open and engine running for the easiest convenience in getting back in after shopping and driving away? or are you secure and locking the doors/taking the keys with you. 

I hate Amazon as much as the next person (maybe a touch more), but honestly, if a package says it was delivered to your house....then that's your fault it was gone when you returned home. True at times Amazon can make a mistake delivering it to a neighbor's house. But then should that neighbor not hand you the package marked with  your name, that is theft. They stole it.

Believe it or not, it ends up I bought 11 keyboards in the raw and return 8! 4 didn't have a WIFI dongle, and another 4 were completely different models. It's like no one even checks returns and they just send them to the next customer.

The problem is that I am sending it back with a comment ""wrong item in the box"" (and I don't want to say anything else because that's exactly what happened), and I'm worried that it will appear that I am the one who took dongles and put the $30 keyboard in place of the $60 keyboard. It feels like I am potentially abusing the return and I do not know what to do. Should I just contact Amazon customer service and try to open a claim or something like that? Does anyone know how they check their returns and what is going on there? Thanks."	4	"[""Throwingshead: Amazon warehouse items are always a gamble.

I ordered a Bissell carpet cleaner from Amazon tried it and it didn’t clean well at all so I hired professionals to come in and clean the carpets instead and I sent the item back to Amazon. 

3 weeks later I get an email from Amazon stating that I returned the wrong item and they won’t be issuing a refund. Confused so I call them and they say the serial number doesn’t match the box so they disposed of my item. I’m beyond confused at this point I tried everything spoke to every level of rep emailed jeff@amazon.com they couldn’t help either. I eventually after a week got a rep to provide the numbers they recorded and the numbers did indeed match but on the box Bissell put the model number before the serial number on the box. Contacted the manufacture (Bissell) and they emailed proof that this is indeed the case the model number is before the serial number on the box and my serial number does match. I forwarded that to Amazon and they refuse to reply.

My last course of action was a chargeback with my bank and to my surprise I just got an email from my bank stating that Amazon provided evidence and my claim has been denied. The evidence you ask? It’s that the item has been used and that goes against their return policy…. So NOW they’ve pivoted their entire reason to fit their narrative. I’m lost for words with this.

Even though the item may say Free Returns, there is now (in my area, anyway) a $6.99 fee to bring your pre labeled return to a UPS dropoff point or a $7.99 fee for UPS pickup. 

Seven dollars is several dollars more than it would cost me to send my small item back to Amazon using USPS the pirateship portal or stamps.com if I paid out of pocket. 

Of course if you call Amazon to object, chances are they will email you a free label for a UPS dropoff point, like they did me. 

But I do not want to have to call customer service every time I need to return something. I get why Amazon would charge extra for UPS pickup but charging Prime customers extra to bring their packaged and labeled return to a dropoff point is beyond the pale. 

If this is a new policy being applied across the board, I am not sure I will keep my Prime Account. I certainly won't buy anything from Amazon that Walmart carries, since Walmart is very near my house and allows returns for a full three months.  

It isn't just the drive to Kohl's/Wholefoods/UPS Store is too far. My nearest UPS store is poorly managed and has particularly unpleasant service (probably because their mgr screams abuse at them). They're nice enough at Wholefoods/Kohl's but the lines are long and sometimes they have to hunt for someone authorized to take the item.

Note: I do not know whether the 6.99 fee applies when you return a defective product. I was returning an unused bike pump I needed to inflate the tires of a dog stroller which I had to return because it couldn't be assembled (the drill-holes were in the wrong places). So when I returned the bike pump, I checked ""no longer needed"". 

But I also had to call Amazon just to get the defective 35 lb. stroller returned because the instructions said I was responsible for return shipping, so it seems to me that the convenience we are paying for is severely degraded."	15	"[""m0nsterhuntr: This has been going on for awhile near me as well.

If Amazon had to pay to have UPS go to the customer's home to pick up a return, they would stop accepting returns.  Why should they pay UPS to pick up an item from you?

The only returns I have ever done were for either the wrong item being sent or a defective product. \n\nSo, this new system of charging people to bring an item to a UPS store is either regional, based on customer's return history or it only applies to return reasons other than wrong item or defective item."", 'DoubleCapable725: Actually that is what i used to do - mark it defective, but as of yesterday or so, even the defective option still says you have to pay 6.99 to drop it off at UPS.

Flash forwards to a few days ago I decide to reread one and download the app on my phone after learning it was an app I could get.  Log in, and it says to verify phone number ending in xx.  My entire family has had the same numbers the entire time and none of them ended in these numbers.  Now I'm a bit concerned, but my number is 1 button away on the keyboard, so maybe.  I call and they say it's on hold for suspicious activity since essentially my sophomore year (graduated '17) and they never bothered to tell me, due to ""suspicious activity"".  They send me an email asking for verification of card ending in xxxx.  I've never owned a card ending like that, and even if I had a gift card like that I couldn't possibly find it or a receipt for it, so it cannot be possibly verified.  So thanks to Amazon not telling people their accounts are locked, I've lost $200-$400 dollars in books.

When I try to log in on the app it asks for the billing address and a billing statement which I don’t feel comfortable giving to a company. 

So I called Amazon and they submit a request to unlock my account, to my understanding it takes 24 hours or under for them to look at my account and get back to me, and once my account is unlocked the hold on my orders will be lifted. 

The thing I’m most worried about not getting is the legend of Zelda tears of the kingdom pro controller because it’s very hard to pre order them and I don’t want to pay 140-300 dollars for one on eBay. 

The person at Amazon who I spoke with Told me that once they email or text me back I won’t have to send them a billing statement I will only have to provide the last 4 digits and the expiration date of the card used. 

But what I want to know is:

Is it most likely I’ll get my account back?

Is it likely my orders (especially the pro controller) will still be there? 

And finally, did they person at Amazon lie to me when they told me that once they email or text me back I won’t have to send them a billing statement I will only have to provide the last 4 digits and the expiration date of the card used?

Thank you for all your help in advance and I hope to hear from people soon. I’m sorry about bothering all of you and wasting your time, I just really really don’t want to lose my pre-order on such a hard limited time item to obtain."	20	"['xncee: happened to me.\n\nfor me it was because my account was new and i paid using gift cards only..\n\nI sent about 50 messages to these email addresses:\n\namazon-payments-cb-buyer-info@amazon.com\n\nmanagingdirector@amazon.con\n\ndave@amazon.com\n\njeff@amazon.com\n\ncb-info+A3A4ECF7JUTKY0@amazon.com\n\ncb-info@amazon.com\n\naddress-verification@amazon.com\n\necr@amazon.com\n\nchargeback-alert@amazon.com\n\ngc-account-alert@amazon.com\n\ncs-reply@amazon.com\n\ncb-info+A19KOA0XYZ8UX1@amazon.com\n\nsubject: LOCKED ACCOUNT - (your amazon account email)\n\nexplain your situation and upload a pdf file that includes the following:\n\n1- a picture of your visa card (blur the card number, only the last 4 digits is needed)\n\n2- a picture of your ID\n\n3- if you used a gift card, upload a receipt for it (if it was a physical gift card u can just take a picture for it and upload it)\n\n4- a screenshot for the transaction from your bank account\n\n*make sure to include your account email and phone number in your message\n\n*send the messages on a different times\n\n*if u received an email that says ur account has been deleted, just ignore it that\'s not true.\n\n\nyou will receive an email after 24h that saying ""your account was reinstated"".\n\nif u have any questions i\'d be happy to help :)', ""FFX-2: What did you do to get it locked?

I don't return many purchases, and when ever I would return via UPS store, I would get my refund an hour after the UPS store clerk would scan my item for return. This has always been the case. Recently I returned an item on March 26th at the same UPS store I always take my returns to. 5 days later and no refund. To make things worse it seems UPS has lost the package. The return is coming from Cali to Vegas and should have been delivered the next day. It has been 6 days now, and for the last two days the tracking # went from showing ""**Delayed**"" to "" **The delivery date will be provided as soon as possible**."" One UPS rep told me it's more than likely lost, yet another said ""**it's normal, it's still in transit, please wait**"". No help there.

I gave amazon a call early in the morning and was connected with a young lady who told me she will process my refund right away and that I should see it in 2-3 hours.  5 hours passed and no refund! However, she did close my return, and the status changed from ""return started"" to showing the original delivery date. Only made things more confusing!

Once again I got to chatting with another Amazon Rep, and now I'm being told they are waiting on the item to return and it can take 2 weeks and up to 30 days to process the refund. No help there! 

Did they recently change their return policy? I have never had to actually wait for the item to return to their warehouse to get the refund. What changed? And what do I do now? Both UPS and Amazon are giving me the run around. If the package is lost, I need the tracking to actually show it's lost or Amazon will just keep telling me ""it's in transit"".

The more expensive the item the more likely that would be the case since a manual inspection would be needed to complete the return. Amazon has done this for a long time and the only thing that may change is which items will qualify for instant refunds at drop off scan ad which items won\'t. You do not get refunded before the item is delivered and processed because it is a fraud prevention tactic.

Yesterday,   i requested a return for a couple items that i wasn't really happy   with, and the return request was accepted, i received an email by the   shipping service saying that they would come next week to grab the   packages, however, today, i received this email from [ofm@amazon.com](mailto:ofm@amazon.com),   should i be worried about it? Should i cancel my return request or  this  one is fine as long as i won't make new ones after this? I'm very   worried about it, i will definitely think twice before buying an item   from now on and maybe investigate more with reviews and stuff like that,   but what i'm wondering is if the return that i already asked and is   going to be picked up next week will be fine, or if it's better if i   delete it.

Also honestly i never  returned something with missing parts, obvious signs of use or not cased  in the same package... Yeah i made maybe too many returns lately (4-5)  but they were all returned in perfect conditions.

Obviously even Amazon no longer gives a damn about Amazon...why should anyone here?

I've been a customer since 2002, the earliest of Amazon's days.  (I used to order actual books!  Still do sometimes!)  I'm vine voice and all that ""jazz"" of yesteryear.  I used to be in the ""top 5,000"" Amazon reviewers, but even that isn't even ""measured"" anymore.  I'd vent on Amazon's own forums, but pretty much every avenue of public communication are shut down.  Even r/amazon is highly curated, to protect the constant onslaught of their decline.

I've cancelled Prime twice before, when service goes to crap.  I've been through the ups and downs before.  It used to be that cancellation of Prime sent a message, especially when it comes from their so called ""prestigious"" customer base.  No one is listening anymore!  I think I'm finally done once and for all.

I've got a dozen orders, sitting in ""we will email you with a delivery date"" for at least three to four weeks now.  I contact customer service and they can't tell me anything the website hasn't.  ""Errr, the computer says we don't know?""  The only offered option is to cancel the order.

I really, really don't get it.  Here you've got Amazon laying off thousands of workers, shutting down entire sectors of their business...and yet they can't even perform the very most basic thing the website is supposed to do called sales?  Like, hello?

I know this isn't a systemic problem, and probably relates to geographic regions and the incredible complexity (and code/automation) they've built into ordering & fulfillment systems.  Yet, I order from other companies and it turns out they ship stuff to me!

I\'ve slowly learned that ""Same-Day Delivery"" is just a lie meant to drive business away from brick and mortars.\n\nI also think the general downgrade in quality of products on Amazon is staggering. They turned Amazon Basics into a logistical nightmare for the U.S. Patent Office by creating an AI that generates random company names, then applies for a patent under that company name, and then prints that logo on cheap, foreign, mass-produced products and then lists them, in an effort to create more business for themselves and reduce competition with their legitimate sellers. In essence, the majority of ""Sellers"" on Amazon, are just fake business\' that Amazon has created to maintain that the majority of searched items on a single page are from their own fake business\'.

It all boils down to the fact that the company treats them like crap, so they don\'t give a crap about their job, that, once again, has proven a 100% success rate of screwing its\' employee\'s at every possible opportunity. It just sucks that, inadvertently, the paying customer catches the most flak as an innocent bystander in this weird, back-and-forth, retributive skirmish between management and worker-base.\n\nI\'m 100% going to Walmart from now on.

GaymerZane94	25	1256yfw	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1256yfw/rant_wildly_inconsistent_customer_support_amazon/	"I've been an amazon customer for years and never really had issues until now. For context I've ordered plenty of small and a few expensive items before, so I didn't think twice about placing another order with them for an expensive item. 

So I've had an issue over the last few days with amazon. Bought a computer from them (huge mistake) for nearly £1,000 that was meant to arrive on the 23rd. On the day of delivery, the driver asked for the code, gave us two tiny boxes with random other orders, and drove off even after we told him the order was definitely wrong, the driver then lied on his delivery claiming he gave us the computer. 

I messaged amazon, sent photographic proof of the wrong order, and was told I had to return the £10 bath bars they sent wrongly to get refunded the money they had taken from me. They claimed it would take 2 weeks for the item to be returned to them, and 30+ days to process a refund. I then called up and was told the item would definitely arrive by the 25th, and if not I wouldn't need to return the random wrong order and could throw it away and would get a refund within the week. I was also told amazon had no way of tracking the item as it was sent by a 3rd party (I emailed said 3rd party, they sent me proof that it was distributed by amazon...) 

Fast forward to the 25th - no package. First I was told I wasn't due a refund, then I was told an investigation had to be raised (by the same agent) and not to contact them for 72 hours and to await a resolution. 

I call today, and I'm told the investigation isn't complete after over 72 hours and I'll be contacted shortly. (I wasn't.) I then went back to chat, to be told by two chat people that because I gave the delivery driver the delivery code, I wasn't due a refund even if I can prove they never delivered the item, both then ended the chat before I could ask any further questions. One tried to accuse me of lying, by saying ""why would you give them the code if they didn't have an item?!"" To which I explained I had 3 items coming, and he had a small box in his hand, and I assumed there were other boxes, because thats how amazon has always delivered to me before. One then sent an email saying that if I want a refund, I have to send back the item that I never received... 

At last I got through on the phone, and after 30 minutes on hold the agent asked sensible questions that nobody else bothered to ask, like ""whats the QA code on the wrong order box?"" The moment I gave her it, she immediately knew I'd been given the wrong item as it didn't match any order on my account. She said I'd definitely be due a refund within 5-7 days, they'd email me confirming it (they didn't despite being helpful which makes me insanely nervous) and to check back by the coming saturday if I have no refund. 

How on earth can I trust anything any of them have said though, when I have a whole bunch of emails saying different things from different agents, even within minutes of each other? The people on the calls are 100% more friendly and understanding than the people on the live chat by far, the people on live chat genuinely don't seem to understand whats being said, are outright aggressive, disconnect chats and just seem to read from a script. 

If I don't have the refund by saturday I'm going to have to do a chargeback as it's quite literally theft on amazons part to swap out an item for a wildly different one, then refuse to refund me for the item I paid for. I don't think I'll ever buy an expensive item from amazon again, or frankly any item from them again if I have to file for a chargeback. I work in customer service myself, and this has honestly been the most frustrating and disgusting service I've ever witnessed. I'm genuinely tempted to take it further than just a chargeback honestly. 

Has anyone else had recent experiences like this?"	22	"[""Ash_Draevyn: Thanks for posting…I think everyone needs to start sharing their Amazon shitshow stories. It is beyond ridiculous at this point. Amazon customer service has become synonymous with the collections department.\n\nAmazon contacted me via email to tell me I didn’t return an item and that they will be charging me again if it is not returned by March 31. I returned the item the very day it arrived (February 14).\n\nAnyway, the CSR noticed that I did in fact return the item, but then proceeded to tell me that even though I returned the item, the system will automatically charge me on March 31 due to system error and I am to call them back on March 31 so they don’t re-charge me or if they do, to get the charge removed.  Ok, fine. ..but I wasn't seeing why the onus was put on me.\n\nI told the CSR that is complete bullshit.\n\nTHEY contacted me about their fuckup and subsequently expect me to fix it? Hell no. I asked the CSR to hold on, got my recorder out, put him on speaker, told him I’m recording and to repeat everything he has said from the beginning (Amazon has their recordings; I also wanted my own).  He complied, then he put me on hold.\n\nWhen he came back…magically…all was fixed. He told me I wouldn’t be re-charged. Apparently someone “with higher access” was able to rectify the situation. Always check your invoices/statement..I’ll be making sure they don’t charge me come March 31.\n\nFinally, I asked him to put everything in writing and to email it to me, which he did.\n\nOh ya, early in the conversation he started to panic for some reason and was escalating his voice and temper. I had to tell him to calm the fuck down (not in those words) and to explain properly. He admitted he was confused by the situation. Ok…it was a return, that was returned and somehow that wasn’t recorded. If Amazon trains their CSRs properly, he shouldn’t be confused by the concept of a basic return.\n\nBe very careful with Amazon…they’re not the same company as they were 10 years ago. They created a rental service which people abused and actual customers have to deal with this shitshow. Their business plan with regards to Alexa failing...massive layoffs...and now they’re trying to scrape money from honest buyers.\n\nThey should be going after the ones they know are screwing around. I.e. the people buying a large screen TV for a super bowl party then returning it when they were done with it, as an example.\n\nDo not abuse chargebacks, if you're honest about how things went down with Amazon when speaking with your financial institution rep...they'll get to the bottom of it.

I pre-ordered the Resident Evil 4 Remake last friday and was told I'd be getting it in ""two day shipping."" Now, I wasn't expecting to get it the same day, and was ok not receiving it over the weekend. However, I was expecting, since it is a pre-order game (it would be shipped out the day of) and because I do have amazon prime membership that I would get it in ""Two business days"" as stated.

However, it says ""Estimated arrival: April 10-April 20."" WTF?! I get it that it may be more tot cover there ass in case the arrival of the game in my mailbox isn't this week, but that's insane to wait for a pre-ordered game. Had I known it would take this long then I wouldn't have pre-ordered it and just go buy it at the store (in this case I knew I wouldn't have time to do so anytime soon). 

&#x200B;

Has anyone ever had this issue with Amazon? If so, has complaining to customer service resolved anything?"	13	"['AlmostRandomName: I\'m not exactly sure how Amazon works when it comes to preordering games, but I\'ve had this issue before (haven\'t preordered for years). Basically I assume Amazon allows customers to preorder based on how many copies they expect to get, but it might not necessarily know at the time if youre nearest/default Fulfillment Centers are going to get that game. So you can preorder a game with 2 day delivery and release date might hit and Amazon might go, ""Oh, there\'s actually no inventory for this in Moxley\\_56\'s nearest FC, it\'s gonna take 2-4 weeks now""\n\nI\'ve preordered games and had them arrive way late, probably because of this mismatch between Amazon\'s promises and Amazon\'s logistics.\n\nIf you want to preorder a game, I\'d recommend going through a more reliable retailer for this like GameStop or Best Buy in the US. Local stores will typically only allow customers to preorder as many copies as they\'re going to get on launch day, so if you preorder a game from the physical store you know you\'ll get it. Online sales with those retailers are usually reliable too, you just have to wait for shipping.\n\nSo yeah ultimately to answer your question, I\'ve had this issue, and it\'s not surprising. Can you talk to customer service? Well, they won\'t be able to get it to you any faster, they may recommend you cancel and reorder the game, and they might offer you some credit as a consolation.', ""katehenry4133: Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't 'pre-order' mean that it's not available yet and will ship when it is available?"", ""IndiaEvans: I had this same thing happen with a book. It was out on March 14. I preordered it in February. In the past they would ship it to ARRIVE on the release date. It wasn't going to arrive to me until the 20th, a week away. Absolutely ridiculous."", 'Derwurld: I have the same issue lol I pre ordered RE4 remake for PS5 and it said it shipped though. But never any tracking and after a week of contacting Amazon one rep told me that it was lost and they ordered a replacement. At least here in Canada it seems that Amazon is having difficulty getting the PS5 version while the xbox versions keeps coming up in stock. They gave me a 10$ promo credit for the inconvenience. \n\nNot sure if you are in Canada but you are not alone. I am only sticking with this pre order because I used some bank CC points that enabled me to get 20% off the game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOdd thing is that I have never encountered any issues with Amazon pre ordering until this year. Dead Space remake they told me it would come the following week but it arrived on launch day. Metroid Prime they said it would be middle of march but i received it the day after launch. Their tracking system is all messed up.', ""Moxley_56: Yeah, I understand. But what's frustrating is that the point in pre-ordering a game is to get it either the same day or the following business day. Or else, why the hell would people do it via amazon. If I don't get it by Wednesday, I think I'll get in touch with customer service and see what they can do/offer."", ""Moxley_56: when you pre-order something, the consensus is that you will get it the day it's released. In cases of delivery, it is understandable it can take 1-2 days via amazon. In my case, it's the opposite. Amazon must have kept accepting the pre-orders without checking what they have in facility, etc. Which, to me, is bullshit. \n\nIt's like reserving at a restaurant. You reserve to make sure that when you arrive at said time you have a table. If not, then WTF is the point of making a reservation?"", 'sibman: It does.', 'Moxley_56: Yeah, I ended up receiving the game Monday night. I spoke with customer service, explained how disappointed I was with the lateness given the fact that I pre-ordered the game a week prior to its release. They gave me 20% credit (roughly 20$).', ""AlmostRandomName: Yeah I know, Amazon *has* had launch day deliveries or pretty close to it. I think when I preordered Fallout 3 from Amazon I got it pretty close to release day, but these days I wouldn't preorder from them anymore."", ""Derwurld: That's good! Are you in Canada or the USA? Still waiting for the replacement to ship lol"", ""Moxley_56: Yeah, first time I've done so in a long time. And the last from now on."", 'Moxley_56: Canada', 'Derwurld: Thanks!']"

It\'s irrelevant.\n\nThey will then give you a case number and how to view, usually online.\n\nAs far as the 4 building different picture suggests it was delivered and perhaps to the wrong door and a neighbor has it or they are saying they never got it to try and get it for free.', 'WOOOOOORICKFLAIR: Honestly the only time Amazon has screwed me. Was when they caught onto me sending the wrong shit back…\n\nI was 100% stealing from them. I admit that. But I spent close to 13,000 a fucking year with Amazon. I figured I could pull a fast one on them.  Welp they caught on and billed me back for all the wrong items I sent back.  Now when I try to do a return or report a problem I get a totally different attitude from their customer service.  I probably have a red flag in the system, and rightfully so.   I’m just sharing my experience, there’s usually more to the story because Amazon has NEVER done me dirty until I started trying to scam them.', 'zoomiepaws: It could be the people delivering the product.

I received the items the next day bc my neighbor had them.  Thanks Amazon.', ""Throwingshead: This isn't a delay tactic it's a difference in cause. Amazon will have geotracking and what they feel is accurate proof the item was delivered successfully so in their eyes the issue is either theft or the recipient being dishonest. The police report is something that can be done to persuade them into giving a courtesy refund if they can verify the report is legit because again in their eyes it can only be theft after delivery if the recipient did not get the item which would be out of Amazon's control. The long investigation period is usually to give them time to contact the police department to confirm the case is legitimate which can take time depending on how responsive the local pd is.\n\nSo Amazon sees this is a police issue, they do not expect the police to do anything more than make a report. Amazon wants a report made to show the customer story is accurate since anyone committing fraud in this case would obviously not take that step.\n\nCommon misconception is that chargebacks have a 60 day limit which is only true for billing errors or fraud in the case someone unauthorized used the card. For issues with a product or service the banks usually have a 120 day limit for these types of cases so even with Amazon's delay that wouldn't matter since there is still plenty of time to file.\n\nWhere OP could screw their chances is if they file a CB way too early as that would make them look more like a fraudulent buyer if they do not let the policy play out and the odds of winning the CB case isn't as ironclad as the OP would assume since Amazon likely has the gps delivery confirmation on their end that would show it to be correctly delivered. At that point OP could only counter with photo proof of the different doors but that won't 100% work every time."", 'Big-Message-3367: i work in customer service & deal with customers on a daily basis , i calmly and professionally explained the situation & the reps are braindead robots who are reading a script. i spoke to 5 different supervisors & from research on reddit other people have the same issue', 'Big-Message-3367: charge back from your bank if it hasnt been over 60 dats', 'None: [deleted]', 'Big-Message-3367: i did report it to the police and stated i did not ever recieve the item and to also put that i did this because amazon told me it what i had to do to get my refund', 'blahblahsnickers: Police won’t take a report for a package delivered to the wrong location.

The seller received the item February 15th at 11:46 AM.  First refund was denied because the seller said the heater was in good condition and they needed picture of the defective heater or copy of the tracking number.

First time, they delivered an office chair two weeks ago, talked to a customer service for over an hour, said there are no replacement available and wanted to hold my refund for 30 days even after shipping back the wrong item.

I was at home from 9am to 4pm, and of course, UPS came picking up the item during the 30 minutes I wasn’t at home, so I had to drive 40+ mins to drop that heavy package to UPS for something I don’t feel like I am responsible of.

Later, I ordered a same model in different size as that was the only one in stock, a week later, it came in a different color…

It’s really frustrating, and yet Amazon customer service just always told me there are nothing they can do other than taking another week to ship a replacement and want me to ship the wrong item back.

I recently returned a $300 dollar amazon warehouse item, and my refund was ""issued"" on March 24. However, I still haven't received the payment on my debit card and I was wondering if I should call support?

I returned an item before, and the refund usually appears in my bank account the day the refund is issued, so I'm a little confused as to why it's taking so long now; is it because it was from amazon warehouse? Should I wait a week before calling them? I would appreciate any input.

EDIT: So on March 27th, I got the refund without having to call them. I recommend waiting around 3-5 days, and if you still don't get it, call support.

Chat customer service has been horrendous to deal with, but phone customer service has spent a lot of time trying to figure out what's going on with prime orders for those based in Hawaii, as it appears to have become a major issue.

From what I've gathered, the issue is the new alleged fulfillment center based on-island, which automatically designates orders made in the islands to that specific fulfillment center, rather than those we were designated to previously (usually California or Las Vegas). Because the fulfillment center is new and likely understocked (didn't even know we had one yet), many of our orders are being processed then cancelled by the Hawaii fulfillment center because they don't have the items in stock in the warehouse. Because of this, our orders are waiting to be ""picked up"" by the next available fulfillment center, which is causing a huge backlog.

The last estimated delivery I got from CS was 2 months after the most recent order, which would be some time in May. This is probably because Amazon is trying to cut back on shipping costs and trying to put Hawaii orders on a boat to the on-island fulfillment center, with freight also experiencing massive backlogs.

Currently trying to order each item individually to see if it makes any difference, as CS said it may make it easier to ship from multiple fulfillment centers; I guess ordering multiple items on a single order gets designated to your closest center and they won't process it or cancel the transaction if they can't fulfill it. 

If I don't get my items within the next 7-10 days, this still be the catalyst for me to cancel my membership and be done with this company. This is the worst experience I've had in over 10 years of hundreds of orders; sad to see how bad things have gotten."	22	"[""tofuflower: Do we know if all Hawaii prime members are affected yet? On r/Hawaii, I haven't seen much noise about this, so I don't know if it's Hawaii and account specific.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/11exzap/is_amazon_not_worth_it_anymore_in_hawaii/jd9ft5q/"", ""AKHwyJunkie: Interesting.  I'm seeing this exact same thing with orders going back to March 8th.  Difference being, I'm in Alaska!  (We obviously have a lot of similarities in remote experience, though.)  Also, all of my orders are individual items all ready.  We do have a couple of warehouses in the state, but the role is mostly to put direct Prime flights into the USPS system AFAICT.\n\nI did put in an order last night, it shipped almost immediately.  Looks like I need to pester customer service to figure out what's going on."", ""punkdigerati: I've been having the same issue for weeks, talked to CS four times and not a single one was able to tell me about this.

Have been talking to Customer Service (chat first, then phone) and other than ""We\'re sorry you\'re experiencing this problem"", they have not done anything.  I hope it gets better soon.  I didn\'t mind the 10 to 14 days shipping before hand but now the 5-7 days after shipping without an estimated shipping date is pretty bad.', '14th_Mango: Agreed.  We’ve been waiting weeks for them to even ship. Missed Birthdays altogether.  Also considering cancelling membership.', 'IndiaEvans: Oh gosh, I have never thought about this.

I was waiting for the email that says order was shipped. Instead I got an email last week on those three items saying it was delayed and I had to approve the order ort would be canceled. Wth? \nI canceled all of my orders except for that order and ordered them all separately, thinking each source couldn't ALL be delayed. Same problem.\n\nSo I took a closer look and saw the same thing as others. To get the items by a reasonable time, I would have to select expedited shipping at $6.99 PER ITEM! To see if it was just Hawaii, I had a friend in Californnia mimic my order.\n\nGuess what? He had next day delivery to California, but when he changed the address to my address in Hawaii, up popped the $6.99 to get it by May 5th. And he added two more items ad the $6.99 was added THREE TIMES! \n\nFor now I'm placing a big order to get to my niece in California to save on the $6.99 per item charge. Instead she can put them in two large flat rate boxes and mail them to me. The only problem is the HIGH CALIFORNIA TAXES!! UGH!\n\nI hope that this isn't Amazon's permanent policy.  That would have a HUGE impact on all of us so isolated here in Hawaii."", ""tofuflower: I just reread OP's info that this is impacting only the orders that would have been previously assigned to CA or Vegas warehouses.\n\nThis makes sense because in the past two weeks, I had three orders arrive, originating from Ohio and Texas warehouses. I suppose other customers are lucky in ordering with the warehouse assignment and may not have been impacted by this change yet."", 'norse_torious: Did you request to speak to a ""manager""? Next time you call (do not chat; always call), ask to speak to a US based administrator/manager. Let them know you are one of many Hawaii customers experiencing this issue. \n\nBased on my last discussion, it won\'t gain traction unless more people start making a fuss. Of course, they could be fully aware of what\'s going on but aren\'t saying anything out of fear that their OCONUS states may mass cancel memberships (someone mentioned this is going on in Alaska as well).', ""norse_torious: The saddest part is now I'm going back to eBay for a lot of purchases. Placed orders for the exact same items yesterday and they already shipped out, with projected delivery by Friday.\n\nI payed an extra $20-30 for the ebay items but it still came out cheaper than the $6.99 per item for expedited shipping on Amazon. Absolutely ridiculous."", 'norse_torious: It\'s important to contact customer service and inform them you are experiencing the same issue. The manager I spoke to essentially stated that cases that are ""escalated"" (usually what CS says when they can\'t fix the problem) are actually just brought up in meetings and unless they identify a larger scale problem in a specific region, it kind of goes ignored.', ""norse_torious: Chat CS gave me an estimated delivery date of mid-May for a bulk order I initially did. Took their advice to cancel and reorder individually and now they can't give me an estimated delivery date at all."", ""norse_torious: I'm sorry you are experiencing the same issues. I highly recommend contacting customer service to report your experience because as I mentioned in a previous response, they won't take this seriously until they see issues being reported from large numbers of customers in a given region.\n\nI am not experiencing any issues with eBay or other e-commerce sites, so shipping doesn't appear to be the overall issue. Granted, the majority of orders that did ship from Amazon (4 out of 15) were sent through USPS."", ""norse_torious: It's looking like it might be better for Hawaii residents to cancel their prime memberships and just place orders over $25, assuming they don't use/need prime video. \n\nDelivery times to Hawaii are back to pre-Amazon rise/peak and do not justify purchasing a prime membership if we are getting the same items in the same timeframes as non-prime members. What's worse is that A LOT of items sold on prime are literally the exact same Chinese-made items sold on sites like Temu and Vevor, which believe it or not are actually shipping in rapid times because they use USPS. \n\nTo give you some examples: I ordered a 66# blacksmith anvil from Vevor for about $170 including shipping and I received it within a week. The same anvil (literally the exact same one) was selling for $179.99 plus $50 shipping and it stated it would take 1-2 months to arrive. I also ordered some cricut supplies on Temu that were the exact same items on Amazon. 6 12x12 mats for $2.89 each w/ free shipping. 3 of the exact same items on Amazon were $18.99 and no expected delivery date.\n\nOnly remaining benefit I now see with Amazon is the return policy, but they are trying to make it harder to return items. It's almost like Amazon is investing in losing money and wanting the company to crash these days. I went from 99% of online purchases with Amazon to probably 10% and find eBay, vevor and Temu to be the new go-to marketplaces for the exact same products at far cheaper prices."", ""norse_torious: I've received a few orders, but these were shipped via USPS.\n\nI'm wondering if Amazon is running into issues with FedEx, UPS and/or commercial airliners that carry their products to the islands?"", ""punkdigerati: I will escalate it the next time I call. I wasn't aware of this being the issue while I was speaking with them before. \nIt's been very frustrating not getting any information from them."", 'norse_torious: Update for the ebay stuff.\n\nOrdered Monday, one item delivered Wednesday via USPS, next item expected delivery Thursday.\n\nAmazon looking mad stupid right now.', ""MerleChloe: I think the Star Advertiser or Action Line should do a story and we just bombard Amazon on Twitter and other Apps with the Story link to create mass hysteria. Lol. Include Alasla too if it's also a chronic problem. Social Media might create some negative buzz faster than individuals calling CS who have no pull. 😉"", 'norse_torious: I\'ve chatted with about 6 reps and spoken to 4. The last I spoke with was a manager, who gave me a bunch of info on the situation, as well as what an ""escalated case"" really is (essentially it\'s issues brought up in meetings).\n\nBest advice they gave was having customers with issues file complaints because they won\'t take action until it\'s a larger issue with the potential for mass membership cancelling.\n\nPersonally, I think the issue is shipping carriers and they are fully aware of the problem; just haven\'t said anything because they know people will start cancelling if 4-8 week waiting times become the norm, just so they can save a few bucks off the billions they made over the past 3 years.', 'MerleChloe: I did speak to customer service and was told that ALL of my items except one was definitely in stock and they\'re just waiting on the ""source."" So I canceled 90% of my orders and ordered them all separately. Surely all of their ""sources"" couldn\'t ALL be having issues. Ordering them separately without the $6.99 expedited fee left me in the same situation. Only now, my orders are starting all over. I canceled everything and reordered them late last night sending to my niece in Southern California. Some of my orders are already there! I\'d rather pay for two , maybe 3 flat rate boxes than to give Amazon $6.99 per item x 28 items.']"

Edit: To be clear, the item never leaves the Amazon facility. 

The last thing I ordered was in stock and waiting to be shipped for a month before I finally canceled it, since my card hadn't been charged. It showed in stock but the price had doubled between the time I'd ordered it and then. 

Before that, an item had ""shipped"" and my card charged, but it was only ever scanned at the Amazon facility and never left. This remained the case for a mere two days before Amazon sent an email saying they'd issue a refund if it didn't arrive by the end of the week.

It doxxed me.	frooburst	58	121sq9l	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/121sq9l/psa_never_redeem_cards_from_a_friend_online_it/	"I have this kinda weird clingy friend I've known for a few years who sometimes gifts me games on steam and what not. I mentioned wanting to buy something from amazon offhand to them and they sent me a amazon giftcard. Heh, strange but thanks I'll use it no harm can possibly come from this right?


WRONG, they talked to amazon support and was able to get my FULL name from them. First name, middle initial and last name. They then messaged me my entire full name. They knew the state I lived in so they were also able to find my facebook.... They also offhand mentioned possibly being able to find my address from that.


I now have what I would call a stalker trying to add me on facebook and calling me my name and trying to find my address for gods sake all because I redeemed what I thought was a harmless gift from them. It's absurd that amazon is willing to give out entire full names just by you talking to support and having the giftcard code.

I contacted Amazon customer support to see if they could tell me what the charge was for. They were able to tell me that it was a different account, but nothing else. They confirmed the other account wasn't in my name and encouraged me to reach out to friends and family that have access to my debit card.

I usually pay it and forget about it. Recently I decided to check my statements and found an error. Turns out a lot of my ""refunded"" special finance purchases were never actually refunded onto my card. So it turns out i've been paying for items that i a have already returned. These ranges from items  from $100 dollars to $3000. To make an estimate, i probably gave Synchrony over $10k of items that should have never been charged. I spoke with synchrony and they realized the issue and are now sending me statements dating all the way back to 2015 to confirm my refunds. So if you have a refund on your special finance Synchrony Amazon Card, BE SURE it actually got refunded.  The statement activity will show the deducted amount but it won't be removed from the promotional purchase.

Several years ago, before Prime Family reduced the number of adults allowed on one membership (2015 or so?), I had tacked my father onto my account in addition to me and my husband.  No problems.  I added my teenager a couple of years ago as well. 

In the last year, my father has passed away and my teen is now 18 and considered an adult.  

Because my father had been “grandfathered” in (haha) as an allowed third adult, is there any way to “transfer” his account (linked to his credit card, address, etc.)?  I’d like to make his (he’s obviously no longer using it) my daughter’s.  

I’d of course update the credit card info and shipping/mailing address to hers.  

I would just be moving the third adult in household to a different adult, but since they’ve limited it to only two adults now, I don’t think they’ll let me.   Is there a work-around?  

I’d obviously have to log into my father’s account (which I have access to) and change the name, address and payment info.  I could and would still be using “his account” just changing/updating info.  

THEORETICALLY, my father could have gotten married, changed his name, changed address and gotten a new credit card.  Right??

I know this is confusing, so I hope I’ve explained it correctly.  The need to get an additional Prime Membership so that we can enjoy the privilege of providing them with a new and very lucrative profit source.  Not like Daddy is ordering anything lately, and I assure you my kid is and will.  Essentially, his account is just sitting there, completely unused.

Mysterious-Resist-56	1	11yq4fr	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11yq4fr/amazon_international_self_return_using_ups_marked/	" 

I've sent 2 laptops back to amazon (used ones, amazon warehouse) by self-return using UPS (i'm from Italy and I bought the pc from amazon.es). Obv i used all the info that amazon gave me for the refund (i could only do the self-return) and the package was delivered.

I sent the packages and they were marked as delivered on the 22nd of February. Since the 1 of march, I was contacting amazon about my refund and my package, and they only told me to ""wait until 15 march""...

I've sent them proof of delivery and receipt from ups, but they now telling me that ""the package is not in our warehouse if you use self-return we cannot refund your item if not here. You should talk to the carrier "" so I opened up an investigation with UPS...

The investigation closed positively from ups telling me that :

"" I sincerely apologize if you needed to deal with this. Upon review, our records indicate that an investigation was indeed raised and was eventually closed as the relevant team received a response from the center that Amazon Pluton received the package.""

I even told that to amazon, but they just copy paste the same responses... that they do not have the item (even when I ask them "" do you not have the items physically (means you searched for them and you didn't find it, or you dint' scanned yet? They are 2 different things"" they just tell me that ""you have to contact the carrier"" and close the chat.

Does anyone have any suggestions? we are talking about 2k euros..."	2	['nosleepbrooklynn: Any update ?']

1679417095.0	21-Mar-2023 09:44:55	Shipping 4 days slower for 30 minute drive	ooohhhwhatchasay	1	11xmjnf	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11xmjnf/shipping_4_days_slower_for_30_minute_drive/	"Hey Reddit!

I've been having an issue with an amazon order and was wondering if anyone else was experiencing this or had any tips.

&#x200B;

I ordered some items on March 14 and the delivery ended up getting set for March 28th. I checked today and realized that if I ordered the items today (March 21) the expected shipping is still March 28. This made me believe that everything has been sitting around in the amazon warehouse for a week for no apparent reason. For reference the closest amazon warehouse is under 1 hour drive from me. 

&#x200B;

So after getting a rep and being told I was having 'issues with my bank', grouped shipping was causing the issue or the items were not at the distribution center, I threw all 3 items back in the cart and tried a zipcode about the same distance from the amazon distribution center that I was, which said that the items could be there in 4 days. Some items would be there next day if I did not do group shipping. When confronting the customer service they just said that the zipcode/location matters (which makes no sense because we are the same distance apart and there is a 4-7 day difference in shipping). Am I really going to have to ship items to my family's house and drive to get it in order to get fast shipping? Its kinda ridiculous that I am paying for prime and its taking over a week to get items when 30-45 minutes away I could be getting items next day. In this area we used to get the 2 day shipping because of how close the amazon facility is, but everything randomly started to take more than a week.

&#x200B;

I've heard people had luck with prime business, but that does not include prime video.

&#x200B;

I've posted my chat as a few screenshots since I am not sure how to do the whole reddit thing.

Thanks!

The item was purchased to Israel. It was later returned through DHL, and tracking says it was received on February 8th already, yet Amazon customer supports keeps saying they can't help because the returns facility hasn't 'scanned' the item yet. What do? Keep waiting or are there other things that can be done first? 

**Timeline of events:**  
\- January 10th: Purchased an Intel i9 13900k $729.56  
\- February 6th: Package was sent back to Amazon Returns using DHL  
\- February 8th: Package arrived in destination  
\- March 19th: Amazon customer supports claims to not have gotten it still  


I will now upload pictures and links, hopefully they could be useful:  
\- [DHL Tracking for tracking number 2343053963](https://www.dhl.com/il-en/home/tracking/tracking-express.html?submit=1&tracking-id=2343053963) please do note that at the bottom of the page there are 'More Shipment Details' and 'All Shipment Updates' sections.  
\- [Electronic Proof of Delivery by DHL](https://www.docdroid.net/rLnKbV3/proofofdelivery-2343053963-pdf) \- It seems to have been signed by someone called 'Marco G'  
\- [DHL Delivery Receipt](https://www.docdroid.net/hTYFaTJ/dhl-delivery-receipt-pdf) (whited out personal info)

&#x200B;

Some quotes from Amazon online Customer Service:  
""... **right now we are unable to process a refund  in our system, we need to wait our facility to process your return item**.Once return center processed your return item your receiving an email confirmation about the refund. ""

""... **we will not be able to provide further insight or action on this matter.We are unable to process your refund here  because return facility is the one who process your refund** and I kindly ask you to wait .""

""**As per checking here, the item has still no scan on it**.   We can only confirm if we received the item once it has been processed or scanned on our end.""  


Could anyone ever so kindly please assist with what should be the next move. It seems like waiting it out isn't doing anything as the person has already waited over 5 weeks since the DHL Tracking shows it was delivered to the returns warehouse. Customer services keeps giving the same answer and saying to ""wait it out"". Any suggestions..? 

Thanks !! :)"	0	[]
1679243125.0	19-Mar-2023 09:25:25	Amazon sent me a returned game, that was the wrong game with a sticker on it. And I can't get a replacement.	TheNinjaDC	9	11vpnnz	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11vpnnz/amazon_sent_me_a_returned_game_that_was_the_wrong/	"I'm completely baffled about what to do with this situation.First, I was sent a pre-owned version of this game (Violet), when I ordered a new copy.

But the second, and bigger issue, the pre-owned copy was switched out with an older Pokemon game (Sword). Seemingly, they switched the sticker on the game, and sent the older game back in the new game's box. When I inserted the game, I was met with a Pokemon Sword load screen. This isn't the game I ordered, but a faked returned copy.

I ordered Violet in January, but never got around to testing the game till it was out of the normal return window as I was waiting for a late Feb patch before playing the game. I have photos of the fake product, and still have the plastic repackaging plastic with attached bar code it came in.

I contacted the sub-seller. They informed me of this:

""We are experiencing the same problem right now with Amazon. Here's a background to the issue. A seller has 2 methods of shipping: 1) Merchant Fulfilled -- this is when we ship the package directly to the customer, 2) FBA (fulfillment by amazon), this is when we ship our inventory to amazon and pay amazon a fee to process and ship the orders on our behalf. Since Christmas, we have received returns through FBA and the games do not even belong to us! I have opened so many cases with amazon to complain about this issue. What I believe has happened, is other sellers have shipped their bad merchandise to FBA and Amazon has commingled everyone's inventory. Commingling is when amazon takes everyone's game and puts them in a communal bin. Therefore, when customers return this game to FBA -- amazon begins to return these games to us, and now we have realized the garbage other sellers have been trying to sneak into FBA and amazon never caught the problem.""

&#x200B;

They recommended I contact Amazon for the replacement as it was FBA fault. But Amazon keeps sending me in an automated loop that either rejects my return for being over 30 days past, or occasionally seems to offer a generic return. But I'm hesitant to do that as I don't want to pass on this hot potato and be blamed for it.

So I need help contacting AN ACTUAL PERSON! So I can return this defective/fake product in a way it won't be re-entered into the pre-owned game stock (at least before being properly relabeled), and get me my replacement (new) copy I paid for.

&#x200B;

I contacted their customer service and I got the below unprofessional attitudes. Amazon has to step up and get their customer service trained professionally. Amazon Canada has to stop holding people's money for unknow reasons. I can't pay the balance of my CC of things I don't own!

Anyone else has ever face with this garbage unpolite Amazon Canada customers service?

1679151457.0	18-Mar-2023 07:57:37	Ordered AirPods, received empty box, Amazon giving me the runaround	LudwigVan17	25	11uqmn4	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11uqmn4/ordered_airpods_received_empty_box_amazon_giving/	"I ordered AirPods Pro 2nd gen from Amazon because they were $50 cheaper than the Apple store. They arrived in a completely untampered with Amazon box but the AirPod box inside was not wrapped in plastic and the Airpods and case were missing. I contacted Amazon support and they said they would ship me a new pair and sent me an email confirmation on the reship. I asked them to cancel the AppleCare and issue it to the new AirPods and they started saying things like ""you can just use your order number for the applecare"" which I looked into and is not true. The AppleCare immediately attached to the serial number of the original stolen pair which was confirmed by email. I let the customer service rep off the hook and thought id just deal with it when the replacement pair arrives.

Two days passes and I log on to my account to check the delivery status of the replacement AirPods and the replacement order had been cancelled!! At this point I was pretty frustrated so I contacted amazon chat again and explained the situation. The rep could not explain what had happened but she issued me a refund. The email confirmation says that she ""requested a refund"" and there is nothing on my amazon account that actually confirms a refund has been issued. It still says my original AirPods were delivered. No ""return pending"" or anything like that on the site. She also said the the AppleCare would be refunded as well to which she never sent me confirmation on. I asked her to email me AppleCare return confirmation and a copy of our conversation and she immediately ended the chat.

I contacted apple support and they were an absolute joy to deal with after dealing with the Amazon support. Apple issued a refund for the AppleCare. I want to go to the Apple store and purchase the AirPods today but im still skeptical about my Amazon refund actually coming through.

I know theres nothing anyone here can do to help but i guess i just wanted to rant. Moral of the story is order Apple products from Apple.

TLDR: Ordered AirPods from Amazon. Empty box shows up. Amazon issues a replacement pair to be sent. Amazon cancels replacement order and lies about AppleCare.

It all started last week with an SMS that my account was put on hold because of a suspicious activity, so I tried signing in, and as requested, I submitted a bank statement downloaded from my bank's mobile app, after few hours I received an email that says ""we were unable to verify ownership of your visa payment ending in XXXX because the document provided does not contain any name"", it actually did, but whatever, I said it should be just not clear, so I signed in to my bank's web app, and I found out that the bank statement there is better organized, so I downloaded it, and I attached a picture annotating the placement of my name and address and the transaction, then I submitted it, after few hours, I received another email that says ""We have reviewed the information you provided but we were unable to verify ownership of your MASTERCARD payment ending in YYYY because the document provided did not prove card ownership"", I said, oh good, at least we are advancing, now I just need to prove the ownership of the second card YYYY (it was a backup card, and Amazon asked for documents for the payment method used in last transaction, so I didn't expect they were asking for it too), anyway, I attached a bank statement of this card, and same as before, I attached an annotated picture explaining the placement of the information, after few hours, I received another email, and it said ""we were unable to verify ownership of your visa payment ending in XXXX because the document provided did not contain any transactions"", and I said what?!!! now we are back to the XXXX credit card, I said, maybe I need to attach both documents at the same time, and that's what I did, and I even attached a picture of my passport next to both credit cards, and I said now I provided everything, but few hours later I received the famous email:

>After a review of your details, we have determined it is necessary to close your [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) account. Any pending orders have been canceled.  
>  
>We may not reply to further emails about this issue.

This was a shock to me, I provided all the information they requested, so I still don't understand what's the reason, I called customer service many times, and they were of no help at all, and all they could do is file an appeal that resulted in nothing so far (it has been 4 days now).

Now I lost access to all the ebooks that I bought in Amazon, I can't access the Kindle app on my phone, my Kindle tablet is on life support, and my son's Fire tablet as well, I really regret buying anything from Amazon now, and I'm just glad I never saved anything on their cloud storage, otherwise I would have been locked out of it, having the fate of ""your content"" in someone's hand means it's not your content, and now I learnt it the hard way.

Updates:

- three days after my last call to the customer service, I received an email that says: 

>""Hello,
>
>We received your most recent communication.
>
>We had already implemented the appropriate resolution and >sent you an email with further guidance."",

I assumed this meant that they are not looking into solving my issue.

- 2 days after receiving the above email, I receiced an other email that my account has been reinstated, I have no idea what helped in solving the issue, whether it was the customer service call, or the multiple emails I sent to jeff@amazon.com and investigate@amazon.com and account-alert@amazon.com.
Anyway, I'm glad my account is open again, but still I would be extra careful about buying digital content on Amazon going forward, I don't like the idea that my content is in the hand of a team of non-comptent people who might decide to close it when they can't read properly my evidence."	5	"['2Adude: Open a new account.

Amazon Prime is attempting to charge for their subscription on random credit cards assoc. with my account after I declined to renew. My bank flagged it as fraud, Amazon customer service insisting it’s a “glitch”.

Context: my Amazon prime account just expired and I had no intention of renewing it this year. Said no to all of their promos etc. The card on file from past years was my husbands and it expired so we thought it was taken care of. 

Over the past two days, Amazon Prime has attempted to charge two separate credit cards of mine ( both associated with my Amazon account, but never used for prime membership) $150 each for a subscription. My bank flagged BOTH transactions as fraud and declined them. One was charged& declined last night, the other was charged this morning and also declined.

Had a rough call with Amazon customer service who insisted this was merely a “simple glitch” and that Amazon would never charge me without prior authorization. I said but that’s exactly what happened right? And they said yes BUT “it was just a glitch”. I insisted that if my bank didn’t flag this I would have been charged without my authorization, there is no evidence or backend for this available on my account. They just kept insisting it was a glitch that will never happen ever again. I’m pretty dissatisfied with this answer as my main concern was finding out if my card numbers were actually compromised at some point. They of course refused to patch me through to a higher up.

Curious if this shady shit has happened to anyone else? This really smells like Wells Fargo secretly opening unauthorized accounts to hit their sales goals in 2016."	2	['RedMapleBat: Did you actually end your membership (Your Account > Prime Membership)?

They were $18 solar entry glands . I ordered extra just in case I needed more than one and was planning on returning what I didn't need. A rep from the Solar system manufacturer came by to make suggestions and said I only needed one. So I requested a return label for the 2 I didn't need. I packed them up still sealed in there original packaging. Put the return label on the box and dropped it off at a UPS store. Got a receipt. A few days later Amazon refund the 2 items. Then 4-5 weeks later Amazon recharged my credit card for 1 of the items with no explanation? I called Amazon they said they only received one? After a month they decided something was wrong. The first person I spoke to gave me the usual Dont worry we will fix this . Then days later nothing? So I called again and they had to transfer me to another department? They then insisted they only got one back? These were 2 small plastic parts costing $18 each not much value to anyone that's doesn't know what they are for.  So I called my credit card company and they found in my favor after providing all the documents showing when Amazon received the return a month before hand.  Now a few weeks later Amazon sent something to my. Credit Card company that had them reverse the charge yet again? I'm not sure what's going on at Amazon? Someone didn't count the return properly. Or dropped one of the items. I am now going to cancel my Amazon account over this . A company this size that can't figure out a mistake was made somewhere a month after the fact is pushing for $18. It's not about the money it's the principal of it.  They put a lot of effort into this for no reason! I know both items were sealed in that box when. I handed it to the UPS store.  What happened after that I have no control over.  What if this was a more expensive item? I've purchased stuff costing thousands of dollars through Amazon before.

Aggravating_Bet1026	2	11t3rdu	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11t3rdu/beyond_fed_up_with_customer_service/	"On 03/06, I start a return on a MacBook Air as I no longer wanted it. Used the prepaid label provided by Amazon and proceeded to drop the item off at my local UPS store the same day. Got a copy of the return receipt. 

Item was delivered back to Amazon’s Fulfillment center located in Lexington, KY as of Friday, March 10.

A week passes by and I have not received any update regarding the status of my refund so I chat with Amazon customer service and have been told to wait 60 days for a refund from several representatives. 

On Monday, I chatted with a Rep who told me that they were able to issue a full refund on the order and that it would reflect back on my card within 3-5 business days. I was unsure whether to believe the Rep or not, so I reached out to support again to verify whether a refund was indeed issued or not, and I’ve been told no. 

Today I chatted with another representative who also told me that they manually issued me a full refund. I was having doubts as I’ve already been told the same thing twice this week, so I requested this Rep to send me an email confirming that they issued a refund and they did. 

This whole ordeal has led me to filing a complaint on Amazon through the BBB and emailing both jeff@amazon.com & andy@amazon.com. 

Received an email from someone at Amazon’s Executive Customer Relations Team advising me to wait 60 days, and that any additional inquiries on the matter won’t receive a response. 

I’ve got screenshots of all the chat communications I’ve had with representatives promising me a refund but never honoring it.  

Refer to screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/KOs7y8F

I’ve always received refunds on orders no more than 7 business days. When trying to explain this to Reps, they would keep advising me to waiting 60 days.

The few times I do talk to a customer and I tell them I can leave the label for them to drop off at a ups store (for customers who call a pickup) and they declined and I explain “alright if the tape doesn’t hold and the contents fall out UPS isn’t liable for your refund I’ll leave a note that taping/packaging isn’t sufficient” some get upset but I tell them it’s in the return info they are responsible for. Ultimately if it got to the merchant without item it might have fallen out during transit and without pictures of how it was packaged/ taped any claim would be denied as insufficient.', ""Simple-Ninja-8372: No, I do not, which is my fault. I have returned many items to Amazon like everyone else, but I never really thought about taking pictures or videos as proof till now. The prepaid label was 7 lbs, and the whole package is around 4 lbs. I have talked to the UPS store about tracking/package details if they get weighed in somewhere along the transit, but they said they couldn't pull it. Only whoever owns the label can. Amazon said the same. Still waiting for the seller about package transit details, and also they said they have video proof of them opening the return box."", ""buxzythebeeeeeeee: Yeah,  I would definitely want to see that video since it is not entirely unheard of for stuff to go missing while in the hands of UPS. Or for the video itself it be suspect in terms of how it is edited and so on.  \n\nOnly the seller being able to access the label makes things all the more Kafkaesque since they can say anything and you don't have access to the evidence to refute it, but if they are going to accuse you of fraud they need to be forthcoming with ALL the details including the actual weight of the package as recorded by UPS after UPS received it. \n\nIdeally, of course, Amazon would actually do something to help since they are the ones with the A-Z guarantee and are the middleman in the transaction as well as having a lot more power than any single buyer, but you might need a miracle to get them to intervene in any useful way.\n\nAll I can say at this point is good luck on a successful outcome."", ""Simple-Ninja-8372: Thank you. Amazon already denied my first claim attempt for the A-Z guarantee process in just 2 hrs of dealing with them through the phone and seller. It is he said she said type of thing where I, the buyer at the bottom end of everything. Barely investigated the claim really\n\nI've been a prime customer for years and spent thousands of dollars with them every year and returned many items, and have a great track record. The reason why I returned the item is that it is a gray market camera and has no manufacturer warranty which I was iffy when I found out since it is a very expensive purchase.""]"

I had this zippo custom engraved for him as a birthday present, and he always keeps it in one of the two places he smokes the most: 1. his car or 2. on the coffee table on the front porch.

He had a package delivered recently and the delivery photo has the zippo in the frame, but when he got home his package was there and the lighter was gone. Has anyone else gone through something similar? It was a really sentimental item and technically this delivery person stole his property, but it's so small I don't know if anything would be done to actually have it be returned to him."	6	"[""AmnesiaInnocent: I don't understand.

Again, not impossible, but that would be a lot of coincidences.

The product was a non-expensive electronic device around $150. Doesn't work, is completely bricked and damaged from the cold/moisture.

Just curious if you guys have had an experience like that recently? Is this going to go the way price matching has disappeared in Canada?

My sister refuses to get an Amazon credit card/account because she wont listen to any advice at all and she wants me to figure out how to add her to my account so she gets discounts and I get her cashback points.

If I do this can she use my card or anything like that through the app? Or are there any drawbacks? She wouldn't do it on purpose but if there's any possible complications then I don't want to deal with it.

Thanks for any assistance."	0	[]

i am in the Netherlands.

on 7 march i was supposed to receive 2 items. but only 1 was delivered.

but both items were marked as delivered. 

i have opened a investigation at amazon. 

i had to call them every time because i never got a email back in the indicated time.


i got the email stating i should file a police report for the missing package.

because they said the item is marked as delivered. 



problem is.

1. per law it's their responsibility. so it is also not my responsibility to file a police report. 

this is also backed up by about the other 4 mayor shipping companies in the Netherlands. 

which also state ""the seller(shipper) is fully responsible. if a package is not delivered. the seller is also responsible in contacting the shipping company and launching investigations.

2. fuck that. I'm not wasting 3 hours of my life sitting at a police station just to get laughed at and told it's their responsibility to do the report.




i have called amazon support yet again. 

and everyone i talked to agreed that it is weird and unusual. since they are also from the Netherlands. they also know how it works here.


amazon funny enough is just managed from Germany. which is probably why they think it's my issue.



anyone else dealing with the same bs? i have already replied to the email basically saying ""no. it's your responsibility per law. i want my money back"""	14	"['aobtree123: Amazon customer service will just say anything to get you off the line.

I wanted a Citizen watch, and saw there were few used listings in buying options, all sold by amazon directly. I figured why not let's give it a go. Safe to say this would be my last time trying that. The watch I got in package was not only used, but also an obvious fake (missing side pusher, wrong dial layout, etc.). Returned it the same day but have been waiting for refund since beginning of the month.

After that I have bought the same watch again, this time new, from amazon. I love the watch, and 100% sure the first used one was a fake. 

Amazon's CS has been nothing but a waste of my time so far. It also seems their CS quality has gone wayyyyy down. Difficult to understand, confusing answers, and contradicting each other... frustrating!

These are 2 fairly long stories but I'll make them as short as possible.

I first ordered an S22 ultra from Amazon and had an issue with the auto brightness and was sent a replacement which was fine (I  also sent back the original) until I began having other issues with the replacement. I sent it back, waited 30 days and no refund appeared which was very odd considering I used to get refunded within 7-10 days on other returns. I contact support and am told they cannot refund me until the original phone was sent back, but I sent it back months ago and they never contacted me about not receiving it when I would have had the proof of tracking number and receipt. They also said that the phone I had just sent back was damaged but I had pictures of the phone and packaging before I sent it so I filled in a form they wanted me to and attached the photos of the condition of the phone (which had a screen protector and case on the entire time and had no damage or even scratches) they then confirmed this even though they didn't care about the picture evidence. They still insisted that I did not return the original phone even though I had months ago and said to me the reason for not contacting me was because they ""Brushed it under the carpet"" and ""Trusted me"" which is not my problem. Anyway, I eventually managed to get the tracking code after hours of digging through photos trying to find a single QR code then they told me they had it all along but it wasn't working and I explained to them Hermes had rebranded to Evri and so some tracking information may have changed. They didn't accept this and this continued on for weeks. Eventually, I spoke to someone who refunded me after all that hassle none of which was my fault.

Recently I returned a pair of galaxy buds because I didn't want them anymore - within 14 days. I took a video of me packaging them making sure the box was fully protected because of my previous incident and even recorded myself putting the box into the amazon locker for return. I contacted their support after 30 days of not getting a refund and they tell me I sent back the wrong item and as per amazon policy, they disposed of the item accordingly and are waiting to receive the item. I HAVE VIDEO EVIDENCE OF IT ALL but they don't care, they are assuming I have tried to lie to them which is not the case. 

At this point I don't think I am ever going to buy from Amazon again, their customer service used to be so good and actually sort things quickly but I feel like something is going wrong over there especially when I ask to speak to a supervisor and I am told that they have the same access as the normal workers its very disappointing.

Sorry about the rant, I've just had enough now!"	1	[]

Roughly since 2023 started, I’ve been having 50/50 luck with Amazon. I will note I live in an apartment complex.

The other 50% has my packages lost, at a Amazon local center, says delivered with black screen as the photo, or delivered to the store downstairs who are experiencing agitation due to having multiple residents’ packages delivered to them. All of our packages state clearly OUR addresses. 

Just today, my package states it was delivered and I cannot find it anywhere. There is no picture, I’ve called customer service (have to wait a day, I’ve heard it so many other times from them), looked around my complex, called the local amazon center, and will call the downstairs store. 

What can I do for this issue? What do the drivers see on their end on how to deliver? There’s information on how to enter our building."	2	['123confusion: Mine was left along with other peoples packages(assuming these packages are part of the same apartment complex as me) by the street recently(they had the gate code and apt number). I happened to see the notification at the moment it was delivered at 5am because my husband was getting ready for work and had been louder than normal due to being sick(coughing). I was pissed when I saw the picture as the gate in question is on the sidewalk that leads directly to a small shopping lot that has a bar, grocery store and a few other small businesses. It was also highly visible from the street as well because it’s a fire hydrant outside the gate making it more visible because if the no parking zone.']

1678451854.0	10-Mar-2023 04:37:34	Extremely vague warning from Amazon about my “posts”	grantalx	29	11no240	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11no240/extremely_vague_warning_from_amazon_about_my_posts/	"I received this weird email from Amazon this morning:

“Hello,

One or more of your posts were found to be outside our guidelines. In order to help our customers make informed choices, we encourage them to review the product and contribute information about it. However, Community content that violate our guidelines or Conditions of Use will be removed.

Please consider this a first warning.”

They of course don’t tell me what the hell they’re talking about. 

By “posts” I assume they’re talking about reviews? There aren’t really any Amazon forums anymore, are there? 

I submit maybe one review a year. The last one I wrote was six months ago, and was basically “the pictures show that this product is sparkly, like it has glitter on it. It is not sparkly.”

And that’s the typical content. I’m not snide, political, whatever, just stick to the facts of the actual product.

Would it be safe to assume that some seller of a product in the distant past put in a dispute of a bad review I submitted years ago, and managed to somehow get me in “trouble” in the process of removing bad reviews?

I’m slightly annoyed (blah blah longtime Prime customer blah), but mostly perplexed. They include a link to their “posting” guidelines, which are thus:

> so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of ""spam"" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages. 

Needless to say none of that applies to my “the product picture is sparkly but the product itself isn’t sparkly-style reviews … unless writing a bad review is now “defamatory”.

So dumb."	23	"['I-Am_9: I think if a company takes the time to say you ""violated"" their ToS, then being vague and ambiguous is counterintuitive.

I bought a 700$ tablet on Amazon, it was an international order. After changing my mind, it was too late to cancel the order.

The associate on the phone called UPS to start a stop and return. It showed on the tracking, but somehow,  the item still reached me. I had already got my refund.

I refused delivery and called Amazon, a member of the leadership team said i can keep it, and sent me an email confirmation.

This was back in december 2022. In february i received an email from the account specialists that was messed up (codes, hyperlinks). I replied to it and they said it was just a mistake.

Yesterday i got an email saying my account was closed because i've already been warned about return/refund policy. Which is not true. I appealed to it and they ended up reopening my account but only restricting it to digital purchases.

Any help guys? I have like 1800$ of gift credit and out of 70+ orders i have max 5 refunds."	3	['Snoo-11928: take them to small claims court for the money they owe you, amazon are bullies and wont bother assisting you AT all. dont waste your time messaging them.', 'jixpixel94: Account specialists are the worst']

I often order from Amazon because of the cheap cost and speed of delivery, but at this point, I am more than ready to jump ship and just pay more for better service. They don't care if you have prime, delivery drivers and people in the warehouse still treat the products like they are footballs or soccerballs and kick/toss them around. 

  
I have had so many items arrive damaged that I have become painfully tired of complaining and trying to get some sort of compensation, let alone shipping them back for a return. Amazon has helped a few times but a lot of the times I have just given up on saying anything. I had a big order of brand-new books/manga arrive from Amazon today and 7 out of 10 of them were damaged to varying degrees. Rips on covers and spines, but worst off all were three of the brand ""new"" volumes being completely bent in half, another with the cover torn up along with the first six or so pages. 

  
After actually talking to a real person with amazon over the phone for once and making a tiny bit of a fuss and expressing my frustration with just how often I receive severely damaged and very poorly packaged products that just get thrown at my door, they gave me a whole 5% refund on a couple of the items, which is obviously not nearly enough to compensate but they said its the best they could do. 

I know the workers aren't paid enough, but this is a multi-billionaire dollar company we are talking about here. The fact that local shops and even *other* giant corporations care enough to at the very least put some thought into packaging just shows how garbage amazon is and how it's not worth it.

I only knew about it because my bank sent me a text saying I would go overdrawn as I have an alert on my account for large purchases.

I immediately phoned Amazon and managed to get it stopped and it was delivered back to the warehouse. They originally refunded my account and I requested it back as a giftcard balance so I could just use it when I wanted to buy something.

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks later, they locked my account while they investigated it. Despite me sending numerous emails and phone calls, I could not get my account back. I more or less gave up as it gave me too much anxiety.

A couple of weeks ago, I was looking for an Amazon order for a printer cartridge that I had originally bought on my old Amazon account and saw my ""sent"" emails regarding my account closure, so on a whim, I resent them, specifically to [Jeff@amazon.com](mailto:Jeff@amazon.com). Two days later, they reinstated my account!

I was over the moon but then when I actually got back into my account, my giftcard balance of over £500 was zero, with ""Balance Withheld"" as the reason. I have sent more emails since then asking for my gift card balance to be reinstated but haven't heard anything, what do I do now?

&#x200B;

Edit:  So I sent more emails last night and this morning, less than 6 hours later, I received an email that said they will be reinstating my balance but it might take a couple of days!

&#x200B;

I will only believe it when I see it in my Amazon account but if this has happened to you, don't give up, keep emailing.

I added another email address to my list yesterday and I don't know if this is the one that had an effect but I did get an automated reply to say they would look into it so its worth a go.

The email addresses that might be helpful for other people in this situation :

[jeff@amazon.com](mailto:jeff@amazon.com)   [dave@amazon.com](mailto:dave@amazon.com) and the one I think got me a reply is

If they managed to get it on there, a simple call tp the credit agency reporting that they have been unable to show proof of the debt would have it immediately removed. Proof of the debt would require YOUR signature on a document that states you will pay whatever fees/sum for said service, and have you tax id/whatever the Canadian social security number is. Name/address/credit card number is not enough. A simple security breech and info sold on the dark web could give someone that simple info. Nah.\n\nAnd you could easily prove to tax authorities that you paid. Show the Amazon order receipt from online on your account. Easy. They don't just roll up and arrest you lol.

Why would they even let the order go thru if there’s a limit (that you don’t know about)???!!Then chatted with Miko, who just kept saying “oh I see” then she escalated me to Desmond, apparently a higher level of customer specialist, who confirms that he has no way of knowing what my limit is! Who the hell knows then? Can you tell me before I waste time filling my cart?! He suggests breaking the order in 2. Which could be two orders of $400 each—-wouldn’t they both be cancelled???  He says one will probably be cancelled and hopefully the other will go thru.  Spin the wheel. That’s the advice of Amazon. That’s when Desmond admits “there are issues” with this service.

Fabulous_RedHead84	0	11ln8yz	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11ln8yz/so_do_i_have_any_recourse_of_action/	"I just got off the phone with three people and basically I’m not getting my items or a refund because the person who delivered it said they have proof I did get it (I didn’t) but I ordered about about 60 items some still are coming and they shorted me out of shirts, a 12 pack and they shorted me a very expensive make up powder mica set worth about $55 for my resin products and because I went through Affirm, they told me I am still responsible for paying them even though I didn’t get the items. They told me I was under investigation or something like that? I said go ahead and investigate me, but I didn’t get the items and they were two items out of 22 items that I didn’t get. The Indian guy that I spoke to because they stopped hiring call centers in America, told me I was being investigated lol. If I was going to commit fraud, it would be for far more than a $55 and a $35 item. The printer was dead on arrival, so I did the right thing and sent it back but they are not doing the right thing. Amazon really is going downhill to a point where after I get my stuff I’m never ordering from them again. I will order from another place.

I have no protection with Affirm apparently either. Same with a thermal printer machine. It was worth 130 and I sent it back because it didn’t work. It was dead on arrival. They are not only not giving me a refund but I sent the item back and UPS has proof of it. I have proof that they got it and they are telling me they never got it. UPS confirmed to me and to them. I have proof, including the phone call, not the actual audio but, proof that I called and then I called UPS, and UPS did confirm. I sent that to the Better Business Bureau through pictures. Including the tracking that says delivered and the receipt. I made a claim through there, not that they are bothering with doing anything. Their score on there is like 1.9 and that’s pretty low for a BBB. PayPal is doing the same thing though. I swear, they took advice from PayPal and it’s going to come back and bite them in the butt.

It really is time to start finding another place. I know a few places that are currently being advertised and from what I understand they’re pretty good and they make items here in the US and sell them. I might give them a try. Anyhow. There is a lawsuit going for Amazon right now and I’m going to try to see if I can get in on that. I have proof I just have to see if I can contact that lawyer. What is an anti-trust but somebody needs to start one for the buyer side. I mean, do I have a recourse of action? I already filed with the BBB."	8	"['cheezerman: Definitely file a lawsuit against Amazon and please post your experience here!', 'Throwingshead: Is this real?', 'Fabulous_RedHead84: I am getting to work on trying to file a lawsuit right now.

I figured people can join me if they’d like because, I didn’t get some of my stuff and they’re refusing a refund/ replacement I had to go through the seller and ask them to help me out, and I still had to pay for it through Affirm. Which means I am out of those items, and I am still liable, for the payments. Even though I didn’t get it according to Affirm, which said I can dispute it, but they still found with Amazon.

Considering whether to renew my Prime subscription and came across the fact that they offer photo backup.  I do have about 2TB of RAW files (NEF) which I wouldn't mind backing up to one additional location, apparently there is no size limit and NEF is a supported format.  Though I have a couple questions:

1. I assume I can upload from my PC?
2. Will the backup retain folder structure?  Usually photos are nested either one or two folderes deep
3. Are these photos at all secure?  Or does the EULA give Amazon the right to train their AI algorithms on our photos and shit?
4. How is the restore process?

Thanks for any info!

Also, do you guys subscribe year round or on a month by month basis?

Employees or DSP employees are not to have box cutters which is considered a weapon. The packages can easily be opened by ripping or tearing them. They can just return it damaged to the warehouse for re packaging if they didn't want it. Rather to give the customer a damaged packages again. If they were going to steal your package you will never see it.. plain and simple.. I can tell you how they do it. Here's the scenario every time your package goes from one location to another it is scanned even when we get it to put it in the van we have to scan your package. So these people that want to steal your package they won't scan that particular package so you will see it as scanned as last location which would have been let's say the warehouse so you never see it out for delivery so most likely you will see it at the last location it was at before delivery you will never see that package and it'll just sit there and sit there and sit there even though it's already been on the van and the guy already probably took it home you will never see it. And after a few days you're going to question it why has not left the warehouse yet and you're going to call for a refund or or another shipment and they will report it as lost or missing and either send your refund or send you another package. An Amazon can't tell since it was never scanned into the van that it even left the warehouse. or they report it missing and it's will reprocessed and another item would be reshipped. Not everyone is a thief, but Amazon is good on issuing refunds and replacing packages. I have never had a problem with them when it comes to that. I understand that if happens more often than not. But I hope these idiots would not risk their jobs to steal a shirt that they decided they didn't want. And delivered an opened package.. I am sorry this happened.. but I would not want a customer to report me that I had opened their package without proof as to that is what happened without a doubt. I feel conflicted to deliver a cut package. But I only had one item that was damaged to the item from the box cutter out  of say 10 packages cut. Most customers would rather have it if it wasn't damaged to the item inside.  And I would be very upset after delivering a cut package with no damage to the item and getting reported for opening a package I would stop delivering to those houses as I don't feel safe and return all packages to warehouse.. until that address was blacklisted."", 'Helpful_Maize1308: Oof that last part doesn’t sound too good but at least they would be notified it’s off?

Just in my area this can happen a lot and already has ppl admit it to me.', 'steven82792: Hey I hold nothing against anyone, I understand your concern completely.']"

1678117065.0	06-Mar-2023 07:37:45	Second fraudulent order through Amazon. I have zero trust in Amazon. Cancelled my Prime.	Wallytooters	1	11k248b	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11k248b/second_fraudulent_order_through_amazon_i_have/	"This has been the 2nd time someone has gained access and ordered large items. In October I noticed a bunch of tiny orders placed on Amazon, tons of registration emails to throw me off. I believe it's called brushing to test if any orders are placed with my card. They attempted to order a $1k electronic gift card. What I didn't catch until months later was an Xbox trade in through Amazon. They got an electronic gift card sent to them right away, and since I don't even own the xbox to ""trade in"", Amazon eventually charged my card when Amazon didn't receive my xbox. Also the $1k order was put into Archived Orders so it doesn't show up on your normal Orders page. 


Before any of this happened, I had 2FA setup. Amzon told me I needed to set it up - I already had. That was their only tip and said they'd look into it. *Sure*. From this point I started using Bitwarden for everything and I don't even know my passwords. Now they are something like 'j2!ll_*_jhMN81IIll(^dsm6xkfi' I don't share my accounts with anyone. I set tighter alerts when any purchase is made from my Visa card.  My biggest question is WTF is my 2FA notification / OTP code?


Last weekend I woke up to a $700 charge from Amazon. Saw about 70 registration emails""Fcuk a duck"".  An iPad was ordered and being sent to some place in TX with same day shipping. With a gift receipt and a note saying ""Enjoy the gift"". I've read scenarios that this address is just an innocent bystander. And a delivery driver will go to that location to pickup the iPad to ""return"" the item. That's where the theft happens.  Funny thing is the delivery address in Texas was only 2 miles from an Amazon warehouse. So either the driver simply doesn't deliver the iPad to the address and drops it off at a different address or car. Or makes the delivery and comes back with all of the Amazon clothing and possibly the Amazon truck. When Amazon barely pays their employees - I wouldn't put it past them. (I never got a delivery email or photo, but probably because I cancelled my Prime before it would've arrived. )


I chatted with Amazon about the fraud and asked them to refund my recently renewed yearly payment for $136. I saw the Prime membership pending return right away on my banking app. I'm done. I've never had problems with fraud on my card until this past year and Amazon is the pattern. Not worth it. I'll be using Sam's Club, Walmart online, Target pickup (within 2 hours) or online orders, or just buying elsewhere. We live in the city and pass by the stores every day. Amazon is no longer worth the hassle of changing cards, calling my bank, calling Amazon. Especially when the 2 day shipping turns into 4-7 days. Bye Jeff!"	5	"['RedMapleBat: Did you change your email and Amazon account passwords after each hack?  I don’t really understand your sentence about the OTP code.  Are you saying you never received such a code?  If not, did the hacker change your phone number in your account?  It’s hard to say for sure how the hacker got into your account, but I understand it’s hard to do when 2FA is enabled, unless your device has been compromised or you’re using insecure Wi-Fi.\n\nYou could still use Amazon, but instead of leaving your cc on file, delete it.  Enter it (and then delete it) whenever you want to make a purchase.  Unfortunately, you run the same risk using the other retailers you mentioned, if you leave your cc on file.  \n\nI find it interesting that the hacker didn’t change your Amazon password.  You still had access to your account.', 'GlobetrOtterEric: 2FA is secure, no offense but could be a family member with access to your device(s) or compromised devices', ""Wallytooters: I changed my email and passwords back in October after the first fraudulent happening.  \n\n\nBoth fraudulent issues in October AND last week didn't send me an OTP code. Phone number is still the same. My wifi is secure and was updated after October too. I did remove the card after a few orders, but left it in there after the last order in mid February and then it happens again. I don't save any passwords on my browsers nor iPhone keychains. \n\nI'm open to more suggestions."", 'Wallytooters: None taken. Wife only orders through me and doesn’t use the Bitwarden app.', 'RedMapleBat: A while ago, I read a Reddit that sounded similar to yours.  The poster enabled 2FA, but still had a problem.  The poster then discovered that the hacker had gotten in through a TV and was still logged in.  The 2FA didn’t log the hacker out.  I don’t know the technical details of how that can lead to access to an Amazon account.\n\nBut, if you’re getting OTP codes when you sign in, but not for the hacker, it suggests to me the possibility the hacker is still signed in.  Or, the hacker is getting the OTP to go elsewhere that you don’t see.  In my Amazon account, I see under Login & Security there is a Compromised Account button.  I’ve never tried it, but I guess that’s an option.   Also, there is a Messages button (Account > Messages).  You could scroll through the messages, which are copies of every email Amazon ever sent to you, to see if you notice messages you never actually received.  That might suggest an issue with your email.  Having your email set up with 2FA is a good idea.\n\nBeyond that, I’m out of ideas.  I guess you could start fresh with a new Amazon account in which you set up 2FA right from the start.  Also 2FA on your email account.']"
1678086810.0	05-Mar-2023 23:13:30	Amazon Canada was once a great service, but has steadily gone downhill. It is now at a level where it's gotten so bad that it is almost unusable, and has gotten downright exploitative.	DustinPooparski	29	11jrma2	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11jrma2/amazon_canada_was_once_a_great_service_but_has/	"Cancelled my prime membership today for various reasons, but I am frankly disgusted with the direction Amazon has taken their business in the past few years. I have been a prime member since 2014, which is almost a decade, so I have a lot of experience with it. I've made thousands of purchases, most of which were great, but the past few years several things have reached the level of unacceptable and I just cancelled my prime service today.

here's what has been bugging me:

More and more items are taking over a week to deliver, despite being prime. I live in a populated city in Canada with a population of a million people, and there is an Amazon warehouse right outside the city. A few years ago when the warehouse was built, Amazon actually started moving towards having more one day guaranteed delivery items, which gave me hope for the future, but somehow things have gotten worse since the warehouse was built. These days when I buy an item, it usually takes 4-5 days to deliver, sometimes a week, even if it is a legit Prime and not a ""fulfilled by amazon"". A few years ago they also started offering ""free delivery for prime members"" items, rather than outright prime items, which as you know are items that aren't really prime, and are actually sold by a third party. I am not talking about these items, I am talking about actual prime items. (although I will add that it is a little annoying that Amazon doesn't have a way to filter \*actual\* prime items from these ""free delivery for prime members"" items when you search.

Delivery dates on prime items are dishonest on the website, and feel like a bait and switch a lot of the time. You can see this for yourself on many items. Perfect example is one that happened to me today. I'm looking for a certain item and before i actually put in my cart, it says that it will be delivered by ""Tuesday March 7"". However, when you go through the checkout, the earliest shipping option you can choose is ""Wednesday March 8"". It really seems like they want to paint a prettier picture about the delivery date before you decide to buy an item, then as you are actually buying it, they do a sleight of hand trick and suddenly change it. Even if you go back and refresh the listing, it still clearly says ""Tuesday March 7"", it even has the count down of ""if you order in the next 6 hours and 32 minutes"", but in the actual check out, they add a day. And on top of that, this date can actually change even after you mutter under your breath and begrudgingly agree to buy it. This exact thing happened today, which was actually the straw that finally pushed me to cancel prime. I ordered this item, listing said Tuesday March 7, checkout said earliest is Wednesday March 8. I agreed to buy it. I check the orders page an hour later, and my delivery date was changed from March 8 to ""March 28 - April 1"". WTF. I guess the item isn't actually in stock or something? I go back to the listing, and it's still being advertised as ""get it Tuesday March 7"". This incident in particular made me wonder how they can be doing this at all, and what am I even paying for? It's bad enough that prime items went from being delivered in two days to three days, to four, to five, and the fact that they are now being very deceptive about the delivery dates, but adding a whole month to a two day purchase? I feel like I am going crazy. Maybe this was an extreme case, but I just feel completely disrespected by this type of thing, it just feels like they are treating me like a sucker, and it kind of feels like some kind of cheap bait and switch parlor trick.

Customer service has gotten more and more stingy, to the point where now, they have removed almost any possible way for you to contact customer service. Everything is automated options that give you certain options and that's it. Most recently I received a used item, which is clearly used by a previous owner - it's opened, and damaged inside, parts are missing. However this item is not available anymore, so my only option is to return it or to exchange it for a different item. But the thing is, this item is hard to find, and I would actually gladly keep it if they offered me a partial refund. I just feel like a sucker paying full price for a used and damaged item, so I kind of have to either give up on the idea of owning it altogether, or just live with being ripped off. Partial refund is not an option anymore apparently.

I keep getting items that are broken, damaged, or not as described. Being a member for 9 years it's very noticeable how many listings now are just deceptive and dishonest. I recently bought some vacuum cleaner attachments that were listed as fitting the model vacuum cleaner I have, but the item I received is generic and doesn't actually fit my specific vacuum cleaner, despite specifically stating the model in the listing. The item I was sent is actually downright garbage. It legitimately belongs in the trash. It's a product-shaped object rather than a product, just an absolute scam.

Prime fee went up from 7.99 to 9.99 a month, and I wasn't even notified about it. But when I went to cancel my prime membership, they put me through three pages of ""are you sure you want to cancel?"" I am not kidding. After clicking cancel, they directed me to a page that is basically a sales pitch summarizing all the awesome benefits of prime, and gave me three options - remind me three days before membership renewal, proceed with cancellation, or remain a prime member. I clicked proceed with cancellation, and they took me to ANOTHER page where they AGAIN gave me a sales pitch summarizing all the awesome benefits of prime, and offered the SAME three options. I clicked proceed with cancellation, and they took me to a THIRD PAGE with the SAME same sales pitch, and the SAME three options, but this time they were actually arranged differently (possibly to trick me into clicking the wrong one, kind of like the cups and balls trick). So I had to click on the original cancel prime membership link, then I had to go through THREE ""are you sure you REALLY want to cancel?"" pages before they finally let me cancel. I swear, this tactic is intended to make people believe that they have cancelled their membership, when in actuality they didn't. After the first ""are you sure?"", and the second ""are you REALLY sure?"", some people will probably just assume that after they click ""yes, please friggin cancel"" the second time that their membership really is cancelled. But no, they make you do it a THIRD time. It's unbelievable how disrespectful and exploitative this kind of tactic is. I wonder how many people have had incidents where they genuinely believed they cancelled prime, only to find it still being charged to their credit card when they get their credit card statement. It really seems like a deliberate tactic to squeeze out some extra payments from people who aren't paying attention.

Also, Prime Video and Prime Music aren't great. Aside from a few good shows on there most of it is crap that you can get for free on apps like Tubi or other free streaming services. It's really not any kind of incentive to be a prime member in my opinion. Although I did watch all of The Mentalist on Prime, which is a great show."	7	"['Ash_Draevyn: I hear ya. Also in Canada. It’s quite obvious how terrible it has gotten. And how fast it got that way. I’m lucky, I guess, I receive my orders relatively fast. But it’s not like before.\n\nWhat really pisses me off is the amount of damaged items I’m receiving.  If I’m ordering a gift for someone or if it’s a collectible item…Product boxes are damaged 7/10 times; nevertheless, arriving in immaculate Amazon boxes. Which means they are intentionally shipping these items. What the hell? \n\nI usually just exchange for the same item…when the replacement arrives it’s in perfect condition with much better packaging!! So they know exactly what they’re putting into the boxes. (It also arrives much faster)\n\nWhy are they intentionally shipping out this stuff when they know it’ll be returned, then subsequently make the return process horrible for the customer? \n\nThe assholes who used Amazon as a rental service for years has made it hell for honest consumers. Is this Amazon’s retaliation? They’re only shooting themselves in the foot. \n\nDaily posts on account banning, people cancelling their membership and Jumping ship to Best Buy and Walmart.

Similar reasons, mostly ridiculously long shipping and sudden terrible customer service.', 'TehPurpleCod: I’m in the USA but I agree anyway. I still pay for Prime because my entire family uses it (different address) and I do have some niche items I can’t find elsewhere. But overall, Amazon’s service has gone down drastically. I ran into many situations where one day delivery ends up being two or more days. The warehouse near me is known to have bad logistics and lost packages constantly. Customer service is really bad too and also, I ran into so many sketchy third party sellers so I stopped buying third party. For electronics, if it’s less than $100, I’ll buy off Amazon Prime. If more, I take myself to a retail store.\n\nEdit: I’ve been a Prime member for I think over ten years too. They banned me from writing reviews about a year ago for a false reason then when I reached out to them to resolve the matter, customer service told me they’re not obliged to reinstate me.', 'None: [deleted]', ""Just_Low_1294: I have cancelled my annual subscription and left amazon music now that they have basically made the free to members totally unusable.

T2LV	4	11i9jy0	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11i9jy0/does_amazon_track_all_returns_whether_shipsold/	"Ive returned a few more things than usual the last few months and randomly stumbled upon an article about somone being banned for returns. 
On average I return around 10%. Many returns are not as described and unused/unopened but I have had a few returns of a $200-300 items that just didnt work well/crapped out on me after a few weeks or bought used and decided I would prefer brand new with warranty. I also have a tendency to buy third party cheap China items, them arrive and realize they work horrbily, return and buy the higher price brand name item.

I buy a lot of items from them, have never received a warning but would be destroyed if I did. I have 30~ items on my monthly subscribe and save and order from them daily. I easily spend over $1500+/month from them. 

LSS Do they only track, returns for no reason that have been opened, or do they also include: brand new, used items returned in same used condition, third party sellers, and defective items?"	4	['amerifolklegend: Maybe I don’t understand what you’re asking. Do you mean can you track your package back to Amazon if it’s a third party shipping company who was used for the return? Or are you wondering if the return itself - like the fact that you returned something at all - is tracked? \n\nIf it’s the former, that will solely depend on the shipping company. Only they can provide tracking information back to Amazon to then push to you. They are not required to provide detailed shipping information, however. \n\nBut if it’s the latter…everything you do is tracked. Obviously every order and return are tracked. Who the retailer, shipper, returning company, or anything like that are is irrelevant. Literally everything you do is tracked. Your searches, your time spent on any given page, your keystrokes, everything. There is nothing you do with Amazon on their site that isn’t tracked. It’s also all automated, so it’s not like a person is manually flowing you around as you make your way through the site. If you want a simple example of what goes on, play around with a web app called Lucky Orange. It’s a more basic version of the kind of recording that Amazon can do, but optimized and made more pretty for small businesses. \n\nAnd it’s not like some dude is on a computer somewhere pulling your file to make some grand decision to ban you or perhaps give their blessing on a return. Everything is automated and triggers are created to start an action. If something causes a person’s account to get locked, for instance, something that they did with the account (on purpose or accident) automatically triggered that locking to happen.', 'Mea0521: Yes, all returns are documented.  Be careful.', 'T2LV: Wondering about the return itself being tracked. Ie. If amazon decides you are returning too many items they will close your account. I am wondering if all returns regardless or reason/seller, count towards this tally.', 'amerifolklegend: Yeah, doesn’t matter who the seller is.  A return is a return.']
1677894883.0	03-Mar-2023 17:54:43	FINALLY managed to make at least WEEKEND shipping dates show up for my Amazon Canada account.	bigbabytdot	3	11hm45g	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11hm45g/finally_managed_to_make_at_least_weekend_shipping/	"Let me start off my saying that I live in downtown Toronto, and the Amazon fulfillment centre is less than an hour drive from me, in Mississauga.

As I mentioned in the Shipping Rant Megathread, up until about three months ago, I had the filter option in my Amazon searches for Prime and Prime One-Day.

The One-Day search filter option disappeared quite suddenly, and along with it, NONE of the items I looked at, no matter how basic or ubiquitous, lacked a One-Day option.

On top of that, anything I ordered with Prime Two-Day completely ignored weekends as being real days. Would never set the delivery for a weekend, and would always start the delivery timer from the next day no matter when I ordered it. (Countdowns are also absolutely gone.) Like, I would order something completely normal on Prime, like batteries, pens, or light bulbs, on a Thursday afternoon, and it would set the delivery date for the following Tuesday.

Three months ago I contacted Amazon support through phone, chat, and email multiple times to get this sorted out. Escalated my calls to supervisors at least twice, but to no avail. There was absolutely nothing they could do to bring back my fast Prime shipping options and search filters, and that was that.

Fast forward to today when I'm just buggering around on the Amazon site deciding to take another crack at it... and to my astonishment, I managed to get delivery dates for THIS SUNDAY. (Apparently Saturday still doesn't exist,) but WOW.

How did I accomplish this? Black magic you ask? No... I went to my digital content settings and clicked on my region to ""change it"". Filled in my address and everything, and lo-and-behold, now TORONTO shows up to the left of my search bar on the home page, along with my still-truncated postal code. (Something about Amazon's website absolutely loves cutting off the last digit of Canadian postal codes, and I have not found any way to fix that, nor has Amazon apparently.)

Anyway, small small small victory, I know. But if you're a Canadian Amazon customer and you've been going through Hell trying to get decent shipping options to show up for your address... try restating your region in the Digital Content preferences. Maybe it'll help, maybe it won't. But I'm excited that weekends exist for my account again."	0	[]

Since the receipts clearly state they cannot be used for returns, after a week I tossed my receipts and physical gift cards.

Now, after placing my first order, nearly 4 weeks later, Amazon decides to suspend my account until I can produce proof that the gift cards were purchased by me with a receipt.

I don't have a receipt (and who does 4 weeks after purchasing), so I tried to negotiate by telling them the location and date I bought the gift cards, in case they monitor where each of their gift cards are sold. They give no explanation but decided to close my account. I'm out $500 now.

Anything I can do at this point? Filed a report with Better Business Bureau. Otherwise - a PSA for all folks out there:

Keep your receipts for Amazon Gift Cards Until they are spent. If you are given gift cards from someone else (no receipt), redeem the minimum amount each time that you need to buy whatever you're buying, so if Amazon decides to steal the money, you don't lose the entire gift card balance but only the amount you redeemed.

Update 3/7: I stopped by Whole Foods. With Google Maps tracking the exact time I bought the receipts, I gave them the date and time and they printed out a receipt for me!

Now trying Amazon again. Will update once I hear back.

Update 3/14: Amazon has stopped responding to me and still refuses to honor or refund the $500. Posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/11rfooh/need_help_filing_small_court_claim_whole_foods/) about trying small claims court. "	6	"[""RedMapleBat: Were it me, I might take them to small claims court (and I've never done that so far in my life).  $500 is a lot of money.  If they want receipts, they should state that they require proof of purchase at the time of redemption, not weeks later.  And, it should state on the gift card that a receipt is required in order to redeem the code.\n \nThis is assuming you purchased the cards from an authorized seller (like a drug store or grocery store)."", ""AHeroToIdolize: Did you buy it with card? Try doing a chargeback and include the email from amazon saying they can't verify it without a receipt and then shut down your account. I usually don't encourage this bc Amazon will retaliate by closing/banning accounts for chargebacks, but since you're already in that bucket there's nothing to lose. \n\nI had a similar issue with another store a few years ago, where I bought about $250 of gift cards but then that store had some kind of gift card scam and they invalidated the ones I bought. When 5 weeks went by and they didn't refund me like they said they would, I then filed a chargeback and got my money back. My bank was really easy to work with and they said having those letters/emails saying there was fraud concern from the store really helped my case."", ""throwaway1335352: Appreciate the suggestion, I'll look into it."", 'throwaway1335352: I bought with cash.

Thanks.	btadams1971	7	11hbrxx	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11hbrxx/please_give_me_feedback_thanks/	Hello drivers. I’m just curious as to how things work. I’m in Park City , Utah. I have moved here from Los Angeles where if I ordered an item overnight it would arrive. Now, in Utah, the last 5 items I have ordered overnight have not arrived. They have shown out for delivery, but then I get a notice that Amazon is sorry for the delay, but it won’t arrive today. It then takes 1-3 days to arrive. I’ve even had one not show up at all. On regular orders I will on probably 20% of my orders have it show up as delivered, but then isn’t until the next day. Talking to customer service, which is never in the US, they can never do anything to help. What steps should I take? I love some advice. I can’t let this keep happening. 3 overnight orders ago I actually lost a contract because I couldn’t give a presentation. The item I needed didn’t arrive the day it was supposed to, and not even the next day when I needed it. But I was promised up and down it would, and that Amazon was taking it seriously. They don’t seem to care. It’s never UPS or USPS. It’s always Amazon delivery. I’m hesitant now to order from Amazon, it’s always a hassle. Which it never was in Los Angeles. Who can I call that isn’t in India or the Philippines? They are call centers who never help, never. They say Amazon Logistics won’t talk to the public. I am confident it’s because they do such a poor job that they can’t handle the volume. Please help me figure this out. Who do I call? Thanks.	2	"['Animal-Crackers: Volume of orders per zip matters a lot to Amazon. And they only have one “same day” fulfillment center in Utah.

AHeroToIdolize	3	11gbk4y	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11gbk4y/amazon_trying_to_charge_me_for_returns_from_a/	"I know lots of people have had issues with returns lately but mine is going really far back!!

I had fraud on my Amazon account (items bought on the site through my Amazon store credit card) in November ‘22 and it took a month of constant calling and escalation, but they finally fixed it. Then I got emails saying I needed to return items from the fraudulent orders in order for the refund to process, which obviously I can’t do since someone else ordered them. I closed my Amazon credit card when the fraud happened and didn’t renew my prime membership because of the fraud and how difficult they were. Amazon finally said they wouldn’t charge me for the fraudulent items and I assumed everything was finished since I closed all my accounts. This was all settled back in the end of December. 

Now, in the last two weeks I’ve gotten over a dozen emails telling me items I returned over a year ago need to be returned or else they will charge me. Obviously I returned them, but CS and returns told me they can’t help me at this point since it’s passed the 30 day return period (duh, I returned these items in the end of 2021). It’s a sizeable amount that they’re looking to re-charge me in the next week or so if I don’t return the items. 

I only had my Amazon credit card on my account the last few years and since it’s closed I’m wondering how they think will charge me if it’s closed? I don’t really care if they ban my account since I haven’t used it the last couple of months,but should I be worried that they will send this to collections? 

Another weird thing is that a few days ago Amazon issued me a refund for an item I never even bought?? And it refunded onto my closed Amazon credit card. I called synchrony bank which houses the Amazon credit card and they said refunds can’t be overturned now that the card is closed so I should ignore their emails…but idk if I can trust the representatives since they didn’t know how the refund processed on the closed card (and yes, it fully processed it’s not just pending). 

Has anyone dealt with this? Should I be concerned?"	1	['Username-dumb75: Don’t have a clue…..but Amazon just gets shittier and shittier.  Good luck with this.']

For back story as a broke college student back in 2020 I ordered some items of significant value from Amazon and unfortunately due to bad influence surrounding me (friends), I was convinced to report the items as DNA and basically get them for free.

I ordered an intel 13600k cpu back in Jan. However, I was able to find one for a cheaper price so I decided to cancel the order.

So when the driver arrived, I told my driver that I need them to return it. 

Not long after, the status of the item becomes ""return received"" on the orders page (on Feb. 6th). After 3 days I reached out to customer service as I still have not received a refund. I was told then that I will have to wait until 28th to get back to them. So I waited.

Today is 28th and when I reached out to customer service again, I was told that they ""simply cannot process refund"" and that I have to ""keep waiting for refund to be issued"". What the fuck? They can't even tell me when because they ""do not have the option to process refund"".

Recently I ordered a pair of JBL wireless headphones and some C4 Preworkout which were supposed to arrive in the same package, instead I only recieved a little girls braclet making kit lol, the braclet making kit even has a sticker on it claiming to be C4 Jacked Preworkout lmao.

The issue is that customer service is having a serious hard time understanding my issue, they keep asking me to return the items for a refund which I can't do because I never recieved them in the first place — eventually one rep seemed to understand and told me to send back the braclet making kit and issued me a return label but that label is indicative of a JBL headphones it comes with a battery hazard sticker and everything; I don't want to send back this braclet making kit only for them to say I sent back the wrong item and not issue my refund. 

CS has spammed me with over 20 emails with basically the same copy and pasted please send back the item for a refund, and I can't get a clear answer as to if they want the JBL and C4 I never got for a refund, or to just send back this stupid toy for my refund. 

When I check Amazon it says ""Return started"" your refund will be processed when we recieve the item. But the wording makes it seem like they want me to return JBL headphones for a refund (which I never got), the fact they aren't saying anything about the $30 Preworkout missing to is also annoying ugh.

Both have been well outside the return window.  One was a foot product that we had used maybe a quarter of.  The other was an assistive device we bought for my mom four years ago that she uses daily and was recalled for a safety issue (people have been asphyxiated using it because it collapses if you put weight on it in the wrong way and they have pulled it down onto themselves and died ... which is pretty scary).

In both cases, Amazon emailed me a recall notice with a link to https://amazon.com/your-product-safety-alerts and both of the recall notices are listed there.  (This wasn't some weird phishing attack or something ... it was a legitimate notice from Amazon.)

Both of the recall notices say to return the product to your retailer for a refund.

In both cases when I called Amazon support, they kinda fumbled around not sure what to do and then eventually just issued a partial refund for a completely unrelated item that I bought in the last month.

I feel like that's not the right process and that was just a support person who couldn't figure out the right process using the tools they have available.

Gonna have to go the bank chargeback route. Hopefully that goes through.

My girlfriend ordered some AirPods Pro 2nd Gen for me, shipped and sold new by Amazon. They were clearly fakes and none of the serial numbers (on box, on AirPods, in iOS) matched up. We explained the situation to support and returned the fakes, but we just received an email saying an “incorrect item” was returned and no refund will be issued until the correct item is sent. They’ve also discarded the “incorrect item”. 

Chat support has been no help, so we’ve emailed the returns team and are waiting for their reply. What else can we do in this situation? I realize we don’t have much proof and it’s Amazon’s word against ours, but it’s ridiculous that we received fakes in the first place, let alone have our refund refused.

The reason for that was that instead of the dashcam, I had a nicely boxed and shrinkwrapped... gift card for a Chinese web site I'd never heard of.

Mistakes happen, so I returned it and tried again... also don't recall sold by \\[again, not Thinkware,) but shipped by Amazon.\n\nI got an identical boxed gift card-- again.

I know Amazon will notify you if the person you're sharing with adds one of your cards to their wallets, but can they immediately use it at that point, even if the shipping address differs from all previous addresses used with that card? I know if I change my shipping address, Amazon requires you to re-enter your card info---does that also hold true here?

Also, does anyone know if the zero liability clause of credit cards (specifically the Amazon Prime card) applies in this circumstance? I guess you're authorizing the user by entering them into your household, so I'm worried that there are no consumer protections whatsoever and that even asking Amazon to simply cancel/return the orders may not go through because you've authorized the individual but simultaneously don't have access to their orders, etc.

Can anyone weigh in? Could I be liable for Amazon orders up to my credit limit with no recourse?

A letter from Amazon's CEO
Amazon welcomes One Medical
Dear Customers,
Today, getting great health care is often too difficult and inconvenient. Typically, you have to find a doctor, make an appointment a few weeks in advance, and drive 15-20 minutes or longer to the doctor’s office. When you get there, you wait in the reception area for a while, get called by a nurse into an exam room, wait another 10-15 minutes or so, and eventually see a doctor for only a few minutes who often then prescribes a medication. Finally, you drive 20 minutes or more to the pharmacy and wait for the medication to be ready—all while you or a loved one you’re caring for aren’t feeling well. It’s a lot of work; and let’s face it, the system isn’t working for customers or clinicians.
At Amazon, we’re trying to improve the health care experience for customers. We started by building Amazon Pharmacy, with a broad selection of medications sent to you with reliable, free delivery. We then added RxPass, a new Prime benefit from Amazon Pharmacy, which for $5/month lets Prime members get as many medications as they need from a list of 60 medications frequently used to treat many common conditions—and shipping is free. We also recently launched Amazon Clinic, which offers a convenient, personalized, and affordable way to get medical advice and treatment for over 20 conditions (like migraines, allergies, sinusitis, and more) simply by messaging with a clinician—no appointments, no travel.
Today, we’re excited to announce that One Medical has joined Amazon and our mission to make it dramatically easier for customers to get what they need to stay healthy. With One Medical, customers can connect with clinicians 24/7 via video chat or messaging if that’s most convenient. Or, customers can choose to make an appointment same day or within days to visit any of One Medical’s offices in many U.S. cities. If you need a specialist, One Medical works closely with lots of hospital systems and can help you get a referral and an appointment quickly. One Medical works with most insurance providers, and while you can of course get your prescription filled anywhere that’s convenient for you, you can also choose to have it delivered to your door by Amazon Pharmacy. This is how primary care should work.
For a limited time, to celebrate One Medical joining Amazon, you can now join One Medical with a discounted annual membership of $144 for the first year (a 28% discount), the equivalent of $12 per month, for new U.S. customers.
We’re just at the beginning of what’s possible. Customers tell us there is a need to radically improve the health care experience, and we think we can help. At Amazon, together with One Medical, we’re determined to help make it easy for you to get the care, the medication, and other products and services you need to get and stay healthy.
Wishing you good health,

1677200457.0	23-Feb-2023 17:00:57	Charged for Free Trial	itisadessertwine	0	11ae8xw	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/11ae8xw/charged_for_free_trial/	I just started my free trial and when I looked at my email later on, I had received an email from my bank notifying me of a charge from Amazon for $1.50. I immediately logged into my online banking account to check it out and it showed two processing transactions from Amazon, one depositing $1.50, and then another charging me $1.50, so my current available balance remained the same. I contacted Amazon support and they weren't able to tell me why I was charged for this. First I was told it was because I added shows included with Prime onto my list (I didn't even watch them just added them to my list btw) even though that's included with the Prime free trial and I should not be charged for watching them. Then I was transferred to someone else to help me and he couldn't because he needed the order ID number to see what the charge was for which I did not have. This charge doesn't show up in my order history on Amazon and the ID doesn't show up in my transactions on my bank account either. He told me to get it from my bank and I'm having trouble getting in contact with someone there so I just want to know if anyone here has any idea what this is about or if they've had a similar experience? The only explanation I can come up with is this transaction happened to make sure the card I used was valid, but when I asked them about that they seemed to ignore that comment and gave me the aforementioned responses. I specifically started the free trial so I could watch a new show that's coming out but now I feel a bit hesitant to use it after this. 	6	"['OnionTruck: That\'s not unusual for ""free"" trials.

I was eligible for a month long free trial of prime and a week long free trial of the hbo max add on.

The hbo max add on was supposed to renew on 1/30, and I thought I had the payment method set so it would charge my gift card. I used it for 3 weeks and then suddenly got an email saying the charge had been unsuccessful. 

I've tried to change the payment method but it won't seem to let me set it to my existing, already redeemed gift card balance at all. It will only let me use a credit card (and frankly, I am poor so I really needed to use the gift card), or redeem a *new* gift card, but gives me no option whatsoever to use my gift card balance. I tried contacting support and they just said I can't use my gift card balance to pay for prime video add ons, but that seems at odds with the fact that it gives me an option to use a new gift card (just not an already redeemed one), and with this page that says people in the US (which I am) can now use gift cards to pay for prime channels https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=TZti7yJP0CwBRPyc2R

Does anyone have any advice on how to get this sorted out? I still want to pay for another month with my gift card if I can but am unsure how to get my digital payment method to change to that. The extra frustrations are first of all, I had prime for years and it was CONSTANTLY using my gift card balance to pay for it, even when I didn't want it to. And now it won't let me do it when I *do* want to? And the second frustration/confusion is that now it says my subscription has just been cancelled and bc it's a ""past"" subscription, it won't even seem to let me change my payment method *at all*, but I'm unclear on whether I still owe them the money they attempted to charge me on 1/30 and don't want my account to be in trouble bc I haven't paid them or something."	3	"['RedMapleBat: Well, the link in your post states:  \n""To access a free trial (if eligible), you’ll need to add a credit or debit card as a backup payment method.

With Canadian customs becoming more and more difficult to deal with, I stopped doing that in 2017. I don't recall being Prime USA but I always was a Amazon Prime Canada member.

Fast forward to this month, because of Netflix new policy and the impossibility to share passwords, I redownloaded Amazon Prime Video so I supposed it promped a notification telling me I was billed this month for ""Amazon Prime US""... So I make my research and discovered Prime US and Prime Canada were 2 different things... so 2 different bills.

I go to my billing account in Amazon USA and discover I've been billed 13.99$ or 14.99$ USD for the last... 48 months. So in total, since January 2019 I've been an American Prime member and never knew it. It's about 700 USD.

I recognize I have some responsibility in this but since I was paying double (Canadian & American) membership, and never used the US account, it seems to me I should get a full refund on this one.

I called the customer service yesterday and they accepted to refund 27 months on the 48 total. I didn't push to talk to the manager and see how I could get a full refund. But thinking about it, I'm wondering if I should have. What do you guys think ?

My Prime membership renews every December. I also pay for Music Unlimited, which renews every October. And I often pay for various Amazon channels for a month or two here and there.

I recently went back to school and thought about switching to the student membership. I know that if I switch now, I'll get a pro-rated refund of my membership fee that I paid in December. I also know that the 6 month free trial of Student Prime does not include prime music or prime video.

So my question is - even if I don't have Prime Music for those 6 months, will I still have Unlimited since I paid for it in October? And even if I don't have Prime Video, can I still sign up for Channels? I see that Student memberships can sign up for Showtime for 99 cents/month - can I do that during the 6 month free trial or do I have to wait until I'm on the paid membership?"	1	['None: Can I have a student membership at UC?

My main account got hacked, twice, and unauthorised orders were done on it. First time the account was 'temporarily suspended', I contacted them to let them know it wasn't me and shortly after I could use it again. Second time around, they kept it shut (which is fair enough but still annoying) and support advisers on the phone advised me to create another account. Which I did and lasted for another few months fine.

A friend later that year gave me a prepaid card as a present, which he showed he could use on his USA Amazon account; mine is a UK one with a UK billing address. I tried it anyway after persuasion, which again, got it suspended. Getting in contact with them was useless and no matter what I tried to cancel the order, my friend didn't have sufficient proof (no billing statements - only physical photos). Again, Amazon wasn't having it and that account got shut.

Again, yet another Amazon account had to be opened (as I need Amazon, they have good items on there and good deals). No matter what I do, I can't open another and I can't use my cards - they always get suspended as they say the same message that ""it's related to another Amazon account that got shut"". The fraud team is a separate designated team (according to Amazon reps, manager confirmed it after calling with much frustration) and always send emails from a noreply email not giving me a darn chance to explain anything.

Their reps or managers can't touch accounts and apparently the Amazon risk team can only do that. What do you advise I do? If I call them up and tell them there's a misunderstanding I feel like I'll get the \*shrug\* response with ""there's nothing I can do"".

Staying logged in somewhere?  \n\nThe best advice I got from my bank after a scammer got my debit card number and tried buying stuff in South Korea (I'm in U.S.) is:  get a credit card through your bank that you only use for Amazon.  It's easier to get help and reimbursement with a credit card than debit card.  And then you can control your purchases through that one account without throwing the number around elsewhere.  Make sure you transfer money to pay it off each billing cycle to stay good with them.

Oneness-	3	115ctfo	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/115ctfo/question_about_returning_an_item_purchased_with/	"   Hello everyone, So I just recently got the the card about a week ago. I  decided right away to make a big purchase with it ($600 worth) and  decided with paying it off monthly instead of 5% cash back.

Anyways, I decided I want to return the product. But I'm confused as to whether I  should refund it back to my original payment method which is the Amazon  Prime Visa Card or should I return it to my amazon account balance.  Will there be negative consequences choosing one over the other?

Also, I used the $100 gift card amazon gives you when applying for the card  to pay for part of the purchase. If I choose to refund it back to the  Amazon Prime Visa Card, where will the $100 go to? Will it add money to  the card or will go back to my Amazon account balance?

I apologize if the questions sound ridiculous, I just want to make sure  what's the best option and I'm also kind of paranoid I will lose money  if I choose one over the other. Thank you in advance to everyone answering my questions."	5	"['mikeinmass: I would be surprised if you get the $100 promo money back.

been a amazon prime member for a good 3-4 years at this point, had zero account or payment issues whatsoever.

i followed the instructions and apparently my account has been suspended/locked for no reason, didnt receive an email regarding this matter either.

i tried using the form, uploaded my bank document with bits covered to ensure i dont run into any issues and even explained to them that the original card used for my account is dead and i had a new card sent out that same week.

now no matter what i send them i get some BS automated reply that either the information i sent wasnt enough or it didnt verify my account ownership, despite it clearly showing the last 4 digits of my bank account number, my billing address, name and multiple amazon/prime membership purchases from last month.

i found an email on another forum but all i got was a automated response that the address does not accept incoming emails, despite people claiming it worked a few months ago.

It got lost in the mail (tracking showed it would be delivered by Amazon).  Got my refund but I couldn’t order it again because it was invite only and even though I never received it, I couldn’t request another invite.  

A few days ago, it became no longer invite only so I ordered it and this time got USPS tracking.  

It was marked delivered yesterday around 1pm but I had no motion alerts and it wasn’t on my porch.  

I checked with neighbors and walked down a few houses to see if any packets were on any porches.  I didn’t see any packages big enough to be a current gen console, plus this day and age, I wouldn’t go snooping anyway.  Even if my package got put on someone’s porch, I wouldn’t take it because to them and their doorbell cameras, it would look like I was stealing and this day and age, I don’t know my neighbors. 

I’m afraid Amazon isn’t going to believe me.  At least the first one stayed in their system and was never marked delivered.  I let USPS know but it was just a claim that takes 72 hours to investigate.  

Any idea what might happen?  I’ve never abused Amazon orders and I’ve had my account since 2006."	3	"[""diezel_dave: Be ready for them to tell you to go file a police report before they'll do anything. That seems to be the case lately."", 'Blackwiz3rd: try jeff@amazon.com if cs wasn’t enough']"

Tried to buy a gift card back in December for my nephew and it was immediately flagged as fraud. No one from Amazon reached out to me to confirm it was me making the purchase. I tried calling and chatting in multiple times and no one could help me. My entire order history disappeared too. They then started charging me for items I had returned before any of this happened. 

Fast forward to now - still can’t see any of my orders or pre-orders. I had to dispute the charges with my CC because Amazon refused to refund me because they couldn’t find the order I was referring to. I could give them the order number because I couldn’t find it since my entire order history, again, is gone. 

After multiple calls to them, each of their incompetent agents told me they canceled all of my outstanding orders. Welp, had an order deliver yesterday. Didn’t get any notifications it was shipped. 

No idea how to get this fixed. Filed a complaint with the BBB and they just keep asking me for order numbers and can’t comprehend the fact I can’t see my order history. I hate Amazon.

The customer service for buying helped me most of the times, so it's not entirely terrible.... yet.\n\nAs for the goods being sold, forget it. It's like eBay and Wish put together. Even for simple generic products that should work totally fine, are often misdescribed or the seller would lie about the materials. So many clothes on Amazon claim to be cotton but when I receive, there's a tag attached that says polyester mix or they all feel like cheap Halloween costumes.

If the user was being an ass then fine, retaliate take no shit, but it was clearly a calm opening and they jumped to being stupid about the response. Simply explaining there is no faster shipping option and that it would ship as soon as the warehouse was able to, would have been fine.

They have such limited routes to contact them and once an issue like a return is marked as closed it feels impossible to address.\n\nThat said - I had the horrendous experience of trying to get a return processed via eBay during the start of COVID and discovered they had absolutely zero ability to call a customer service agent or use online chat at the time - only fill in a short form and wait indefinitely.

I returned a phone back in December to amazon and still have not received a refund. It was returned with UPS pickup as instructed by amazon. UPS picked up my package and left me a receipt. Many weeks pass and I contact amazon numerous times about the status of the return. Every time they give me the same response saying to wait 60 days to see if the return will process. Well tomorrow is the 60th day so I reached out again asking about the return. They told me they received the package but cant locate the item. I'm very confused by this because why would I send them an empty box.

I asked them to provide the tracking details. They did and it shows that the package was delivered. I even told them that it states the weight of the package, proof of delivery, etc. They didn't make any comment about that and just told me to contact the carrier about the problem and abruptly ended the chat with no other solution. If I contacted UPS they would probably just show me the package was delivered.  

 I feel stuck as I have no control of what happens at the amazon return center and If they lost my item or something. What should I do?"	3	['InsertBluescreenHere: call call and keep calling. keep asking to be transferred.\n\nthose tier 1 people are there to make you give up and just kick the can down the road till its too late to do a chargeback. amazon keeps the phone and your money - they win.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbe polite but firm with these morons.']

I've since received them and everything was fine. 

Last night I sat down to purchase tools for a job I have coming up. I was met with a screen requesting that I change my password. I didn't really want to change my password. They do this every other time I log in. So I click the button and I'm redirected to a page where I'm supposed to input a code that they are supposed to email me. 

The email never came. 

So I would spend the next several hours on the phone with customer service and my bank. 

They tell me I'm locked out of my account because of too many attempts to enter my account. 

They ask really nonsensical questions during the security test they administer in order for you to regain access to your account.

One of the security question items was a transaction ID in which case this was when I began having to look into my online banking and talk to my bank. 

The transaction ID is supposed to be a 9 digit alphanumeric code. 

There are no such codes in my online banking and no such codes that my banker can see. 

Another one of their questions is ""name an item in your saved for later"" 

1 I don't use save for later.

2 I don't know how to.

3 whenever I'm interested in something I just add it to my cart and I go back and buy it later.

4 I don't remember everything that I save in my cart.

Yet another stupid security question was

 ""when did you first subscribe to Amazon prime?""

Now considering the first time I had Amazon prime was almost a decade ago and the fact that every time I've had Amazon prime I just ended up with it because of something I bought and I didn't make the decision to get Amazon prime and I'm never emailed about Amazon prime other than the fact that my prime subscription has expired... How in the hell am I supposed to remember this? 

So I eventually gave up and I created a new account. 
I got all the items I needed and put them in my cart and I proceeded to check out and they were on the way, great right? 

Nah, not so fast. 

The transaction gets canceled. Then I'm locked out of that account too. When I try to regain access to the account I met with a screen asking me for a bank statement as part of their verification process. 

I upload the document and then I call customer service and they tell me it's going to be 24 to 48 hours before I can access the account again. 

I wake up this morning to check on all of this and I have an email requesting that I send them a utility bill as part of their verification process. 

1 I travel for a living and do not have utilities. 

2 isn't this a bit much just to buy some tools? 

3 If a bank statement is good enough to verify my new account why wasn't I asked for one when I was having issues with my old account?

4 wtf is going on with these people and this company?"	1	"[""Throwingshead: On your payment method statement the Amazon charge will show up as something like AMZN mktp and then a a bunch of random characters after that in the charge description and that is your transaction ID. I just checked mine and it's there.\n\nWhen Amazon suspends an account they suspend all accounts that are associated with it. This is a fraud protection measure and is necessary for them to prevent what they deem to be bad buyers from just making new accounts and repeating the same things that got the original suspended in the first place.

1676433507.0	14-Feb-2023 19:58:27	My item was marked as “delivered” but isn’t actually here, contacted Amazon and they’re asking for a police report	Jim-Jam07	19	112ovsg	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/112ovsg/my_item_was_marked_as_delivered_but_isnt_actually/	"I came home from work on the 11th having seen my parcel as being marked as being “behind the wheelie bin”. No photo attached though. As I went round the back to get it, I noticed that there wasn’t any obvious parcel, I looked around there and back round the front of my house only to find there was no package. I spoke to my neighbours and my housemates to see if they’d seen anyone delivering from Amazon during the day, to which both parties said they hadn’t even seen a van. 

I attempted to report this to amazon that day, and was told to wait until Tuesday 14th. I waited and came back to report it then, only to be told that there’s nothing to be done and that I must file a police report if I wish to get my money back. 

So I call the non-emergency line (101) and explain to them what’s happened. I’m told in no uncertain terms that a non-received parcel is NOT a police matter and for the amount of the items (1 item) missing (~£50), it’s too small for them to file a report anyway. I explained to Amazon that I don’t even know if it’s stolen so how can I report it as such and am told that until the item is physically in my possession, it remains the property of Amazon and if they believe it’s been stolen then you need to file the report. The police told me it’s more of a civil matter and my best chance would be letting my bank sort this as a dispute.

Until I receive the parcel, it can't be stolen from me, and seeing as I don’t have it, how can it have been stolen from me. Amazon have a sales contract to deliver the items I ordered to me. How is this not their issue to solve?

Any suggestions?"	37	"[""moonbeam127: This is amazon's new game, washing their hands of all liability when in reality they have full liability and responsibility to deliver the goods ordered.  this is AMAZONS problem to solve, not the customers.\n\nAmazon's new game is cutting costs, cutting corners, and stiffing the customers."", ""IndiaEvans: So frustrating!

I cancelled my monthly membership and received the refund for it immediately only for them to charge my bank for a yearly one.. 

Now I never sign up for yearly memberships and I am not illiterate with tech so I know for a fact I didn't randomly sub for a year after cancelling because who would do that. 

&#x200B;

Well I contacted my bank and they were forced to close the card I had on file for amazon because they suspected fraudulent activity. Which ended up being Amazon's fault I just didnt know it yet,

Now I am trying to receive the refund from Amazon and it keeps getting declined from my bank because the card is no longer active

The card that is no longer active because of Amazon. So now Im having to go back and forth with Amazon and my bank to fix an issue that was not even my fault. 

Amazon is now trying to send me a check instead. But i am also being told they cannot send me a check? this is so frustrating."	6	"[""Throwingshead: There can be glitches with any renewal subscription when cancelling and it's happened with others on Amazon before. Mistakes happen and you kind of cancelled your card prematurely which isn't Amazon's fault and really is your bank's fault if they cancelled it before asking you to confirm the charge with Amazon first. Most major cards have a pause function so if that was possible they should have done that before assuming fraud. You basically yanked Amazon's ability to correct the mistake easily."", 'moonbeam127: Can amazon credit that monthly amount to your amazon account like a gift card?  That way the next time you make an amazon purchase those funds are the first to use?', ""Which_Secretary7039: Yeah I didn't ask for the card to be cancelled. When they told me they were obligated to cancel I actually asked her not to do that but she basically was like sorry too late which has now fucked me over completely. All I told her was I didn't authorize that charge because well I didn't and then she automatically assumed that meant fraud. I have first financial bank i'm not sure how major of a bank they are.\n\nTrust I was def not trying to make it more difficult on Amazon's part. When I initially thought I resolved the matter I mentioned to the Amazon support that my card was no longer active and asked if that would be an issue.. he told me no, well now here I am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts entirely annoying the bank is refusing to help me now.\n\nI've now talked to at least 4 different amazon support who have just kept telling me they are going to re send the refund to processing after I've told them hey that card youre sending to is inactive.\n\nI go to my bank and they tell me hey they cant do anything about it.\n\nWhat now? my card is cancelled because my bank assumed fraud and amazon wont do anything but refund to that specific card.\n\nIt's so frustrating I am having to do all this back and forth over a glitch\n\nEdit also: One person told me they could send me a check.. but then the next three people after that acted like they did not know what I was talking about when I tried to mention that as an option... has anyone gotten a refund check from amazon?\n\nI just disputed the charge through my bank but who knows if that will be approved. Im at a genuine loss now and can't even afford to lose that money hence why I cancelled my monthly in the first place"", 'chrlsPbac0n: Honestly, I’m surprised they haven’t tried to do that to me. But personally I don’t want Amazon credit especially for something that happened where they took money from me I never authorized. I haven’t used it since Christmas really and have other important things going on in my life that requires that money they took which was a lot for me ($139)', ""Throwingshead: Yea my whole take with this is again that mistakes happen but I would personally be more pissed off at the bank for cancelling the card that fast. Not sure if they have a freeze/ pause feature but usually anything on Amazon subscription wise is easy to get refunded especially if it's within the first 3 business days of a new subscription so it usually can be fixed fairly fast. \n\nIf you didn't authorize the charge and you told them that I would think that would mean that they are going to file a claim against the charge already since it was deemed unauthorized. I think Amazon may be able to issue a check for some instances but that may ultimately depend on the payment method that was originally used.\n\n If you put yourself in Amazon's shoes now it makes sense why they shouldn't issue checks for this because you paid with a credit card and you can now dispute the charge directly with the bank. So if Amazon mails you a check and then you dispute the charge via chargeback with the bank and get refunded through that they may double refund you if you were to then cash the check after the dispute is closed.\n\nFor this case specifically a chargeback is likely the easiest way to handle this if your bank can get their stuff together because it shouldn't be that difficult, but for Amazon I don't see anything they can really do that makes sense.""]"

I tried it:  Ordered 4 items, they arrived in 2 deliveries, my ""try"" period started when the last order arrived (sunday- ugh) I already knew from the first delivery at least one item was going back, ends up 3 are going back.  I log on Monday night to get the return started, all is fine, of course its 2 separate QR codes but whatever. Something needs to be boxed but not labeled. This is getting slightly annoying and the other 2 items just brought to the UPS store.

Usually for returns I immediately get the QR codes in my email.  Those didnt arrive so I 'chatted' with help, 'help' said to wait 4-5 hrs, uhhuh fine whatever, still no QR codes this am.  I ended up taking screen shots so I can return this damn stuff.

The good: the try period of 7 days starts when your last item arrives.

The bad: the hassle of returning all this in multiple boxes, QR codes and now it seems even getting those QR codes is impossible.  

Will I use it again, probably not.   It's easier to stick with TJMaxx or Target.  This is a frustration level 8thousand I do not need."	5	"['InsertBluescreenHere: lol good ol help ""yea you should wait (leans over looks at clock to see how much time they have before they leave) about 5 hours""', 'Gh0stp3pp3r: I\'ve tried it twice.  \n\nThe first time, the items (all clothes) were suddenly delayed during transport.

There was confusion over what to do next... as I asked if they could just send new items.  On no, they can\'t do that.  My previous Try Before You Buy transaction has to be completed before another can be started.  It took forever to clear out of the system and make sure I wouldn\'t have to pay for the items as they weren\'t ""returned"".\n\nThe first order caused a waiting period for being able to try it again.  I recently attempted a 2nd TBYB order.   Out of 6 items, all were available to ship right away.... until I placed the order, then 3 weren\'t available for at least a month.  This caused issue as (per the idea of the program) I wanted to try them all on and decide which ones to keep.  I couldn\'t get definite info on when they would be shipped beyond about a month.

I persisted and they allowed cancellation of the three items delayed for the month, but I had to accept the other three.

Lost_Piccolo_2102	0	112ct6p	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/112ct6p/japanese_account_locked_for_suspicious_activity/	"I wanted to buy some Japanese exclusive Kindle ebooks that are not sold in my region, and the only way was to create an [amazon.co.jp](https://amazon.co.jp) account and fill in the billing info with a random Japanese address and phone number. There doesn't seem to be any other way to buy from Amazon Japan and this is the commonly used method everywhere I ask.

I made some purchases with my credit card and everything was fine, since it was only digital books for Kindle. and the actual physical address didn't matter whatsoever. But around 15 hours later, I wanted to buy another ebook and immediately got logged out. When I logged back in, I couldn't do anything or even access the stuff I already owned. There is a ""suspicious activity"" warning demanding me to put in the fake Japanese address, the phone number and the bank receipts to confirm it's me and not someone else stealing my account and going on a shopping spree.

Is there any way to resolve this with just the bank receipts, or will Amazon actually try to send me a code to the made up number or something, making it impossible to recover the account?

I don't understand what exactly caused it. It wasn't a big amount of money, so maybe it was the amount of individual purchases? They were little 200 yen books, three in a row at the beginning and then a fourth 15 hours later. That one didn't go through and immediately triggered the ""suspicious activity"" thing.

Is there a definitive way to avoid this in the future, in case I have to make another account from scratch? It sucks that I have to fake an address and number in order to buy region locked digital books at all, but once a warning like that is triggered for whatever reason, I lose access to everything because all the contact details are made up by necessity.

In short, does anyone know how to keep this ""suspicious activity"" thing from EVER triggering? Maybe waiting a day or two between purchases? Is that a guarantee?

I am so pissed and stressed dealing with this for a few days now, I have been on multiple chats and phone calls, and escalated to their executive customers relations team multiple times for days, and every single time, they say, the original item was not received and no refund will be issued, and this is final and completely refuses to do anything about it and and won't refund me 595, for a product I already returned..

I dropped off the package at UPS on feb1st, the package was weighted and scanned with the item inside, so it had a accurate weight at drop off. I have my receipt for this, I requested amazon to send me photos or videos of what they received, and to check the weight of package vs what i dropped it off at, they refuse, and probably do not have anything like this to provide regardless. But they continue to say I did not return the item when I infact did, I have been a Prime member for over 10 years, and have 100s probably 1000s of orders, and this is the first return this has ever happened with. 

So it seems amazon refuses to do anything, they will not look into this issue, I went back to UPS and talked to the store i dropped the package off at, they said I cannot do anything from my side since this was an Amazon label, and Amazon has to be the one to try and make a claim on the missing product, which apparently amazon doesn't even care to do since this was never an option i even mentioned this to them and they really didn't care, from what i read online my only option is to credit card charge back, which I contacted them and they were very confident that I would be getting my money back with the proof i provided, but then from that comes the possibility of getting my account banned, I have a primary family account which is used by many family members, we have our movies, our music, or photos, books, everything that we payed for saved on our accounts, So i am terrified of getting a ban from what I read online, we use these accounts for personal and business ,so that would suck really bad to lose all this stuff. 

If anyone has any insight, information, and advice how to go at this, please let me know, I have been so stressed and upset with having to deal with this, since it was completely out of my control, whatever happened to my package happened between UPS and Amazon, but im being blamed and theres not much I can do about it from what it looks like."	10	"['Electronic-Fix2851: You’re getting scammed.

Basically there is not much you can do at this point but plead with them and create potential doubt in the original item they sent. 99% of this specific type of issue occurs because the item they sent to you was a previous return where the buyer switched out the original unit with another item or identical unit with a different serial code and then ships it back to Amazon resealed so they think it is still good to sell new again since it was seemingly unopened. The best way to fight this would have been to treat it like it had a problem once it arrived and record every product identifier for the unit you actually received so that if something like this comes up you would have some level of proof to support your claim with Amazon."", 'TheAlmightySkeletor: If you’re worried about that start a BBB claim even after processing my refund my account is in good standing condition.

My card is a black card that saids Prime on the upper right.  But I only get 3% (not 5%) back for Amazon purchases.  And the card details for this Chase Visa signature card saids no annual fees.

The non-Prime amazon visa credit card gets 3% back.  The prime one gets 5% back.  But my card saids prime on it.  But I also signed up a long time ago.  So, what's the deal?  I let my prime account lapse last month."	0	[]

When delivery was made I only got one package and later on the other one showed up as scheduled for delivery today (Saturday) by 10pm, only now it was bundled with yet another order I placed on 2/1 that I knew was extended delivery.

So all day today the package shows Out For Delivery by 10pm with both items.  It never appeared on the map so I doubt I’m getting it (It’s currently after 9pm).

P_Cakes_84	1	10zh1rj	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10zh1rj/if_im_ordering_an_item_around_230am_and_i_have/	"I already completed the order and went with ""Today"" to be safe. My friend and I were thinking that ""Overnight"" might not be as soon as the two times listed under ""Today"".

On the one hand, Overnight times are listed below Today's times and we wonder if it would look any different with us reviewing the order later in the day. I just checked again now and it said the order had to be completed in under 3 hours (by 6am) to get the ""fastest same-day delivery of 2-6pm"". Also, the overnight delivery times are the same price as today's afternoon/evening times. All of that makes me think that choosing overnight 4-8am means delivery of 25-29hrs from now instead of 1-5 hours from now.

On the other hand, it should list tomorrow's date for Overnight if it were not those times of the same day as the order. I looked into this a bit and saw that Amazon does sometimes deliver packages within a few hours. I am in a major city, so it is plausible. I included pics below (ignore the blue highlight over 7-11am).

The last thing I bought on amazon prime was an HDMI splitter on november 18th.  Around this time I also got afflicted with a Flu that lasted until late December. After that, I had a car crash. I wasn't paying much attention to what was happening as I paused my prime account, and saw no reason to check my statements; and being exhausted mentally from consecutive events.

BOY, WAS I WRONG. Somehow, despite even my amazon account page showing no prime charges since July 5th, I was charged:XX#### PURCHASE 11/09 01:55 Amazon Prime\* HB8 Amzn.com/bill WA 00000000 072207. And similar statements each month on the 9th. I finally realized this today when I went to buy something for 40 bucks, thinking I had more than 40 in my bank account, only for it to keep denying me. I look in my account and oh look, 16.08 from an amazon prime purchase yesterday. I haven't even opened the amazon web page to shop since november 18th. How. HOW?  


  
UPDATE for those who ever have this issue and are trying some google fu for a solution in the future: Get ahold of the customer support on the website and open a chat. After some prompts and such, you can chat with a real person. Have them check what accounts are linked to the card, because somehow my father's account was linked to this card. He was having some issues from a really bad diabetes scare in november, and it seems very possible my card was used on accident. Unfortunately, since this means it was a legit purchase, I won't get the money back from Amazon itself, but at least I know what happened, now. tldr; customer support call for seeing what accounts are linked to the card.

Issue resolved.

Overall I buy a ton of stuff from Amazon every week. So every week I make 1-2 returns of small things. Usually under 50$ for couple hundred bucks worth of order. 

This morning I got an email for an item I returned, stating the serial number was wrong. It was in same condition I received. Same item, open box. Working and no cosmetic damages. Reason for returning was because it was Incompatible with my laptop. It’s a 400-500$ item. I replied to the email to appeal because the email said I could. The account specialist gave me a generic reply saying incorrect item was sent. Send in the item for refund. And decision is final that I will not be getting anymore replies. I paid with Amazon gift card too so I couldn’t exactly contact bank. 

I tried Amazon customer service, they couldn’t do anything and got escalated to the manager who basically told me to reply to the email that I was told will not be getting anymore response. The guy typed so fast and left chat. I couldn’t even read the whole message. Very unhappy with the experience. Was also told the item I sent will be disposed when I asked for it back if refund couldn’t be issued. 

What the world is going on? I know economy is bad lately but this is ridiculous. The email I got also said that I tried to return incorrect items repeatedly. This was the first time I heard of this. All my other returns went through no problem. Also after talking to account specialist I got email from customer service saying “sorry you didn’t receive your item”… to file police report and stuff. I never said I never received the item. Issue was not that I didn’t receive my item. It’s that they wouldn’t accept my return or give me back the item and holding my money hostage

Should I go to small claim court? How do I proceed with this? I’m pretty much ready to close my account after using Amazon for many years. This is pretty unacceptable

Update:

It’s been a month so just giving you guys an update on the situation. I gave up on the 400-500$ item that I lost through gift card purchase / return. Was planning to use my recently renewed Amazon prime membership for music and videos but few days after the incident I started to receive email reminders to return items that I already returned over 2 months ago (got return confirmation email of item received and refunded). I went to customer service and was told item received and come back if I do get charged. So I went back the following week after being falsely charged. 20$ item. Just extra from a multiple unit purchase of Christmas gifts. Very small things. I got accused of sending back an empty box. Same thing. No one wants to helps, tells me to return item for refund and ends conversation. In rage I immediately permanently deleted my account. I called bank to dispute and provided evidence. The bank gave me credit back on card immediately and a week later I see on my statement, Amazon provided a refund for it too. Now I got double the amount of 20$. I kind want to call bank to figure out but at the same time I didn’t want bank and Amazon both to uncorrelately reverse that refund. Long story short. Still at loss of the 400-500$ item. I’m going to consider the extra 20$ a small recover of my recently renewed membership and will not be using Amazon anytime soon. If no further progress I’m going to consider this situation finalized and move on with my life."	41	"['fiestybox246: Something similar happened to me, but it was just a pair of $30 scrub pants.

RecognitionEvening98	2	10yq0m4	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10yq0m4/supervisor_hung_up_on_me_what_do_i_do/	"This is one of the first times I've chased an issue to this extent. An item advertised as a prime item, a £90-ish pair of Sony headphones, which I ordered on the 3rd of January. The estimated delivery time I got was 17th of Jan - 14th of Feb, given the fact it's Friday the 10th and the item hasn't even been dispatched, I think it's unlikely I will recieve them by Tuesday. 

What irks me is that Amazon has readvertised the item with a far sooner estimated delivery date. I will have wasted nearly a month and half waiting for an item I pretty much use everyday. Since Amazon is the one who advertises items as 'Prime' and NOT the manufacturer (Sony), this seems to be an issue on their end. Upon ringing, being transferred 3 times (first 2 colleagues were fine) the supervisor told me that there was nothing I could do but wait, before I could ask whether it would be best to do this or cancel and replace the order, she spoke over me 'I'm going to hang up' and then cut me of practically mid sentence. I was naturally annoyed at the fact I've been waiting this long for my item to arrive, but I was in no way rude. Would never raise my voice or swear or anything like that as I've worked in customer services myself and know what it's like to deal with the dreaded 'Karens'. 

Additionally, she told me that there was no email associated with my account, but that I would be sent a feedback form. Hilarious.

TLDR: I asked questions about the status of my order, was told that the people who should know had no idea, talked over, and hung up on. I hate complaining, but should I call another department? Is there even another department who deals with this thing? I just want my 'prime' Sony headphones I order nearly a month and a half ago..."	8	"[""IndiaEvans: That's absurd.

You order it, you have it in two days.\n\nAnd finally, this here when you follow the link that says ""Learn more about all the Prime shipping options:\n\n>*If the item you\'re ordering is out of stock or unavailable to ship immediately, the shipping method time starts when the item ships. For example, it will take two business days after an item ships to reach you with Two-Day Shipping.*\n\nThat is saying that you can expect your delivery two days from the time you place the order, unless it\'s out of stock or unavailable to ship immediately. It\'s literally an If/Then statement.  \n""If the item is not in stock or can\'t ship immediately, then it\'s 2 days from the time it ships.""\n\nI\'ve even had someone try to tell me ""See, it says \'For example, it will take two business days after an item ships to reach you with Two-Day Shipping.\' so that means that applied to everything!"" disregarding the basic If/Then element that is literally saying that everything ships same day with 2 day shipping unless it\'s out of stock or for some reason can\'t ship same day.\n\nWe were specifically told and sold the deal in the agreements that Two Day Shipping actually meant two days from the time you placed your order. This only didn\'t apply if the item was out of stock (as marked on the item page) or was unavailable to ship immediately (also was on the item page). Otherwise, it\'s very clearly stating that the two day shipping starts immediately.\n\nThey may have changed terms since then, but for god knows how many people, they literally sold it to us as 2 day shipping from the time you placed your order.\n\nAnd frankly I have looked through all of my emails and haven\'t once seen an email from Amazon telling me they were making a change to the Two Day Shipping benefit to remove that very valuable sales point that sold it to me and god knows how many others who joined Prime for it. But they\'ve certainly made me pay more for it with membership fee increases, haven\'t they? And they sure email when other aspects of Prime are changing, don\'t they?\n\nAnd again, I\'ve had some argue ""You agree to the new terms regardless when you renew your subscription.""\n\nBut my subscription renews automatically. If they don\'t advise us of changes, how do we even know to cancel our subscription? Automatically renewing something with no notification of changes that affect the perceived value does not mean we agreed to the changes that we knew nothing about. Is it even legal to completely change terms of a membership without some notification, and then saying ""Well, your automatic renewal went through so you\'ve agreed to the new terms that you knew nothing about.""', ""poodlefriend: I'm doing the same when mine is done in August."", 'Late_Hand_5754: I had some undeliverable stuff back during Christmas and they refunded me like wtf I wanted my stuff.

It's always been the least of the video services. I hardly ever use it despite heavily using other ones. I've never found much there that I wanted to watch.

With shipping involved there is some unknown potential for things to go wrong in shipping but to prove it was sent faulty you would need to build evidence of that. \n\nThere are details that would be needed to understand things further but as its stated the return reasoning would play a big part in the claim eligibility and Amazon does protect you if you returned the item with the correct claim status and they side with you. If you feel you should have received a full refund you can file an a to z for the rest of the refund amount. Whether or not that is awarded it up to the investigator. Sellers can't pull this often and there is no real point to do that intentionally. Sellers will usually only charge a restocking fee if the return is out of policy or they are very sure the item sent back was not in the condition they sent it in because there are significant risks involved that would easily outweigh an $85 restocking fee. \n\nYou should be able to contact Amazon or start an A to Z claim for the remaining refund you feel is necessary but with that claim nothing is 100% guaranteed."", ""IndiaEvans: Document everything.

That means they saw the item as it was, and shipped it anyway. If it looked damaged to them and used at the time, idk why they sent it.\n\nCondition can be subjective. What the manufacturer considers as ""new"" is usually not what a customer would consider ""new"". It could be a blatant overlooking by the seller but new products purchased from a manufacturer don\'t always arrive in perfect condition since shipping tends to be a rough environment for products. Obviously there is a limit to how damaged something can be but maintaining a pristine condition for an item when shipping is involved is not always easy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So either they’re lying about inspecting it, or someone opened the shipped package and fiddles with it. Doubt the latter, so leaves the former.\n\nMost of Amazon is a volume game so inspecting items is usually very fast so things can be missed, and mistakes happen. If the seller is actually charging a restocking fee and sticking to their belief then there is a decent chance that they truly believed the item was sent in the correct condition. Restocking fees usually carry a lot of risk for a seller to impose so most won\'t do it unless they feel they are absolutely in the right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As far as plastic goes, all of the manga box sets ive ever received from stores or amazon have had plastic wrap around the box to prevent anyone opening them and reading the manga or taking them. This was the first time I’ve received a manga set in this bad condition.\n\nAnything purchased that is fulfilled by Amazon will likely have some sort of protection to keep the item together since everything must be ""warehouse ready"" so plastic wrap whether done by a seller or coming that way from the factory would likely be present for those orders because of that requirement. Items coming direct from another source may not because that additional requirement is not necessary since it\'s not going to a busy warehouse. Condition of the item is one thing but the lack of plastic still wouldn\'t necessarily point to condition depreciation. Imported items have a much higher chance of being received without any plastic because of the shipping process if the manufacturer even sealed it with such.', 'LearnDifferenceBot: Bye ImpossibleMagician87. Have fun continuing to use common words incorrectly!', 'BlondeT3m: I received it damaged with no protective plastic seal, so in this case the seller is wrong to feel “wronged”.

And you say it carries a significant risk to charge a fee, but again I checked some of their reviews and it seems they’ve gotten away with what they did to me, but with others. \n\nAnd again, you say plastic wrap not being there doesn’t necessarily denote a depreciation in condition, yet here the seller clearly considers it as one and charges me a fee for it. All these defenses for the seller, are what the seller is using to attack me as the one in the wrong. If they can use these variables to accuse me, then I am right to accuse them with it then: I recevied a damaged box that was torn, and opened—no plastic wrap that is virtually on manga box sets, and has at least been on all the box sets I have purchased since my collection began 7 years ago.\n\nSo far your entire rhetoric seems to be in apologetics for the seller, and hasn’t really been helpful.', 'BlondeT3m: They literally said that “the seal being broken” was part of the reason they charged me a fee.

I did everything by the book, and they are not. I wanted a solution, not an argument.', 'Throwingshead: >I received it damaged with no protective plastic seal\n\nAgain, the plastic seal may not be deemed as part of the product so it is potentially not relevant for the actual condition of the item.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I checked this seller’s reviews before too and there have been similar reviews that described my situation. Wish I would have saw that before hand. Amazon still hasn’t done jack shit about this seller it seems.\n\nFeedback has to be taken with a grain of salt. Most negatives are usually inaccurate or beyond a sellers control. If the seller is still around they likely had some proof of what they believed the item condition was in. Maintaining an Amazon selling account is not easy especially if you are a consistently poor seller. Amazon is very strict compared to any other marketplace platform.', ""Throwingshead: >The condition here isn’t subjective between me and the seller.

I’m working off the app, I’m logged in, I clicked the print label-redirects me to web to log in. Do not want to do that. 

I click “email copy of label and instructions” > “send copy of email” *enter my email* > click ”send email”. I received the email, and it’s not a copy of the label for me to print, it’s another link that redirects me to Amazon app, which starts the whole cycle over again. Just why. 

Yes I know I can give in and log into the mobile web browser version and attempt from there, but it’s just so ridiculous that I’m mad at this point. 

I can’t print from the app? I can’t email a copy of it? The ONLY option is to log in on a browser and print from there?? 

Sorry for 1/3 of this being a rant but has anyone else encountered this or is there some secret I’m missing to get an actual copy of the label sent to me?

Arouthor	4	10vfq51	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10vfq51/undeliverable_is_now_deliverable_but_i_reordered/	The title kind of says it. Earlier in the week Amazon flagged my package as undeliverable and I read I would get a refund in 3-5 days or so. I went to the companies direct website and just ordered the product through them. I just got a notification that the undeliverable package is out for delivery and it’s status is still undeliverable. I also read closer and saw the refund only applies after the order is returned. Is there any chance I can get refunded so I didn’t just buy 2 of these? It’s perishable so I’m not sure if anyone would even want it returned. Sounds like Amazon support is a bit of a pain to work with. Anyone else experience anything like this?	2	['Famous-Perspective-3: If it is perishable, you need to check to see if it is even returnable.  If not, you can always refuse shipment.', 'Arouthor: Ok in case you’re someone who likes closure here’s the somewhat thrilling conclusion to this saga. I got home and the package was outside my door and addressed to me. I messaged Amazon and explained the situation and they issued a refund with no return necessary. Sweet right. I bring the package inside and and open it expecting it to be damaged in some way. But, instead of the perishable item I ordered I found a 2 pack of electric drills. Go figure. Anyway that’s the strange conclusion to this story. I got a refund and some random drills because something mystical happens to my original order.']

You have to ask for them to ship the product in Amazon packaging, or they'll ship it in the original package.

I wouldn’t be overly concerned if it wasn’t  after midnight where I am. I tried to use the call me now function to contact the driver but it didn’t seem to work.

I ordered some decor for my home and it was delivered to the wrong house. Amazon refunded me and I placed the order again and included very specific instructions to get to my house. Some of the packages were again misdelivered even though Amazon told me the issue had been fixed. I was confused because of the fact some have made it just fine while others are not. 

I went to the house they were delivered to (which is 2 miles from my house) and asked if they had them. They claimed they never did, though I don’t really believe that. Anyway, I contacted Amazon today told them I have photos of the packages at the wrong house and that the pin showing my location is wrong even though the address is right. They said no refund or replacement would be given because their tracking shows it went to the correct location. I said that must be because the pin is wrong, but he told me it is right. I asked about my packages I still have on the way and about moving the pin to the correct location and he said “the tracking pin is correct. Goodbye” and disconnected the chat. 

I’m just kinda shocked and don’t know what to do next.

After thinking about it for a while, I realized there is little I actually get out of the service. 

Plus, there has been quite a few changes recently:

* Prime cost increase
* Removal of Amazon smile
* No free shipping on grocery orders
* Two day shipping is gone, and now everybody gets the same shipping on orders over $35 (unsure about same day, but doesn't matter much)

Looking at the other features, idk if it is worth:

* Prime gaming is meh and useless if you aren't a gamer
* Prime music is awful. Amazon music unlimited is okay at best as it is
* Whole foods discount doesn't even apply to all items, and how many of us shop at whole foods?
* Amazon is flooded with cheap aliexpress items. It is hard to even sort through most products to find something quality.
* With everything so expensive nowadays, hitting $35 for free two day shipping really isn't too hard, eliminating a lot of the need for the free shipping benefit

Any help?	machu_peechute	1	10qyufd	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10qyufd/amazon_wont_replace_600_bladeless_fan_i_bought_on/	"Hoping I could get some help here, as I spoke all the way up to a ""supervisor"" last night and they only said they couldn't offer a replacement, with no explanation. Just that the system would only allow returns. I bought an LG Aerofan air purifier that came in last night. It was shipped via UPS through Amazon. I opened the box before noticing the damage on the side. As I set up the fan, I noticed a dent on the lower back of the fan. Looked at the box and the damage lines up. Plugged the fan in and everything works except the rotation motor; just clicks and rocks like it's missing teeth in the gear. And the contamination sensor is all over the place, and resets itself to 999 everytime it gets to moderate, kicking the fan into overdrive. I bought the fan on sale for $300, and now it's back up to the $5-600 range five days later. Not sure why i get hassled on a $30 knife magnet or a $600 fan everytime something is wrong, but people are always talking about Amazon telling them to keep $1500 graphics cards. To be clear, I'm not looking for a freebie. I'll gladly return the old one, but I really want the fan, and I don't want to refund it just to turn around and spend an extra $300 for a replacement. And the only return option is UPS pickup at home, when I'm not there. I'm going to try chat or calling today during normal business hours to see if I can make anymore progress. But any extra tips or help would be appreciated.


UPDATE: Thanks for all the suggestions!  I spoke with their CS through chat during normal hours. They said they couldn't replace as the sale ended, but they're letting me keep the old one and credited sale price to my credit card to use as a discount towards a full-priced replacement. Now to find a place in Colorado that can repair LG fans so the bad motor isn't a fire hazard."	8	"[""Throwingshead: If the sale has ended they can't send another at that price.

On 1/20/2023 I decided to open a chargeback against eGift card $100 to save part of hold founds

Today 2/1/2023 received email:

So two questions:   
How they removed access to my account 4 days before I decide to open a chargeback?  
They say ""*Once payment is made to Amazon, you will be able to access your account again.""* is it bullshit and just want me to close the chargeback/pay for it and nobody unlock my account, right?"	4	"[""cheezerman: Chargebacks are for fraud, not because you're impatient.

Amazon has the great ""feature"" of only allowing me a ""UPS pickup"" option instead of bringing it to a UPS store or UPS drop off point. 

How exactly is this supposed to make things easier for the customer? You have to worry about when the driver will show up (which they never do most of the time and you'll randomly find the return label in your mailbox or left at the conceirge, and no one tells you, or the UPS driver doesn't even leave the label so you have to spend a whole second day trying to coordinate and worry about when the guys is going to show up.

I told them how crazy it was, but they insisted. \n\nSo took screenshots of all the conversations (in case it got stolen and I needed to do a cc chargeback) and put the box out there.

Ups never comes in time here either — took 2 days and an irate call for them to finally show up at 730 in the evening. \nAmazon support told me they think it might be because of the value of the items…both were around $100.

1675194481.0	31-Jan-2023 11:48:01	Amazon Keeps Getting More and More Bizarre (Were They Hacked?)	CJ_Southworth	0	10q8iod	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10q8iod/amazon_keeps_getting_more_and_more_bizarre_were/	"Over the weekend, I came across a deal on season 3 of Titans that I couldn't pass up ($14, free shipping, new).  I ordered immediately.  Later on, since I was on the app already and, even though I am trying very hard to kick my Amazon habit, I noticed that a number of items on my wishlist were also showing dramatically reduced prices (also $14, free shipping). I thought it might be some sort of flash sale or something, so I added some of the items to my cart.  When I went to the cart to check out, some of the items were missing.  I re-added them, and they disappeared again.  Finally, I gave up and just emptied the cart.

Cut to today, and I have one email telling me that Season 3 of Titans has shipped, but there is no tracking number.  A few hours later, I have another email saying the order has been cancelled and refunded with no reasoning.  But in my account, it still shows it as having shipped.  

Were they hacked by someone who changed prices?  Was there an error in the system that they aren't acknowledging?  I have no idea if the blu ray set is going to show up or not, but if the company was hacked, that should be something customers are made aware of, yes?  At the very least, I'd like something in the way of an explanation as to why the order was cancelled if it was cancelled.  

Honestly, it's becoming difficult to even shop on there anymore.  Many of the items I search for (I mostly order physical movies and music) only come up with weird search terms.  For instance, when I was looking for The Menu, it wouldn't come up no matter what I typed in.  I finally accessed the listing by going through a review site that linked to it, and it turned out it only came up on a search if you typed ""The Menu Feature Film.""  It's like the company has gone from a well-oiled-if-sometimes-annoying machine to something that functions like it was being run out of a garage by two high school dropouts."	5	"['BodybuilderMean828: i have heard that [WatchIt](https://watchit.video/) is good and that they pay attention to safety just take a look', ""Throwingshead: This is not a hack it's more than likely a bug.

What’s going on?	chrixar	1	10q2qsi	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10q2qsi/after_a_week_of_no_updates_amazon_says_ups/	"I ordered a camera on Amazon last Monday, and made sure it was being shipped and sold by Amazon. At the time the prime delivery was Thursday. Thursday came and went and there was never any update and the item never shipped. I messaged Amazon and they said to wait 48hrs. On Saturday I message them again after no updates, but this time they said it would be shipping next day air via UPS with a delivery of Tuesday (today). Tracking updates on Sunday with UPS that a label was made, and Amazon’s tracking says “package picked up by carrier.” The shipping address on UPS is a fulfillment center 10 miles from my house, but it still says next day air.

Now it’s Tuesday, and nothing has updated since then. When I talked to Amazon they said it was picked up Sunday, but when I talk to UPS they said they’re still waiting for it and to open an investigation. I’m now stuck in limbo until Friday, which is when Amazon says they can look into it again.

It happens everyday. UPS is very strict with that service level specifically and if a driver accidentally puts that package in with normal ground packages it can get mixed up very easily since all air service is usually handled separately within the UPS center it arrives at. Prime is telling you they scanned and released this to the carrier but the carrier may have misplaced this and not scanned it in their system properly but all of that is pretty much in front of you and you have no liability concern right now other than a delay so it is not a Prime specific thing since this could happen again to any company when a package gets fumbled.', 'chrixar: Thanks for the info!

Supawoo	30	10q0l28	amazonprime	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/10q0l28/has_amazon_prime_customer_service_become/	"I feel like amazon CS has progressively become less coherent lately. Two examples of recent interactions:

My account had been hacked, and the hackers requested a gift card balance refund on an order, totalling around $200. When I secured my account, I chatted AND called them, explaining that I was hacked and don't need the $200 gift card balance. Their response was ""Yes, the refund was issued already"". Me: ""again, I was hacked, order is fine, I don't actually need the refund"", CS: ""The full refund was issued and is reflected in your gift card balance"", Me: ""I understand, BUT I DONT NEED IT, I WAS HACKED, IM TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE MONEY BACK"". They eventually removed $150 of the balance, but left me with $50 in gift card balance for some reason, saying there's nothing they could do about the remaining $50. Fine. Lol.

This week, I had three orders delayed in shipping on Amazon's end. I let them know that USPS had not received the package, even after the guaranteed delivery dates. Their reply: "" I understand, we always give the carrier a chance to deliver it to you"", me frustratedly: ""again it's not the carrier, they have not received the packed from Amazon. Should I just charge back the purchase on my card and keep the items if they actually arrived since delivery date is showing as unknown?"", CS: ""Yes, that is correct"", me: ""So you're saying it's alright with you if I charge back the amounts from these three orders (gives me my money back) and just keep the packages?"", CS: ""Yes, I assured you we will take care of this. And regarding the money, you won't get charged for it.""

Ooooookay, your losses Amazon, lol.

Iam a amazon.es user and buyer since 2018. Do orders all the time no issues at all.

2 weeks ago I bought a CPU to gift my brother. He is building a new computer, and got him the Ryzen 5800 3d.  In the same order I had a makeup kit ( for kids) and was all sent together.

Received the order, and it was all fine, the package was a teared, we could see the inside. Opened it and had the CPU and the makeup kit. We can check the cpu from the outside, the seal was not broken but the CPU inside said 3700 not 5800. I opened Amazon and informed it was the wrong item, they scheduled the pickup and was All good. They received the order and didn't sent me a new one neither the refund. Later I got and email saying the item was different from the one they sent... Yeah the item really was different also from the one I bought. 
Now they refuse to communicate with me, and say I need to return the right item. What Iam supposed to do ? 
I returned what I got... Iam really mad about this, it was 300€ and right now I have nothing.


I found on Reddit that this is not the first time happening this kind of stuff. 

What can I do ?

It's not only on Google I've used a firestick gen 1 and gen 3 but the app is horrible to use on all devices. It has a slow start up time (not a big deal), fast forward and replay take ages. It does not save the last seen episode, everytime I click on the resume button it randomly starts playing some old episode that I've already finished. This is just the start of my problems with his app. Amazon as of today is a trillion dollar business but the damn streaming app is still rubbish.	2	"[""diezel_dave: Yes it does suck.

I haven’t bought anything above $200 that I’ve had to return so I don’t know how long that’ll take.

I attempted to order 2 items, one arriving Tuesday with 2 day Prime shipping, and one arriving Friday. Upon checkout Amazon forced the shipping date to Friday with NO other options presented like they would usually do to allow both items to arrive separately. I had to work around this by placing two separate orders. 

The next day, my wife attempted to purchase an item via Buy It Now, the estimate showed Tuesday on the page, but it was forced to Wednesday when using the Buy It Now option. She had to actually add it to the cart, and manually change the date back to Tuesday for delivery. 

Unfortunately, it seems Amazon continues to make it more and more difficult for us to get the service we're advertised.

Lately when we do it we’ll get a message saying “how to watch” and I have to get on my phone, start the movie and broadcast to our tv. Once I try to do so I get a message that says it won’t play because we have too many streams of said movie when in fact we have none. 

My first question is why do I need my phone to broadcast a show to my tv

My second question is why does it say I have too many streams if the show when every other device in our home of two people is offline?"	3	"[""glbltvlr: How old is your TV?

Iam a amazon.es user and buyer since 2018. Do orders all the time no issues at all.

2 weeks ago I bought a CPU to gift my brother. He is building a new computer, and got him the Ryzen 5800 3d.  In the same order I had a makeup kit ( for kids) and was all sent together.

Received the order, and it was all fine, the package was a teared, we could see the inside. Opened it and had the CPU and the makeup kit. We can check the cpu from the outside, the seal was not broken but the CPU inside said 3700 not 5800. I opened Amazon and informed it was the wrong item, they scheduled the pickup and was All good. They received the order and didn't sent me a new one neither the refund. Later I got and email saying the item was different from the one they sent... Yeah the item really was different also from the one I bought. 
Now they refuse to communicate with me, and say I need to return the right item. What Iam supposed to do ? 
I returned what I got... Iam really mad about this, it was 300€ and right now I have nothing.


I found on Reddit that this is not the first time happening this kind of stuff. 

What can I do ?

I remember last time HBO licensed some of their series it was the last time those deals were being done because HBO Max was already on the horizon.

Do you think that the contract is black and white, that there is no negotiation there?  Amazon market cap is 1.025 trillon, HBO is 151 million and hbo max struggles to get a foothold in a crowded market.  Amazon fire has a 25% share of the streaming market, and is setup to very conveniently allow access to third party streaming system.  Point is that if Amazon doesnt list your streaming service, you won't have a streaming service for very much longer.   \n\nThis gives Amazon the power to dictate the terms of any contract they sign with any streaming service.  Therefore, if they wanted to, Amazon could have demanded a provision in the HBO contract that properties that existed on Amazon at the time a Prime member signed on would be retained for that prime customer.  It wouldn't be a difficult thing to code up either.   \n\nIt would have demonstrated loyalty to their early adopting Prime user base, esp given that one of the biggest selling points in early Prime was access to HBO shows.   \n\nNow I am not saying that they are required to show loyalty to longtime users or even considered a provision like this.  My OP, really, if you break it down, was the fact that companies rarely ever honor their most loyal and long time users.  New phone contracts get free stuff.  New bank accounts get the new toaster.   \n\nNow, economically it may not make sense to show love to your long time customers.  Amazon sure doesn't give a \\*\\*\\*\\*, is my point and it sucks that companies rarely ever give any thought to those sorts of intangibles."", 'BurrStreetX: LOL', 'philliphatchii: Amazon is a big company for sure. Does a streaming service live or die by being featured on it? Probably not. Is Amazon’s Fire devices reach bigger than Apples with billions of devices activated and Apple customers historically and still spend more money than Android customers? And if you go to Android then we can start with Samsung and work our way down for customer reach. On the streaming side as far as impact on other streaming platforms success I wouldn’t say Amazon is the most important. They certainly are in the upper echelon for what companies have the most total value though. \n\nAs far as HBO and or HBO Max not burning up the charts as far as customer base. At this point it’s a much bigger picture. Initially you would be looking at Warner Brothers as a whole as they owned them both. And now with the merger you’re looking at Discovery. At one point Discovery was considering folding HBO Max into its Discovery+ service, as bonkers as that sounds. \n\nAt this point just about any company that has its own streaming service will be bringing content they own to it to add value. If they haven’t already then certainly once existing deals come to an end. Logically it just wouldn’t make sense to keep renting your titles to a competing service cause you’re shooting yourself in the foot. \n\nI agree it would be great if a service kept titles they had when you signed up. Cause it’s a pain in the ass having to subscribe to so many streaming services to be able to have access to everything you might want to consume. Apple with select movies does a rotation now. With the Apple TV+ subscription. Something that started in the last few months but generally there is now 5-10 movies that they don’t own that are included with the service for a limited time.']"
