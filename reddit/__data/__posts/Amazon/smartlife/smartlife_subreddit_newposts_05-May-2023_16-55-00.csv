I have a Tuya-enabled wifi lightbulb. I also have a wireless scene switcher, which basically enables me to execute any tap-to-run scenarios with a press of a button.

I was hoping to use it as a toggle for the lightbulb. The lightbulb doesn't actually provide a toggle command, just ""turn on"" and ""turn off"". A simple ""On press if LIGHTBULB is OFF then SET TO ON else SET TO OFF"" would be the entirety of the ""scene"", which is so simple it really shouldn't be a problem - but I just don't see how to do this? I figured out a way to more-or-less hack around it like so (the bulb is to be at 100% brightness normally):

1. Tap-to-run: Turn bulb on, wait 2s, decrease brightness to 99%, wait 2s, increase brightness to 100%
2. When bulb hits 99% brightness: turn bulb off
3. When bulb is turned on: disable the 99% automation
4. When bulb hits 100% brightness: enable the 99% automation

If the bulb is already on when starting #1, #3 won't be triggered (as it's a state change detection thing) and so #2 will turn the bulb off at 99%. If the bulb is off when starting #1, #3 will trigger and so will prevent #2 from turning it off when it gets to this stage while #4 will rearm it after.

This ""works"" (it would work better if the pipeline of communication wasn't tied to the actual brightness of this bulb, but oh well), but surely there's got to be a better way. Does anyone have any ideas?"	5	['Quacking_Plums: There’s a really odd way of setting up toggles in Tuya/Smartlife — I don’t know if it’s a bug but I’ve posted about it before. \n\nIf you setup your scene switch initially to just turn on (or off, doesn’t matter) your Wi-Fi bulb on single press, save, then go back into the configuration you will see a third option labelled on/off.

The problem is that having lights go on and off at fixed times and durations potentially gives away that they're automated, which could defeat the purpose.

It would be nice if the 'Delay' control had a box you could check for 'Random', and then let you set a minimum and maximum duration, rather than a constant fixed duration. Then you could set lights to switch on, remain on for anything from a few minutes to a few hours, and then switch off.

Is there a possibility to configure the smart switches just to work to turn on/off the lights?

On AliExpress I bought a Neo Tuya HomeKit Zigbee hub.
It’s basically the Zemismart hub in a different package.
I’ve successfully managed to connect my Moes Zigbee TRV, Sonoff mini (zigbee) relays and some generic outlets (zigbee Tuya and energy monitoring).

I was unable to get any of my Aqara devices to connect, but i do have an Aqara hub for my alarm system anyway.
My Aqara devices are a couple of years old, so maybe they aren’t Zigbee 3.0?

I did buy some Tuya no neutral light switches but although they work in smartlife, they didn’t show up in HomeKit 😩
I’m now looking for an alternative without paying the Zemismart prices (about £25-30 / switch)

I’ve purchase a new Tuya human presence detector, which is Zigbee 3.0 and I’ll update if this works in HomeKit via the Neo hub.

Anyone else got one?
Any devices you’ve managed to sync with it and HomeKit?

My favourite is the outlets, they are cheap, 20A, work in Alexa, smart life, google and HomeKit with power monitoring and automations based on power in the smart life app."	4	['Automatic_Setting_30: When you say its “basically the zemismart hub in a different package do you mean all the devices compatible with the Zemismart hub are compatible with the Neo hub? \nIts hard to find info about this product and i dont know what devices are compatible with the hub in homekit.

Hi all,

I need your help to correctly install a smart curtain controller to my traditional wall switch.

&#x200B;

[Smart curtain controller](https://preview.redd.it/nk75eshb78sa1.jpg?width=997&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=206772d1d8cd54c2160aca2e042a6747e1af2192)

Long short story: I've bought two from aliexpress and one blew up when I connected it to my wall switch. The wall switch is powered (as you can see in the images).

The other one worked but without the wall switch.

I don't understand how I can use the wall switch buttons with these devices.

Thanks in advance.

Had it all set up before. However when I try to reset the plug (so it goes into the blue flashing pairing mode), it just switches on and off. I’ve tried leaving it off with no power for several minutes. Holding the button down for up to 30 seconds to reset it, and turning it on and off several times rapidly, but nothing I’ve found online will prompt it to go into pairing mode so I can set it up in the smartlife app again.

AndyJBailey	6	11wjtd8	smartlife	https://www.reddit.com/r/smartlife/comments/11wjtd8/smart_lights_and_smart_switches_the_holy_grail/	"I posted this as a comment to someone looking for a solution and thought that other users may benefit from it.

This is the solution I came up with...

Step 1: Buy 1cm spacers for your light switches and replacement screws to hold them in place.

Step 2: Buy a cheap, generic ZigBee WiFi hub. They're about £10 on AliExpress.

Step 3: Buy a cheap, generic ZigBee Scene switch. They're available with 1, 2, 3 and 4 buttons and sell for around £10 on AliExpress.

Step 4: Once you have paired the hub in the Smartlife app you can then add your Scene switches through the hub interface in the Smartlife app.

Step 5: Using Bluetac, stick the Scene switch to the spacer thus covering the original old-school switches. This prevents accidentally disconnecting the power to the smart bulbs. Any time you may need to power cycle the smart bulbs due to a disconnect, you can easily peel the Scene switch off and stick it back.

Step 6: Using the Smartlife app's standard automations (not automations within the ZigBee hub's interface) you need to create 4 automations per Scene switch.

Automation: Bedroom Light Switch On.

Conditions: If Bedroom Switch pressed.

Tasks: Turn Bedroom Light On.


Automation: Bedroom Light Switch Off.

Conditions: If Bedroom Switch pressed.

Tasks: Turn Bedroom Light Off.


Automation: Bedroom Light State On.

Conditions: If Bedroom Light On.

Tasks: Enable Bedroom Light Off, disable Bedroom Light On.


Automation: Bedroom Light State Off.

Conditions: If Bedroom Light Off.

Tasks: Enable Bedroom Light On, disable Bedroom Light Off.


The advantages of this method are many.

1: The Holy Grail of having Smart switches AND Smart bulbs work together.

2: Works flawlessly with Voice, Schedules, App and switches.

3: No wiring required.

4: Completely reversible if you move.

5: Affordable.

6: Buttons have 3 modes (click, double-click and hold) so you can have up to 12 different functions.

7: Not limited to just controlling lights. I have one that turns my TV and receiver on/off.

8: Easy to set up multiple switches with single lights like controlling the landing light with one switch at the foot of the stairs and one at the top.

9: If your bulbs allow it, switches can control brightness and colour.

10: You can add additional switches by just sticking them to the wall. They come with 2 adhesive strips and run off PC bios batteries (5 yr life cycle).

11: You can get creative. My bathroom has 5 ceiling lights. 3 down one side, 1 over the bath and 1 over the shower. When I click the top-right button the 3 main lights come on one by one starting at the door. When I turn them off, they turn off one at a time ending at the door. If I hold the button they dim, hold again and they brighten. Same for the bath and shower. The spare button toggles white or colour (which Google Home changes... Dim yellow in the morning, bright white during the day, cool blue when I go to bed and darkroom red if I get up in the middle of the night to pee lol).

When trying to set a circulate, it doesn't really work without setting end time or start time in minutes (and not time of activation). What does that mean?"	5	"['Emotional_Mammoth_65: I\'m personally using the Tuya app (which is a re-labeled smart life app.\n\nI think you should look into the ""scene"" function which is located on the icon bar at the bottom of the app. The scene function allows for a great deal of smart functions that you cannot perform from the individual button or switch page.\n\nI\'m not certain what you are attempting to do exactly but the scene function has helped me do the following:\n\n  a) We have a fish tank. We have a smart switch connected to the fish pump. When the fish is fed, someone hits the button on the side of the switch. That shuts off the fish pump.   I have set up an automation that detects the off state, waits 15 minutes, and resumes the pump. Simple but effective.\n\n   b) Second automation for a multiple gadgets we have on a charger most of the time. I found that keeping gadgets plugged in and charging 24/7 leads to early battery demise.  I have an automation setup to charge twice daily for 1/2 hour each (just as a maintenance charge). A second automation detects is used if someone comects a used device. A button press to the side button will allow the charger to remain on for 90 minutes before automatically shutting off.\n\nAgain I don\'t quite understand your specific goals. But the power is the scene function and leaning how to use it. Believe me there are a great deal of limitations but with some thought - you can coax these $5-10 devices to do a lot.

I set this up but then realized that this will turn on the lamps when I'm not home, which I don't want.

I know I can't use a location change to make this work, and I don't have motion sensors. So I figure I can somehow make this work by making the overhead lights already being on as a condition. If I'm home, the overhead lights will be on.

The controller is aging but is not yet ready for replacement.  There are off the shelf products that do the same job that are smart (app enabled) zone controllers but they are expensive.  

These controllers have a safety feature called a master zone, so if all zones are disabled by the user then one of the zones will be turned back on - this is to prevent a pressure blow-out in the air ducting system.

I am curious to understand if the cheap relay boards that can be set up on smart things or eWeLink type apps can be given similar logic - ie the users can only turn off relay 1 if relay 2 is on; and if relay 1 is off and relay 2 gets turned off then relay 1 will be turned back on."	4	"['Academic_Strike85: I have a couple of Sonoff 4 way smart switches and they do have a function to turn on only one of the circuits (any button you press turns off all the other 3) - but this is not what you want.

Topic : Help needed for 2 way (3 way) smart switch installation

I'm looking to install at 2 way (3 way for Americans) smart switch to control my stairwell lights. Currently they're wired up using dumb switches. Top switch has live wire, with 2 switch wires (travelers?) going to the bottom second switch. ***By the way, I can only use no neutral switches, that’s how wiring is here in Asia.** *

Lutron and etc are not an option here in Asia. I read on other threads that there are ready made 3 way light switches that allow only 1 smart switch to be installed. However my ecosystem at my house is predominantly Tuya or Aqara, and I'm leaning more towards the Tuya route at the moment. 

For this setup, do I just need 1 smart switch ? And the other dumb switch can be retained ? Or do I need 2 smart switches, and the second one does not have any switch wire (common/traveler) wires connected to it, just live (hot wire) and programmed via automation ? If so, does the second switch work locally in the Tuya (and or homekit ) ecosystem ? 

Lastly, how does this translate into Homekit? My Tuya (zemismart) hub allows for my Tuya devices to be incorporated into Homekit. 

Sorry for the long post, and thanks in advance !"	14	"[""fernando_marques: What I did was your Second option. One 'real' smart switch and a Second smart switch with scenes automation.

 I recently bought four more Treatlife outlets and I'm experiencing a problem that I've never had before. It's also difficult to explain. :(

I own probably two dozen Treatlife products, (many of them the same outlets that I'm having problems with), and I've never had this happen.

Here's the product I'm having trouble with: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088PNCJFQ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088PNCJFQ)

What's happening is that the outlets from this last purchase (all four of them are doing the same thing) function correctly, add to the SmartLife app correctly, and are seen in Alexa, but some time after adding the devices, each device gets added multiple times to Alexa.

What happens is this:

* Device gets added to SmartLife, getting named something like ""Outlet Den Lamp""
* Device appears in Alexa like normal
* Device gets configured and works fine with no problems in either SmartLife or Alexa
* Some time later though, SmartThings eventually picks up the devices from SmartLife, and then multiple copies of the device then appear in Alexa. Each outlet appears as ""Outlet1"" and ""Outlet44"" along with the original one named ""Outlet Den Lamp"" (That means three entries for each outlet, wtf?)
* Neither ""Outlet1"" or ""Outlet44"" appear in SmartLife
* ""Outlet1"" cannot be controlled, and it says ""There was a problem"" (Yeah that's not vague or anything...)
* ""Outlet44"" can be controlled, acting like a duplicate of ""Outlet Den Lamp""
* When Outlet1 and Outlet44 are deleted from Alexa and/or SmartThings, they just appear again some time later

I've deleted the device(s) from SmartLife completely, re-added them, renamed them, and re-added, all to the same effect. 

As mentioned, this has never happened before with any of the two dozen (or so) TreatLife products I use, including these same outlets.

I sent a support email in to TreatLife but haven't gotten a response yet... but something tells me they'll push this off as a SmartThings problem and not theirs. I also have no doubt that SmartThings will say the same thing in reverse.

Has anyone experienced anything like this before, or have an idea of how to fix this problem?

Administrative-Map16	3	10dxy7f	smartlife	https://www.reddit.com/r/smartlife/comments/10dxy7f/flash_bulb_firmware/	"When I was first getting started with automation I bought a couple of Wi-Fi bulbs from AliExpress which work with an app called CozyLife. The app is a sort of bargain basement knock off of smart life.

It's compatible with Google Home and Alexa so I've been able to integrate them into my overall home automation and work seamlessly with smart life devices that way, but I'd rather not have to use CozyLife.

One of the main issues is that one or both of the CozyLife bulbs will randomly switch on overnight, and there's no activity log in the CozyLife app to figure out why.

I've tried adopting them in smart life, in case they're the same protocol or whatever, but it doesn't work.

Now I wonder whether the hardware is standard and I can just flash new firmware somehow to get them into smart life. Is this possible, and if so, how?"	0	[]

Furthermore, when I originally tried to get my Tuya integration working, it was like 1.5 years ago when I was on Spectrum's Internet. I switched to a different ISP about 6 months ago, so I don't see how Tuya could even have me blocked, not to mention that even if I was still on Spectrum, I would have probably had 5 new IP's by now since nearly every home ISP company assigns addresses via DHCP, so how could Tuya possibly block people that way??\n\nI'm wondering if my ISP is maybe blocking access to iot.tuya.com and developer.Tuya.com?

StormBurnX	2	103n4sn	smartlife	https://www.reddit.com/r/smartlife/comments/103n4sn/looking_for_the_opposite_of_a_smart_switch_smart/	"I have some smartlife compatible smart bulbs (Teckin 4 pack from amazon) and I'd like to be able to turn them on and off with a regular light switch, but still have them receiving power to run scripted automations (adjust color temperature, dim at nighttime, etc)

I tried using an overly complicated setup with a wemo mini plug to know when the lightswitch is sending power or not, and then use IFTTT to trigger the lights being on/off to match the outlet's state, but that didn't even work correctly on the pro+ paid subscription plan so I gave up.

Then I went into the Smart Life app and started looking at the devices I could add, and at first I thought I needed a Smart Switch, but then I realized **that's the exact reverse of what I need**.

To clarify, Smart Switches connect in-line with mains electricity, just like a normal light switch, and then turn off/on an actual electrical circuit, just like a normal light switch. The 'smart' part is that they can be remotely turned on/off, like a smart outlet such as the wemo mini.

**What I'm looking for is the opposite of this**, something that does **not** shut the mains wiring on/off. Something like a smart 'button' that when I click it, it will run a scene/whatever that turns off the smartbulbs in the room, and when I click it again, it turns them back on.

However, I cannot seem to find this sort of device in the list of options under ""Add a device"" in the Smart Life app, so I don't know what's compatible or really even where to start looking.

Is there such a thing? I would expect it to be a very simple feature/device but I can't for the life of me figure out what it would be called to look for it.

The basic idea is you hook the smart switch up to the line, and neutral, like normal.  The smart switch load out is capped off, and you also wire the line directly to the load (the lights).

Hey Guys, first of all I wish you all a happy new year. Ihad a lytmi sync box for a while now. I wanted it smarter so I decided to buy a Philips sync box und the gradient 75 z light strip. Yesterday I wanted to install it and had problems. Installation was easy and my PlayStation 5 worked fine (in every hdmi input) but my Apple TV worked in no one. The Apple TV signal goes through the sync box and I can see everything on the tv but there is no Ambilight with the Apple TV signal and the app says no signal but somehow switches to Apple TV when I turn him on. So the sync box recognizes something but somehow has no signal for ambilight. Another problem is that in some apps for example prime video I can only hear the movie but I have a black screen. Menu of the Apple TV, Netflix and also the menu of prime video are not a problem and I have a picture but not by starting a video. So I believe the Apple TV or the apps thing that there is a recorder between the Apple TV and tv but it’s only the sync box. I used several hdmi cables and none worked out. I want to say again that the PlayStation 5 worked with every input and the Apple TV with none. The Philips hue support is garbage and can’t help in any way. Please help me. I am so frustrated.

I've noticed that sometimes the lights would stay on even if I have switched it off. Both in app and physically. To fix it, I would peel off the faceplate and 'short it' by connecting two of the pins with a test pen. Sometimes I have to loosen/tighten the screw plate a little. If both doesn't work out, I would have to take it out and try to reconnect the wires again. 

I know it's not my wiring as I have one particular light that will not switch off despite swapping the connectors (was using a 2 gang switch) and would work when I use a 1 gang switch or a 'dumb' switch.  I assumed it was a batch issue but another switch that I bought from the same seller months before started to show the same symptoms. 

In another corner of my house I have a smart relay for one of my lights. So far it's the only smart relay that I'm using and it's been reliant. 

I'm thinking of swapping my existing Smart Switches to a smart relay + scene button combo. Was wondering if anybody else have experiences using smart switches & smart relays and how's the reliability. I'm worried that the current situation would repeat again with the new setup but this time it would not be as accessible to repair it."	0	[]

I'm playing around with more in-depth smart lighting for the first time. I've got a couple Tuya WB5 LED strip controllers. I'm having some difficulty getting them paired with my phone, and could use some help.

The QR code on the device goes to the Tuya Smart Life app (the blue square with the house symbol), and most of the tutorials I find say to use that also. When I put the WB5 in pairing mode by holding the 'set' button, it flashes purple (like it says it should), and the Smart Life app recognizes a device to add. When I tap to add, it prompts me for WiFi SSID & password, which I provide. It says 'being added' on the device, and the indicator light on the WB5 changes from flashing purple to flashing red to solid blue. The app sits there for about 60 seconds, and then gives me a 'device adding timeout' error, and the WB5 goes back to solid red.

Initially I thought this was an issue with my WiFi (I'm working in a complex WiFi environment with multi-band, multi-AP SSIDs), but I created a single-AP, 2.4Ghz-only SSID and used that. I do see where both my phone and the WB5 connect to the SSID from the WiFi controller, so it seems like the initial WiFi join does work. In fact, even after the 'device adding timeout' error, the WB5 remains connected to the WiFi access point.

So, two questions.

First: any advice on getting this connected to my phone via WiFi?

Second: Is there a way to connect over Bluetooth & NOT over WiFi? Frankly, that's what I'd really prefer. I can't for the life of me figure out how to do that, though. When I try to open the Smart Life app with WiFi turned off, it gives me an 'Unavailable Network' warning banner. When I tap 'add device', it does see a Bluetooth device to add, but but gives me an error about ""Only after your mobile phone is connected to WiFi can it be connected to the device"".

Thanks in advance for any advice you can give!"	2	"[""mp583: I had a problem with adding devices to smart life before when the WiFi password had special characters in it. I removed those and then it worked. I'm not sure it will help though if it is connecting to the WiFi!\n\nAnother thing I tend to try when adding devices to smart life is using the other pairing mode. If you reset it again it should go to a slow blink, then it will create its own WiFi hot-spot which you connect to. This has solved some pairing issues for me before."", 'XTJ7: Thanks for sharing it. I have a slightly different model (wx300p) and unfortunately this did not work for me. I created a separate guest WiFi, I made sure it is 2.4 Ghz, no special characters, short password, had the controller right next to the router, set it to pairing mode but it would immediately jump to ""timeout"". It is just not working. To top it off the IR remote also does not work. The battery is full and with my phone I checked that the remote is sending IR signals, but even from 5cm distance it just won\'t do anything. I am starting to suspect that my controller is actually broken.']"

Hi, I use **smart devices** and **home automation** for the whole year by now. The app is **Smart Life**, and I created various scenes with it.
The thing is, for smart switches I used the most, it is boring and complicated to swipe phone screen, enter the app, and toggle switch, multiple times per day. Also, **Smart Life** doesn't have good widgets, so I tried to find better solution - and idea with **NFC tags** sounded perfect to me.

I searched how to connect NFC tag and Smart Life app,  and everything looked too complicated for me, to many coding, ""nerdy"" wording, weird apps and set up knowledge.

**Eventually, I found the solution.** It's not the best, it's not perfect, but it is the easiest, fastest, and the best part is that you can rely on your own logic to design logical paths. **And it works!**

**SOLUTION:**

**The point is to use MacroDroid to read NFC tag and display notification (as consequent action). Next, IFTTT reads keyword from that notification and triggers created Smart Life scene (IFTTT is able to access Smart Life scenes).**

**Hardwere:** NFC tags, smart switch/socket

**Softwere:** Smart Life, MacroDroid, and IFTTT

**Step by step:**

**1)** Go to **Smart Life** and create **Tap-to-Run scene** with your smart switch/socket hardwere. (If ""Launch Tap-to-run"", then ""Run the device"")

**2)** Go to **MacroDroid** to create Macro which will read NFC tag and display notification (as consequent action). 

* **Add Macro** -> **Add Trigger** -> Device Events -> NFC Tag -> Write New Tag

* **Next,** add multiple consequent actions in the same field via ""+"":

* **Add Action** -> Notification -> Display Notification (write something nice and informative here, you can even set icon for it)

* Add action -> MacroDroid Specific -> Wait Before Next Action -> set 12 seconds

* Add action -> Clear Notifications -> Select Application(s) -> pick MacroDroid -> Text Content (contains) -> Enter one keyword from displayed notification you entered above.

Last two actions are to automatic remove your displayed notification, so you don't need to do it manualy everytime. I recommend 12 seconds, because next app, IFTTT needs from 1-10 seconds to read it.

**3)** Use **IFTTT** app to connect MacroDroid and Smart Life with simple IF/THEN logic path, but first sync Smart Life with IFTTT.

First sync:

* **Go to Profile** -> My services -> Smart Life -> gear icon (top right)

Next, create:

* **Create** -> **If This** -> Add -> Android Device -> Notification received from a specific app -> App name (MacroDroid), 'Filter by notification keyword' (use unique word from your MacroDroid notification you wrote above)

* **Then That** -> Select action service -> Smart Life -> Activate Scene -> Scene -> Select scene you created in Smart Life (first step in this tutorial).

**I hope this will help anyone who searched whole night to find ""solution for dummies"".**"	1	['avipars: which nfc  tags do you recommend?']

I've used a wifi mini switch to put in the wall socket of a bathroom electric radiator.  I'v set up a scene to turn the radiator power on at 4:40 and off at 5:10 and repeat several times during the day.

If I turn the power off/on to the socket it will work as expected for 12 hours, but then it stops triggering.  I have to manually turn the power supply off and on again to power off/on the switch, which then starts working again.

&#x200B;

At all points the switch can be operated manually from the Tuya app but Google Home can report it as offline.. 

&#x200B;

The switch is about 3 meters away from a TPLink AX73 in AP mode, connected to a separate IOTLAN WiFi network.  All other SONOFF switches are working fine on the same network and never fail to trigger.  I have several other plug in Nooie switches in the Tua app, and they work fine, but they aren't in a scene, so only ever manually turned on/off.

&#x200B;

Any idea's?  I'm going to reset the switch and reconnect to Tuya, but I don't think this will solve the problem.

&#x200B;

The switch is the same as this:

I need some help. Feel like I’ve tried everything. 

I’ve setup an automation with a door sensor. If Open, then notification (in-app). The automation is enabled and disabled by two Tap-to-run. The Tap-to-run is exported via Smartlife’s own Add-to-Siri and edit in Shortcuts. This works fine to enable and disable. 

Now.. if I enable and open door shortly after, I get notification. 
If I go to work, come back and open door, nothing. Like 95% of the time, nothing. 

I can see the door sensor is triggering. Under logs for automation there’s nothing. 

Suggestions?"	15	"[""AndyJBailey: Step 1 is to rule out an issue with notification so add another signal like turning a light on.

Sorry for late response. \n\nIssue with notification has been ruled out. The automation log show that the automation is not started at all.', ""AndyJBailey: Ok, let's eliminate those 2 tap-to-runs.

I’m completely new to Tuya, just bought my first switch. Setting it up with the Smartlife app was quite simple, but the general idea was to add these devices to my Apple HomeKit via Homebridge. 

First step was like I said pretty straight forward. Setting it up in Smartlife have no problems. 

Then according to multiple tutorials I should create a project on the Tuya IoT platform. The account was set up in a jiffy, the project didn’t take much more time, but when I try to add the Smartlife app to the project it responds that 0 (zero) devices will be added. After the second try the message changed to something like the maximum amount of projects are linked to the Smartlife account, and this one can not be added. 

First idea was to completely delete the corrupt projects, but it seems that’s not possible. 

I haven’t got a clue how to remove the Smartlife account from a project, since it doesn’t show the account anywhere in the project. 

Second I would like to know what’s going wrong. There’s only one thing I can imagine. In the tutorials I have to add one specific API to the project giving a total of 6 API’s. I think this is an older version because in my project there’s quite a number of default API’s which all have a different name then in the tutorials. 

When I add the project to my homebridge setup I don’t get any error codes what indicates that homebridge is connecting correctly to Tuya IoT. So easy conclusion is something went wrong in the IoT project, but I can’t figure out what it is, and how to fix it. 

Any help would be appreciated a lot."	6	"['AnchoredFrigate: Yeah, their platform is absolute garbage with fun things like not being able to delete anything once its created (gotta make sure to not lose out on that data collection I guess) so you\'ll hit the limits of being able to do anything pretty quick, but after couple new accounts and few failed projects I managed to make it work:\n\n1.

I had a think about the problem and it made no sense that it would take 5s for the motion sensor to trigger a scene/automation via the cloud because all my other wifi lights, garage door opener etc trigger pretty quickly within a second even though they have to go through the Smart Life/Tuya cloud even when activated by Google assistant. 

So I thought it had to be because it is being powered by battery, being put into a sleep state, having to wake up, turn on the wifi chip and authenticate before it could even connect to the cloud to trigger any scenes/automations.

Plugging in the sensor to a constant power source via micro USB solved the issue. When motion is detected, my scenes/automations triggered within a second. 

TLDR; plug your wifi motion sensors in if you find them slow to respond. They're in a sleep state when powered by battery. 

[/Update]

So I have wifi motion sensors that are set up to turn on a wifi light 

I understand the motion is sensed then talks to the cloud before telling the light to turn on. Sometimes it can take over 5 seconds for this to happen 

My question is, if I switch to zigbee motion sensor and zigbee light with a zigbee hub, will it still have to talk to the tuya cloud for the automation?

Would using zigbee devices only but using smart life app for automation still cause a slow triggering of the lights to turn on?"	3	"[""AndyJBailey: I don't know for sure but I have ZigBee light switches and they turn on/off my normal WiFi bulbs in less than 1 second so I think it's worth a try.\n\nHope this helps 👍"", ""33espressos: Thank you.

GoYoshi	4	ykct4f	smartlife	https://www.reddit.com/r/smartlife/comments/ykct4f/display_individual_units_of_power_strip_in_one/	"Hi! I just installed SmartLife to control two power strips and two sockets. Within the power strip I can control the individual units, like the LED bar behind the TV.

However, is it possible to have all the named units of the power strips and the sockets combined on one single page so that I don't have to select a power strip first and look for the correct port? It's a bit inconvenient and costs me a new taps.

So I imagine I have a single page where I can turn off my LED bars or cabinet lights or change their schedule. Is that possible with SmartLife or do I have to look for another app?

I'm looking at buying smart lights for my house, but only ones that are designed to be able to be switched on and off with a regular wall switch. I don't want to have to constantly be on my phone just to switch off a light when there are perfectly fine regular wall switches around. And I don't want to have to buy extra ""smart"" wall switches.

The reason I'm interested in smart lights is to establish a circadian rhythm. I.e. I'd like an RGB light that is white/blueish most of the day, and gets more red towards the evening and the night. So after setting it up once, the RGB light just follows the current time to determine what colour/intensity it should be.  I don't need any functionality that allows me to change the colour whenever I feel like it or when watching T.V. etc. I don't really care about that kind of stuff.

Technically this shouldn't be very difficult. The way I would imagine it (if I would build it myself, and I have been thinking about it) is:

1. Setup the bulb once, choose your colour/intensity routine.
2. Wall switch is flicked on, provides power to the bulb.
3. The bulb connects to wifi network and gets current time via NTP (i.e. from the internet).  In the meantime (whilst bulb is connecting to wifi) the LEDs take on a colour and intensity that provides some bare level of lighting whilst not being so bright that it is disturbing (e.g. if you switch the lights on middle of the night).
4. Once the UTC has been obtained, the LEDs change their colour/intensity to the specified values as prescribed for the circadian routine. Bulb can now disconnect from wifi.
5. Flick wall switch off.
6. Cycle repeats from point 2.

Does anyone know if such lights exist? So far I've only encountered info saying that it's [bad for smart lights to turn them on/off](https://smarthomestarter.com/how-do-smart-bulbs-work-with-regular-switches/) regularly with a wall switch, and some info suggests that for some brands after disconnecting from power [the bulbs do weird things and lose their routine](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/13/philips-hue-ios-app-power-outage/).

You can set a default ""on"" action, ""on from power source"" it\'s called in the app. Additionally you have the option to do on from app option as well. \n\nFrom there you can create schedules for the bulbs to turn to presets based off time, sunrise, or sunset. The sunrise and sunset options will require you to share your location with the app so it can lookup your local sunrise/sunset times.\n\nIt might not be the best solution but kasa products are reasonably priced and you wouldn\'t need additional products or services.', 'daanTheLion: thanks for all the input!

If my Tuya lights are set up normally, is there a way to power them on/off using both a physical switch and through a smart app (obviously, only being able to turn them on via the app if the physical switch leading to them is also in the ""on"" position). I'm assuming the reason they keep disconnecting is because I have the physical switch leading to them powered off for an extended period of time (if the physical light is off for less than 10 minutes (let's say), I can still turn them on later using that same physical switch and they won't go into the blink/pairing state.

Do I need a special 3-way switch of some kind to keep the light semi-powered so that it doesn't lose it's sync to the network, or is there a way to set it up so that it auto-syncs to the network after having had it off for an extended period of time?

Setting up the Zemismart ZMHK-01 Homekit Hub  was easy. Logged into my Tuya app, and added it there. The hub will be added to Homekit. It wont appear in a room, since it’s a hub with nothing controllable on it (its LED light is not exposed to homekit), but you can see it under home settings - hubs. Then i added the switches via the Tuya app too, and they were exposed to Homekit too.

Some notes about the Zemismart ZMHK-01 Homekit Hub :-

1. **Yes, the Hub cannot pair to the router via wifi**. There is no wifi option. Its via ethernet only. So if you have no access to ethernet cabling in the room that you want to install this hub too, then your pretty much out of luck. Not sure if you can run a powerline wifi extender to use it.
2. **The transmission of zigbee signal is pretty terrible**. I installed the hub in my study room, which is sharing a wall with my bedroom. The MOES switches that i installed is in my bedroom. The hub and switches are barely 6 feet apart (give or take) separated by aforementioned wall. When i checked the zigbee signal in the Tuya app, it says poor reception. Yikes.
3. I’ll probably buy a zigbee repeater to try to extend this hub’s reception to the floor below. Not sure if it‘s able to. If all else fails, i will have to buy another Zemismart ZMHK-01 Homekit Hub  hub. It’s still more affordable than the Aqara route. The M1S (2 no.s) that i have is not pricey, but the Aqara D1 switches are. The MOES switches are cheap compared to the Aqara D1s.
4. I have read that this hub can pair with 3rd party (besides tuya) zigbee devices such as sonoff sensors. Will try this down the line.

Some notes about the MOES Zigbee Switches  :-

1. Materials are not as good as the Aqara D1 switches, they feel hollow to press on.
2. When remotely (within the Home app or Tuya app) toggling the switches, they don’t make an audible sound like the Aqara D1 switches do.
3. The LED status light can me turned off in the Tuya App, unlike the Aqara D1 switches.
4. They can be used as a wireless switch as well like the Aqara D1 switch.
5. They can be used as a 2 (3?) way switch, but neutral cable must be connected.
6. They can be used with or without neutral, and if used without a neutral cable, no capacitor is required to be installed before the light fitting.
7. Cheap.

**Conclusion**: **The Zemismart hub a pretty affordable hub, to pair with cheap tuya accessories to expose them to homekit.** more affordable compared to an all exclusive aqara route. I mean, i could just use a normal tuya hub with the MOES switches, but the tuya plugin in Homebridge is pretty terrible. There’s another plugin that’s local control but it’s just easier to have a hub that exposes all the accessories natively. **The MOES switches are very cheap, and do what the Aqara D1s can do, just that the construction feels kinda hollow.**"	29	"['Money-Secretary9832: Just curious, could you please share which moes zigbee switch you purchased?

Overnight my wifi switches now do not work, I have been using them for a long time and now when I try to use Alexa to turn them on ""Alexa turn on the bathroom"" I get a response from Alexa ""bathroom doesn't support that""

I have removed the devices, turned the power off and back on, and turned the permissions on the skill in the Alexa app off and back on. All other lights in the house will work, but the two switches don't.

The light switches will work within the Smart Life app. I can turn them on and off and adjust the LED nightlight color and turn the nightlight off and on. In the Alexa app I get the red ""!"" and ""unavailable"" and ""server is unresponsive"". I can use Alexa to turn on other lights and plugs and my AC temperature that are in the smart life app.

This is the same switch as I have installed

I'm having some trouble plairing Tuya Temperature & Humidity Sensors to the Smartlife App.

I want to use several sensors to monitor the temperature in different server rooms at work.I'm having full control on the wifi access point, and i made sure to allow the sensors' mac adresses to access the network.

What i'm doing :Using the SmartLife App, i'm picking ""Temperature & Humidity Sensors (wifi)"". I fill in the password to the wifi ssid. I press the sensor button so it goes into ""slow blink"". I then select the sensor's SSID, and connect my phone to it.

When going back into Smartlife, the app spends the next two minutes trying to link up to the device before stoping with no success.

Now, a bit more info.

I can monitor the network, and i know the phone does connect to the Sensor. The sensor does connect to the access point, and goes all the  way to the servers in Germany (i'm in Europe). The phone also access the servers in Germany, and at no point does my network blocks the connection (ports show no denied request).

So far, i've tried the pairing on two different phones, on two different networks (personal phone as hotspot and office network), and a vpn. None of these works, and the behavior remains the same as described earlier.

The only time I was successful was when i tried this on my personal home network, with a router provided by my ISP. There, the pairing was almost immediate, and i could get the  sensor's data at will.

I'm a bit lost here, and while i'm not network savy, i'm working with network engineers and they can't seem to understand what the issue is... If anyone has any idea, i'm all ears.

Thanks for reading !"	2	"['Echil46: So i\'m posting this in case anyone else has the same issue (tho it\'s very specific).  \n\n\nMy office uses Fortinet routers, which use a UTM (Unified Threat Management) to regroup all security protocols.

It just doesn\'t connect. I spent hours looking at logs and traces to figure if that i want these sensors to work within our office network, i\'ll have to directly contact Tuya and Fortinet Support.   \nWhich i won\'t.  \n\n\nStill, i\'m curious as to what triggers the UTM to block the connection. Probably something in the way packets are sent from the sensor.', 'xblackdemonx: I noticed the same thing as you, when I try to pair my LED strip I will see the blinking change like if sees the network but the app will stay stuck on ""Connecting"" and eventually it will fail.

If you are using [smart outdoor lighting](https://lumarysmart.com/collections/smart-outdoor-lights), then you do not have to worry about this problem, just need a smartphone app, no matter where you are you can control them remotely. Under certain conditions, use the [Lumary app](https://lumarysmart.com/pages/lumary-app-smart-bulbs-control-system) to set the color as well as brightness of the lights you want with just a tap on the screen.

I am currently using smart life scenes via Alexa to keep the AC On for a desired amount of time. I have 4 scenes setup:

Is there a way it can take variables via audio and use that within Smart Life?

I've got plenty of smart life bulbs and a scene switch.  I'm trying to program my living room lights to change color depending on the switch press (i.e., ""black lights"" for single click, ""all green lights"" for double click, etc.).

My bulbs, in the smart life app have a color mode on them, as well as ""white"" & ""music"". I'm trying to create a tap-to-run scene where I can program my colors, but the problem is the scene won't let me choose the color of the bulb.  I have ""ON/OFF"", ""MODE"", ""BRIGHTNESS"", ""COLOR TEMP"" & ""TIMER"" options.  I can select ""ON"" & ""COLOUR"" modes but it's all numbers on color temp (which I think deal with warm white/ cool white).

I figured that I could use a google command (since ""Hey google, change the living room light 1 to blue & change living room light 2 to orange"" works) but I obviously can't set up a google command in the smart life app.  How the hell can I get this switch programed to change my bulbs colors?  Any suggestions?  Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I have Smart Life, Google Home, Amazon Alexa & IFTTT accounts.  There's gotta be some way to do this!"	2	"['AndyJBailey: Unfortunately, the features available to use in tap-to-runs and automations is set by the manufacturer. Out of the 30ish GU10 smart bulbs that I have bought, only 5 allowed me to use colour mode (last set colour) and choose 4 editable scenes (set to static colours).\n\nIf you are determined to achieve what you want then you would need an additional smartphone or tablet permanently plugged in within earshot of a Google/Alexa device. Then using another Smartlife account you would set up your automations to include a notification in the task list. This notification would be picked up by another app called Tasker which would then trigger a text to speech output ""Hey Google, set bedroom light to blue"" which would then be heard by the nearby Google device and acted upon.\n\nHope this helps 👍', ""ShineHigh247: Wow, thanks for the heads up, man.

I recently bought the ""official"" neco tuya garage door relay for my garage.

However, it has no security at all, I assumed that as it was the official adaptor it would require a PIN or similar like other smart locks, but it doesn't. Is there any way (other than giving it an obscure name or disabling it in the Alexa app) that I could add some level of security, could I change the device type in the smartlife app?

Want to know if anyone around here has the Zemismart Homekit Hub? So far besides the paid reviews on YouTube there doesn’t seem to be much information on the net regarding this hub. What I’ve gathered as follows :-

	1.	Connection via Ethernet only, there’s no on board wifi
	2.	Range is very poor
	3.	3rd party zigbee 3.0 devices (besides offical zemismart and tuya ones ) are able to connect to it, such as sonoff zigbee child devices. Aqara ones do not work.

""scenes"" can be referring to 2 different things: one of them is what you mention in this comment, about light bulbs having a ""scene"" setting wherein they\'ll change colors according to patterns you like and whatnot, and then there are the ""Scenes"" proper from smart life, which are lists of automations that can be triggered by something else (this can include linking them to the push of a scene button).\n\nThe main limitation with smartlife and colour lights, is that in Scenes (capital S), you can have it turn on the light, set the light to light mode (as opposed to colour mode), adjust the brightness, etc; but you normally don\'t (at least with most generic zigbee or wifi RGB lightbulbs) have such fine-grained control over the ""color"" mode (ie adjusting the colour, the pattern and brightness); so indeed, when in an automation (ie: Scene with capital S) you set a light to mode:colour, it can only go back to the last colour setting it was set as. This is the same thing with the bulbs\' ""scene mode"" (lowercase s) which can also only ever be selected to activate the last available scene.\n\nThat, aside from the lack of multi-condition triggers for automations, is the main limitation of smartlife. For a lot of people, the ease of use and quick setup is worth these limitations; and other will want more fine-grained control in those 2 key limitations of smartlife.\n\nBut it\'s not necessary to change all your devices; Home Assistant can take over with the same gear, it\'s just a bit more of a pain to setup and program than smartlife. It will require either a hub or a spare computer/raspberry pi to be setup though, or alternatively buy the premade hub they sell preconfigured.\n\nBut to answer OP: Scene switches (upercase S) do exist, and they work. word of caution, I\'ve preferred to use zigbee-based ones in my home as opposed to wifi-ones; firstly because the battery life is much better with zigbee, but also because they\'re more reliable than wifi in my experience.', 'mrgrod: Yes, I get the limitations of the Smart Life, which is why I was very reluctant to go this route in the first place, but unfortunately they were the only ones with wafer lights available last year when I needed to purchase them. I might buck up and switch them out to the new Hue wafer lights at some point, but if I can get them to do the basic thing I need them to do, which is be controlled for On/Off purposes only via two separate wall switches without actually removing power from the lights, then I can certainly get by with these for quite awhile. I would love to have better scene control, but that\'s not a huge priority at the moment. My question is, why is there a battery involved? You mention preferring ZigBee based switches due to the battery life, but why is there a battery? I have constant 120V power available in my wall switches right now. What I want is a light switch that can get it\'s power from that wiring, while hard wiring the lights so they always have power, then let the Smart switch just send a WiFi signal to the router to turn the lights on or off whenever the switch changes position (I don\'t even really care if it\'s a button and not a rocker switch, as long as a single button press from either location tells the lights to change state from on to off, or off to on). I see some ""scene switches"" on Amazon from the link another poster linked, but they all seem to be designed to actually cut the 120V power. I would assume I can just leave that wiring out of the loop and just set the switches up to do what I want, but maybe I\'m wrong? I\'m also having a hard time finding a simple one...lots with many buttons, but I just want one single rocker switch, or one button...hell even two buttons would be fine, where one can be set up to send an ""on"" signal and the other can send an ""off"" signal.']"

I've tried a bunch of different bulbs and I'm definitely swayed by arguments for going the Smart Life route and not being locked into any particular ecosystem. But I'm trying to get these scenes set up, and honestly it doesn't seem to be as easy as I expect.

Seems like I can manually overwrite the preset ""scenes"" (that's the app's term for the custom color/brightness/etc settings of a single bulb, which is confusing) for each bulb, and I can't share settings, so I have to do that for every individual bulb/device. I seem to be limited to 8, which is probably fine but I don't like that there's an upper limit. But the killer right now is that when I create a tap-to-run scene I only seem to be able to specify mode: scene.

\+ > Create Scene > Launch tap-to-run > add task > run the device > choose device > mode > scene

I can't choose which of the scenes I'm referring to, so it just turns on the most recently used scene, which undermines the capability of having more than one scene in the first place. Basically I can only have one scene using this technique... or, as I am right now, I have to go into each bulb/device separately and manually change the ""scene"" (which is wildly impractical).

This all seems quite not-smart, which makes me think I'm probably doing it wrong. Can anyone help steer me down this colorful yet winding path?

Control of home heating only. No control of hot water (is separately timed to heat up overnight storage). Location UK / \~240 volts.

Home Setup:

* Household radiators (single circuit)
* UK conventional combi boiler (inc hot water + heating a storage tank that is not involved in this setup)
* Landis Staefa RWB9 programme (heat and hot water)
* \[replaced\] Honeywell T40 Thermostat.

&#x200B;

The Change and Challenge:

Replace old Honeywell T40 Thermostat with generic Tuya thermostat (dry contact type) - specifically 'MincoHome Smart Thermostat' off am Amazon UK.

I took a best guess at the thermostat type needed as there are several different type depending on the indented use - I got the 'Dry Contact' type which means the two contacts are just a relay and will not supply power.Seems I should have got one of the 'Normally Open / Normally Closed' types as they would supply a mains (240v) feed to call for heat without the need for the bridge wire below.

Solution:

Thanks to this YT vid ([https://youtu.be/cpIk4NLCviw](https://youtu.be/cpIk4NLCviw)) it's explained that a loop/bridge wire can be used to put a live feed (240v) over to one of the 'Dry Contacts' which then feeds the 'Live - call for heat' wire.

Wiring mapping as follows.  See the bodgy wiring diagram image below.

From the Controller - 3 wires in use:  
\* Live (1 on the old T40)  
\* Switched Live / Call for Heat (3 on the old T40)  
\* Negative (2 on the old T40)

Tuya Heater Controller - MincoHome Smart Thermostat:(note the numbering used changes a lot depending on the brand of Tuya device)  
\* Live (1)  
\* Switched Live / Call for Heat (5) - is feeding back to the controller  
\* Loop / bridge wire to bring Live to the Dry Contact relay - from terminal (1) over to terminal (4)  
\* Negative (2)

Recently I bought a set of speakers for my monitor. The speakers come with an IR Remote, so I quickly added the remote to smart life via a universal smart remote. Problem is, On and Off is the same command i.e. Same button. So let's say, if I have a routine where I'm turning Off all my devices, if speaker is already Off, it will turn On.

Benjyd21	1	wtf752	smartlife	https://www.reddit.com/r/smartlife/comments/wtf752/i_think_i_need_a_hub_gateway_but_dont_know_what/	"Hi guys, So during Lockdown I got big into Smart Home installations and basically kitted out all my lights, light switches, sockets, desks, lamps, computer, heating, fans, cameras, the list goes on. I have at least 50 devices in my home now and I love my smart home. However, I have noticed a dramatic drop in my bandwidth over time. All of these devices are connected to the same router (2.4ghz frequency). Yesterday I installed 3 new switches and one of them wouldn’t connect despite them being the same as I’ve installed before. After an hour of trying, I decided to turn my breaker back off and swap it back to the normal switch. When I turned my breaker off I had a though, “what if I’d reached the limit of devices my router will connect to”. Turns out I was right (I think) because when I turned off my ground floor lighting, suddenly smart life allowed me to connect through the app. Anyway, when I turned my downstairs lights back on, you guessed it, one of them came up “offline”. I did a-bit of googling and I think what I need is a hub to control the devices as I have plans to install more smart home appliances etc. 

So after that, I have 2 questions. 

1. Will a hub solve the problem I have and allow me connect more devices

2. What is the best (reasonably priced) hub for smart life as the majority of my devices are on the smartlife app. 

Thanks in advance

I bought two sets of Teckin 3-way switches years ago and it has worked fine. Recently I noticed that although in the Smart Life app, a set of switches is recognized as one switch, Google Home began recognizing it as two. The functionality has not changed though.

When I turn both of them on in the Google Home app, the light turns on, vise versa.

Recently I wanted to have the same setup, but Teckin has indicated that they do not sell them anymore. I managed to get my hands on ones that are identical, just without the name brand.

However, once I power them up, Smart Life recognized them as two switches and so as Google Home. I name two of them as ""Basement Bedroom"" and when I ask ""hey Google, turn on Basement Bedroom lights"", the lights would come on for a second then turns off. 🤷🥲 It does the same when I turn it on or off as a group in the Google Home App.

But anyways, I tried multiple times to reconnect the bulbs, turn off 5ghz, manually add the bulb, I downloaded other apps that supposedly would work better. None of these solutions worked for me. But what did work for me was putting the bulbs in AP mode (the slow blinking mode). 

To do this, do the on-off-on-off-on, and once the bulb starts flashing quickly do the on-off-on-off-on again. You should get one blink, and then a blink every 3 seconds or so.

I downloaded SmartLife app to my phone, and managed to get the app up and running. 

I then found that the 6 switches are actually separated into 2 sets of 3. So to use the app instead of going to the switch (I'm disabled and struggle to move around easily), I have to remember which set of 3 it is and click through to the switch.  
I am convinced that if I knew what I was doing I could set it up so that instead of showing me  


Gang 1 - kitchen spots, kitchen dining and living room sofa as individual switches

Gang 2 - dining area, desk area and passageway as individual switches  


Where the gang 2 is the first one I see, (can't work out how to swop the icons over) and it allows me to switch all 3 on at once (which I'll never want to do, I'll only want all off at once every night). And I have to click into the individual gang to access the actual switch I want to use.

IF I knew what I was doing, I would be able to have it set up as individual lights themselves so I can just use the home screen? I have set up Living Room and Kitchen as rooms, but they're empty cos I don't know how to use the app.  


TLDR: Basically I need an idiot guide on how to split up the 2x sets of 3 switches (currently showing as 2 devices) so I can access each switch from that home screen. So I just need to launch the app and it's there on the screen for me.

Alternatively, maybe I could do some sort of voice command set up? But I think until I've got my 2 devices organised, I don't think I should be jumping off that particular cliff...  


I suspect that it's intuitive, but not to me... and I'm utterly lost! In an ideal world I'd have 2 switches relating to kitchen, 4 switches related to living room. I just can't work out how!  


I think I don't know the right words to google for. Cos search results aren't helping."	4	"[""mwhahaharun: I'm using a few smart switch with 1&2&3 gangs.

I purchased a set of path lights yesterday and got them set up in Smart Life (Smart Bridge, 4 lights).

Maybe it's not possible.

I’m new to Smart Life but have been working in professional lighting controls for 20 years. I thought I’d dabble in the world of Zigbee for the first time for my new house. I’m struggling to achieve something that is rather trivial on other systems that I’ve worked with (I’m not a developer, mainly sales / product management with some commissioning experience). 

I’m using sonoff ZB Mini smart switch modules purely as a contact closure trigger for controlling some smart lights with built-in Zigbee. I didn’t fancy changing batteries all the time so haven’t gone for the scene controller style Zigbee switch. Everything is integrated with Alexa. The mechanical switches I’m using have a push to make, push to break contact arrangement. I’m trying to simulate a retractive switch with no visible on/off position, which doesn’t seem to be a thing in the consumer Zigbee world. 

I can get the sonoff devices to control the smart lights on and off with a couple of basic automations. What I can’t work out is how to incorporate a check on the smart lights so that the next switch action is always the opposite of the current light status e.g. if the switch is in the off position but Alexa turns the lights on, how do you make the switch change the current state of the lights on the first press?

Hope this makes sense!

Basically I have standard WiFi plugs (teckin) and heaters that can run using the smart life app. I now wish to add motion sensors to set things like lamps off etc using said WiFi plugs.
If I were to buy a ZigBee hub and say sonoff motion sensors, can I use the app to then set off non ZigBee based plugs?"	2	"[""flamingspiral: Unfortunately not from my experience. Sonoff and Tuya are competitors and they make it very hard to work together.

I have a window AC unit that doesn't have any smart functions, but it does have an IR receiver for a remote. I use a smart thermometer and IR blaster to turn the AC on and off when it gets to certain temperatures. But if it's above a certain temperature outside (which it gets to every day all summer where I live) my AC can't quite keep up with it so the room gets a bit warmer than I prefer even though the AC runs all the time. 

This causes a problem where the AC will turn on only for the temperature to climb back up over the trigger temp for the smart action. This triggers the action to turn on the AC again, but since the IR receiver only has a power input and not separate on/off inputs, my blaster will instead turn off my AC when it needs to be on the most.

The kind of annoying solution I've been doing is just turning off the smart action every day around noon, then turning it back on around 10 pm. It's just annoying to do every day, and it only takes a few seconds, but if I can automate this away I'll be happy.

I was thinking about getting a smart plug with current draw reporting so I can add it in to the on/off smart action conditions. So if the temperature is above x degrees c and the AC current is below y amps the AC needs to be turned on. I've looked for smartlife compatible current monitoring plugs, but the ones I've found don't have very good reviews for the accuracy/frequency of reports, or I'm worried about putting them under such a heavy load for so long each day. [I have this 8000 BTU AC unit.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D3FOD0Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) Does anyone have any robust plugs they recommend, or another solution maybe?"	3	"['Pltiton: I have a similar problem with IR Humidifier. I a smart plug and start every automation with ""Power off"". Thats the only way to have a ""defined state"" in a one way communication. And than have a automation/programm running every hour to check the conditions. Unfortuntally the the automation doesn\'t know any variables ... but you can use another plug for a true/fals variable - but - somewhat expensive solution, becaus of the 1 W standby power drain. Regarding the brand, your AC only draws 600W max, i wouldnt worry, most of them are good for 2000+ W.', ""Infamous_Memory_129: I would highly suggest another solution. I don't trust these plugs... maybe if you find one that is UL listed but I'd be surprised if any are out there and affordable. I had an 8amp pump on a 15amp plug with monitoring. I don't know if it was accurate, but it was fairly consistent.\n\nI had it in use outside but fully shielded from the elements mind you. One morning it was offline and when I checked on it, it had burned up. I had plastic melted to a brick and the end of my heavy-duty cord was fused to it. I put a new end on the cord and all was well. It did last about a year at various duty cycles with no issues until then. I have had a similar experience with an expensive UL listed Solid State Relay and I was only pushing it to 40% of the rating. That was a 240v application though.

I was told this is probably the better reddit for it rather than r/amazonecho. Please forgive the cross post.


As of a few weeks ago, my bn link outlets have stopped being individually accessible in Alexa. I have the ones that allow both the top and bottom plugs to be individually addressable in the smart life app. Also the USB is addressable too, so when I add the device in smart life, it adds 4 different devices - the top plug, the bottom plug, the USB, and then the whole thing that controls all 3 of the others. All 4 can be named whatever I want. 

Then, when you have the smart life skill installed and linked to alexa, then these same 4 devices are imported into Alexa as well. 

Well, a few weeks ago I started getting server unresponsive messages on my individual devices for each socket. Alexa just could no longer control them. I tried everything to reset the devices (by cutting the power at the breaker temporarily - which is what I consider the nuclear option) but when they came back and reconnected to the network, Alexa still could not control them.

I noted that smart life could still individually control each socket, but that Alexa could not, so my voice commands would not work. 

So consider this an FYI, and maybe also a question as to why this is now the case all of a sudden. Smart life no longer gives (or Alexa no longer accepts) the multiple devices inherent in these outlets. This started about 2 weeks ago now. Curiously, the device that controls all 3 of the others (the main one) is still coming over to Alexa, and still functions to turn everything off and on, but the individual ones do not. 

I have completely removed one of the devices from both Alexa and smart life (including wiping the data in smart life for that device) and re added it. Same result. It appears it just no longer gives Alexa all 4 devices individually anymore. Anyone else experience this with the bn link outlets?


The workaround I found was to create a scene in smart life that controls the 4 or 5 or so different individual outlets I wanted to group together, and then create a routine in Alexa to call those scenes. It's a lot more setup, but it does work. Doing this in Alexa is far easier (I just create a group with a particular name and add these 5 in, and then I can just say Alexa turn on Living Room Lamps and it works). Doing it in Smart life means I need a scene to turn them on, and a scene to turn them off, and then 2 routines in Alexa to attach to each, and then specify the words to say. Works the same, but a lot more setup than I wanted to have to do for each similar group. 


Also, last thing, I contacted bn link about it. I was surprised that I called a number in CA and that a person immediately answered who asked for my question and started giving me troubleshooting ideas. She knew her stuff too! She hadn't heard about this issue (which is mostly why I wanted to call to find out) but gave me some suggestions I immediately tried, but no luck. Ultimately this is between smart life and Alexa it seems."	1	['--Swift: Ok, as of tonight, after 3 weeks of not working, I opened my Alexa app and it said 30 new devices discovered! They have all come back online!\n\nI am thinking it was something either the smart life skill,  or the Alexa app itself had caused, and they have since fixed it.\n\nOk, move along folks... nothing to see here... 😀']

They're both connected to my Google Home.

Whenever I turn them off, minutes later they start acting up. The one in my bedroom turns back on as a red glow (it still shows up as off on the smart life app and google home app), and the one in the living room  flashes white for a split second every few seconds.

It's really annoying, and the red light in the bedroom is just bright enough to prevent me from sleeping well, definitely not just an afterglow. They both turn off completely when I use the wall switch (both are simple on/off, no dimmer).

I've already tried resetting and wiping them completely from the app, and nothing changed. For now I've resorted to turning off the bedroom light directly on the wall switch when I go to sleep, which defeats the whole point of the smart bulb. 

Any ideas on what's going on and how I can fix it?"	4	"[""Adventurous_Win_5420: That's not natural bro...."", 'iTLOP: Any solution?

&#x200B;

I bought a 1CH Zigbee Switch Module from AliExpress (this one: [https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003417122659.html?spm=a2g0o.order\_list.0.0.6b681802Hdm1VO](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003417122659.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.6b681802Hdm1VO)) and I am trying to install it into the back of my lights-switch. This is the first one I have done though so want to make sure I get it right. Everything I find online has reference to L and L1 on the back of the lights-switch but on mine it seems to be L1, L2 and L3.

This is a simple single switch room and the back of my switch currently looks like this:

I am guessing that I need to run a cable from the blue connection to N on the module for the neutral connection but them I am unsure what to do with the other 3 cables? I can't quite get my head around this diagram: 

https://preview.redd.it/l8ix56e40s691.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ad479a86c178ff738650036a17f935ed4990350d

Does one come out of L1 on the switch and go into the L on the module and the other one stay in L1 on the switch? L2 on switch come out and go into L1 on module and then a new cable go into L2 on switch to S2?

Any help or explanation would be great."	0	[]

I made some tests and I hope it help someone

1. Inside your router you can create a secondary wifi or guest connection, I made one invisible without password, so only I know the wifi ID to put on my smart devices. 

2. I suggest change all your devices to one kind of connection, for example I use all my Smart plugs on 2ghz and the Pc/phone on the 5 GHz.  

3. Some devices have the option inside the configuration to keep online after lost the connection, search for ""boot state"" or something like that inside of your device configuration.  

4. However some devices don't have this option, here what i did. First reset the device, go to the app and add the smart plug as Lamp/smart bulb, then change the pair mode to connect with the wifi, the device will blink slowly, after pair go to Alexa app find the device and inside the device configuration change the way it act from switch to Lamp/light.  

Hope this work for someone, after years trying a solution"	0	[]

It might take a while to wrap your head around it but there a 3 automations that act in a circular relay. Each cancels the previous and readies the next. When no vibration is detected, the currently running automation is allowed to complete at which point it executes the ""if no vibration detected"" commands.\n\nAutomation: Vibration 1.\n\nCondition: If vibration detected.\n\nTasks: Disable Vibration 3, Delay 5 minutes, Enable Vibration 2, Delay 5 minutes, Send notification, Disable Vibration 1.\n\n\nAutomation: Vibration 2.\n\nCondition: If vibration detected.\n\nTasks: Disable Vibration 1, Delay 5 minutes, Enable Vibration 3, Delay 5 minutes, Send notification, Disable Vibration 2.\n\n\nAutomation: Vibration 3.\n\nCondition: If vibration detected.\n\nTasks: Disable Vibration 2, Delay 5 minutes, Enable Vibration 1, Delay 5 minutes, Send notification, Disable Vibration 3.\n\nThe START configuration for this system is to enable 1 automation and disable the other 2.\n\nI\'m guessing your scenario is that you want to know when the washing machine has finished. So this is how it works...\n\n1: The active automation waits for vibration.\n2: You start the wash and the automation is triggered.\n3: After 5 mins the next automation is enabled and is waiting for vibration.\n4: If no vibration is detected then the original automation is allowed to complete, sending the notification. The automation that was enabled is ready for the next wash and the running automation disables itself.\n5: If the next automation detects vibration then it disables the previously running automation preventing it from sending the notification.\n\nYou can play around with the timings but remember this rule... The quickest cycle through all 3 automations (i.e. when there is constant vibration) must be longer than the shortest time any single automation takes to complete. So in my example, if you briefly shook the sensor and then didn\'t touch it the active automation would complete in 10 minutes. If you constantly shook it then it would take 15 minutes before the first automation would be reused.\n\nThe reason why this is important is that in reality you cannot cancel a running automation (because it\'s running on Tuya\'s server in China) but you can prevent the commands that Tuya sends back from being executed by disabling the automation.\n\nAlso, when you are creating these 3 automations, start off by just adding the first delay then saving. Now you can add the 3 ""enable/disable automations"" to each automation at once and then by holding down on their entries in the tasks list you can slide them up and down to re-order them. The sequence is disable previous, enable next then disable current.\n\nHope this helps 👍', ""makario_orta: >but you can prevent the commands that Tuya\n\nAfter writing this process down I fully understand it.

I want to put 30-40 RGB flush mount lights in the soffit/eaves around the house. I have a mesh wifi that says it can support 60+ devices and I don't currently have any smart devices, only ~10 phone/tablets/chrome casts that use it.

I have some questions and looking for answers..

Do these lights disconnect from the wifi easily? With so many lights, will I constantly have problems?

It looks like I can set them to turn off/on and sunrise/sunset. Is that correct?

It looks like I can make custom scenes, so does that mean I can make them change to certain colors and set the duration in between those colors?

If so will they all stay in-sync if I set them to the same scene?

I have a smart home setup of 5-6 devices where all devices are controlled via Smart Life. They are connected to a router provided by ISP & has same SSID for 2.4 & 5 Ghz bands. While most of the time, the setup works well, I do notice that occasionally some of the devices stop working for a few minutes. It occurs randomly. On researching, I found that there is something called ip leash renewal that can cause this. Website here - https://smarthomeowl.com/why-is-smart-life-offline/ The problem is, I have many automated routines setup via alexa & devices randomly going down affects the reliability of those routines.

My question is, does anyone have any experience in dealing with this problem & avoiding downtime altogether? The main problem is that it occurs randomly, I cannot manually reproduce it, thus no way to test out different things & come up with a proper solution. The page above says that I should buy a 2.4 GHz only WiFi Router & DMZ it to the main router, but I don't see how that will solve the IP leash renewal problem as it has to be done there as well. On my ISP provided router, DHCP lease is set to 24 hour timeout.

Let me know if you have any suggestions."	6	"[""erikperin: I've always had problems with routers from ISP providers (they're usually pretty bad). So the ideal is to buy a router of your own and of good quality. And if your budget fits, look for MESH routers (TPLINK for me works great, like Deco M5). This will really greatly improve the signal and stability of the connections. \n\nIn addition to this. Then in the settings make the IP reservations so that you avoid unnecessary DHCP calls. That might solve it. \n\nBy the amount of devices on the network as you said, I do not believe it is an excess of connections.  I hope it helped you, and please, if it worked, come back and give feedback on the result."", '--Swift: You\'ve probably done this already, but maybe see if your wifi is conflicting with a neighboring wifi channel? Download wifi analyser and see what other wifis are using your channel, and their decibel level. If there is an obvious channel that would be clearer, change your wifi to it.\n\nAlso, when you say ""randomly"" how often do you notice? Is it happening every day, once a week, once a month?\n\nI\'ll also say that your IP lease being renewed and giving you a new IP (which is the reason why this can be a problem) is unlikely the culprit here. Often the ISP will keep your IP the same for a long period of time. This is especially true if your internet is connected 100% of the time like most of ours is. Again, unlikely the cause of your internal network issues.\n\nPerhaps the DHCP lease might be a possibility, but 24 hours should be plenty, but of course you can set it for longer. However, even if your device gets a new IP, that should not affect its connectivity to your network. It should just pick it back up with no issue.', ""downloaderfan: > And if your budget fits, look for MESH routers (TPLINK for me works great, like Deco M5).\n\nI looked it up. Deco M5 & Deco E4, but all of my smart home devices are setup in just 1 room 10x10 ft, so I believe a mesh router would be overkill. I would have paid for it if it was absolutely necessary to fix this problem, but I don't think it would be required for such a small space.\n\n> Then in the settings make the IP reservations so that you avoid unnecessary DHCP calls. That might solve it.\n\nCan you perhaps post a screenshot or video of how it's done? I went though all settings in my router and saw that the only change I could do for DHCP is to modify the timeout from 1 day to something else. Are you referring to static IPs?"", ""downloaderfan: > By the amount of devices on the network as you said, I do not believe it is an excess of connections. I hope it helped you, and please, if it worked, come back and give feedback on the result.\n\nUpdate - After trying out a multitude of things in my ISP Router like changing channel width, channel band, separating SSID of 2.5 and 5 GHz, turning Off 5 Ghz, the issue still persisted.\n\nFinally, I bought a TP-Link AC1750 router and am using it in access point mode. Haven't faced the issue in 2 days."", ""erikperin: >Can you perhaps post a screenshot or video of how it's done?\n\nWell, that depends on the router. Each one stays somewhere.

Appreciate any advice on this.

I was thinking of getting on board home assistant to ""speed things up"" (everything works fine on the wifi for the most part) but am worried that there are functions that HA would not be able to handle.

The main issue which has been ongoing for half a year+ now, with no fix, is that Home Assistant is not able to get the state of your switches accurately.  For some reason, the refresh function is broken, so it will get your state from when you booted the system, and then maybe 30 minutes later?  Or when you manually reload the integration.\n\nFurthermore, Tuya has switched their requirements so you need to make a dev account, etc.  There is a free ""trial"" for 1 month, then you can renew for free for 6 months.  Not sure what happens after that?\n\nThere is, however, a local add-on, localtuya, which does not rely on Tuya\'s IOT dev system.  This looks like it does work.

1654370725.0	04-Jun-2022 12:25:25	SmartLife app hangs on some devices on Galaxy S8 (Android); works perfectly on iPhone 10 (iOS)	swbrains	2	v4w3v6	smartlife	https://www.reddit.com/r/smartlife/comments/v4w3v6/smartlife_app_hangs_on_some_devices_on_galaxy_s8/	"I have a Galaxy S8 and loaded the SmartLife app.  I was able to add all my devices (mostly TreatLife swtiched) using the normal set button method and they work fine and do NOT show as offline in the app.

In the main view of SmartLife, it lists the devices with a ""power"" icon I can tap to turn each device on or off.  This works fine pretty much every time.

However, tapping a device's tile in the listing normally brings up a page for that device with additional options including scheduling, settings, etc.  On about half of my devices, this page hangs before it loads.  I can tap the tile for the device on the main page, the page clears (sometimes counts up to 99% quickly), then... nothing.    Some devices show an animated rotating circle but they don't display the device's page.  Most of the regular on/off switches load their device page quickly without issue.  The fan/light combo switches often hang while loading the device page (but work from the main page), and a couple of other devices like an outdoor plug are slow or hang while loading the device page.

I would normally say this is an issue with the compatibility of some of the devices, such as the fan/light combo switches that consistently have trouble loading the device page, but the interesting thing is that on my wife's iPhone 10, using the iOS version of the SmartLife app, the device pages load consistently quickly and properly, even for the fan/light combo switches.  She has mentioned that once or twice a page won't load, but overall it usually works fine for her.  Mine is the opposite.   It usually fails to load the page and rarely opens the device page properly.

We both connect to the 5 GHz wifi in our home, but I've also tried the 2.4 GHz wifi and it makes no difference on my phone's app -- it still hangs opening a device's page.

We have very strong wifi in the house, which is all one story and we have two access points at either end of the house with the router in the middle.  No other wireless devices have any issues streaming or with any other activity, so I believe our wifi is strong and working well.

I've also tried uninstalling and reinstalling SmartLife on my phone with no difference.

Any ideas why my S8 would have such issues with SmartLife, but only when drilling down into a single device's page?  Has anyone else experienced this type of issue with SmartLife?"	5	"[""swbrains: I finally figured out what caused this issue with the SmartLife app.\n\nI have an ASUS GT-AX11000 router with wifi turned on (both 2.4 and 5 GHz radios) with a guest SSID on both.  The smart devices connect to the 2.4 GHz guest network.  I also have two TP-LINK EAP225 access points which have the same SSIDs configured on each of them.  The issue only occurred when I had the 2.4 GHz guest SSID active on the access points.  If I disabled the 2.4 GHz guest SSID (same as router's), then the smart devices all connected directly to the router and worked fine in the app.\n\nAfter much trial and error, I found that Asus uses a VLAN with an ID of 501 for its 2.4 GHz guest networks, so I enabled the VLAN for the 2.4 GHz guest SSID on the APs and set their ID to 501.  Now the SmartLife app works perfectly and drills down into each device instantly, and I can leave the 2.4 GHz guest network enabled on the APs which allows each device to have a better connection (lower RSSI) than when they were each forced to connect to the router. \n\nIt also cleared up a strange issue I had with one switch that was part of a scene in the SmartLife app that would turn two smart plugs on or off when the switch was toggled (the two plugs were grouped and the switch scene manipulated the group).  Recently I had noticed that one of the switches (the same one) was always delayed turning on or off when toggling the switch.  After the VLAN configuration change on the APs, that problem no longer exists and both plugs toggle on or off instantly and simultaneously with the switch!\n\nSo ultimately it seems to have been an issue with using the TP-LINK EAP225 APs with my ASUS router along with using the same guest SSIDs as the router that caused the issue with my smart devices communicating consistently and quickly.  Telling the APs to use the same VLAN as the ASUS router for the guest SSIDs cleared everything up.\n\nHope this helps someone in the future!"", ""Angus-Black: I am having exactly the same issues on a Samsung A71 Android phone and a Lenovo Android tablet.\n\nThe app works fine on an iPhone 12, iOS 16.x.\n\nI don't have the same network router setup as you though.

This will force all of the smart devices to connect to only one router.  If the app responds normally, then it's likely an issue with the AP configuration with regard to how it works in conjunction with your primary router.  Since you don't use the guest network, you probably don't need to worry about setting up VLANs to match the main router.  But at least it would tell you if the issue is AP-related."", 'Angus-Black: Since my routers all have unique SSID\'s that wouldn\'t have worked.

With zero indication of what features and capabilities relate to which model (if any). None list any model names/numbers either, and all the vendors use the same copypasted image and text mess (even when the listing includes cheap, simpler models too). Only clue I've found is from the images, that some connect over ethernet while some don't. 

Is there any resources available where I can dig and filter out some useful information about these gateways, their specs and differences? Can't say the Tuya website was of much use either.

Im trying to understand the logic of the if then actions on smartlife.

1) If I have a simple automation for TIMER 1 say if Power is <400W DELAY 5mins, then TURN OFF x, DISABLE TIMER 1. Does the app trigger TIMER 1 several times during the 5min period (and sends several consecutive 5mins delays assume in that time POWER is less than 400W) if so on the first trigger after 5mins TIMER 1 is disabled does that mean all the other 5min delays are disabled?

2) if the initial condition above is already <400W does that even trigger, since theres not a change in status?

After the new network was up and running I had to reconnect all my smart devices (strip lights, in/out cameras). I ran into many problems. Some devices would install/connect successfully but then struggle to stay connected. Other devices would get halfway through the install process then fail. After a year of tinkering with smart devices and the Smart Home app, this was a new kind of behavior. 

I eventually got it working, after finding a tip on a small online forum. So I wanted to share that tip, just in case anyone else is going through a similar struggle. 

1. Go to the routers system manager - the routers IP address (commonly [192.168.1.254](http://192.168.1.254))
2. Go to 'Home Network' > 'Wifi' (nav menu) - *the 'Device Access Code' is needed to access this settings page. The code is listed on the router under the default network name and password.*
3. Click 'Advance Options' (link) 
4. Under the '2.4 GHz Wi-Fi Configuration' section, change 'Channel' value from 'Automatic' to '1'. 
5. (OPTIONAL) On the same 'Advance Options' page, under each SSID section, there's a setting for 'Maximum Clients'. I increased the 'Max Clients' for the SSID used by my smart devices (which is my guest network). The default was 10, a little short for the amount of smart devices I run (I really like strip lights). 
6. Save

There are ATT router configs that allow for an additional router (Firewall > IP Passthrough), however I could not get this to work. I probably needed to do additional configurations on my personal routers side. But at the time that was beyond my knowledge and patience.\n\nTwo weeks in and ATT has been way more reliable than my previous ISP, Xfinity (constant outages and throttling). Their equipment is also just as good as my personal equipment, which was a relief.\n\nI hope that helps."", 'swpete: Ok thanks!']"

My old UK light switches do not have a neutral wire, just live (red) and line (brown).

So in this scenario both the switch and the bulb need to be permanently powered. So I was thinking that instead of buying a switch that's designed to work without a neutral wire (which would cut power to the bulb when off), I could use a switch that requires a neutral wire and connect the live supply (red) to the live terminal on the switch and the line wire (brown) to the neutral terminal.

This would power the switch and bulb in series. The line terminal on the switch would not be required as the bulb would be controlled via the Smartlife app with 4 automations.

1: If switch on then turn bulb on.
2: If switch off then turn bulb off.
3: If bulb on then turn switch on.
4: If bulb off then turn switch off.

The thing I'm not sure about is using the original line (brown) wire as a neutral wire.

The bulb has to change from on to off for the trigger condition to be true.\n\nI don\'t know how often you have power outages for this to be a real concern and realistically, the simplest solution would be to use the built in option to be notified if a device goes offline.\n\nIf you really need an automated solution, I can offer a workaround.\n\nLet\'s say you want a light to turn on at 6pm and off at 7pm AND be able to work after a power outage you could use something like this...\n\nIf ANY condition true:\nSchedule time is 18:00\nSchedule time is 18:10\nSchedule time is 18:20\nSchedule time is 18:30\nSchedule time is 18:40\nSchedule time is 18:50\nThen:\nTurn bulb on\n\nYou would use a similar automation to turn the bulb off.\n\nHope this helps', 'Leather_Turnip3175: Yeah I also thought about this also.

Other bulbs and groups of other bulbs are in the list, but not those latest bulbs or groups created from those bulbs. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I tried the Tuya app instead.

I'm lost for options right now. Has anyone else encountered this issue with certain devices not showing up in the list when creating scenes ?

I have a Garage opener that works with Smartlife. It has a ""door status"" but it is not usable on scene.

So If i want to open my garage with a scene and that it is already opened, it will close it. It’s a bit annoying.

So I added a zigbee ""door sensor"". I tried to add this door sensor on the condition part of a scene. So when the scene is activated that gives ""if door sensor is closed then open garage then deactivate the scene"". Problem, it will trigger only if ""I close"" the sensor.

&#x200B;

To put it simply, I have several devices that hang every now and then and need to be automatically reset. All devices currently are plugged into tuya sockets and reset remotely via android app. I need a solution that:

&#x200B;

**- will ping an IP address in a loop, lets with a 5 min interval between addresses (for example** [**192.168.1.2**](https://192.168.1.2)**, wait 5 min,** [**192.168.1.3**](https://192.168.1.3)**, wait 5 min, ...** [**192.168.1.253**](https://192.168.1.253)**, and loop),  or a list of specified IP adresses**

**- if a device with a given IP address does not respond to the ping, it will send a command to the TUYA device assigned to this device to turn itself off and on**

**-wait \~10min**

**-continue pinging**

**- and so on and so forth for 24h/7**

&#x200B;

I was thinking of something simple like IF THIS THEN THAT (IFTTT), for example:

&#x200B;

**TUYA outlet 1,2,3... something:**

**-Ping IP address XYZ**

**-If there is an answer -> ping again**

**-If no response -> turn off and on -> wait 5-10min**

&#x200B;

and so on and so forth

Uploading other software, i.e. **tasmota**, to the tuya device is **out of the question**. At this point I am only able to use the HomeAssistant platform and android applications.

Which solution from your experience would be the best?

My biggest consumer is the heatpump water heater. I live in Portugal and grid electricity is almost half the price at night from 10pm until 8am. So I set the target temperature of the water boiler to 60 degrees Celsius from 10:05pm until 7:55am and outside of that timeframe to 50 degrees Celsius. The boiler will only turn on if the target temperature drops more than 5 degrees below target value. Since the tank is quite large (200 litres) and it's only a 2 person household, most days the water heater actually never even kicks in during daytime. This timer is in the control unit (which has no online connectivity and is very simple). Until now the only benefit of having the Smart Life plug is that I can monitor energy consumption, but it's always turned on and just running on the logic of the water heater control unit.

With the solar panels I'd like to switch the boiler on and off (even when power is cut off, it remembers the time and when switching the power back on it reverts to the last selected ON or OFF state) in a smart way based on weather data.

If the following day is sunny or just a bit cloudy, I'd like to not switch the water boiler on the night before and it should only switch on let's say 45 minutes after sunrise until 45 minutes before sunset. If the following day is very cloudy or rainy, I'd like to not switch on the boiler during the day but only the previous night between 10pm-8am for cheap grid power.

I've tried to look into creating scenes, but they can only take into account the present weather, and not forecast weather. Is there any way you are aware of to use smart plugs for this?

The hub is a short line of site distance from the bulbs but they show a bad signal strength before reading “no response” after about a minute.

After a short while the hub then disconnects from the network & then disconnects any devices connected to that homeplug’s Wi-Fi.

The two Zigbee PIR’s connected go from excellent signal strength to bad when the bulbs are powered on, even though they are right next to the hub.

Switching the homeplug’s Wi-Fi off doesn’t make any difference either.

They're not perfect every time, but usually if my lights are, say, pink, and I give the command to turn them all white, they'll all turn. I might have to say it again in case one or two bulbs don't quite catch on. 

But for the last few days, they've stopped obeying properly, but they're still functioning. I give a command to my Alexa to turn them red (set up with a routine), and they'll flash red for like a millisecond, but instantly revert back to whatever they were on before. So the command goes through, and they do the thing, but it's like something is getting caught. 

I have 3 on my ceiling fan, and only one of them performs properly now. I turn them all to white, and they'll all briefly turn white, but only that one will actually remain white. The other 2 will go right back to the previous color.

The weird thing is they all turn on and off properly in general. Turning them off works fine, and turning them on (supposed to default to all white) is wonky but still turns them all on. 

Note: Pressing the buttons in Smart Life or Alexa works just fine. The bulbs follow exact directions when done that way, so I don't think this is an internet issue, right? 

Also, I've already reset these bulbs and re-established all the routines.

Anyone have any idea what's going on here? It's messing with my morning routine because they're supposed to turn on all white when my final alarm goes off so I'm too bothered to fall back asleep

Since I had an extra smart light bulb available, I figured this would be pretty straightforward -- I set up two scenes like so:

(2) If bulb is switched ON, adjust color to warm white (Scene valid 4pm-6am)

This ... isn't working as I hoped.  I'm turning the bulb on/off using the physical knob, which means the bulb goes offline.  Unfortunately, turning the switch on doesn't always trigger the ""bulb switched ON"" event for whatever reason.

Why???	lcrosswe	7	thgjlv	smartlife	https://www.reddit.com/r/smartlife/comments/thgjlv/automation_with_switch_stopped_working_why/	"I have a Treatlife 3 way switch and 3 smart bulbs all connected in Smart Life. I have automation set up to turn all 3 bulbs on when the switch is powered on and turn them off when the switch is turned off. This has worked great for over a year. Last week it stopped working for some reason. There has not been a power failure recently and my internet connection has been strong. I cannot figure out any event that would cause this.  
I uninstalled the lights and switch from my Smart Life app and reinstalled them. Smart Life recognizes them all. I set up the automation again and it still doesn't work. Smart Life correctly reads when the switch is on and off. Smart Life can turn the lights on and off together without a problem. Only the automation is an issue.

I have some WiFi smart dimmer switches (Feit Electric brand from Costco) that I was using to wirelessly control some outdoor string lights via an automation upon pressing the switch (in addition to the indoor lights it was wired to control).

I've tried removing my switches from the network/app, resetting power by flipping the breaker, and recreating the automation in a bunch of different ways trying to figure out the problem. I also tried to add all of my smart devices to different forks of Tuya/Smart Life apps to see if it was just an app issue (it's not). \n\nNothing has worked yet, and I've learned that for some reason none of my switches can be used to trigger automations.

I was hoping my other smart plug could go ON/OFF with this, but no luck since it doesn't register OFFLINE as a trigger so it just stays ON.

Is there a different solution to this?"	2	"['AndyJBailey: Buy a Smartlife IR transmitter and create a tap-to-run that turns on both devices and another to turn both off.

When I first installed the light I added each bulb to the app, then created a group so I can set the colour/turn on/off/etc as a group or change each individually. Last night the group stopped responding in the app. Couldn't even get to the colour change option (though I still could through the google home app). I removed the group but am unable to add any devices to a new group.

I have tried completely removing and re-adding the bulbs to the app, making different groups... but I only have these three bulbs and I cannot group them at all. When I try and make them into a group if I add them all to a group the save button greys out, if I remove them all I can save but the group either isn't created (if all removed) or if I try and make a smaller group 1 or 2 bulbs the group contains no devices.

Any ideas?

Picked up 4 more (2 pack) of the BW904 B/W/Color bulbs. First 2 added fine. 3rd and 4th gave me a timeout adding. Took that box back and got another. Same issue. Grabbed an extra BW932 B/W I hadn't installed yet from a 3 pack, 2 of which installed fine. SAME ISSUE.

So I tinkered around for awhile, even tried to connect my phone directly to the bulb's WiFi during setup but the add device page won't load without internet. Then I switched back to my WiFi and tried again. While it was ""adding"" I went back to my WiFi settings on the phone to see if the BW932 WiFi was still showing, it wasn't, so it had already connected to my home. Then I accidentally tapped the screen and turned my WiFi off.  A few seconds later when it allowed me to turn it back on the bulb IMMEDIATELY finished adding and loaded the controls screen. 

So I grabbed the BW904, put it in pairing mode and started adding in Smart Life. As soon as the bulb stopped blinking I turned my phone's WiFi off then back on and BOOM the bulb immediately added! So this ongoing issue with suddenly being unable to add new devices has something to do with the devices WiFi, in my case a Galaxy S21 running Android 12 with the February 1 Security Update.

Somehow I was able to whoops my way into adding one but I can’t repeat the “mistake” on the other switch.

I’ve tried doing the manual fast blink mode and it continuously times out. I can’t seem to get the slow blinking AP mode (which is how I’m fairly certain I’ve added these previously.)

I’m open to any suggestions. Help?"	8	"[""GRRemlin: Usually when the pairing fails, for me, it means that I forgot to connect my phone (on which I am performing the pairing) to the 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi instead of 5Ghz.\n\nBut if you are already on 2.4Ghz, when the LED is blinking rapidly try holding the button on the switch again for 5 seconds, maybe it will switch to the AP mode.\n\nEdit: Also, make sure that your 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks have different names.

And after a lot of pain with setting up other aspects of my smart home, I did change my 5ghz network name. Made it a lot easier for all things.\n\nI’m wondering if I just am processing the steps wrong. If I get it correctly, it should go like this:\n\n1. Join the 2.4ghz network\n2. Launch the SmartLife app and go into pairing mode, in this case choosing a WiFi dimmer switch\n3. Turn the air gap switch to off for at least 10 seconds then turn back on\n4. Press down on the bottom part of the paddle five times quickly and then press and hold the paddle for five seconds until the lights turn blue and blink three times. Release the paddle after the lights stop flashing\n5. In the app, continue the process and begin pairing.\n\nThis is where anything stops working for me. The app just circles until it times out.\n\nWhen I try to go to AP mode, I can sometimes get there but I’ve only been able to see the SmartLife-xxx WiFi network once but I wasn’t able to join it.

I have 2 zigbee smart bulbs, same manufacturer, but there is a small issue in here:

\- One of the bulbs I can reset and connect without any issue, the other one never connects alone to the gateway ( a multimode tuya gateway )

Altought if the first bulb is paired then I am able to pair the second one, and everytime I check the connection it is connected like this:

Now if I check the connection to ""good"" one it is directly connected to the gateway.

This brings me some troubles, I would like to have them connected directly to the gateway!Note that the bulb2 is closer to the gateway than the bulb 1.... so the packets are doing the biggest way around..

&#x200B;

I already tried to reset the bulbs but nothing changes this behaviour, without bulb 1 I can't pair bulb 2 and I am never able to get a direct connection to gateway. Any expert here to help me out?

&#x200B;

EDIT: If i disconnect bult 1, I lose connection to bulb 2 aswell... as expected seeing how the connection is... and this is one of my biggest issues :/"	0	[]

It allows bluetooth devices to be controlled via wifi (or so I think).  You connect to it via the Smart Life app and is viewable in the Tuya IoT Platform as product 无线智能小网关（JMWZG1).

It appears to connect to bluetooth devices by pairing.  However, I want to use it on bluetooth devices that don't pair.  I can currently connect to those devices and control them via the bluetooth dongle on my raspberry pi, using the hcitool and gatttool commands.

Ultimately I won't be using the phone app to control the devices and will use Homebridge.  However, first I need the JMWZG1 device to be viewable as a bluetooth gateway on my linux machine.

Does anyone know of a way to do this?  The device has an IP address and I am assuming I should be able to connect to it via IP, and send it control commands for the bluetooth devices it pairs with.  I was hoping to attach the device as some sort of linux device so I can use hcitool and gatttool commands on it directly.   This would require some sort of driver but I don't know what that would be called.

Two are older ones and the other four are newer ones.

They all work flawlessly (except one of the newer ones) and will operate either through the Smartlife app or through Alexa. The problematic one is set to turn on a lamp at 1930 and off at 2200, however it turns the lamp on at 1630 and doesn't turn it off.

I can manually turn on or off the socket via Smartlife, Alexa app or voice command via Echo device. The socket will turn on or off if I run the associated routine in the Alexa app. I just can't get it to obey the set timer. 

I've tried resetting it by holding the power button for 10 seconds and re-pairing it with the Smartlife app, but when it comes back it has exactly the same name and the custom photo I set for it (without me editing it) - like it's holding on to the info somewhere, probably in the Smartlife Cloud.

I've tried running the timer in Smartlife only, and Alexa App only - neither solves it.

Is there any way to 100% factory reset the Teckin sockets, so the app etc will see it as a completely new device? Either that or any suggestions on how to get this stubborn thing to do as it's told?

Recently I got 5 Tuya Zigbee motion sensors (the square ones).  
I really like them because of their price and response time (when motion is detected within 0,5sec the light turns on).

However, I don't like the cooldown/retrigger time.  
If the sensors detects motion, it stays at motion detected for about 40 seconds before turning off again.  
And after that it takes about 15sec before it can detect motion again.

Is there a way to reduce those times?  
eg, cooldown time to 5 sec. and motion-detected to no-motion-detected to 10 sec.  
By software/firmware or hardwarechange?

ps. I have them connected to deCONZ Conbee 2 and that works great. and use that in OpenHAB3."	1	['internetcookiez: same here, let me know if you ever found a solution']

I've got a SONOFF Zigbee bridge that will sync up in eWeLink but not Smart Life (even though SL shows that it supports Zigbee Bridges).  Well, I bought a triple-button, wireless ""Scene Switch"" stick-on panel and it's advertised to work through SL with the Zigbee Bridge.  Well, my Sonoff bridge won't sync (under any option that I've tried) with Smart Life, rather will with eWeLink.  In  order to get my switch to work, it needs to be added under a Zigbee Bridge.  Is there any way to get this Zigbee Bridge to work in Smart Life -OR- any way to get this switch to be recognized in eWeLink?

The closest that I've gotten is opening my eWeLink app, get my bridge, add a device and when I press the button on the switch, it'll show ""1 device found"" > I click next and it just refreshes my lists of devices, minus the new one.  My 2.4ghz wifi seems to also be cutting off (and yes, I'm only using my 2.4 band to sync everything up).

Is there something that I'm missing here?  Am I going to have to buy a Zigbee hub that's made soley for Smart Life?  Could this be a straight up Router/Internet issue?

Pukit	4	rrbyxz	smartlife	https://www.reddit.com/r/smartlife/comments/rrbyxz/anyone_using_tuyamoessl_trv_radiator_valves/	"I’ve fitted a couple of these trvs to my rad valves, most of my property has Tado TRVs which run perfectly but I’m struggling with these. 

Several times I’ve come downstairs and found water under these valves. I think they put too much pressure on the trv valve bodies. 

Do these need to do their calibration once you’ve fitted them so they find their end points, or is there a button to make them do a calibration?

Any pointers would be good."	11	"['richardwonka: Water under the valves points at a mechanical failure in the valve, less at a problem with the valve controller. A controller shouldn’t be able to apply enough force to break the seal on a valve. \n\nI use the Moes controllers. Known issues here:\n\n- They’re picky about their power supply (don’t like rechargeable AAs, because of the lower voltage), \n- some of mine keep going into a locked state and I don’t know how to undo (other than holding the ‘-‘ button on the unit) or keep that from happening. \n- sometimes they don’t accept changes in settings right away. \n\nI got them cheap, but wouldn’t buy again. I’ll see if the power supply will accept a LiIon battery instead of two AAs.', ""phpfaber: I use Tuya TRVs from here [https://aliexpress.ru/item/1005001895935932.html?spm=a2g39.orderlist.0.0.1f204aa6qwiyKn](https://aliexpress.ru/item/1005001895935932.html?spm=a2g39.orderlist.0.0.1f204aa6qwiyKn) with Buderus radiators. Very happy with them in cooperation. Didn't like the original Buderus ones (just mechanical) at all."", ""Practical-Net7922: Sounds like you discovered how to pair these. I have 20 of them in a box, which I have not been able to use because I can't get them.to.pair. please can you explain to.me how to pair them? \n\nThank you- Rowan"", 'Pukit: I fitted the central heating in my house myself, all the rads had decent Drayton trvs fitted with compression fitting valves and lockshields. The Drayton trvs or lockshields or decorator caps for that matter, even when screwed fully down hasn’t resulted in a leak from the valve and functioned correctly. \n\nOnly when fitting the Tuya trv did it start doing so. Hence my question of whether they can be calibrated to find their end points so they don’t just keep screwing downwards. I’ve tried the Tado TRVs on the same rad and had no issue, so it’s a concern with this Tuya trv imo. \n\nThey are a right paint to pair and a bit of a faff to program. I’ve got a HA system running so use a separate temp sensor in the room to calibrate it but still don’t think much of them. \n\nI may just flog them on eBay and pony up for more Tado TRVs.', 'Pukit: What are you using to pair them, do you have a zigbee gateway and app or using an Amazon echo or HomeAssistant etc?\n\nTo put them into pairing mode I followed a video on YouTube as the instructions are very poor.\n\nSince one made a valve body leak I’ve reverted to using Tado since.', 'richardwonka: Huh. That’s unexpected, but really clearly seems  to be a controller issue, as you say. \n\nFwiw, I’ve not had trouble pairing them with my ZHA-based Homeassistant. Just using the stock integration. Apart from the above issues, they’re pretty nondescript using their built-in thermo sensors.', 'Pukit: Yea I was stupid tbh. I saw them mega cheap on the 11/11 sale and went for ten valves and a controller. When they pitched up I wasn’t thinking straight and started pairing them with the controller and SL app. It’s a right pita. Then my brain switched on and I used HA, I’ve got zigbee stuff all over the house and they paired fine with the integration and my Tasmota/Sonoff bridge. \n\nFor some reason I went into kid at Christmas mode with a new bit of kit and got stuck in with the controller. It’s since been unplugged and I just use HA. \n\nAlso in regards to batteries, my Tado TRVs go through a pair of AAs a year each but are much louder than the Tuya, they’ve been known to wake people up. In comparison the Tuya are basically silent which is nice. I’m not really fussed about replacing the batteries once a year, I just buy a big box of decent AAs and go round and do them all, save them whinging that they’re low. \n\nSo last question for you. \n\nWhen you fitted these valves, did you pair them first and then fit them, or fitted them to the rad valves, then put batteries in them and then paired them? \n\nSo my main reason is I know they self test when first powered on, should I have fitted them pre/post self test.', 'richardwonka: I attached them, then powered them on and paired them. Maybe that’s what makes the difference.', 'richardwonka: I’m wondering how i would be using a remote temperature sensor as a reference for these.. i have a tiny 5v circulator fan housing where the sensor would be perfect.', 'Pukit: There’s a couple of good threads on the HA support forum, if you google Tuya TRV HA calibration you’ll likely find blueprint for controlling the valve using a separate sensor that I’ve used. Mine is a bit of a mess but I’ve got it working in one room well but ran out of time pre Christmas to do the others. I may junk it all and go Tado anyhow if I can’t trust the Tuya valves. \n\nI use the cheapest zigbee Tuya or Sonoff temperature/humidity sensors on aliexpress and have them stuck to walls or on book cases etc all around the house. They pair really well with HA and send frequent updates. \n\nI’ve adjust the Tado valves with a negative offset, which is about right for when the Tuya temp sensor reads 20deg C the Tado valve reads the same. When the sensor reads about 16deg though and the rad isn’t on the Tado valve reads about 11deg. The difference is due to the proximity of the trv to the radiator. I’ve even fitted longer rad tails to take them away from the rad but it didn’t make a lot of difference. \n\nSo that’s why I’m playing about with blueprints and external sensors.', 'richardwonka: Thank you for the insights! 🙂']"

I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post in, so I apologize.  Reddit has been so helpful with my projects that I figured, why not try again.  I'll attempt to make this quick.

I have a Yamaha RX-V520 stereo receiver that I bought back in probably 2008 ish.  It does not have Bluetooth or WiFi capabilities, but otherwise works.  I lost the remote for it.  While looking for a remote replacement, I came across [this Smart WiFi-IR remote](https://www.amazon.com/Smart-WiFi-IR-Remote-Control-Universal-Hub/dp/B08HLTQB97/ref=asc_df_B08HLTQB97/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459579282194&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15275677019877321070&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9016243&hvtargid=pla-1159944454032&psc=1).  I'm thinking this solves my problem, but wanted to run past you all my understanding of how it works, to make sure that I'm thinking about this correctly.

I buy the Smart WiFi-IR remote.  I plug in the Smart WiFi-IR remote and connect it to my wireless network.  I download onto my Galaxy A50 cell phone an app, which seems to be either Smart Life or Tuya Smart.  I then pair the Yamaha stereo receiver with the Smart WiFi-IR remote (presumably with the assistance of the app).  Then I use the app to control my stereo receiver by way of my phone sending the instructions to the Smart WiFI-IR remote via my wireless network and then the Smart WiFi-IR remote forwarding the instruction to the stereo receiver via IR.  

My questions are thus:

* Am I correct in assuming my Yamaha RX-V520 stereo receiver received instructions from the remote control (which I lost) by way of IR?
* Is my above simplistic explanation of the process correct? 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and maybe even help me out.  I hope you have a good one."	0	[]

Smooth transitions like you want would have to be on the light itself for support. In normal use, you use the app to send a command, it goes to your nearest tuya service on the internet, and then the light gets that update. This takes time--how long between choosing to turn a light on does it actually turn on? Now, for transitions you'd need to sent lots of these commands.

I have set an automation that if the camera detects motion, it will turn on the light and the camera starts recording. This automation works OK but my problem is with the camera. I created this automation because of an issue described below.

At night with no ambient light, the camera is on night vision which is OK. but as soon as it detects motion, it goes out of night vision which impairs its visibility. It takes a second or two to turn on the outdoor light automatically. If someone is to disable the outdoor lights or the outdoor light malfunctioned, my camera wont see anything once it detects movement. Has anyone ran across this issue?"	0	[]

The issue I'm having, however, is with my smoke detectors.

I have linked two smoke detectors to the app. When I open the app, SL can see both and give me a status update on both. If the app is open and I test the smoke alarms, the app alarm will sound and tell me which room the alarm is going off in.

The issue is, if I test the smoke detectors without first opening the app, no alarm sounds. Now, presumably, that's because the app is sleeping, or something, but as far as I can tell, I've been through the steps they give to ensure the app doesn't sleep, but obviously I'm missing something.

The app itself is up-to-date, and I'm using a Samsung Note20 Ultra. If anyone has any experience with keeping the app awake at all times, and knows of something I can try to make sure it doesn't sleep, I'd be very grateful. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!"	0	[]

What are you doing for the security of your network / privacy with all these iot devices? I feel like the list of devices is endless online.

&#x200B;

Here is what I am considering and I'd LOVE your feedback (All I ask is that its constructive to help me and others);

1. Dedicated vlan / ssid for smart devices. (So someone bad can't extract my traffic usage from main devices in the house if an iot device is compromised)
2. Bandwidth limit the vlan to 3% of my throughput (so even if a device/s is/are ""botted"" or ""hacked"" they aren't maxing my line until I identify what's going on.)
3. Set notifications or graphs for usage. (So I can identify which devices are causing issue)
4. Set up a ""pihole"" dns server on a separate network and have all TCP / UDP Port 53 DNS traffic sent there whether destined for it or not (So that i can log all dns requests. This may or may not work well due to DNS over HTTPS.)
5. Try to disable VPN on iot vlan (Stop a direct channel from outside back into my network. I know some internet providers just have a tick box inside their router but i'll try to figure out if its possible on mine. Either way may not be 100% accurate but could help?)
6. Figure out the IP addresses that the iot devices are connecting too for smartlife and start creating a whitelist once it seems to be built well, region block traffic outside of the whitelist. (If it stops working, rinse and repeat)
7. Going into each smart device in SmartLife and selecting auto update.

I cant help but be a little paranoid. Compared to others I'd say I am just touching the surface of my smart home journey, I want to start it correctly with good security and configuration.

I bought four smart outlets from Nova digital, they recommended the Smart Life app. Installed it, connected the outlets and they worked just fine. Then, enabled the Smart Life skill in Alexa and it worked just fine as well. So I set up a routine in Alexa to turn them on and off at predetermined times.

Everything was working great, until I bought a new mesh network dual band router. I'm using only one router since coverage is enough so far. Problem is, Alexa is now having intermittent problems controlling the outlets.

I have reconnected all the outlets to the new router, and it even correctly connected them via 2.4 Ghz instead of 5 Ghz. Smart Life detected them all just fine and it works flawlessly always, but Alexa sometimes cannot enable or disable some of the outlets. What's weird is that even though Alexa couldn't control the outlet, it will still display its status correctly.

I have tried logging off and on from the Smart Life app, tried deauthorizing and reauthorizing the Alexa account and the skill, but im still having issues. I have also tried deleting the devices from Alexa, renaming them and readding them to but no luck. Any ideas?

I have just bought a door sensor for our kitchen door, as the door gets used quite a lot when we’re at home, my phone is constantly buzzing as I have set up to receive a notification when it does.

I have been trying to find away within the smartlife app to receive notifications if the doors is open, when I am not at home, but I can’t seem to find away. I thoughI had amazed to a couple of times, but my phone just keeps buzzing when I’m at home.

Its a standard but not there no homekit/zwave approval process so many vendors have tinkered with it to make their devices only compatible with their hub.

I have quite a few devices on it and, being someone who loves to customize everything, I made icons for each device so that it all looks good on the widget and everything is easily identifiable.

However, I've tried to add a new smart bulb today and the option to change the icon is no longer there.

I also added a smart plug, from the same pack as other smart plugs I have, but again, there is no option to set the icon, only the name and the location.

The other smart plugs from the same pack did allow me to change the icon.

I tested this again with another plug from the same pack just now, and nope, the icon setting is not there.

Foolishly, I thought maybe it had reached a limit of devices with custom icons, so I reset the icon of another smart plug back to its default, and now it won't let me change it back again!

I have Smart Life on my iPhone Xs Max, as well as my old iPhone 6 Max (which I just keep by my bed for podcasts and such), and this is happening on both devices.

Has anyone else had this problem whereby the option to set custom icons is now missing for newly added devices but is still present for devices added previously?

SetAffectionate8162	2	qyswkq	smartlife	https://www.reddit.com/r/smartlife/comments/qyswkq/does_virgin_media_dislike_smartlife_in_the_uk/	"Wondering if anyone else has experienced this and found a workaround. I have several plugs, bulbs thermostats all connected to my home setup. In recent weeks I have noticed that it can take an age to open any of the devices from the app on my phone (20 seconds plus). 

I had assumed it was my phone slowing down with old age but noticed when I accessed the app from another WIFI network in my office it was lightening quick again on the same phone. After a bit of experimentation I found the same behavior on another phone as well (so I know its not my phone at fault). Even turning off Wifi and just using the cellular network gives instant performance despite a connection speed a fraction of my home internet.  My home internet is 200mbs, cellular connection via the EE network  is 4/5mbs. I use Virgin media to access the web, that is connected in modem mode to ASUS Aimesh setup to broadcast Wifi across my home.

However, we currently just have standard lightswitches on the wall - obviously if someone turns them off at the wall, they won't respond to voice commands so we would like to replace them.

Any recommendations for particular switches - and how do they work. Is it at an electrical level, or are there switches that you 'pair' with the bulbs (we'd want one switch to control two or more bulbs) and send the commands via automation?"	2	"[""sc0rp10n101: This could be tricky and very much depends on if you have a neutral wire. If you're in the UK then this tends to not be the case, however I've heard there are light switches out there that are compatible with UK wiring.\n\nThe issue, in your situation, is that you tend to either have one or the other, as in, use smart bulbs with a dumb switch or use a smart switch with dumb bulbs, if that makes sense. As you've found already, smart bulbs render the dumb switch that controls them useless (OR the other way around if someone turns the light switch off) and to some degree a smart switch would render the smart bulbs it controls somewhat useless too. It doesn't tend to be the case where you use both wired to the same circuit.\n\nWhat I have installed in my daughters bedroom is a smartlife switch. This then works with the smart life app to control a device or devices of your choosing or also run automations etc. It essentially becomes the light switch. Here's a link to a video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5S9BDX-d-Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5S9BDX-d-Y)\n\nIt is pretty good. So it has 4 switches but you can program in double taps, long holds etc etc so it can do all kinds. So you can press one button to turn a smart light bulb on or off. Double tap to lower the brightness, or long hold to increase the brightness. Then have a different button to run an automation and so on.  \n\n\nEdit - Sorry, I just re-read your post and see you are planning on replacing the bulbs themselves. Much of the above might be irrelevant to you. Hopefully you find a solution. I'd be keen to find something similar myself."", ""Rihinoldn: If you have bulbs you like, and are fine controlling them with your voice, and just want to prevent people from accidentally turning off the switch, look into something like this:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Option-Switch-Guards-Clear-Toggle/dp/B00DTXKOTM?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Option-Switch-Guards-Clear-Toggle/dp/B00DTXKOTM?th=1)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Option-Switch-Guards-Clear-Rocker/dp/B00DUBOSTA?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Option-Switch-Guards-Clear-Rocker/dp/B00DUBOSTA?th=1)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Switch-Guards-ILIVABLE-Switches/dp/B08J6HF9T6](https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Switch-Guards-ILIVABLE-Switches/dp/B08J6HF9T6)\n\nThere's lots of options out there.

I tried naming the new wifi with the same configs as the old one, but no connection. I disabled 5 Ghz on the router, still nothing. I tried other apps, still nothing.
