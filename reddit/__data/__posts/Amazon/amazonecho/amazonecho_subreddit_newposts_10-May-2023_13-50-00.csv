Recently Spotify no longer switches back to the iphone automatically after previously playing on one of my echos.

Today I bought two Echo Dots (5th gen).

The idea was to have these two Dots in the kids' rooms and then use the Drop In feature to chat whilst we play video games online together.

The problem is the volume coming from the Dots.

If I speak through the Show, then the kids can hear me fine upstairs through their Dots.

If they speak to me, their voices are very quiet.

If they speak to each other, their voices are very quiet.

Even if I have the volume up all the way on the Show, it's still a bit of a struggle to hear them, especially when playing the game.

The devices are all about 30cm away from us.

This leads me to suspect that the Dots' microphones are doing as good a job as the Show's. But from what I've read, the Show should have more microphones than the Dots?

I went on chat and the guy asked me to follow a procedure but it made no difference and then he seemed to give up entirely.

We've tried using our smartphones on speaker using WhatsApp to make a group call and the volume was fantastic with that, if anything, a bit too loud.

But ideally wanted something ""hardwired"" rather than using phones.

Should I try getting two Shows instead of the Dots? Are the microphones better in the Show? 

Thanks for any advice."	6	"['sirbearus: Try muting the microphone on one and see what happens.

Yes they're far enough apart not to be listening to each other, as long as the volume is reasonable anyway.\n\nWhen they're on full volume I can hear myself coming from upstairs but when I have the Show in full volume I get slightly above a whisper.\n\nI thought that maybe the Dots were picking up the sound from the video game and dimming it but it didn't matter if we had the sound on or off, the voice was still quiet.\n\nPerhaps I should have checked to see if the noise improved when making a call rather than using the drop in function. But then the Show seemed to be passing on a decent volume level and that was in drop in mode as well.\n\nI'm starting to think I'll just take them back and maybe try two Show 5's and see if that's any better."", 'Separate-Effective77: I think the other post was about the two dots being to close together, not the show and dots.', ""FlibV1: Thanks, the Dots were in separate bedrooms with a bathroom in between.\n\nAlthough even from downstairs I could hear my voice coming through their speakers if they turned it right up, but on max volume on mine, I got barely an audible voice coming through.\n\nI've returned them now though and ordered two Show 5's.\n\nHopefully they work better.""]"

 By [Otter ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEH3MNPMDAESNHQU3T4TYGGBGM4Q/ref=ask_dp_lswr_pp_hza)in the United States on January 11, 2023Amazon recently started showing ads on their Echo Show devices. I contacted support about how to turn these ads off and was told that basically you can't: ""this will be fix soon"" and ""We always trying to make the things which is beneficial to our customer"" (their grammatical errors, not mine). I find it a bit hard to believe that the software engineering powerhouse of Amazon takes weeks to figure out how to provide an option to turn off these ads. Didn't it occur to them that forcing ads on long time customers might be poorly received?  
I even received an ad on an Echo Dot in the form of a ""Notification"".  
There have been extensive improvements to both Apple HomeKit (for Apple devices) and Google Home (for Android devices) in the pats year, so I am migrating to HomeKit since I have other Apple products. I will be systematically removing my Echo devices. I need many fewer Apple HomePods to cover my home since any Apple device can accept voice commands. Also Apple's Shortcuts and Automations are far more powerful than Alexa's Routines.  
Amazon has successfully pissed off this long time user of Echo devices so that I will never buy another Echo or other smarthome Amazon device.

Yes -  
There are two options that I know of:  
1. set a routine that keeps turning on photo frame which will then eliminate the adds because photo frame is always running - at least most of the time- it runs for 3 hour blocks so you need to set your rountines accordingly.  


2. trade in your shows for the new echo five dot which actually provides really good sound (this is what I did).  


It is highly disappointing that amazon has decided to put adds on all of their screen devices. I am a prime member, subscribe to amazon music premium and spend a silly amount on their other products. I used to highly recommend all amazon devices because even if they came out glitchy, amazon normally did a great job fixing the issues (and fast). However, since this add push is getting more and more obtrusive, I have been pulling away from amazon. We are inundated with adds every where, but to force adds on products even when you are not using the produce like the shows or fire tvs (screen saver now shows full screen adds) that are in every room of the house is simply not appropriate and is bad innovation for the sake of profit. They are going to lose customers because of this. guaranteed.

But, it sounds like that TV is not compatible with echo home theater which I don't understand. The TV has eARC. I thought that was what was needed in order to use the sub and echo studios as a 2.1 sound system.

What am I missing here? Is the echo home theater only compatible with the Amazon branded fire tvs, but nothing else?

So if that's the case, what are my options? Is there any way to use these studios + sub as a home theater system? What if I hook them up using the optical audio cable, would that work? Would I have to connect them both or could I connect only one and have it pair wirelessly with the other and the sub?

I think I could get a fire tv 4k max and make it work through that device, but the TV already has fire tv on it so I'd rather not spend the money on another box.

DeerFucked	0	136edvx	amazonecho	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/136edvx/about_to_give_up_on_my_echo_dot_gen_2_any_tips_or/	"I've had a Dot Gen 2 for about a year and have found myself using it less and less. My main problems are these:

1) I can't seem to natively control the echo speaking volume separately from media volume. So if I'm watching a movie or listening to music at volume 5, and Alexa decides to chime in, her voice is loud enough to make my neighbors think I'm deranged at 2am. I would ideally like to permanently keep Alexa volume at 1 or less, while controlling media volume separately. It's honestly a bit traumatizing to have her yell-speak at me all the time.

2) Alexa talks so fucking much. I don't want to hear your suggestions. I don't want you to tell me you're connecting to this or that device. I don't want to hear random loud dings and beeps in the middle of the night. I just discovered ""Alexa, be brief"", so hopefully this works. 

3) Echo to PC connection is finnicky and sometimes just works, while other times I have to reset the echo, reset the bluetooth connection (which sometimes fails), and generally just mess around with everything to get it to work. 

4) The app is garbage.

Any tips or tricks regarding the Echo and/or the app are appreciated, thanks."	2	"['brantome24: 1. Not possible but probably one of the oldest feature requests.\n\n2. Re connection to a Bluetooth device, not possible as it’s confirming a connection so you know it’s not connected to something different. The dings etc might well be it re establishing a connection after a break - best unpairing any Bluetooth devices to stop automatic reconnection. Brief mode will make Alexa less verbose, but not entirely. To cut down on suggestions, ask “Alexa, stop by the way” which will suspend them for a period. Also, in the Alexa app, go to Notifications and turn off as many as you want.\n\n3. Get a PC speaker, or a better pc Bluetooth implementation.\n\n4. The app is there to help configure Alexa and devices - your echo is a voice assistant so really, once configured, you should have little need for the app.\n\nYou might want to check if the firmware is up to date by asking “Alexa, is there an update?” and perhaps even deregister the echo under its device settings in the Alexa app and set it up afresh.\n\nIt should also be noted that the gen 2 Dot is pretty old by Alexa standards so you shouldn’t perhaps expect too much of it. Mine still works ok feeding an amp in my summerhouse though…', ""DeerFucked: It's a shame about the volume controls, it really doesn't seem that difficult to implement. I'm using the two voice commands now, hopefully it's not something I'll have to tell alexa everyday. \n\nRegarding using it as a speaker, I'm trying to consolidate and minimize as many things in my workspace as possible. I figured two birds one stone. I may look into the newer generation, larger ones then. Bluetooth-wise I'm using a brand new z690 motherboard that's been working flawlessly with my airpods, iphone, and nintendo pro controller, it seems to be only the echo that has trouble.

Plain old Amazon Music has been ""good enough"" for years - I can live without a larger library.

6 months ago I took out a trial subscription to Music Unlimited for peanuts and enjoyed having a larger music library and no constant plugs for Unlimited.  Yesterday that trial ended, and I reverted to Amazon Music...  Except I didn't - I've returned to some dystopian shadow of what Amazon Music used to be, where *maybe* Alexa plays the song I asked for, but then continues to shuffle ""similar"" music that I definitely didn't ask for.

I looked back through the sub, and I can see I've missed a lot of drama re. this change at about the time I blindly switched to Unlimited.  However, it's not clear what the current status us.  Am I correct in thinking that the only way around the ""shuffle"" function is to upgrade to Unlimited, or is there some setting or trick I can use?

I read that I can turn off autoplay, which I did and can't see that it's made any difference at all - to be honest I'm not even sure what that is.

Not throwing my toys here, but I will likely just swap my Prime subscription for Spotify if there's no other way around this.  Whilst the free delivery is nice, I see Prime as a ""good enough"" music service with the bonus of free delivery and don't really use any of the other benefits.

Sometimes it'll take 10-20 tries before she finally plays something (she'll play half a second of music and then stop.) It's incredibly annoying considering I listen to music daily and **love** having multi room speakers.

I've found that if I close the Spotify app on my phone and then tell Alexa to play Spotify, it works more than half the time. Then once she's playing, I can open it on my phone and control it. It's still not perfect but it's so much more reliable. I half suspect that a couple of my devices are messed up and the root cause of the issues but I'm not about to fork over $80 to replace them with how god-awful Alexa has been for me recently. 

I need to do more troubleshooting like unplugging the suspected faulty echos and trying my everywhere playlist, but I haven't gotten around to that yet."	4	"['rmalbers: If you really want multi room music, etc. to work well you need to spend the money on sonos stuff.', ""besureto-: I'm having the same problem and nothing will stream (I mostly use TuneIn).

I am wanting to connect my Echo Studio and Echo Dot to a Verizon 5G Gateway.  Alexa app pairs with the Echo Studio unit over Bluetooth and sees the Verizon Gateway.  It fails after I enter the WI-FI password.  It doesn't give me a reason or error that I can see.  My phone and PC work fine with the Verizon Gateway.

Is this because I don't have a network WIFI switch/router between the Verizon Gateway and Echo?  If so, is there a specific requirement for the switch or will a decent Netgear or name brand network switch work okay?

Thanks for any advice.

I'm in a bit of a pickle with my Amazon Echo Spot. I've had it for a few years but haven't used it in a while. Recently, I decided to dust it off and give it another go. However, after resetting it fully, every time I say ""Alexa,"" it responds with ""Sorry, something went wrong."" I've tried unplugging and plugging it back in three times, but still no luck. 

On top of that, when I try to add photos from my phone, the app keeps telling me to update the Echo Spot, even though it says that it's already up to date. I'm starting to think that these issues might be related. 

Has anyone else experienced this problem? If so, how did you resolve it?

HBO MAX, ESPN, and actually most. Only Netflix and Youtube are the ones that work as it always has. Those particular apps are also slow on my android as well. I have also seen those same apps work slowly on a different house.

Netflix and YouTube usually default to adjust the quality based on the available internet speed, meaning that if your internet is slower than usual it will slightly drop the quality to keep the stream playing smoothly (it’s usually not noticeable, tbh). Most other platforms, otoh (Crave/HBO, Prime, etc.) will stop the stream and buffer rather than dropping the resolution, which is why they can be most finicky. We often switch to Netflix on days when our internet is acting up for this exact reason. \n\nAll to say that I would bet it is either a wifi signal or ISP issue. You might have some luck reducing the resolution on your other apps as a short-term solution until you can get it resolved with your ISO, and I would run some tests / make sure nothing else is drawing from your internet connection (eg. a neighbour, downloads, devices or phones syncing large amounts of data, etc.). OneDrive is always a big culprit in our house if I’ve been WFH on large documents/presentations or saving a lot of photos.']

I traveled home to visit with her in person as often as I could but had moved out of state for work and I knew we wouldn't have too many more years left with my beloved grandmother who had lived a truly remarkable and fascinating life. She had so many fascinating stories and for years everyone in my family would always say how we needed to get my grandmother a small tape recorder or something so that we could capture and preserve her priceless narratives of our family history and in the early / mid-2000s I did actually buy a little micro-cassette type tape recorder for her to use and tried many times to show her how to use it but it just was too much for her and wasn't intuitive enough for her and so I'm sure it eventually just ended up in some junk drawer somewhere. When Alexa/Echo Dots finally  came around I immediately thought that it would be perfect for my grandmother and that she could not only use it for music and to communicate with us but also thought it might be a great way to finally be able to capture so many of my grandmother's incredible stories. I bought my grandmother an Echo Dot and set it up in her apartment and spent a good amount of time with her showing her how to use it and making sure she felt comfortable using it and she indeed did. I showed her how she could speak to it and tell it to send me a message and asked her to please share her wonderful stories with us this way and she found it a lot of fun to use and so for the final six months or so of her life she would typically spend a few hours each week talking to Alexa and sharing these priceless bits of family history and personal insight with us via Alexa messages. It was really wonderful to have these priceless messages especially of course after she did eventually pass away in 2018 and being able to hear her stories and her voice was just so incredibly wonderful.  \n\n\n\nWell... one day I had some issues with my own Alexa communications/calling profile and so I called Amazon support and was eventually told by the representative that they needed to reset my Alexa communications profile to fix the problem. I immediately told them that if this meant that I would lose my saved Alexa messages that this would absolutely not be an option and told them about my grandmother's priceless messages and told them 20 times not to do anything that would result in the loss of those messages. They reassured me multiple times that it would not affect these messages and that they were saved forever and that they were backed up in the cloud as well in case of some emergency.  And then without even asking my permission this person just went right on ahead and reset my stupid profile. No warning, no confirmation, nothing. Well of course, everything was instantly forever gone... every fucking message my grandmother had spent hours each week over the final months of her life pouring out her heart and history to share with us - completely gone in an instant. The whole thing about there being cloud backups available was just a total fucking lie. I was in tears, my whole family was in tears... for days, weeks whenever this topic came up.  The Amazon representative apologized profusely and promised they would work with some stupid team somewhere to retrieve the data and that it existed somewhere on the cloud and not to worry blah blah blah. But of course, fucking lies. Just like how they always say they'll call you back with a follow-up call for a tech support request from Amazon but they never fucking ever do, they didn't even bother to call back on the time and date when they said they would. I called countless times and was just given the runaround and eventually someone confirmed that there was no way at all that any of these priceless fucking messages would be recoverable.

First why are they set up under just your account? Each person should have their own account. This can and will cause a lot of confusion. If someone other than one of your brothers calls you from an alexa device, they will ALL ring. Your amazon deliveries will show up on all devices. If you add something like an alexa enabled doorbell, your doorbell will ring all 3 houses.\n\nSet up each device under each individual person. This way you can day ""alexa call john"". And she will know who to call. \n\nAlso each of you needs to go into your app and pick each other\'s names from your contact list and hit ""allow drop in"". This will enable the ""drop in on loved ones"" feature. You will be able to drop in on their device at any time. There are obviously some privacy concerns here and why it is not enabled by default. You only do it with people you trust. Even if someone does drop in though you will be notified by a sound and the camera will be blurred out for 15 seconds.\n\nCreating an occupancy routine to alert you when they are home seems like overkill. I wouldn\'t want a verbal notification every time my parents walked past their echo. But since I have we each have allowed drop in I get a card on my device that scrolls past telling me who is home. It\'s jjst a visual card that say ""drop in on loved ones"" and shows the names of who is home. There is also a little icon in the top right hand corner of the screen that I can tap at any time to tell me who is at home. \n\nBut also if each person has the app on their phone like they should a lot of this won\'t matter because if the person isn\'t home and you say ""alexa call john"" he\'s echo device will ring as well as his phone.

My wife wasn’t home when I set it up so I used my Amazon account, but her’s is the primary one we use and the one our firestick is registered to. 

I can’t for the life of me figure out how to use both of our accounts for the echo. I was able to “add” her but it’s just her name, not her account. I tried setting up a household account but as far as I can tell it didn’t do anything. I tried to pair one of the echos with her Alexa account and it just kicked it off of my account. The only solution I found was her logging into my account on her Alexa app to be able to use the echos.

For years I have been able to make video calls to all Echo Show devices in two homes. As of this week I can no longer do that. I have two homes in two countries with all Shows linked to the same account, and I used to just say ""Alexa call Bob Smith"" (not the real name) and every Show device in both homes would announce the video call and it could be answered on any of those devices. It is how my wife and I keep in touch when we are not in the same country. My wife could also call me by using my name. Now, when I announce ""Call Bob Smith"" the Show device still says ""Calling Bob Smith's Alexa device"", as always, but a second later emits a beep and nothing happens. I've tri d It on several devices. I can still call individual Show devices using the ""communicate>call"" option on a Show screen or with the Alexa app on my iPad. And I can use the drop-in feature to contact a specific device. But neither is as convenient as having all devices (4 each home) announce the call because that way the announcement can be heard and answered in any room where an Echo Show is located.

WiFi in particular seems to get more and more flakey. I've two Echo Dots (2^nd and 3^rd gen) connected to a FritzBox, the 2^nd gen one via a powerline bridge (Fritz Powerline 1260, meshed) and the 3^rd gen one connected directly to the router's WiFi. There's also an EchoPlus connected to the router WiFi, a kindle Paperwhite and a FireTV Box (1^st gen) with a wired connection. 

Regularly, the Dots seem to lose connection to the WiFi responding with a red ring on speaking the command word and declaring that they are not connected to the WiFi. Most of the time both are gone, if the powerline fails, it's usually only the one connected to that, so I'd view that as a different problem.

A power cycle of the dot will fix this immediately - until the connection is lost again after a few hours. Strangely enough, if spotify is streaming through a Dot it (the Dot) will lose functionality and become non-responsive to voice commands though the stream keeps on playing just fine. 

The EchoPlus apparently does not have the same problem. It usually remains online.

The FritzBox WiFi has both frequency channels (2,4 and 5 MHz) activated and is using auto channel selection. SSID/pw is identical for 2,4 and 5 networks. WPA2 encryption. 

Anyone know what might be causing this? 

On another note; even though I've my time zone set to ""CEST (Berlin)"", I've noticed a lot of repeated queries to 0.north-america.pool.ntp.org coming from all the Amazon devices in my household. It's more of an annoyance but I'd like them to use a server closer to where they're at to cut down on unnecessary traffic. Is there any way to tell them to use a different server (the FritzBox even serves ntp locally, so there is hardly any need to use an outside one, but I'm suspecting this is hardwired."	6	"['Benji2108: Havnet had any issues with mine for years.

The Amazon thermostat seems to run until it's hit its set point then turns off.  And then 10, 15 minutes later, runs again.  It's constantly turning on and off which has to be harder on the system than running longer.

Am I missing something, or there some way to tweak this?  I've tried AC mode, I've tried Auto mode.

What's your experience been?	mtichbon86	15	12t6ffn	amazonecho	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/12t6ffn/anyone_moved_to_echo_devices_from_google_setups/	"I've got Google home devices all over my house - a Nest Hub Max in the lounge, Nest Audios in the two family rooms, and minis in bedrooms. However, I'm getting increasingly annoyed with them: they often mis-hear my when I'm standing right next to them or just completely fail to act on commands; speaker groups fall out of sync with the radio (though not Spotify) resulting in weird, echoey sound; there's a massive delay for anything to do with smart home controls like lights or heating.

As such, I've been thinking of moving over to Echo devices and wondered if anyone here has made a similar move in the last 6-12 months, what their reasons were for changing, and how they've found the ecosystem compared to Google's.

Things I like that seem appealing with Echo devices: custom skills; better sound quality of the speakers; the drop-in feature (seems much better than Google's all-speaker broadcast); the speed of Alexa in controlling smart home (tested this with the Alexa app on my phone and it's muuuch faster than Google assistant).

Things I'm wary of: having the same level of control over my next thermostat; finding a way to show my family phots in the lounge as my wife and I share a Google photos album and use the Nest Hub max as a photoframe - from what I've tested, Amazon Photos is not great compared to Google Photos.

Any insights people can give would be really appreciated, thanks!"	24	"['itwentanotherway: I have six Alexa devices and four Google home devices.

I am looking for some suggestions to make Alexa room-aware. Let me explain.

I have 3 rooms, with similar types of devices in them viz. fans, lights, ACs. All of them have similar names e.g. living room fan/AC, bedroom fan/AC, study room fan/AC.

Let's say I am in the living room and I say ""switch on the fan"", Google's Nest devices easily understand that I want to switch on the fan in the room I am currently in.

But Amazon's Echo devices say something ""A few things share the name fan. Which one did you want?"". That seems quite ""dumb"" to me, for a ""smart"" home assistant.

Is there a way to make Alexa understand the room context? Or run routines for a specific device? I just want the same ""room aware command execution"" feature like Google's Nest device."	26	"['brantome24: Alexa will do that for lights if you have an echo in that group. Some have said it also does it for tvs,  but I haven’t experienced that personally as I only have a tv in one room, and I suspect in that case it’s more to do with echos being linked to fire tv devices than being room aware.\n\nI agree, it would be useful for Alexa to extend that for all device types but I haven’t seen any sign of that', 'thatweirdishguy: Currently that’s only supported natively for lights.  If you have a room setup in the Alexa app that includes one or more lights and an echo then you can just say “Alexa, turn in the lights” and it will work(as long as the echo in that room is the one that hears your command).  Unfortunately they’ve never bothered to make that work for any other use cases.\n\nSome home automation platforms have hacky ways to try and emulate this. Home Assistant, for example, has a plug-in that can setup a sensor that tells you which echo most recently heard a command. It’s kludgy, slow, and not very reliable, but it’s the best you can really do with the limited capabilities the echo exposes.', 'deathboyuk: Although contrary to what others are saying, I was under the impression that if you assign the items to a room, you CAN say ""turn off lounge"" and it all goes down.\n\nI personally use a single smart plug in each room that goes to an 8-gang plug board for ""things that should go on/off"" and a second set of things that should never turn off - like the Alexa in the room!)\n\nThis setup works great for my whole house and also (during the energy crisis) lets me see how much power is being used in the main group for each room, so I can be even more careful to turn things off!

Please prove me wrong!!	btadams1971	13	12r386r	amazonecho	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/12r386r/my_amazon_smart_home_frustration_just_hit_its/	"I think I just drew the last straw buying an HD Fire Tablet to use as an echo device/dashboard. I just purchased the worst of Amazon products it feels like, Iwas hoping for something I’m realizing Amazon doesn’t care about. Customization and customer satisfaction. Please, please prove me wrong. I can’t be having all of these issues, it doesn’t make sense. What am I missing? The potential is amazing, but such a need for control by Amazon is ridiculous. Please change my mind!! I have googled these questions, searched this group, and gone through every setting. 

Little things on tablet:
- I can’t turn off search bar taking up home screen. 
- I can’t delete Amazon apps on home screen “home” section. 
- The “for you” section on the Home Screen is still showing me Alexa things to try and news I don’t want. Why can’t I customize or delete “for you”? I can’t seem to customize anything, it’s still Amazons tablet, it doesn’t feel like mine. 
- Why do I even need sections on home screen? Why can’t I choose like iPad?
- The screen is ridiculously unresponsive. I have to click a button like “edit” in show mode 3-5 times before it responds. 


Big things:
I bought this for show mode to control my home devices already in Alexa. But I can’t do the following, which is crazy!!
- I can’t set screen to stay on, or even open to “show mode” when there is motion in front of it. 
- I can’t choose which routines to show, it shows all 50 I have. 
- I can’t add rooms to favorites, click on that room, and see devices in that room. 
- I can’t get rid of the top overlay that worthlessly says Device Dashboard!
- I can’t change background,  Amazon is choosing one single ugly color for me. 
- I can’t move location of items, I want categories at top. 

Amazon has done a great job with Alexa, but they are treating customers like we are dumb. Like they know what we want things to look like and interact with. I have gone out of my way to buy Alexa enabled devices , totaling about 8k now through the whole house. I’m starting to question that. The ecosystem works great, but if I can’t customize why bother?! I’m almost ready to sell all my Alexa devices that don’t include Apple Home support and move on. It’s frustrating. If smart home is just a side gig for Amazon I’ll move on. That’s what it seems."	23	"['BahaMan69: Root and install an android OS.

There are a lot of other capabilities and information displayed, but they rarely get any use.\n\nI used to have a kindle fire as the tablet display, but it was a pain in the ass.

I now use it as a dashboard for my son’s aquarium, so he can stop water flow when feeding, turn of heater when doing tank maintenance, etc.  it works ok for that.\n\nOverall, using Home Assistant as the “brains” for home automation and Alexa devices as a voice interface to Home Assistant seems to be the right combination for smart home stuff.\n\nI can’t recommend Home Assistant highly enough; it really is a great platform.', 'btadams1971: Sorry to pee in your cheerios princess!!', ""Nyghtshayde: I've been using it about a year now and completely endorse your comments.

In particularly the display update the clock every 3 minutes. Example are the 17:00 pm and the echo showing the 16:57, updating every 3 minutes (17:00 - 17:03 - 17:06 and so on)

When i turn the mic on, they work perfectly, showing every minutes.

I tried to:

\- unplug the cable for 5 min ;

\- soft reset ;

\- hard reset ;

The problem still there

Have you the same issue ?

Let me know because i don't know how to fix that

As the title says, I recently changed my home wifi name and password. Afterwards, none of my devices will connect. I have an echo show, an echo glow, and two echo dots, so not many. I’ve tried resetting each device as well as I registering them and removing them from my account. I even restarted and then reset my router *and* network (via the xfinity app). 

Initially, I was following a video online which said to simply select “change” next to each device to change the network. That didn’t work as none of the devices would move past the “searching for a connection” screen. I then reset them, but that didn’t help much. I unregistered, but when I go to register them back to the account, I’m met with the same “searching for a connection” screen. 

I called Amazon support and went through uninstalling the app, logging out and back in, etc. and still nothing. We waited about 10 minutes for the connection screen to change but it never did, so a ticket was entered.

Meanwhile in the PC it could bring up suggestions for other products or better yet, ideas that other users have setup similar to what I am creating.\n\nRight now the engagement does not let people go beyond voice or the limited Amazon app interface.  Empower the users and let it grow into an ecosystem.\n\nFor example if I ask Alexa about a topic for clarification, cooking measurements, news headlines, or sports or anything else, the PC app could have some suggestions later, products, media (like upcoming Amazon streaming content), next sports matches (maybe for the team I asked about and tickets for their next home game or when they might visit my town or team merch or a stream to purchase online since they play in Europe/Canada/Korea.)\n\nIf I could set a calendar in that PC app of my week or other upcoming plans, it could suggest going into guard mode at a set time or setting a different lighting schedule or even popup a reminder later as I get close to leaving that rain is in the forecast and might want to make sure windows are closed or anything else I might want to double check before being gone for the weekend.\n\nThere is massive synergy to be gained here and no one has had the vision to build it or, as I would more likely guess, it has been intentionally roadblocked to keep this of PC's for cost or simplicity or just to drive engagement (and information gathering) prominent on mobile.\n\nAmazon, feel free to contact me.

One day the function just stopped working. 

Prior to this Spotify played through the speakers without any issue. “Alexa play Spotify on Home Theater group” would work. Selecting Home Theater group in the iOS Spotify app would work. Now the Home Theater group doesn’t even appear in the Spotify app, and when I say “Alexa play Spotify on Home Theater group” she says, “Alright, here’s Spotify on the Home Theater group.” and then there is silence. 

Spotify is the only skill that won’t stream through my paired Echo Studio speakers. Amazon Music, Sirius XM, and TuneIn will all play on the paired speakers.

I’ve tried several attempts to fix the issue, unpairing and re-pairing the speakers, disabling the connection to my FireTV Stick, disabling Home Theater, resetting the router, unplugging and plugging the speakers back in, removing the speakers from my system entirely and re-adding them. None of these efforts have fixed the issue. When I ask the speakers to check for an update they say, “This device is up to date.”

If I open the Spotify app on my FireTV Stick, it *will* play the music through the paired speakers. If I unpair the speakers and use them as individual devices, each speaker *will* appear in the Spotify app and let me play music through it individually. 
Otherwise there is no way to get the music to play though Spotify on the speakers. 

It’s also worth mentioning that another group I created that includes three other Echo devices, none of which are Echo Studio devices, *will* play music through Spotify as expected via voice command and through the Spotify iOS app.

Even going into the settings and switching off everything on the home screen except photo display mode would not shut off these sponsored ads when using the home screen only to display a photo slideshow. The only way to get rid of them was to click the ""i"" and hide or report the ad, only for it to be replaced by a different one minutes later.

Sometime in the last few days, I believe Amazon pushed out a new update after all the consumer complaints. You can now select ""Photo Frame"" mode on the pull down menu, which seems to behave differently than going to settings > clock and photo display on its own. This feature still needs to be set up for the photo frame mode to work, but it seems that the update push has changed the ad display situation. In the last 8 hours I've been working, I have not seen a single ad. I can't seem to find any recent releases indicating that this was intended, but I use my echo show almost every day and this appears to be newly featured on my pull down menu on my show since last week instead of only in settings, so I think it must be an update.

What do you think? Has anyone else noticed this?"	9	"['Scooter310: Photo mode has been around longer than the ads. Maybe you just didn\'t notice it but it has been there for a while now.

* Disable the GE Cync Skill
* Enable it again
* Login and MFA

Fairly typical attempt at saving energy when I'm not in the house or really active.  It's always worked pretty well, and on the days when I'm home on off hours or day off etc, it has a simple ""Home Today"" button which basically skips the current schedule and goes to the next one.  So say at 9:00am I notice it's getting warm in the summer, hit Home Today, it jumps to the next schedule slot which sets the AC where I want it when I'm home.

How do I do this with the AST?  I've looked all over the app for some sort of method to do it, I've tried a few voice commands like ""I'm home today"", etc.  Is the only way to do this really to go into the thermostat (on the wall or app) or talk to Alexa and manually change the temp to some specific value?  It already knows my preferred Home/Away/Sleep settings.

Surely this 'Home Today"" (skip current scheduled slot) wasn't some esoteric feature that nobody would use, and I suppose telling Alexa to ""set ac to 74"" is easy enough.

The dot was simple. I did whatever key-combo to factory reset and paired without issue. However, when I did the same for the first gen echo, it says “it looks like the device isn’t registered”. I’ve checked the device list of both accounts (the one it was on, and the one i’m trying to put it on) and it isn’t on either. I’ve also updated the app, checking on the web, and holding the reset button for 20+ seconds.	0	[]

Josh_ely1975	2	12a5r7h	amazonecho	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/12a5r7h/does_amazon_music_streaming_work_as_wellsimple_if/	"So short version is I have recently started to love streaming Amazon music. Currently only use an echo dot. Absolutely ready to jump to a echo studio. While researching I learned about the home theater setup.
My current soundbar and sub just don't give me immersive sound ($400 5yr old Samsung connected to a 75"" Samsung TV) tried a bunch of different settings, still not great. Just ok.
So then I thought, why buy a studio for just streaming music IF I can go the echo home theater route for better TV audio AND a good music streaming experience.
Minimum would be 2 of the echo 4th gen with premium sound and the echo sub. Not sure if that will get me enough of the music streaming experience I'm looking for. I could go with 2 studios with or with out echo sub but I really don't have the space for 2 studios anywhere near my TV.
So then I thought about doing separate home theater w/2 echo gen 4 and sub then a studio just for music streaming.
S
Choices, choices...
If a good echo home theater setup would also stream just as good as a separate studio. Then it would be stupid to have both setups. I just don't want to feel like I'm missing out or sacrificing by using 2 gen 4's and a sub.
Thoughts?
I guess another benefit to having separate ""systems"" is the HT stuff can stay put while I take the studio with me out to the garage or when I go to my cottage."	0	[]

I believe this has been covered in the past, but I have yet to find a satisfactory solution.

When I set a timer, it displays for 10 seconds. Then the Echo Show returns to its Home Screen, and shows the timer countdown in a small font at the top of the screen.

I want to use the timer for my autistic son, and have the large timer display until completed. This will help him know how much time he has left during a task. When the timer becomes small, it’s harder to see and he will likely ignore it. 

Is there a way to keep the timer on the screen in the same display as when it is originally set?

1680365881.0	01-Apr-2023 09:18:01	Experiencing Bonkers/Beyond Frustrating Bluetooth issue since beginning of year after working fine for years, treated like garbage by Amazon support	richaardvark	2	128qxxc	amazonecho	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/128qxxc/experiencing_bonkersbeyond_frustrating_bluetooth/	"TL;DR version (thanks ChatGPT lol):  
  
  
The author has an audio issue with their Amazon Echo devices. They have eight Echo devices, six of which are 2nd-generation Echo Dots, and two are Echo Flexes, which are always connected to Bluetooth speakers and have worked fine for years. However, since the beginning of this year, they have been experiencing issues where the music played on the Bluetooth speaker suddenly becomes silent, usually 3/4 of the way into the song. Although the music continues to play, it's just not audible. The speaker is still successfully connected to the Echo device and Alexa will respond through the Bluetooth speaker just won't play music there. If the author asks Alexa to disconnect the Bluetooth speaker, they will hear the music through the built-in speaker, but if they reconnect the Bluetooth speaker, the issue will reoccur relatively quickly. A few minutes, an hour, or several hours later, the audio suddenly plays from the speaker, which the author calls ""ghost audio."" The author has contacted Amazon support multiple times, but they've had no luck, and the tickets keep getting closed without resolution. Now Amazon says the author's Bluetooth speakers are simply not compatible with the Echo devices despite their not being any problems for years and they have also said it is because they need to be Bluetooth 5.0 speakers which the author confirms all speakers are. All standard troubleshooting steps have already been performed multiple times.   
  
  
Original/full/long-AF version:  
  
  
Hi everyone,  
I realize this is not an official Amazon-moderated support forum but if there is someone out there who can offer some insight here I would greatly appreciate it. I will try to keep this as simple and brief as I can despite it being a weird and somewhat complex issue that I've gotten nowhere on with Amazon support and have been treated like garbage, lied to over and over again.  

I have eight Echo devices (well, 9 actually - I added an Echo Link at the beginning of the year). Six of the Echo devices are 2nd-generation Echo Dots and then two are Echo Flexes (originally All eight were 2nd-gen Dots but two of them attempted software updates one day which continued for multiple days with the blue light spinning and then finally I found them dead as a doornail/completely burned out and hot to the touch and would not power on at all so I replaced them with Flexes).  

Both of the Flexes and two of the Dots are always connected to Bluetooth speakers and have always been for years and years now, going back to 2017 for the Echo Dots and at least two and a half or 3 years now for the Flexes and have never had any issues whatsoever with connecting to Bluetooth or playing music over the Bluetooth speakers. Everything has worked solidly.  


Somewhere around the beginning of this year I started experiencing a problem where music played on the Bluetooth speaker would suddenly become silent typically around 3/4 of the way into whatever music request I have given Alexa (doesn't matter the service but usually it's Amazon Music I'm listening to). This happens on both Echo Flexes as well as Echo Dots. It's NOT a Bluetooth speaker connection issue - the connection is never dropped and if I ask Alexa the weather or time it will respond just fine through the connected Bluetooth speaker but there is no music playback, just silence. But the music is still playing. If I ask that particular device to disconnect the Bluetooth speaker suddenly I hear the music again playing through the built-in speaker and it's been playing all along but was just silent and not coming out of the Bluetooth speaker. If I then ask the device to reconnect to the Bluetooth speaker it will do so and will play the music okay anywhere from 30 seconds to maybe a few songs if I'm lucky but typically it's only about 30 seconds before it cuts out again. 

So just to recap: this happens on both Dot as well as Flex devices, the Bluetooth connection never drops/Alexa still responds to requests with her audio coming out of the Bluetooth speaker, the music playback never stops it's just silent and not streaming out of the Bluetooth speaker. This can happen when I'm playing on multiroom music but also when I am just playing on one individual device, doesn't really matter and has nothing to do with multiroom music.   

So then, anywhere from a few minutes later, or an hour later, 2 hours later, 8 hours or more later, etc. I will suddenly hear this strange phenomenon that I have termed ""ghost audio,"" where whatever audio output was supposed to have been playing earlier when it didn't work and was silent will all of a sudden start playing from the speaker. And it's not like it just starts the song over again but the audio that comes out is an actual live audio stream of whatever audio was supposed to have been playing earlier (and sometimes it replays audio that even already did play earlier). For example, if I was listening to music on multiroom music on my one ""Everywhere"" group earlier in the day and one of the Bluetooth speakers dropped out at some point well then later on I'm going to hear that audio that was supposed to been playing sometimes as long as 8 hours earlier playing all of a sudden and if I had skipped to the next song or ask the weather or time I will also hear that audio stream coming out from that device, so it's the actual live audio that was supposed to have played earlier. It's almost like the device realized it didn't do it properly before and held onto the audio it never played and then finally decided to play catch up anywhere from minutes later to literally a half a day later. Once again four of my eight devices are always connected to Bluetooth speakers and all of them at one time or another have displayed this weird behavior but it is usually two devices in particular that give me this issue (one is a Dot and one is a Flex). I'm using completely different brands of Bluetooth speakers with these devices and once again to recap no other changes have been made in my home audio setup or anything in my house has changed at all really and prior to the beginning of this year All of these devices stayed connected to the Bluetooth speakers and played the audio beautifully without issue since like 2017.   


I've opened multiple tickets with Amazon and have gone back and forth and back and forth and they just lie and lie and guarantee they will give me a follow-up call by such and such date and the date comes and goes and I never hear from them or receive an email and then I call again and then the tickets been closed and then they need logs again even though we've given them the logs four fu©king times before already and then of course they write back and tell me to hard reset and do basic troubleshooting that we've already done 20 million times. Then they opened a second case ID for some reason and anyway it's just a mess. And now that new case ID/ticket has been closed now and it's all just a dead end. They (the engineering team) finally came back with some pitiful excuse and told me that my Bluetooth speakers are simply not compatible with Echo devices which doesn't make sense because they worked flawlessly for years and are very standard/common speakers. Then they came back and said that they weren't compatible because Echo devices are only compatible with Bluetooth 5.0 speakers but every single one of these speakers is a Bluetooth 5.0 speaker and additionally that doesn't even make sense because the second generation Echo Dots don't even have Bluetooth 5.0 but have Bluetooth version 4.0 which is a hardware-bound limitation and cannot be updated with software. They have chips in them for Bluetooth 4.0 so it doesn't even make sense for them to mention that it's only compatible with Bluetooth 5.0.  


Anyway, I can't sleep at night and haven't been able to since January because at any given point in my home all night long I will hear random songs and audio coming on from the day or days prior and Alexa ignores you when you tell her to stop or be quiet and just keeps playing it. And then I can't listen to any music because it typically cuts out within 45 seconds of the song starting. What the hell is going on with my stupid devices?"	16	"[""richaardvark: Also worth noting I have removed the Echo Link from the equation for long periods of time and that doesn't make any difference and his nothing to do with any of this."", ""diverareyouok: Is there a TL;DR version?

I didn't want to add any additional text to my post and god forbid upset the TL;DR gods but I've already tried new/different/additional third-party Bluetooth speakers and the problem persists. It's definitely not as frequent with certain brands but so far has happened with every single type of Bluetooth speaker I have connected from a variety of different companies and manufacturers, all of them Bluetooth 5.0 and some of them brand new.\n\nI blame Alexa because I believe it is a software issue as there is no problem or issue whatsoever with the actual Bluetooth connection to the speaker. It is connected fine. The Bluetooth connection is never dropped and at any moment I can ask Alexa what the time or weather is and she responds promptly and the audio response is played through the Bluetooth speaker. It's the internal switching coding/software in the Echo device that determines whether or not the audio for music/media should be played out through a connected device or through the built-in speaker that seems to be screwing up.\n\nWe're talking 2nd-generation Dots (the hockey puck without the fabric on the side kind) and Echo Flexes here - the built-in speakers are absolute beyond abysmally terrible lol. Additionally the audio that comes out of them is by design mono when played through the built-in speaker and not even stereo. The newer Echo Dot models definitely have much better speakers and better sound output but it is still mono sound. It's really dumb that the newest Dots don't even have an audio-out jack IMO. Some of these Bluetooth speakers are quite high-end and have been purposefully chosen for each location in the home and the sound quality is phenomenal played through the Bluetooth speakers and was phenomenal for years. :("", ""richaardvark: I honestly think it's either a software/coding glitch in the more recent Echo firmware, or I think it's got to be fucking planned obsolescence on behalf of Amazon."", ""richaardvark: That's a very good idea but I don't think it's what's going on here for me unfortunately. :( My Alexa devices are typically already at volume nine. I almost thought it was the opposite perhaps and that it was a safety override to prevent the music blowing the speaker because it was so loud. But that's the weird thing, the actual Bluetooth connection to the Echo device never ever drops whatsoever. Echo devices are basically Android devices with a proprietary version of Android and in the case of the Echo Dots without a screen. Anyway, there are several different channels of audio whether it's alarms and timers or media / music or alerts notifications. That's pretty standard with most devices these days and each of these channels has its own independent volume setting. But the actual Bluetooth speaker is never disconnecting from the Echo device and the speaker isn't going in standby mode or power save mode or anything like that and all of these Bluetooth speakers are plugged into AC power and some of them don't even have batteries in them at all and are simply wall-powered devices. It's just that the media / music audio stream is being set wrong or forgotten or dropped by the Echo device periodically. :-/\n\nI wonder if there is some way to debug the Bluetooth connection and read some sort of output. I know the engineering team at Amazon can do this and supposedly did from looking at my device logs and told me that it's because my Bluetooth speakers are not Bluetooth 5.0 and therefore are incompatible. This was after 2 and 1/2 months of them coming up with nothing. Anyway, that doesn't make any sense because every single one of my Bluetooth speakers I have confirmed is a Bluetooth 5.0 speaker and additionally what doesn't make sense is the Echo Dot 2nd generation doesn't even have Bluetooth 5.0 but only has Bluetooth 4.0 so that statement from them doesn't even make sense. Seriously everything worked flawlessly from like 2017 until the beginning of this year. And since then I have swapped out every single one of these speakers here and there through trial and error with brand new, completely different Bluetooth speakers and eventually the same exact problem happens. It's got to be a software bug or glitch. Or I'm really truthfully at this point starting to think that it's purposely being done by Amazon as a form of planned obsolescence which would be fucking awful but not surprising."", 'richaardvark: Oh my goodness so I\'m not the only person experiencing this then??  I did at one point find one other person on the Amazon devices support forum who seemed to be having the same issue.  Unfortunately no, no solution.  I kept pressing Amazon support and they just lied and lied and said X person would call or email me back on X date and then that date would roll around and no one would contact me and I\'d reach out and they\'d say the ticket was closed because there was no activity and I\'d have them open it again and it just goes in circles.  Some idiot customer service associate told me my speaker is just not compatible because it\'s not Bluetooth 5.0. I informed them that all of my BT speakers are BT 5.0 and besides their comment didn\'t make any sense considering that all of my Echo Dots are 2nd-generation and only have BT 4.0 as it is. And that everything worked fine for years with no issues.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut no, sadly, no solution.  I\'ve tried swapping out the offending devices with newer/different BT speakers but eventually it inevitably happens.  I have four Echo devices that are always/permanently connected to BT speakers and usually it\'s two in particular that have this problem but all of them at one point or another have the issue and continue to from time to time.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you get the weird ghost audio thing also, where it plays audio that it was supposed to play but way later?  And does it sometimes play with the volume kind of ramping up and down like ""wha wha wha"" as it plays?', 'rockmasterflex: Ok but “stereo” is meaningless unles you have two speakers. If your Bluetooth “speakers” are actually whole ass speaker systems then that makes sense. If they’re just single units… they ain’t really stereo either.\n\n\nAt the end of the day I don’t think anyone else is having this problem - probably because they’re not shooting so much Bluetooth traffic over their house all the time. \n\n\nThe simplest approach to whole home Alexa audio is to just use the damn dot speakers. If you hate the way the old ones sound, get new sphere ones and use the trade in bonus and turn in the pucks. Think of all the time (time is money) and frustration you’ll save by simply never buying another Bluetooth speaker again and just using the damn dots for whole home audio!\n\n\nOr you could throw Alexa out and spend way more $$$$ on sonos system hooked up to a single dot. That’s the actual best whole home audio system.\n\n\nBut if you want it to be flexible, relatively cheap, and reliable - a dot in every room you want audio in, no Bluetooth, same 2.4 ghz WiFi network for all.', 'Separate-Effective77: You could buy a Bluetooth transmitter to plug into the aux port of the Dots, which would remove the Echo Bluetooth from being the issue, to see if the issue clears', ""richaardvark: They are whole-ass speaker systems, not single speakers. Each one pairs to an additional Bluetooth speaker/uses TWS to create a stereo Bluetooth speaker pair.\n\nI have found a handful of other people on the Amazon support forum who are experiencing this same issue and have started recently experiencing it.  \n\nAdditionally, now that Amazon doesn't include an audio output jack on the newest version Dot it's like they're encouraging people to go crazy with Bluetooth in their homes and have even more Bluetooth connections all over the place. You really can't argue that listening to music (or anything really) from the built-in speaker of an Echo Flex/a 2nd-generation Dot is even a remotely reasonable or enjoyable experience in any way. The built-in speakers in these models are literally the size of a thumbnail and are worse than the speakers in most laptop computers or even the Fire tablets.  \n\nIf I had Sonos I wouldn't have Echo devices, this is true. No, I wouldn't even care to keep even one Echo Dot lol. There are much better media playing platforms and devices out there. I simply depend upon this as my whole home music playback system for now and it has worked beautifully without any issue for years.  \n\nTo your last point - I'm basically already doing that...? I have 8 Echo devices (9 when you include the Link) in basically every room in my house at this point. I don't think I need any additional echo devices in my 2,500 ft² single-family home. They already have issues at times with spacial recognition with the devices stepping on top of each other trying to answer and talk about overkill of radio signals being broadcasted... that would just make things worse. Everything is currently on a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network. In fact, all Echo devices in the home are on their own proprietary network on their own special dedicated high-end router with no other devices on that network."", 'richaardvark: Not a bad idea! Will potentially be annoying having a million more simultaneous Bluetooth signals/devices around everywhere but in theory this should work.']"

Most of the time they work well, but sometimes in certain movies with very deep and vibrating sounds like for example a tank rolling over something or the start of a space ship, then the echo studios both make a cracking sound. If the sound stays for too long they both die and i need to plug them in and out.

I had an idea for Alexa that I wanted to share with you all. What if Alexa could help you keep track of what you have in your pantry and fridge, and even tell you when you need to restock certain items?

Here's how it would work: Alexa would have a feature where you can input what items you have in your pantry and fridge, and how much of each item you have. You can also tell Alexa which items are most important to you and which items you don't use as often.

Then, based on how often you use each item and how much you have left, Alexa can tell you when it's time to restock certain items. This would make grocery shopping much easier, as you wouldn't have to worry about forgetting what you already have at home.

Additionally, there could be a ""party mode"" feature where you can input how many people will be attending your party or event, and Alexa can tell you how much food and drinks you will need based on past usage data. You can even input the names of guests who are likely to not attend, and Alexa can take that into account as well.

This feature would be perfect for people who often host events like barbecues, birthday parties, or family gatherings. It would take the stress out of figuring out how much food and drinks to buy, and you wouldn't have to worry about running out of anything.

Overall, I think this would be a fantastic feature for Alexa. It would save time, reduce waste, and make grocery shopping and party planning much easier.

I bought into the Amazon ec(h)osystem when the first echo came out and it is very definitely heavily integrated into my daily life.  
I've got a number of echos, a few fire tv's, a couple fire sticks and up until a bit over a year ago was pretty damned happy with all of it.

After the changes to Amazon Music made my purchased music basically unavailable from any echo device it seems the Echo ecosystem has been steadily declining in a number of other ways as well.  


It really seems like they've killed off devs that are actively chasing down/fixing stuff and bugs are just proliferating across apps devices etc.  
Why I think this?

* For a good 6 months I couldn't listen to any news station from my echo auto then it started working again as suddenly as it stopped.
* More and more frequently echo isn't able to stream \*anything.  
I'll check and I can stream whatever it was via my phone or laptop but then I'll check and the echo still won't be able stream anything.  
It answers as if it's going to and then just nothing.
* My echo auto now fails to connect to my phone maybe 10% of the time unless I power cycle it.
* I have routines that turn groups of lights on/off and change their colors.  Now every other time one of those fails on 1 or 2 of the members of that group.   
Manually running the routine 1 or 2 (or 3) more times will get all the lights.
* The disparity in what Amazon Music sees or can do on a) my phone b) a browser c) any firetv d) any echo - seems to just keep growing. 
* I have a routine that runs every morning that runs on a TV to a specific channel.  
It goes from working to not working (without me changing anything) 5 or 6 times a month.

I think a very big part of why Amazon grew so big over the past couple of decades was because Bezos pushed a very customer satisfaction based business model.    
I haven't noticed a degradation in that regarding sales via Amazon but very definitely have in relation to Echo / Amazon Music.  
It seems like complaints about Amazon Music or Amazon Echo are now more common than people looking for feature upgrades."	25	"['stardustishere1213: I couldn’t agree more about customer satisfaction degradation.

Any thing dim is already assigned to another group.\n\nScroll down and you'll see a section that is just 'devices'. These are other devices that are linked to Alexa through their own software app. For example, I have about 25+ devices. Any one of them can be included in the group. Of course, you'll assigned just the ones you want to that group.\n\nWhat you'll end up with is a nice, clean group which allows you to control any devices in that group just by using the group name.\n\nThere is one instance where I control all lights. I created a routine that runs at 11:59 every evening. In the routine I added all the lights/devices that I want to shut off just in case we accidentally left them on. For example, before I replaced normal switch for our gas-fired fireplace, one night we accidentally left the fireplace on all night.

In that case you could name 2 of the outlets. Once for left couch light and one for right couch light and put them in a group called couch or couch lights. Then you could control them individually or together. \n\nI have a single two outlet Kasa plug in the bathroom. One has a heater and one has a fan. Again I can control them individually by their name (bathroom heater or bathroom fan). I tun them on individually.

I currently use a fire TV box with a Philips hue sync box which is connected to a Roku TV.

For audio, I have my fire tv synced with two Amazon echo dot generation 1s. I wanted to upgrade so I got the Echo Studio. Turns out, the Echo Studio won’t pair with generation 1s for a full surround sound experience. 

So I was contemplating getting two new echo 4th gens to complete the experience. 

Does anyone have a similar setup? Do you like it? Am I better off going with a company that specializes in home theater audio?

Any advice would be amazing!"	5	"['xyzzzzy: As far as I know the best you can do with this is 2.1 (stereo plus subwoofer).

I've only had it for about 7 weeks but after reading many topics about night mode, I decided that I would factory reset mine to try and fix it, and that actually worked!

However, the clock does not display red numbers, was that removed and if so why? Everyone knows that people adjust better to red light and not blue light (which keeps you awake) now I have very faint white/blue clock numbers.

Also no matter which background I choose (ended up using ""Seasons"") it takes about a minute for the Echo Show 8 to decide that the bedroom is completely pitch black before it goes into the true dimmed mode which is also annoying, for the first minute the display will dim a bit, and keep rotating season images.

Before I factory reset it, the Echo would be doing full rotation of content (in a dimmed mode, but still too bright that it throws off light and keeps me awake).

My settings:

* Background: Seasonal
* Adaptive Brightness  (enabled)
* Adaptive Color

When the device reboots itself for one minute and re-starts to reregister, it will not have any Wi-Fi networks and it’s system anymore. So it will use Bluetooth to your MobilePhone for the set up (so make sure your Bluetooth on your phone is turned on when you do this).  \n\nThen when you’re reregistering the device, use the correct new net work and new network password.  If this is an issue with more than one device, you’ll need to go around your house one at a time deregistering and reregistering each device individually after you have already removed the old network password from your account within Amazons site.  \n\nI hope this was helpful.

I have owned multiple generations of Echo. I bought the 4th generation in October 2022. I use it sparingly in my work office and, in fact, for 2 months of the last 5 I never even used it. 

I've never had the following issue with my past Echo's. In the past couple months already, I started noticing an issue where the music stops and starts again, with almost a static sound when it goes out and starts up again (think someone cranking an old radio tuner off the station to dead silence, and then back to the signal again). Sometimes the ""silence"" is brief...sometimes it's slightly more than brief. Sometimes I can listen for 2 hours with no issues...and sometimes it'll happen twice in 10 minutes. The thing is once it does eventually happen it will happen more often thereafter. I initially thought it may be related to other devices on the same account playing/interfering, but that is not the case. I have unplugged it for a minute and plugged it back in. That doesn't help. It is connected to my business Wi-Fi at 322Mbps. No other devices on this network have connectivity issues and not sure if the Echo is or not. Does anyone know the issue I am having? I know the recent generations haven't been very dependable. I want to see if I can fix this before calling Amazon about either a refund or replacement at this point."	3	"['stumbledotcom: I’ve gotten the static effect every now and then.

He said it's one or the other - you can change the brightness if Adaptive Brightness is turned off, or you can have it on and have the device change automatically.  Which is exactly what I've been experiencing.

In operation, it's pretty awkward because if I have Adaptive Brightness turned on and I use the slider, or issue a voice command, the display briefly changes to a number that corresponds to the level of brightness I've specified, but the display brightness does not change.  I guess it's just a badly-implemented design.

Adaptive Brightness skews a bit dim for my taste and it makes me wonder if the light sensor is on the back of the device.  The overhead light in the room never seems to be enough for it.  But I can live with it."	0	[]

Thanks u/jagunlimited81 for their help! Here’s what I did: Turned off Bluetooth completely. Open Alexa app. Add device. A few different screens might pop up, but basically do whatever let’s you connect via local network. You’ll get a pop up to join Amazon network or smth like that. Hit join. Hit allow device connections via local network. WiFi will pop up. The first time it didn’t show my WiFi and I tried to manually add it. Didn’t work. Second time, starting over completely, WiFi showed up but got wrong password repeatedly. Third time it worked. Kept echo in set up mode the whole time. Hope this helps someone else!

On mobile.

I have tried everything. I’ve repeatedly called Amazon and Xfinity. No matter what I do, I have the same problem. I try to set up my Echo dot in the Alexa app and get to where it’s supposed to show a list of WiFi. Instead, it shows a spinning WiFi symbol and says “searching for WiFi”. Endlessly. 

I’ve unplugged and replugged the echo. I’ve factory reset the echo. I updated my phone. I restarted my phone. I reset my WiFi. I unplugged and replugged my WiFi. I turned my cellular data off. I put my phone on airplane mode with the WiFi on. I took the echo to my mother’s house and it connected fine there, but couldn’t detect a single WiFi in my building despite there being dozens. My phone even detects the Starbucks WiFi next door but my Alexa app can’t. 

I sat on the phone with Amazon for two hours until they told me it had to be the WiFi because they couldn’t remote into my Alexa app. I sat on the phone with Xfinity for another hour before they finally told me to just replace my box at my local store. Today, I went to do so. I then spent three hours on the phone with Xfinity because while my property manager told me I could switch out the box, he did NOT tell me that the only copy of the account number was on a sticker on the old box so I had to force my way past the self service demon (which exists on every Xfinity customer line, including the number on google maps) by spamming 0# until I somehow reached the billing department and got redirected six times with multiple “hold please”s until someone helped me.

And finally, I tried to set up my echo again. Same. Freaking. Problem. I don’t want to return it. I need the damn thing. This was supposed to make my disability easier to deal with since I could use smart home items. So yeah - I’m losing my mind. Any help would be much appreciated because I have half a mind to chuck the echo out of my fourth story window.

I hate the mixing on some of these songs. If you want to see what I’m talking about, the worst example is Aerosmith’s Last Child. In the Amazon Music app, switch between 360 reality audio and hd/lossless for the intro. In the 360 version of the song, you can’t even make out what he’s saying. It’s like they just took out the main voice track. Is there any way to tell the Echo Studio to stop streaming the garbage 360 version? The only way I’ve found so far is to open the app, start playing the non-360 version, then stream it to the Studio. But I haven’t found a way to get it to work with voice commands. My Echo Dot is fine, it defaults to the non-360 versions of every song.	0	[]

GUNNER_BASS	9	119pie9	amazonecho	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/119pie9/anyone_have_success_getting_an_lg_c2_to_work_with/	"Hands down the worst experience I’ve ever had setting up a device to work with Amazon Echo.

My goal was pretty simple: have the Amazon Echo that’s already in my living room, control my LG C2, like the built in Alexa controls it.

Nope.

First off there’s two skills in the Alexa app. One for ThinQ and one for LG TV.

If you set up LG ThinQ skill w/ the C2 and Echo you are able to do basic things like turn on/off the TV and toggle inputs. But you can’t do things like launch apps, advanced searches etc. With the LG ThinQ skill enabled, when you try to launch apps Echo directs you to go to “settings, TV & Video” and then choose the “LG TV” skill to be able to control your TV. Except when you select the LG TV skill it says “this skill no longer exists”. 

Eh, okay?

If you go the other route, and don’t choose the LG ThinQ skill, and instead choose the “LG TV” Skill and add your TV manually, it lets you add the LG TV skill that supposedly “no longer exists” and it works as desired for a little while (change channel/launch apps), then eventually it stops for no reason and you can’t get it back without starting over from scratch. I’m assuming the reason is the “LG TV” skill is for older LG TV’s?

If you go the third route and set up the built in Alexa that’s on the C2 you end up with two (or three) devices showing in the Echo Devices menu. Depending on your previous steps you either end up with an Echo that’s connected via LG TV skill and a built in Alexa that uses ThinQ, or an Echo that uses ThinQ and a built in Alexa that uses ThinQ. 

If you then tell the built in Alexa to use the Echo, instead of the mic on the TV (hands free off, set to Echo in [living room] group), you are back to scenario 1 or two with the Echo - basic controls or a dead end.

As a fourth option, if you tell the built in Alexa to use the mic on the TV, you have full control as you’d want, but now you’re in conflict with the Echo, sometimes triggering both. This would also require the “Always Ready” to be on meaning the TV is always on and listening. Or you have to pick up the remote to press the Alexa button which kind of defeats the purpose of using voice control.

I’ve also played with the multi-room speaker setup in this scenario and can get it to listen to only one of them, which it does about 75% of the time. However if the Echo is the one that hears you, you are once again back to scenario 1 or 2.

Essentially the only way it appears I can get this to work is to ditch the Echo and leave the TV in Always Ready mode, neither of which I want to do. 

Anyone successfully accomplish what I was attempting, another way? I see there’s other skills for TV control but seems pretty silly that ThinQ can’t do what I’m asking."	6	"['slawnz: So many Alexa skills are just cruft.

After that I had to readd the TV in LG ThinQ and a prompt to activate ''turn on using bluetooth or wifi'' appeared. After activating that function it started working but I can't launch Netflix or similar actions and it is kinda unreliable. \n\nWhat a coincidence you just made this thread 4 days ago."", 'GUNNER_BASS: I’ve literally followed every guide possible and invested like 8 hours on this trying different variations. It’s absurd that it’s this hard.\n\nI’ve just settled for the on/off and toggle input functionality at this point.\n\nWhat’s crazy is that “LG TV” skill did actually work for a few moments. I was able to tell it to launch HBOMax, then select profile, then play The Last of Us. Then it magically just stops working\n\nOh there’s also annoying as hell skills built into the TV Alexa too. I asked to launch HBOMax and instead it had me get a skill call “HBO Recommends” or something. It had me going movie by movie asking “do you like this one”after giving a lengthy description, for movies I dgaf about. \n\nTHE WORST “smart” assistant experience ever.', 'GUNNER_BASS: Yup I basically ended up where you’re at with mine and gave up. Deleted the “LGE” device, and shut off Alexa hands free on the TV. So now I have two devices showing in my account. Essentially two seperate Alexa devices, one on the TV and one in my living room. For the one on the TV I just press the button mainly to tell it to show my Ring cameras. Nothing else works reliably. \n\nFor the Echo in my living room I can use it for on/off, volume, and switch inputs to HDMI.\n\nOverall it’s an absolute disaster. LG needs to get this fixed.

In the app it says ""The display brightness will adjust automatically based on ambient light.  Moving the slider will help adaptive brightness learn your preferences.""  However, when the feature is enabled, moving the slider doesn't change the display's brightness.  If I move the slider, the new value (from 1 to 10) will briefly appear on the display.  But the brightness won't change.  

In the meantime the actual brightness seems a bit random.  Sometimes it will be completely dim in a dark room.  Sometimes it will be brighter.

I know that someone else on this sub posted something similar, but also that it was fixed by a recent firmware update.  That's not the case for me.  

I contacted Amazon support and was told to reset the device back to defaults and reconfigure it, but I don't want to do that.

MattEffinCameron	5	1199yd5	amazonecho	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/1199yd5/best_way_to_stream_music_mp3s_that_i_own_without/	"I continue to hold out against adding another monthly subscription to the growing number in our lives.  As such, while I have a prime membership, I refuse to subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited.

Until now, the only downside has been the incredibly annoying advertisements on alexa for music unlimited when I ask it to play music already available with prime.

When there is music I want that is not available on prime, I just buy the mp3 album and add it to my library.  

Amazon has made recent updates where alexa will no longer play songs you want to hear or albums you want to hear even if they are included with prime....instead it says ""playing hypnotize by biggie and songs like it"" and it may start with the song I want, but then goes into a ""station"" of music ""like"" the one I wanted to hear.  It wont let me start a song over to repeat, I only have 6 ""skips"" in an hour, and then if I ask it again to play hypnotize by biggie it will say ""playing hypnotize by biggie and songs like it"" but will start with like song 2 or 3 in the ""station"" of music...so it wont play the song I want to hear the second or third time I try.

Alexa also appears to no longer acknowledge when I say ""from my library"".  I used to be able to say ""play ten by pearl jam from my library"" and even if it was not included with prime, because I had bought it and it was in my library, it would play it.  So now even when I say play this song I own because I bought it from my library it still just goes into the routine of playing the station.

I primarily listen to amazon music/alexa in the car through android auto or on a Sonos One at home....I have also encountered new problems where when searching in the Sonos app for music in my (connected) amazon music library....where now it just shows me stations, not the albums or artists I have in my library.  


SO TLDR:  
Are there any other options for how to listen to my music library of MP3s that I own, through a digital assistant or other service?  Would I have better luck (if this is even a thing) downloading all my bought MP3s and uploading to a google music library and using google assistant instead of Alexa to listen to them?"	9	"['Famous-Perspective-3: the only one I know of without a subscription is Plex.

MyMedia has an almost negligible annual charge (to help pay for the server resources it needs), while iBroadcast offers a free service but limits the playback to 128kbps iirc - I’m not sure if they also operate the paid premium service they’ve been mooting that removes that constraint.

I cut the cord almost 20 years ago (I had my own stockpile of media to stream) and find myself watching more ads now than I ever did back then. No longer can I record a show and fast forward, not that I did it often but not that I can\'t despite paying for the ability to record a show is frustrating.\n\nThe ads I see on streaming media make the ads on the home screen seem like nothing, in fact when one is relevant for a show I want to watch I click on it just for the hell of it. It sure beats the non sponsored ones that Amazon slips in for a show I have available via a subscription and they have available for purchase and at first glance, I only have the option to purchase it (I hate that screen but whoever did the UI for it was good at their job the view other sources(?) button is almost invisible until you see it.) Then they do things like put my favorite show (Burn Notice) on prime at 480p but on Freevie it\'s in 720P or I could buy it for \\~$80.\n\nSo yeah they\'re underhanded and sneaky and it makes it hard, especially for the elderly. My 2 cents set your dad up with YTTV and an echo, it\'s easier to rip the bandaid off.

Then I went into the  ""Sactuary"" group and, on the Speakers screen, UNCHECKED the Echo Dot.  Hey Presto!  The Sonos speaker was now ""available.""  Now it's the speaker for the group, which is renamed back to ""Bedroom.

\------------------------------

I just set up my first Sonos One SL speaker.  During the configuration, Sonos asked me what room the speaker is in, and I said ""Bedroom.""  So far, so good.

Then I enabled the Alexa Sonos skill, and it went out and found the speaker.  Still good.  It created a new speaker device in Alexa named ""Bedroom"" and asked me if I wanted to add it to a group.  I chose the existing Alexa group, ""Bedroom.""

For one hot second everything worked as expected; I said ""Alexa"" and heard a tone from the Sonos speaker.  Then everything went back to the bedroom Echo Dot and stayed there.  No matter what I said, it would only play music on the Dot.  In the Alexa Bedroom group, it said that the Sonos speaker was ""Not Compatible"" as a speaker in the group.

The only way I could get things working again was to rename the Alexa group to something that didn't include ""Bedroom"" (naming it ""Main Bedroom"") didn't help.  Now that the group is named ""Sanctuary"" (only thing I could think of off the top of my frustrated head,) I can say, ""Alexa, play music in Bedroom"" and music will play on the Sonos speaker (but the Echo Dot will do the talking.)

I have a Tribit speaker connected via bluetooth.

About five minutes into a stream (podcast or music), the stream ends - on the Tribit anyway.

It's odd - because it sounds like the stream has stopped.  However, if you say ""disconnect bluetooth"" the stream continues uninterrupted on the dot speaker.  (Meaning that the stream has been ongoing in the background, but only not on the Tribit speaker).

I have deleted and reconnected the speaker multiple times, to no impact.

Anyone else have this issue?"	6	"['BlueberryAnnual8100: I’m having the same issue', 'mtn_lion_x: Yes, this issue just started for me within the last few days.

It’s not a bluetooth issue, ’cuz even after the stream suddenly dies, all interaction with the Echo is still heard through the Tribit speaker.\n\nI’ve tried: rebooting the Echo Dots, “forgetting” and re-pairing the Tribit speakers.  Even tried disabling and re-enabling the Apple Music skill.  I’m not keen to go through the hassle of setting one or more of the Dots back to factory condition and re-setting it up, and I doubt that would change anything.

From there I documented what I did and converted a hobby into something I hope will prove useful for all in our common context, and published it at [www.alzheimerstech.com](http://www.alzheimerstech.com/). This site is my personal initiative which will hopefully lend a hand to others and there is no commercial angle to this at all.  I simply wish to give back and help.

I wanted to share my experience with using the Echo over the past few months and see if anyone else has had a similar issue.

Over time, I've noticed that the voice recognition has been getting worse and worse. I've had to repeat myself multiple times or raise my voice just to get the Echo to respond.

I've tried resetting the device and retraining the voice recognition feature, but the problem still persists. It's frustrating to have a device that used to work so well suddenly become unreliable.

I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience with their Amazon Echo. Is this a common issue with the device?

Just over two weeks ago it stopped showing the correct time. It simply locked the time and shortly the screen started to go black instead of the landscape photos it was showing. 

I’ve changed out the surge protector. Rebooted the wi-fi countless times. Unplugged it countless times. I’ve plugged it into a TP-Link plug and turn it off and on from there via the KASA App multiple times. It works for random amounts of time, then the time stops syncing and then screen dims and goes black after a while. Sometimes even then the voice command will change the light, sometimes not.

I noticed sometimes the time sync happened immediately after using the Tp-link plugs we have to control lights. Sometimes just after a voice command.
The unit seems to work from my App to control the lights, but the voice sometimes works for a while  and then sometimes does not. Eventually it goes completely black and stays unresponsive. 

It’s running Fire OS 5.5.5.6 (683785420) and says no updates available. 

The Bluetooth is showing an unknown LGE DTV that says Tap to Pair, so not sure what that is or if it’s interfering but I’m guessing not since it isn’t paired. Maybe a neighbors and I don’t know how long that’s been there or if it needs deleting somehow?

I don’t know if Amazon is having an issue with software? Or if my TP-Link plugs are having an issue? 
The other possible thing is our kid at college recently plugged in a fire stick using my Amazon account a few weeks ago, but they swear it can’t be that, but I have no idea and they say they’ve disconnected it.

I really need this to control lights. I have an elderly disabled family that can’t reach the lights which are controlled thru TP-Link plugs by voice thru Alexa and that’s the reason this is important to fix. 

I’m not sure what else to check. It has stayed on for five minutes and for maximum of three days at a time. I reset it again just before bedtime last night and it was still on as of this morning until the voice was used and it stopped time sync again. 

I’m not detail tech savvy so I need simple answers. I’ve done all reading and can’t figure it out.

There was an Amazon event in 2018 where this was said:

""Preferred speaker setup lets customers set their preferred speaker for music playback. Just say, “Alexa, play rock music,” and music will stream from your preferred speaker – whether it’s an Echo device, a speaker from Bose or Sonos, or a multi-room music group. This fall, we’re making **Alexa Multi-Room Music** available to all device makers – so if you have an Echo in the kitchen, a Polk Command Bar in the living room, and a Harmon Kardon Allure in the entry, you can add all of them to a single group and play music everywhere.""

However, there are also a bunch of devices from that same event which seem to be discontinued."	7	"['dalmarnock: From memory, the Polk React speakers can but they just look like someone has stuck a gen 2 dot into a soundbar, so perhaps it’s not surprising that they can join an Alexa multi room group.\n\nAs for other devices, the WiiM mini streamers (Mini & Pro) can be included in an Alexa multi room music (MRM) group largely down to their firmware having been developed using the Alexa MRM infrastructure stack.', 'antisane: Echo devices can only be grouped with other Echo devices.', 'Jimmy_the_Heater: There is a workaround.  Every echo dot up to 4th gen has an audio out jack.  You can run that into an input on a different speaker/Hi-Fi system and get multi room that way.', 'kenkiller: Most probably not.', 'RhesusMonkey17: WiiM streamers. Yep! Been using mine for about a month and for the money they have an amazing feature set, including Alexa multi-room streaming. A no-brainer purchase.😁', ""antisane: BTW, I say this as the owner of some (6 throughout my apartment) Sonos speakers. Since going Sonos I haven't listened to music on an Echo at all, there is absolutely no comparison, the Sonos wins in every category for sound. I still keep my Echos around for everything else though, as I did buy any of the Sonos with Alexa built in.\n\nALso, if you want to get Sonos sound for cheap, look into the Ikea Symfonix (all 6 of mine are these), they are Sonos rebranded  (in fact you need the Sonos app to set them up)."", 'RSKadish: Thanks.  I really appreciate your experience here.  Investing in Sonos was always plan A.  When I realized that my new Echo Dot produced ""good enough"" sound for my bedroom, I decided to explore plan B of Alexa multiroom audio.  Now I\'m going back to the original plan.  I\'ve ordered a Beam 2 for my new TV and a One SL for the bedroom.  All of this is to replace my complicated, IR-only home theater setup that\'s mostly more than a decade old, and allow me to get rid of my discontinued, unsupported Harmony Hub.']"

The furthest I could get is to the point where it attempts to connect to Wi-Fi, then it claims the password is wrong.

I have attempted multiple variations on SSID and passwords and encryption options including that of none. None of these seem to get past this point.

Chat support also had me go to the old Alexa.amazon.com site which looked promising at first but once I selected the device type to add, the page fails to load. I've tried Firefox and Chrome. Both claimed to be in some redirect loop, a problem on the server side, I would guess .

My access point is running openWRT. I'm considering trying an older access point thinking that there may be some cipher or encryption issue.

Does anyone have any suggestions? 

Support has offered me 50% off of a replacement, but honestly I like the aesthetic of the original gen 1 cylinder."	3	"['dalmarnock: In your Amazon account, under manage devices and contents, preferences, delete your saved wifi passwords then try again from the alexa website you mention.', 'cantsl: Update.\n\nI dug out my old iphone 6 and was able to use the older Alexa app to get my Echo setup again.', 'cantsl: The DELETE button was disabled.\n\nThe only option under ""saved network passwords"" was to DISABLE ""frustration-free"" setup.

VNzAbguvat	0	116rfpo	amazonecho	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/116rfpo/with_google_assistant_reminders_being_moved_to/	"With the news of Google moving any reminders made from Google Assistant, Google Now and Calendars to Google Tasks, I think Amazon should give deeper integration with services people already use on their phone or device(s). 

Right now, Alexa reminders are only seen in app, and unless you use one of the services they list like Todoist or Any.List, you are shit out of luck if you want to be reminded when away from your Amazon Echo or device(s) that have the Alexa app installed. 

Google moving to tasks is great for creating a coherent experience. Cortana did the same thing with Microsoft To Do before Microsoft chemically castrated her. Siri on HomePod hooks up to your iPhone (and depending on what accounts you have set up in mail, iCloud+Outlook+Yahoo). 

The best way to have customers engage more often with your product is not by forcing your own options, but rather seamlessly integrating into what they already use. Apple does this well when it comes to how calendar, reminders, and contacts work on Apple Devices. 



While we're at it, can Amazon please change the reminder sound? It is so unpleasant compared to other softer sounds from Google, Apple, and Microsoft."	0	[]

My Internet company is SpaceX StarLink, satellite Internet. (Elon Musk’s company) Not going to have it forever, so I’m dealing with it for now. My town is in the very late stages of getting Fiber Internet!  I am very excited as it is Gigspeed. As you might wonder, sometimes both my wired devices as well as the wifi on Starlink is not the greatest. For the most part, the signal is decent, but on occasion, the Wi-Fi does drop for a bit. I’m wondering what is the cause of this error message that I get on my first generation Echo Show? It obeys commands and everything. If I tell it to turn on the bedroom light, it will… as well with  every other light that I have in my house that is a smart bulb. But for some reason on the echo show when I give it a command, it has this error message on top.  Just curious if I could get some help or advice.  By the way… I also have the first generation Echo and Echo Dot.  They all work but because there are no screens on the others I don’t have to wonder about the error message as with the Echo Show. I’m including a photo of the error message. 

Thanks for listening to me babble.

I have a fan in the room so I couldn’t hear what she said, but a white light came on and stayed one for 10 minutes or so. It spookled me so I was going through my Alexa app on my phone trying to find a routine or alarm that would make her do that. I found NOTHING. After looking through the routines for a bit I started setting up the Sunset routine that turns the lights on as the sun sets, simply out of curiosity. However it requires an address and after what Alexa had just done I wasn’t sharing that. So I found random spot in a nearby town, and it made me label the spot. So I start to type “here or there” but on the word “there” I switched to swipe text. When I did that it looked like what I had typed was ‘cut’ and “get out get out get out get out” was ‘pasted’ there. The last couple of get outs were jumbled together. I PANICKED and locked my phone, I wish I would’ve taken a screenshot. But when I reopened my phone the label only said “I’m” and the location had moved to over my freaking house. I have never had anything spooky happen at my house before, and I never asked for this. I genuinely don’t know what to do. Do I burn the house down and move?

But I can't take it anymore. This started as a great tool to use in the home. I could control my lights, add things to a list, play music ... everything I wanted. Until Amazon decided to change it's primary function to marketing. 

So many times, I went through the settings of my devices and turned off anything that would get it to stop ""By the way!""ing me, only to have it start up again a couple weeks later. Now the changes revert even sooner. I've tried in vain to turn off notifications to stop the yellow ring from popping up ""reminding"" me of a feature I have yet to try (and don't want).  Tired of more and more ads appearing on my Show, despite me doing everything possible to lock that down on the screen. 

Seriously - I paid a premium, particularly for the early generations. I'd pay a subscription cost to keep updates coming, if only some company would stop treating these things as ad platforms.

Other complaints? Just scan this sub, I am sure I've experienced most everything anyone who has ever complained about their Echo. It all starts to pile up. 

So goodbye Echo. All seven devices are now deregistered and unplugged, awaiting disposal. I don't really have a replacement ... going to have a single Homepod just to play music in the kitchen and maybe add to a shopping list, but that's it. I tried Mycroft - still playing with that, but no idea how long that will be viable.

Today I installed Echo for my Grandma everything is working fine. The TV is already working and tomorrow I'll install the light switches.

Currently the Echo is sitting in the Kitchen. I've noticed that when saying something in the living room, the Echo sometimes has a hard time picking up what I'm saying(no background noise).

I'm looking for a Device, that basically forwards the voice commands to the Echo, so I can set one up for the Living Room. (Like a WiFi Repeater but for a Microphone)

I'm NOT looking for a WiFi Repeater, nor am I looking for a Voice Remote. (Wanted to make it clear because Google spits these out)

Using the Smartphone as a Voice Remote is also not an Option since she isn't very good with using the phone.

I thought about getting another Echo but is that really the only way? Is there a Cheap way? How is a whole house set up? There's no way they put an Echo in every room right?

You basically have to have a fluid conversation, or if you just want have Echo translate word or phrases perhaps, then you need to say these phrases without long gaps in between. Maybe I am reading a text and I need to translate a word here and there. 

The issue with both Google Assistant Home and Amazon Echo Alexa speakers is the time-out during translation.. that is e.g. I have the device translate the word and then I continue reading and find another word I want to translate.

The speaker waits for the word to translate, once it is finished it waits for the next word. There is a time-out however, after which the device goes to sleep (that's at least the issue with the speakers without display)

Time-out on Google Assistant seems to be even shorter than Alexa but both is definitively short for me. 

My question:

Is the time-out on the Echo Show device same? If I set the display on the Echo device to not to go to sleep, will it continue to listen to me for the next for to translate? Let's say I say a word to translate and then 30 seconds later I need another word translated. Will Echo continue handling the next word translation?

Or will I have to say again ""Alexa, translate from Spanish to English""?

This is the issue, if Echo doesn't hear anything, it times out and to start translation for the next word, I have to go through the whole process again and tell the full phrase ""Alexa, translate from Spanish to English""?

Ideally I would like to be able to set a time-out longer so Alexa continues listening to me."	2	"[""itoldusoandso: **~~Found an answer:~~**  **No this doesn't work - this feature doesn't exist.** \n\n[https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/conversation-mode-helps-interactions-with-alexa-feel-more-natural#:\\~:text=You%20can%20easily%20enable%20this,and%20looking%20toward%20the%20screen](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/conversation-mode-helps-interactions-with-alexa-feel-more-natural#:~:text=You%20can%20easily%20enable%20this,and%20looking%20toward%20the%20screen)\n\nWe designed Conversation Mode with your privacy in mind.

I took it home and plugged it in, but it seems to be stuck on blue light with green circling continuously. I tried turning it on and off for various lengths of time and I have tried to reset it by holding down the mute and down volume button for 20 seconds but nothing happened. Only thing I've been able to do is toggle the mute button on and off, and while messing around with it I noticed if I turn it off then hold the action button when I turn it back on it goes to a solid green light. 

I also tried turning my modem on and off, and tried the auto connect thing on it when I turned the echo on too. Neither of these worked either. I tried using a different power supply from my echo sub too but it was just the same.

I haven't really been able to find anything online other than how to reset it but as I mentioned that didn't work.

However, it says that the 4th Gen will be gaining this as well. Will the 5th Gen actually be an upgrade in this area then, or was the author just really excited to talk about it?	PokemonandLSD	3	11315hp	amazonecho	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/11315hp/researching_anticipated_upgrades_for_the_echo_5th/	"[Here is the article about expected upgrades from the Echo 4th Gen to the 5th. ](https://www.androidauthority.com/amazon-echo-5th-gen-3095027/)

[Article about Echo Gen 4 gaining support. ](https://www.androidauthority.com/amazon-matter-over-thread-3262939/)
>	At CES 2023, Amazon announced Matter-over-Thread support will be coming to Echo devices this spring, according to The Verge. Along with that support, the company will turn its Echo 4th gen smart speaker into a Matter controller and a Thread border router.

My primary purpose in getting an Echo was to help integrate smart devices - especially lights. I am particularly excited the potential this has. The 4th Gen already sounds amazing so the only thing I would really miss is the clock like the Dot 5th gen has. 

I found a new Echo Gen 4 for $35 on FB marketplace and a year-old used for $20 down the street. I want to pick one up and am just a bit confused by this article because the 4th Gen will have support, including for iOS, by Spring 2023 which is probably before the Echo 5th Gen. Will the 5th Gen have Matter over Thread capabilities that the Echo 4th won’t have?

If not, I will get one of these 4th gens now and save a lot of money + not have to wait for the 5th to be released and go on sale. 

Here is the excerpt from the first link that prompted me to post this:

>One thing we can say with confidence is Matter over Thread. Amazon has already delivered Matter on many devices and promised Thread for some, including the Echo 4th gen, so all that remains is for the company to offer both out-of-the-box in the next generation.

>What are Matter and Thread? You can read more about them via our links, but in short, Matter is a newly-launched network protocol that lets accessories work across all major smart home platforms. You don’t have to worry if products like smart bulbs are explicitly compatible with your platform of choice — in theory, they’ll just work so long as they have the Matter logo. The standard also reduces the need for hubs, bridges, and internet access by enabling local mesh networks.

>Matter over Thread should make the Echo 5th gen a cornerstone of many smart homes.
Matter can operate over Ethernet and Wi-Fi, yet it’s ideally meant to be used with Thread, a Zigbee-based wireless protocol. Many Thread products operate as their own low-powered “border routers” to which other Thread accessories connect. The tech is already in accessories like HomePods and Micron bulbs and light panels (see the image above).

>With Matter over Thread, the Echo 5th gen will likely be a cornerstone of many smart homes, pairing accessories from hundreds of brands. The real question is whether you’ll eventually be able to use the speaker itself in Apple HomeKit or Google Home, not just Alexa — the option isn’t in Matter 1.0, but might hypothetically come down the road."	2	['ahecht: > You don’t have to worry if products like smart bulbs are explicitly compatible with your platform of choice — in theory, they’ll just work so long as they have the Matter logo.\n\nhttps://xkcd.com/927/', 'PokemonandLSD: Right - I am more curious if the Echo 5th gen will have any capabilities that the 4th gen lacks.

No amount of deleting the devices from Google home, or moving them, or wiping the home etc and starting afresh would get rid of them. It's an issue permanently stuck on my Google account.  The only solution would be to move to a new Google account, which is totally impractical for me to do.\n\nBeing left unable to use any variations of the names of rooms or devices that we would naturally use was a showstopper. After 3 years there was still no fix.  My wife couldn't remember any new names for things. We were left with little choice but to jump ship, it helped that the rest of our family were on Alexa too.\n\nI've still got the Google devices, just in case. I keep meaning to trade them in but I'm nervous to do so to be honest.  I don't trust either Amazon or Google.  But with the issues we had, we had no choice but to drop Google.\n\nEcho show 5 devices are pretty weak and buggy, they really need a feature to reboot themselves every 24hrs, but there's no huge unfixable showstopper issues we've encountered so far and also no ads here. They've continued to fix bugs that I've encountered so far. Alexa has more skills and features, and the webbrowser covers almost anything that's missing.

For the couple years I had it, it worked like a charm and I LOVED the ability to turn the alarm off without having to physically deal with turning off a clock and telling it to set a timer. I got spoiled... I assumed it was the age of the device causing the problem and so my boyfriend got me a new one for Christmas. Nope. Same thing. I can't find anything much except for ""fixes"" that don't fix it in my searches. It hears me with every single thing except getting it to stop the alarm and setting a timer by voice. I have to actually touch the stop button (god forbid if I touch anywhere else, then it goes into snooze mode for an amount of time I do not want). I want to turn the alarm off by voice.

The Flex and one of the Echos are connected to Bluetooth speakers.

Is there a work around for this?

Then the feature seems to have been deprecated, with the Amazon help page on it being removed. Now it seems to be a mixture of some echos allowing it while others don’t.

Here is the question:

My brother's children and my children want to be able to easily call and visit with each other using our echo show devices we both have. The ideal scenario would be that my kids ask to ""call KID1"" and it only rings on 1 specific device in my house among the many I have and when my children call it does the same at my brothers house.

Is this possible? If not, how close can we get to that? I would prefer if the kids can use eachother's names instead of my name as the account holder. If there are any options what is the setup to do so?

Thank you in advance"	1	['brantome24: No, when you call an external contact, all devices on their account will ring. You can only call specific devices in your own account. To do what you want, they’d all need separate accounts and devices and have their account associated with a unique mobile number (this is needed during setup of Alexa comms).']

I know this is an old problem.  I began to use my 4th Gen Echo Dot with my laptop when those speakers went bad, and when I searched the problem then, I found a program Anti Alexa which made the announcement only happen when I start my computer.

My laptop has been going downhill and I bought a better desktop for running my CNC plasma program and Fusion 360.  I kept using the laptop for business and general stuff but my Bluetooth has been going bad as well, so I switched the speaker to the desktop.  Problem is, after sitting idle it disconnects and reconnects to Alexa and announces all the time then.  The Anti Alexa I had installed seems hard to find, and when I tried to send the zip file to myself through Gmail, it says it contains a virus.

I came up with the idea of finding a white noise background video on YouTube, and turning the volume down as low as possible.  Not ideal fix, but it got me wondering if there was a program that isn't a virus that makes a background noise without actually making noise to keep Alexa connected. Kind of like how a mouse jiggler keeps a computer awake. 

I don't want to hook a aux cord up if possible because I move this computer into my shop to hook up to my CNC plasma table and it's one less thing I need to deal with."	0	[]

TLDR; Alexa Kids account not working, removed voice ID so Alexa responds to child, issue has been reported to the developers by customer support. Located in Aus, unsure if bigger problem or just us. 

I first set up a profile for my son on Christmas day, enabled Amazon kids. Took over an hour and many attempts to set up his voice ID through the Alexa app. Once we did, all was good. A couple learning hiccups, but no problems. Until today. 

This morning, Alexa broke. Every echo dot in our house stopped working for my son. We have six echo dots and all were giving him the same message every time: ""I'm having trouble, please try again in a little while"". Except Alexa still answers me with no problems.

Standard troubleshooting; turn modem off and back on, then unplug dots one at a time, plug back in and let it reload. No success. She still wouldn't answer him in anything other than that one phrase. 

So, we contact Amazon. Follow their instructions, delete his voice ID. Once deleted, Alexa responds to whatever he asks without problem. So suggestion was to set up his voice ID again in the Alexa app (kids account has to be done in the app according to the app). Except this time, the app won't even register that he's saying anything. At all. 

Our issue is being reported to the developers and we await instructions and update on a fix. In the meantime so that we have particular functions, I added an adult profile with his voice ID which works fine.

Anyone elses Amazon kids voice ID broken? What country?"	0	[]

What I’d like to do is use them in the same room. The 2nd gen would be used with its internal speaker and the 3rd gen with aux out to my sound bar. 

The reason I want to do this, is the soundbar goes into standby after ten minutes of not receiving audio. If I have just one dot hooked up, and I ask it a question, it takes about 4-5 seconds for the soundbar to wake up and I don’t hear Alexa’s answer.

So I thought if I had a second echo dot in the room, then the echo using its internal speaker would answer.

But it seems like this doesn’t happen. While they both light up at the wake word, only the 3rd Gen dot hooked up to aux answers. 

I also tried assigning the 2nd Gen to a fake extra room so it would think it wasn’t in the same room and answer, but it still doesn’t work.

I know this is a weird situation.

My alternate option is to split the aux out on the echo to both the soundbar and a small external speaker, and I tried that but - the smaller speaker playing along with the full soundbar speakers sounds like a little echo-ish thing.

Or - is there any way to use the internal speaker along with the aux, at the same time?

Yes I know, it sucks that the soundbar goes into auto-standby and there seems to be no way around it so I’m trying to find another solution.

I have 2 echo dots grouped as a stereo pair but it doesn't mean anything outside of using Amazon Music. Paired or not, I can Bluetooth 2 echo dots to my Samsung phone simultaneously.

Or on the Amazon Echo app? It used to work well, and only occasionally would start in the wrong place. 

Also, is this as annoying to anyone else - the female “reader” will suddenly change the voice and try to add excessive emotion to the voice, always in inappropriate places out of context with the story. It is so incredibly annoying and I wish I could shut it off. 

Lastly - I have had no luck trying to figure out how to have it read to me, for example, for only an hour in case I fall asleep while listening. When I wake up the book could be finished!

He currently is still able to use his computer, but his vision seems to be getting to the point where he won't be able to see the screen well enough within the next year or so. 

He is tech savvy for a person of his age (ran a blog from 1998 until this past fall), but he has never used smart speakers or any really new tech like this. I would imagine he'd want to be able to play music, hear the news, and possibly use audio books. 

My question is whether it would be something that he could easily use or if it would be a pain. For example, for anyone using Audible on an Echo, can you easily pause a book and start it back up hours later if needed? I worry there will be too many steps and commands to achieve what he is trying to do.

Any input or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!"	11	"[""ChipBeef2354: Audible is easy to pause and such. Not sure on purchasing though.

PokemonandLSD	11	10nnemd	amazonecho	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/10nnemd/what_are_the_implications_of_the_matterthread/	"https://www.the-ambient.com/guides/matter-smart-home-explainer-guide-2676

My understanding is that ZigBee is being absorbed and recreated into a home network standard that all the major players afik have agreed on. Like a smart home Bluetooth network mesh, and it will allow things like Alexa to support products that otherwise wouldn’t interface. 

I just got an Echo Dot 5th G and got my lights connected and am not sure why I would need a ZigBee hub in the first place, like in the huge/expensive Echo 4th Gen. 

1) Can anyone help me understand the utility of this “Smart Hub” feature vs a device without one when using smart products that connect to the Alexa Store anyway?

2) It seems like being a “Matter Controller” will essentially replace ZigZbee and therefore make the “Smart Hub” feature of more expensive echo products lines?

3) Echo products won’t be Thread controllers. Few things will be. From what I read that seems like nbd but was also curious about thoughts on this"	8	"['ChipBeef2354: The implication is that We will see Amazon yet again screw it up and lock it down. None of the big players have any intention of operating their Thread and or Matter implementations in good faith.', ""rcroche01: Okay so let's talk about Thread and Matter separately because they are different things entirely.\n\nThread is a wireless protocol. Some say it is the next iteration of ZigBee but this is not really true. Sure, it uses the same frequencies and the same radios, but the Thread protocol is not compliant with the ZigBee standard. So it's new. Okay, fine.\n\nTherefore, to access devices talking Thread, you will need a hub that speaks Thread. Personally, I don't trust Amazon for this critical choke point in the infrastructure. And I say that as someone with eight echo devices and several other Alexa-enabled devices providing voice control in my house. Amazon's implementation of Thread will be designed to benefit Amazon.\n\nSo you need a mesh router that speaks Thread. Right now my smart home hub is SmartThings. I'm a little nervous whether it will properly support Thread, but today its a minor concern. I have no Thread devices. \n\nNext is Matter. This is a bit further off. Thread is appearing now, Matter is still a future concept AFIK. But it is the promise that all devices from all manufacturers (yeah, right) will use essentially the same drivers and speak the same language and be plug 'n play. How often have you heard that promised in the tech world???"", ""rcroche01: Okay, let's break down a smart home by layers to understand the function of each. \n\nFirst your devices need to connect to some network and that network needs a common protocol. There's WiFi, Z-Wave, ZigBee, Thread, and yes now Bluetooth. In my house I try to keep all IoT devices on Z-Wave and ZigBee.\n\nNext, in order for these devices to work on the network, the network will need some kind of hub or router (kinda the same thing). You've been referring to Echo devices as your hub. Honestly, Alexa is very limited in it's control abilities. It's a great voice assistant, but it's automation abilities are very limited. So I don't really consider it a functional hub.\n\nInstead, I look at things like SmartThings, Hubitat, openHAB, and Home Assistant as real controllers (hubs, routers, etc) for your smart home. I use SmartThings, but there are valid reasons for any of the listed ones here.\n\nSo, devices on Z-Wave or ZigBee all working on messages controlled by SmartThings. That's my house.\n\nSitting in top of SmartThings I have two technologies to help with control:\n - I use Alexa extensively but for voice control of SmartThings devices/scenes only. \n - Then for wall mounted control tablets and phone apps, I use Sharp Tools. Sharp Tools allows me to create screens that show status and provide control.\n\nAs for automations.... Here's is where system really diverge. Home Assistant is likely the most flexible but you need to be a controller. Alexa has some automation ability but extremely basic (I don't use it). SmartThings has automations but again not fully what I wanted. So, my Sharp Tools platform has a built in rules engine that meets my automation needs.

Right now it’s like pre-microUSB where every phone had a unique charger. \n\nAlexa leads smart device integration and could lose their seat if they don’t get onboard (and they already said they are, but did drag their feet at first)', 'PokemonandLSD: I mean… Bluetooth? \n\nThe wider this is adopted, the less attractive hubs and devices will be that don’t support it. Devices like the Dot are getting this feature and aren’t currently Smart Hubs. Amazon was reluctant at first, probably because it threatens their #1 spot as a Smart Home assistant, but (hopefully) realized this could backfire if everyone else adopts it to be more competitive. The list of *existing* devices that will become Matter Controllers is huge. They aren’t even holding out to make us buy new devices. \n\nI was using AppleHomekit prior to Alexa, and Govee won’t support it so you need to run custom software like HomeBrew off a computer or Raspberry Pi using Govee’s API to let them talk, using an Echo as a messenger. It’s stupid and I abandoned it. \n\nBut if Apple embraces this, I would switch over (as an iPhone user) due to how much better and conveniently native apps work and can be used. \n\nI am super into Smart Lights and have a ton of Nanoleaf panels which will be Thread hubs/controllers/whatever. That plus my Echo Dot 5th Gen will give me both without needing another Echo product. \n\nIt seems like an enormous and painfully coordinated project by so many manufacturers to just not implement it well.\n\nMaybe I’m wrong and it will flop, but I’m going to just use my Dot for now and return my Echo since I am not sure what the existing Hub feature is offering me at the moment. I am excited to see how this develops and will wait on fully investing in more Echos until it does (although a Show 8 on a really good sale might tempt me in the meantime so I don’t need to use my phone to open the Alexa app and make adjustments). \n\nHowever, you seem to understand this better than I currently do. I have two questions I’m still trying to understand:\n\n1) If Thread is like a similar ZigBee then what does Matter do? Act as a hub for it?\n\n2) What does the current Smart Hub and ZigBee support by products like the Echo actually offer over connecting things to Alexa and using the Dot? My Govee, Twinkly, Nanoleaf, OhLux, Hue etc all connected fine. Only my BlissLight 2.0 can’t connect (but I think that is a problem on BlissLight’s end). Can you give some example use-cases? Perhaps my current interest in lights is too niche and I’m missing the shortcomings of not having a Hub. \n\nThank you for your thoughtful reply.', 'ChipBeef2354: Their ZigBee implementation does not follow the Zigbee standards making them just another walled garden.

It's not really surprising that dedicated servers like Plex and Emby with dedicated apps became the go to solutions instead.\n\nAnd that's not even scratching the surface of what it was hoped that it would eventually be used for (including home automation). \n\nWith that said, I'm hopeful about Matter/Thread. If all the major companies don't unite under a single protocol then HA will never be all that profitable for any of them, so at least there's some motivation.

Because of this I have put a lot of money into outfitting my room in many ways so that I can get the most out of what life I have to live. When it comes to audio devices, I have chosen to place 3 Echo's and one Echo Studio in a type of surround sound configuration. The three Echo's were purchased first and then the Studio was my latest acquisition.

Honestly, I am not impressed. While the Studio certainly produces more bass than the regular Echo devices, it falls short when it comes to clarity of sound.

Amazon advertised a type of immersive experience, a enveloping 360° sound experience, which I have yet to figure out how to configure. I do understand that only certain songs have been recorded in this fashion, and I have tried listening to them, but I really can't hear what all the hype is about?

Now I'm not trying to completely dis Amazon's devices, as the Echo is a phenomenal speaker for the price. However, for the amount of money that the Echo Studio costs, I anticipated a higher quality product, with MUCH better sound. 

Maybe I got a bad device? 

My questions to the group are (if you have an echo studio, or have listened to one), do you have the same complaints, and if so are there specific settings I should try to improve the sound quality? Also, what is your opinion of this speaker, and what would you recommend Amazon change in their next version?

Hope Amazon doesn't blacklist me for this post! lol But I was really hoping to get something incredible when I purchased the Studio, and so far my experience has been really disappointing.

Thank you for commenting, and sharing any recommendations and or experiences you've had with the Echo Studio!

Also if I remember there’s a setup mode for spatial audio that you have to go through when you set it up. \n\nAnd btw I don’t think it needs to be in the middle of a square room to sound good. That’s not realistic. The point is that it’s supposed to adjust the output of its various speakers to its placement and your room configuration. \n\nAll that said, I don’t think you can expect anything amazing for $200. It’s a good speaker at that price but it’s still not competitive with higher end Sonos or whatever.', 'Dansk72: Do you have Music Unlimited or just Prime Music.  It makes a big difference because to get HD, Ultra HD, and Spatial Audio you *must* be subscribed to Music Unlimited.', 'stumbledotcom: The Studio was the first smart speaker I bought.

For me, the regular Echo and Dot speakers pale compared to the Studios.', 'Konquerian: I have 2 echo studios + sub paired to a fire tv cube 2nd gen in home theater mode for my small bedroom. When I stream movies and tv series from major streamer apps, the sound is actually amazing. The sound separation and dialog clarity are quite good. Although it can’t compare to my full sound system setup in the living room, but as a setup in my small bedroom, the sound stage is enjoyable. My bedroom has a flat ceiling, so it’s suppose to work well with upfiring atmos speakers. But since the upfiring speaker of the echo studio is pointing straight up instead of at an angle, the atmos experience is quite weak or none existing at times, so I do hope that they improve the upfiring speaker on the 2nd gen. Also, the echo sub adds the much needed bass that the echo studio alone or in a pair just can’t offer in the mix. I do wish that Amazon comes out with a bigger size sub or simply allow us to add a second sub to the setup. And building on that wish, I really hope that we will be able to add at least 2 more echo speakers to the setup, so that we can have actual rear speakers further enhance the surround sound experience.', ""ChipBeef2354: Has to be dead center in a square or rectangular room.

Hear a nose outside, tell the house to turn on flood lights and all five floods go on. Ask instead for all outside lights and the sconces come on too.

I’ve tried restarting the Echo, restarting the router and modem. I’ve tried deleting and redownloading the app. I’ve even tried Alexa.Amazon.com on my laptop but that kept bringing me back to the homepage when I tried to add a device.

To help people who may have the same question in the future, I\'ll post how I finally got this to work.  After hours of trying everything, I finally called customer service and found the fix (although it was still tricky).\n\nThe key is, during the setup when it is not working, you need to press the circle button for about 30 seconds until Alexa says ""Restarting your device.""  You\'ll then get a prompt asking you to allow Alexa to recognize local networks (make sure this setting is turned to On, and select continue).  I think there are a few more prompts (can\'t remember details, including selecting the Amazon wifi in your wifi settings- this allows the echo to eventually connect to your wifi), and then you\'ll eventually get back to the ""Searching for Wifi"" step, and now a list of Wifi networks should appear.  My actual router did not appear, so I had to ""add it."" \n\nThen, it should at least advance to ""setting up your device,"" but if you\'re like me, it also got stuck at this point.  So I had to do the entire process again (see above).  When I got back to the ""Searching for Wifi"" step, my router name did appear this time and I was able to select it.  Then at the ""setting up your device,"" it finally worked.  \n\n\\*One other note, during this process, you need to keep your app active. If you exit the app or even let the screen lock/go to sleep, it some how messes up the process.\n\nIt\'s odd that for this to be a 5th generation and Amazon product that there are so many glitches in the setup process.  I hope this helps people who have this question in the future (I realize the answer may not be super clear, but it\'s a little hard to describe the work-around in writing).', 'A-Hauck26: While it is searching for Wi-Fi and not working hold the circle button?

Also go into the settings on your phone and make sure you have allowed the Amazon Alexa app to always have location access. Then hard reset the devices again by holding the action button down for around 30 seconds.  Then the next time you try to set it up, or the time after that it should give you a sort of prompt during the setup about local settings mentioned in the previous comment.  It should work after that.  I also had to manually enter my Wi-Fi information, but it did eventually work.  I was able to replicate this with 3 separate alexa devices.\n\nApparently the echo devices aren’t compatible with WPA3 Wi-Fi security yet.  This was all a bit finicky but did eventually work.']"

KrissoLille	3	10ha1yy	amazonecho	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/10ha1yy/python_script_on_my_raspberry_pi_that_can_send_a/	Hello there.

Is this possible?	9	"[""Dansk72: You can setup a *free* Voice Monkey account, install the Voice Monkey Skill in Alexa, then once you've set up one or more Monkeys you merely have to Post an HTTPS command to [https://api.cvoicemonkey.io/trigger](https://api.cvoicemonkey.io/trigger) and the Voice Monkey Skill can trigger an Alexa Routine.\n\nAny number of Monkeys can be setup, each triggering a separate Alexa Routine.\n\nThe Python script can be run on any device that can send an HTTPS Post.

You can also trigger routines from smarthome devices changing states. So it kicks off a routine of your choice with the desired actions baked in.

The temperature sensor is used to control a switch through a routine. So far this has worked beautifully.
Unfortunately, the built-in temperature sensor is updated in too infrequently intervals, resulting in a large variation in the perceived temperature (confirmed by a non-smart temperature sensor). The temperature is queried by both the Alexa app and API calls. I noticed that the temperature sensor is not actively addressed, only Alexa itself returns the last stored temperature.
Now to my question. Is there a way to address the temperature sensor directly or adjust the internal query interval? Is the update interval for the internal query known?
I would be very grateful for a solution and thank you in advance."	0	[]

https://preview.redd.it/thg57qp0z6da1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=26f5119bf279acc736f0bd5317e34f9a0cb4563f

&#x200B;

I'm trying to create (or update, either way) a routine in the Alexa app. I go through the normal motions, like this: 

* Alexa App --> More --> Routines --> Plus (+) button at top right
* Give it a name --> Next
* Select a schedule, in this case ""Sunrise"" --> Next
* Add Action --> brings up a list for ""Add New""
* The second entry in the list is ""Smart Home""
* Choose ""Smart Home""

Normally, I would then be presented with a list of lights, switchs, Echoes, etc.

Unfortunately, now it just flashes what appears to be ""lights"" and ""switches"" and something else as categories (I think, it's very quick, maybe 200ms), and then it transitions to the picture shown. 

This all used to work fine. I have Routines set up that still work. I can still access all my lights and switches within the app. Voice commands for Routines work with my Echoes. I haven't noticed anything else broken except for this. I don't recall adding any new switches, dimmers, lights, Echoes, etc.

Note also that Amazon is accessing all lights through a Hubitat Elevation hub. All that's working fine as well. Network seems fine. I have power cycled both the HE and the network. 

Thoughts on how to fix this? I uninstalled/reinstalled the app. I am hesitant to uninstall my existing Routines for concern that I might not be able to reinstate them. I don't really want to rebuild everything...

Thanks."	0	[]

The main reason for the switch is that I miss my firestick in the livingroom. I have one in my bedroom and it’s just better for what I use it for. I recently switched to Apple TV and HomePods, they’re good but I’m missing certain apps that I got on my firestick that I can’t get on Apple TV. I have a smart bulb, a smart plug, a motion sensor and a eufy camera to watch my puppy. I would use my HomePod as a “sound bar” with my Apple TV in the living room and I’m wondering if I can do that with an echo? Another question is with the smart devices I have do I need to get two echos (one for the living room and one for the bedroom) as I believe the echo has a zigbee hub built, would I need this to control my devices or do I just need one? Or even two dots?	1	"[""mickAMMO: I don't think the Dots have Zigbee hubs in them, but the Echos and above may though.

I got the Dot 3 + free color bulb combo, plus another Dot 3 (no free bulb, but I got free shipping).

As soon as I got the box and opened it, my sister in whose house I live said, ""No. I don't want those in my house."" She gave no reason, asked no question, gave no hint of willingness to compromise. This is usual / common, so I decided not to ask anything.

Our other sister and mom live together, and they were fairly thrilled to get 2 Dots, a color bulb, and 4 white Merkury / geeni brand bulbs (I got for almost free on clearance at a Walmart) for Christmas.

Recent bought our kids an echo dot each for in their rooms. They are connected up and working fine. 

Both me and my wife have a Spotify account but at the moment it's mine that seems to associated with our amazon account. So when the girls are playing music it uses my account.

This causes 2 problems: 
1. I can't listen to something elsewhere if they are using it.
2. They both can't play music etc the same time.

Sometimes it plays one through Amazon Music instead of Spotify but then the next they ask for comes through Spotify again.

I guess I have 3 (1 more Spotify based really) questions:
1. Can you attach specific Spotify accounts to specific speakers? Ie mine to one and my wife's to another?
2. Is there another workaround to allow both to be able to play music at the same time?
3. (More Spotify based) if we had a family Spotify account would this allow us all to play songs at the same time on different devises, and again would we be able to select this on each speaker?

Thanks in advance."	7	"['Wayne8766: Main issue with Spotify even family accounts it won’t all multiple streams at once.

I’m trying to get my tv, sound bar (includes two small speakers, the bar, and a subwoofer - Vizio through wire connections) connected to my Echo Studio, Echo Sub, FireTv Cube, and Echo Show 8. All new and latest generation.

I have no idea if it is possible, but I was getting frustrated that I can’t get sound coming out of everything at once, which I know would sound amazing, and allow for great speaker location options.

I bought the Echo Link Amp in hopes that I could run an optical from the Tv to the Echo Amp then to Sound-bar system and the HDMI from the Cube to the Tv, and have that sync with the Studio, Sub, and Show when watching Tv or playing music. 

Right now I have the Echo Sub and Studio linked in the Alexa app with the Cube, but nothing from the sound bar. Or Optical from the Tv played through the soundbar but not other Echo devices.

The connections are:
Optical out (Tv) > Optical in (Echo Amp) > and Optical out (Amp) > Optical in (Soundbar)

HDMI out Cube > Tv 

Can the Cube and Link Amp sync with the Studio and Echo Sub somehow? Is there a better way to do this? Is it not possible?

1673506364.0	11-Jan-2023 22:52:44	Echo Show 5 Randomly Mutes Itself	LaSainte	3	109sxnt	amazonecho	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/109sxnt/echo_show_5_randomly_mutes_itself/	"I bought a FireTV on sale a while ago and it came with an Echo Show.  I did not want one, but I wasn't going to turn that down.  Just the other day I decided to give it shot.  I really only want to use it to control my TV.

I have an old-school, basic S/PDIF surround sound receiver hooked up to my FireTV.  This is the only speaker I am interested in using.

After some screwing around I was able to get my Echo to control my TV (More or less), though it is pretty terrible.


My main issue is that when I ask Alexa to do something it will mute my receiver part-way through responding.  I can't determine a reason.  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  It basically makes the entire thing useless because I have to unmute the receiver, and I can't really ask the Echo for any information because it just cuts itself off.


My Echo also does not turn on my receiver when I ask it to to turn on the TV.  This is not an IR issue, as I am aware that the receiver controls are being emitted from the FireTV remote.  It still doesn't work regardless of if the remote is pointed at the receiver or not.  I don't know if this is solvable, but it also makes it pretty useless.  No sound means no music.  I don't really see why this is the way it is.  If I ask Alexa to change the volume it controls the receiver just fine.


A third issue is actually playing music.  I use Pandora as my default music service.  When I do already have my TV on AND ask Alexa to play music AND it doesn't mute itself, it doesn't actually open Pandora on the TV.  I don't know how to explain what it does, but it is buggy to say the least.  Sometimes it'll show a fullscreen display with the song, or something it'll show a fullscreen display of the last song and never change, or sometimes it'll just play in the background with no way to interact with it on the TV.  I also can't find any effective way to change my Pandora station to one of my custom stations.


Sorry for the wall of unformatted garbage, but I think unformatted garbage is an accurate description of my experiences with the Alexa so far.  It's a real damn shame since stand-alone, the Echo Show worked great.  Considering it came with the TV, I thought it would interact better with it.


TLDR; My Echo keeps muting itself mid-sentence for no reason, and fails at every other task.  Please let me know if there is a fix to the above issues.  Thanks."	0	[]

This may include ordering stuff on your behalf (even if delivered to your house) or whatever else they can do with creds stored (if any) on the Echo Auto. 

Or is Echo Auto simply a temporary conduit to ANY smartphone w/ Alexa app that is currently paired with the device and doesn't store anything."	6	"['Famous-Perspective-3: not to worry, almost nothing personal is stored on the echo device.   most is stored on the cloud and whoever took it would need access to your amazon account.

The point of (1) Echo Auto needing an internet connection to do anything, (2) needing the Alexa app to get such connection, and (3) potentially having to deregister / reset to pair with a new Alexa app is an interesting point. I guess my concern was, related to (3) specifically - where is this the actual behavior? i.e. when a Echo Auto is initially paired to my device, are we sure it doesn\'t store/cache a session token that will get used (and not overwritten) when it acquires an internet connection via ""your"" Alexa app? i.e. essentially, after initial provisioning of device, it just uses the Alexa app just as a dumb internet tunnel. I would\'ve felt better about this, if this device allowed pairing with multiple devices..

* Spotify integration is patchy at best. Particularly when it comes to different users. It also announces each song before playing it, with no option to turn that off.

* Voice Commands are quite stupid, for instance I can say ""Alexa thank you"" at the end of a timer and it will respond ""your welcome"" and continues the timer.

* Multiple timers don't differentiate themselves in any way.

I was just trying the Amazon Alexa app in order to try a few automation stuffs before actually getting an Alexa device. While using the app, I was able to activate the Hands-free configuration and now on my phone I can simply say ""Alexa..."" and it works perfectly. (Worked so much that encouraged me to purchase an Echo Dot 4)

My problem happened when I tried to setup my wife's smartphone to do the same thing. She has the exactly same model as me. But when I try to configure the hands-free it simply doesn't work.

I have tried all configurations and mirror the same configuration I did for my device, but can't manage to make it work. I also have checked for app and Android versions to match. The difference between my phone and hers in the configurations I was 'messing around"", were two: Her MIUI version is one newer than mine, and in Alexa app, in hands-free option I can see that while my device has more options to configure hands-free, her app only has a button to toggle on and off, and I can't find a way to enable the same options I have.

I'm attaching some screenshots to illustrate what I'm saying.

I’ve managed to avoid all the echo problems I’ve read about recently but I’ve finally succumbed. 

“Alexa, play (my normal radio station I listen to)”
… no issues at all. Radio station plays fine. 

“Alexa, stop playing”
… Alexa merrily continues to play. I’ve tried Cancel, Quit, Cut it Out… and a million other things that USED to work. Now?  It’s like I’m being ignored 🤪

The only way it will stop playing is if I say “Alexa stop playing in 5 seconds” (or whatever time). Alexa will then cooperate and shut the hell up.

I wanted better sound for my digital listening that what I was getting with my more Analog setup. 

Liked the Sonos sound, but not the Sonos price. Read some reviews about the Echo Studio. Decided to purchase (Amazon) the echo studio and two new dots. 

The plan is to have the Studio somewhat central and use the dots around the main living space to act as satellite (filler) speakers. May add the sun later if needed. 

I have never owned or used a smart speaker. I just want to listen to music with decent quality. I flip flop between Spotify, Tidal, and Sirius. 

Am I going to regret this purchase?

Thx"	17	"[""Jimmy_the_Heater: Well it depends.  If you were trying to do whole house audio cheaper than Sonos, well the setup you bought will put music in the area's you put them in.

I started with one shortly after the product launch in Fall 2019. Today, I’ve expanded to a whole house system. There’s a Studio stereo pair plus sub for our open concept main floor. The group easily fills the 700 sq ft space with rich sound. Also have an Echo 4 stereo pair in the office, Dot 4 with clock pair in the bedroom and individual dots in the kitchen and bathrooms. If you can’t tell, I’ve come to realize that the stereo pair option greatly improves the sound—particularly with the Dots. That said, I’m not sure how a Dot stereo pair + single Studio in the same space would work. If it’s financially feasible, would you consider exchanging the Dots for a second Studio?', ""Wiffle73: Recently replace my old technics 5ch setup with 2 studios and the subwoofer. Used to have an echo show 5 hooked up via line into the technics and the sound was listenable, granted, not as good as playing directly from the technics.\n\nOnce I set the 2 studios and sub up I was gutted, it sounded terrible, I have at least 2 echo devices in stereo pair in every room in my home from dots to plus to shows 5 and 8s and it sounded worse than any of them.\n\nReady to send the new kit back I planned the next day to package it up and say goodbye. So glad I didn't, by some weird wizardry when I got up the next morning and tested the studios they sounded amazing.\n\nThe only thing I could put the change down to was giving my ears a reset, yes there was a software update and yes the system will periodically set itself up for the size and shape of the room but as with any new sound system give it credit for what it is and don't compare it to anything else, especially old tech.\n\nThe only downside I have found is to get the best from the studio is you do need Amazon unlimited music. 360 audio, spacial audio and hight definition audio provided by Amazon really brings the studio to life. I was a deezer family subscriber but changed this to Amazon unlimited family and it was nominally cheaper per month.\n\nThe sub is a must of you love kicking bass, I've found its over powerful at times but a simple turn it down a notch or two has worked a treat.

I stopped trying and have just been using routines through Hue lights app itself to have the light come on everyday at a certain time. Alexa was never able to do this even though the routine was set up properly and tested.

Fast forward to last night and I made a routine for 9 AM to turn the dot volume up to 5.  Made one to set the volume to 3 at 8 PM.  Easy to set up but of course she failed to run the routine this morning.  I ran it manually myself and it worked so not sure why she just doesn't do routines on her own.

Maybe it’s an issue between the Alexa app, Hue skill, and Hue app.  Or maybe you need to power cycle your router and devices.  Or maybe power cycle the Hue hub.

Alexa has gotten worse over the years, the extra talking (""by the way""), a decrease in understanding random questions and even cities for weather.  The only improvement was the addition of multiple named timers.  

But the final straw was what they just did to music.  Not only does it not seem to be as good, but it stops pretty quickly now if it doesn't think you are listening.  And the price, $15 just for music.  I wouldn't mind $8 but I already pay for YouTube music and Echo doesn't support it.  And I'm not interested in using it as a paired speaker.

I'm a little sad about it, Alexa was my first, and great for so many years.  I always thought as Alexa as the 'Apple' of the smart home (which is ironic since apple I guess now has a device).

I recently discovered (yes I know I am way late to this) that when I am streaming Amazon Music on my Echo Show 8, I can tell it to also play that same track on my other devices (but not all of them - this I don't get). So that got me thinking.  


The speakers in the Echo Dots aren't great, but they have 3.5mm outputs. If I buy a few cheap 2nd or 3rd gen Echo Dots off Woot and plug them into some nice powered bookshelf speakers, will that work as a way to have a cheap whole home audio system? Do the Echo Dots connect to 5 ghz wifi networks (that's what I have my Fire TV Cube and Echo Shows on), or must they be on 2.4 ghz? Assuming the Echo Dots can connect to the 5 ghz wifi network, can I start streaming Amazon Music on one of those devices and then tell those devices to stream the same media to the Echo Dots? If they can only connect to 2.4 ghz, can I still send the media from a device on the 5 ghz network to them? Does the audio match up really well across the devices, or is there a lag sometimes? (One time I tried this and my Echo Show 8 and my Fire TV Cube were off by nearly a second.)

The real problem is that any new integrations \_only\_ work with my original Echo group as well as my Alexa app but won't work with any new Echo devices I add, so my Ring doorbell alerts the 2 old Echo 1's but won't show up on my Echo Show - which is pretty frustrating.

Does anyone know how I can fix this?"	9	"[""normal2norman: From Amazon's point of view, your US and UK accounts are distinct, even though you may see both in the Alexa app.  So Echo devices registered to your US account are a distinct group from the devices registered on your UK account.

Yes, you can use Amazon Basics Smart Switch as a routine trigger.  I have some empty gangs where my light switches are, and an installing these to trigger routines. I have nothing connected to the load wire (note, it requires a neutral).

You can have it do up to two routines (one for on, one for off).  It's's not a true rocker, but rather a button, so hit it once to turn on, hit it again to turn off.

So basically, I now have a button that can do anything a routine can do, which I think makes it more flexible than any scene controller.  For example, you can have it play a specific playlist on a specific echo, or you can have it turn on the tv and change it to a specific station via logitech harmony hub, etc."	14	"['Aggravated-by-alexa: Now that is thinking outside of the box, I love it!', ""Rice_Eater483: I don't understand why this isn't universal!

I just bought an Echo + Amazon Basics light bulb. While the Echo is working wonderfully, the same cannot be said about the bulb.
I've tried to connect it a few times already and every time the setup goes good, Alexa says it's found it, but whenever I try to control it, the app says the bulb is unresponsive/unavailable.
Any help is appreciated! Thank you!"	1	"['hyperjes: I\'m having this exact issue. I just bought the Echo Dot 5, which came with the free bulb. I ordered two more of the same bulb so that I can use them in a ceiling fan light. Set-up went fine and the bulbs work, kind of, some of the time. They\'re all grouped under ""Lights,"" named  ""Light 1, 2 & 3."" Sometimes they\'ll turn on/off and sometimes they won\'t. Sometimes one or two will work but the other won\'t. Sometimes none of them respond. Echo lights up blue and responds ""ok,"" most of the time. Sometimes it just lights up blue and then sort of...gives up? When I look at the app on my phone at those times, often one or more bulbs says that it\'s unresponsive/unavailable. Occasionally, the whole light section just takes forever to load in the app in the first place. There are no other smart devices connected to the Echo and it isn\'t paired with anything else, other than my phone.\n\nI have fiber internet and (according to my IT techie roommate) a pretty good router. We live in a house, not an apartment or townhome, with our own wifi and no super close neighbors. No other device in the house has connectivity issues, including those in the same room as the lights and Echo.\n\nThe only other issue I\'ve had is that the Echo seems to go deaf and stop playing in the middle of the game when my kid plays 20 Questions with it. It goes blue while waiting for a response and then just stops the game. If kiddo asks it to restart 20 Questions, it picks up where it left off, saying something about continuing a game in progress. I haven\'t had that issue with any other skill though, so maybe that\'s just an issue with the game and it\'s unrelated.']"
