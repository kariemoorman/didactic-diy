>So unless we‚Äôre getting rid of our smartphones, laptops, etc‚Ä¶aren‚Äôt we all being spied on?

Three general points:

1. Feeling helpless against big tech does not absolve big tech from egregious and federally illegal wrongdoings. 
2. The amount of individual data Amazon has and can gather on you because you have an Alexa device and you have downloaded Alexa app on your phone would surprise you. You may think you are boring, however I guarantee you there are idiosyncrasies you wish people you never met never knew. Further, you don't even know how to delete that data. 
3. You are giving Amazon your hyper-personal data away for free; everything is accessible. You don't get paid for your data, data that Amazon makes millions of dollars from. It's absurd.

Playing devil's advocate: 

Why not livestream inside your home 24/7 on an open port (Wait... People already do that via home security sets like Ring cameras), leave your doors unlocked, keys in the car ignition, share your personal videos and images in a publicly accessible location, and advertise its location? 

Do you steal? If no, why? You can get away with it, other people are doing it all the time. So why don't you? The same logic applies to personal assistant tech like Alexa. Yet people seem so quick to make excuses for big tech, because it doesn't look blue collar, like petty theft. Theft is theft is theft is theft.

Sometimes it is about blocking competing traffic (e.g., let's try to route the request to Amazon Music, to increase our user traffic and decrease competitor traffic). Other times it's about internal failures related to routing and caching and ASR rewrites. The user request times out, or the user request is proactively cancelled at runtime (in hopes the customer will think it is the 3rd party skill like Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora and disable that skill in favor or Amazon Music), or the request is so modified that the services don't even remember what the original request was and so everything fails. 

Further, when you check your voice history, you'll see something that may or may not be truly captured by Alexa ASR, and is definitely modified at runtime. Therefore, you'll want to request audio samples from Amazon via a ticket, in addition to downloading your voice history that is surfaced to Alexa App. Because there are differences."	/r/alexa/comments/14n4lqz/apple_music_and_pandora_both_stopped_working/jqe9hts/

I mean, one could even write a quick dictionary of key value pairs that act as ENUMs, since all you want to do is a simple set of commands; nothing fancy. If Tuya/SmartLife App has an API then it would be quite simple. You would need to handle the following components: speech to text, tokenization, NER (for lightbulb names + locations), and mapping commands to specific API calls (turn on vs. turn off). That's it. 

It can be hosted locally on a cheap Raspberry Pi, it can be written as a browser extension (so you can use the computer mic), it can be deployed as an Android or Apple app (so you can use your phone mic). The word error rate in speech-to-text is an issue, however this can be fine tuned using your voice data as input (e.g., to handle dialectal variation). 

All of this can be built an hosted locally, in a privacy preserving fashion. Makes you wonder why big corporations such as Amazon abandoned this path, as they so clearly had this technology since at least 2018."	/r/smarthome/comments/149xlcc/is_there_an_offline_alternative_to_alexaamazon/jo8x71g/

Instead, I can tell you one way to get at it is to look at the privacy and ad policy for each service you use. You'll see Amazon listed as an eligible tracker. Plex, Spotify, and **many others** will show this. Safe to say that every time Amazon is listed, it is bypassing your OneTrust agreement re: info share and tracking. What they don't have they can buy and/or trade with other corporations (e.g., Meta). 

Amazonians can see all of your data. All of it. Know this. 

Further, because turnover is so vast, the security policies are lacking. This means teams of people routinely receive privilege escalations (instead of principle of least privileges). Which means whole orgs can see data not necessarily intended for them. As in, huge privacy and trust violations. Often. With this access, Amazonians can conduct all sorts of investigations about individual sets of customers. And CloudTrail never records it, due to gaps in software, and also gaps in policy enforcement and logging. It's not just external customers that Amazon spies on. It's their employees. Across all devices, personal and professional. 

It's very very illegal what has been happening. This 30 million is not even a slap on the wrist. It's quite likely a deal was struck with the government, regarding all this customer data (worldwide, mind you).

Plex is also a skill: [https://www.amazon.com/Plex-Inc/dp/B01NBB1INY](https://www.amazon.com/Plex-Inc/dp/B01NBB1INY). Seems like something has ""happened"" to render Plex less function on Alexa, e.g.,

Plex is also an app on FireTV: [https://www.amazon.com/Plex-Inc/dp/B004Y1WCDE](https://www.amazon.com/Plex-Inc/dp/B004Y1WCDE). Seems like something is ""happening"" on FireTV to render Plex less user-friendly, e.g., 

""We have a 2016 Samsung TV with the Plex app installed directly on the TV. This Plex app hasn't been updated in years and plays any movie or audio files flawlessly.  
Now we have the Firestick which is Updated frequently. This Amazon Firestick version of Plex chokes on many files. No sound is a common occurrence. Once this happens, everything else I choose has no sound. Thus a reboot is necessary.  
When I open the same exact file in Plex within the installed Samsung TV, that same file plays without a single hiccup.  
I've rebooted, cleared cache, reinstalled Plex and no improvement within the Firestick.  
I hope an agent from Plex or Amazon responds to this notation.""

However when breakdowns happen, an increasing number of reports are surfacing where customers are being told to ""call the cops and file a report"" in lieu of any intermediate customer service action. Is this account-specific? Is this based on demographics? I don't know for sure. What I do know is the customer is being increasingly burdened not only with incorrect orders and cancelled orders, but with police involvement. And at Amazon, one leadership principle is to ""work from the customer backwards.""

This doesn't mean the Amazon delivery driver who is correctly doing their job needs to catch all the heat either. However, Amazon has decided delivery drivers need to have cameras and sensors pointed at them at all times. Quite tyrannical. Further, it still doesn't solve the overwhelming issue of incorrect/cancelled deliveries.

So what's the next level of analysis? Amazon-internal decisions regarding logistics and retail. Neither of those are controlled by the end customer or delivery driver. This is to say, it appears the issue is not the customer nor the delivery driver's fault here. Yet, Amazon is pushing the burden of proof onto the customer to ""file a police report.""

However, I can go to Costco or wherever and pick up a ""home security system"" that I can set up fairly quickly. And unbeknownst to me I'm on a default setting which allows public access to all my cameras.

It's that kind of blatant disregard for public safety that is scary. Because it's all about pushing product, with less emphasis on ensuring customer safety and privacy.

\> Are those things likely? I say not due to targets and cost vs reward on the latter.

This has been shown time and time again to be a ""f around and find out"" mentality, where people end up finding out the hard way. Naked bathroom photos on facebook via iRobot vacuum cleaners (also owned by Amazon) are just the beginning.

It's incredibly short-sided to not have data privacy and security standards in place when selling smart home devices that access Wifi/Bluetooth and Alexa devices. Yet, there's Amazon, leading the way.

I understand there is a new person as CEO of Ring division, however this does not erase the **years** of known wrongdoing by the previous leadership and by Amazon.

Further, by linking to Alexa, you are increasing the number of viable attack vectors. Don't link your home security anything to Alexa."	/r/alexa/comments/125oiud/what_is_the_best_front_door_lock_that_alexa_can/jeasdgv/
1680196296.0	30-Mar-2023 10:11:36	new	Muted_Sorts	alexa	">I think there is a fair bit of security via obscurity/low profile here

I don't think so, unfortunately. There's a huge amount of posturing. But it costs money to maintain security standards. This is why Amazon took away basic features for Ring owners that don't pay a premium. Even then, it appears there's problems that keep happening (e.g., [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/11vqnie/ring\_app\_started\_to\_show/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/11vqnie/ring_app_started_to_show/)). 

Please also keep in mind, Amazon lies about issues with ease (e.g., [https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence)). This poses a serious risk to anyone using anything made and/or maintained by Amazon. 

When we can't trust Amazon, it becomes a very serious issue. And when we are talking about tech like home security items and voice assistants, this becomes crucial to critically evaluate the overseeing company. **When there is a proven track record of inability to trust Amazon due to Amazon pushing lies, deceit, manipulation, and gaslighting onto the customer, please second guess your decision to link your home security to Alexa.**"	/r/alexa/comments/125oiud/what_is_the_best_front_door_lock_that_alexa_can/jeao2e5/
1680141337.0	29-Mar-2023 18:55:37	new	Muted_Sorts	alexa	"It's that things are not as secure as we pretend them to be. Tech like the front door lock and home security systems are vulnerable to attacks in ways you can't see or monitor. 

When we connect stuff to devices such as Alexa, we increase our vulnerability because ""Alexa"" exists in the cloud. If there is a breach, we have to wait for Amazon to inform us and/or patch the vulnerability.

A pin is hackable (see [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35219281](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35219281) on how PINs can be brute-forced). 

Wifi/Bluetooth is vulnerable to hacking and man-in-the-middle attacks. Let's say your phone + Alexa share the same Wifi/Bluetooth connection. This means if you download an app that contains malware, or Apple/Android developers push a software change that includes a vulnerability, or the August lock company pushes a software change that contains a vulnerability, this leaves openings for hackers to intercept the lock/unlock signals and the voicePIN signal communicated to your Alexa device. 

And all the while you could not know it is happening. Until the hackers decide to execute an attack. You could then find yourself locked in/locked out, and/or you could be victim to robbery. 

How much control do you have over Apple/Android/August/Alexa software updates? None. How much control are you giving Apple/Android/August/Alexa to your home? A lot. A whole lot more than you can control in the event something goes wrong. 

Another example is OpenAi suddenly leaking customer conversations and billing information to random people due to a bug in the code. Customers could do nothing to control the ongoing vulnerability. Here, we're talking about locking the door to your home.

There still exists a big gap in what we want to be in place in terms of privacy and security, and what is actually happening. This is where I'm coming from."	/r/alexa/comments/125oiud/what_is_the_best_front_door_lock_that_alexa_can/je80aun/

1679091202.0	17-Mar-2023 15:13:22	new	Muted_Sorts	MachineLearning	"I agree about opportunities in AWS. No doubt. There are lots of cool projects and partnerships happening. Really interesting, fun, hard problems to solve at scale. And AWS has the software/hardware resources to handle it. It's actually incredible how much AWS has to offer in that regard. Some of it is not even available to the public, which is even more fun and makes the lure of AWS that much stronger. IMO, of course. Yea. There's some really, really cool stuff happening inside AWS.

For NLP I actually see this as empowering for people. It does require some re-skilling and up-skilling, but that fits with ""learn and be curious""; also natural interest in how things work, wanting to be a part of it, and having the ability to contribute. Nothing is truly ""off the shelf"" yet, so it's not a total waste to have expertise in NLP. Nevertheless it's not enough. Gotta grow.

IMO, the ""panic"" is the realization that change is required now. People don't like change. Companies don't like change. Like you say, lots of opportunity which makes it worth it. Also we have the issue of irreversible climate change so we're going to need to do something if we want humans to stick around.

DeepMind has developed more application-based contributions than they brag about. Their stuff is incredible, IMO. For instance their work with philosophers to develop models of how animals interact with one another (using Unity I believe) is just wow. AlphaFold is another ""wow."" One really cool part about that group is they just do it because they have to; it's an internal desire to ""know."" It's refreshing. It moves the needle in ways that are not easily understood by most and so it doesn't get the recognition it deserves by the broad tech/science community. IMO, DeepMind contributes serious, foundational, rigorous, theory challenging work that informs us of ourselves and our world at various scales. And on that foundation sits AGI.

For transition to commercial ""success,"" Google scraps more projects that would turn hundreds of millions of dollars in profit that people will admit. Google is just that big. Problem is that it leaves developers empty; without a ""finish"" or a ""goal completion"" (humans need that). Hopefully we as a tech community can move past the cheap thrills of low-tier ""Advertising"" as a primary source of cash grab. Google can lead the way, if/when they want. So can Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Make engagement and adoption worthwhile. Quit reducing human interaction to a mere 5-10 seconds of dopamine. Build trust.

For Microsoft, it'd be great if they could use GPT to detect and fix the vast number of vulnerabilities and bugs that dominate majority of their services.

Amazon invested in ASR rewriting of customer utterances, to take over 3rd party skill offerings (e.g., Spotify traffic, Sleep Jar ""sounds"" traffic). Yes, that's illegal.

The issue is three-fold: (1) your customer utterances are being rewritten without your knowledge or ability to override it, (2) Amazon Music team can't cache their catalog offerings correctly and so customers will repeatedly endure Alexa offering you the wrong song and/or wrong artist over and over again (when you complain your tickets just sit there; Entertainment teams can't fix it, for over a year now), and (3) Amazon has a reduced catalog of music, far smaller than advertised, and so is giving you a subpar experience in hopes you will spend more money.

Advice: Don't spend more money. Why? Amazon Music is a subpar service, with a subpar app. Read what other customers are already saying in this and other amazon subreddit channels as independent confirmation.

Also, u/Wayne8766, stop trying to compare Amazon Music to Spotify. It doesn't deserve the association. Amazon Music is a bootleg Pandora at best. Downvote all you want, but the customer complaints for the last 2+ years don't lie.

Prime delivery takes more than 2 days, with no assurance of quality control or ability to easily return items and receive refund. Prime Video and Prime Music now require you to pay more for basic services. Prime Video tricks you into renting instead of selecting free content. Instead of one-off payments you are signed up for subscriptions. It's hard to figure out you've signed up for additional subscriptions, and even harder to unsubscribe. Prime Video quality is poor, the UI is outright offensive, and voice commands don't work most of the time. With Prime Music you don't get a whole album of anything, the available catalog is much less than what is pitched to you, the volume is messed up, and there's constant playback issues (e.g., the song skips around). Even when you pay $9.99 more for Amazon Music Unlimited you deal with the constant playback issues, along with a really awful app.

It's cheaper, better quality, and much more reliable to independently sign up for Netflix, HBO, Disney+, Spotify, and other video/music streaming services than it is to use Prime.

Edit: To Amazonians who keep downvoting, instead of wasting your time on Reddit, please fix your services."	/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/11t02az/why_do_i_have_to_pay_to_rent_or_buy_some_videos/jcilure/

Suggestion:

If you are using a model < iPhone 7, strongly consider upgrade.

Make sure you are current in your OS (and all your other Apple devices). The fixes from February 2023 patched a huge vulnerability in Webkit that allowed any app (e.g., TikTok) access to all your data. And your mic. And your camera. If you're current, that's one less thing to worry about.

Also read the terms of service (e.g., download it and search). Make sure it explicitly states that TikTok can't access all your photos/videos. Just double check. Same with mic access. Once you check ""yes"", can TikTok open your mic channel without you first prompting it (e.g., making a video; using voice-to-text)?  If it doesn't explicitly state it, it means they can do it. Whether or not they actually do it is another thing.

(1) Alexa mic is open when you don't prompt it, so Amazon is  taking more demonstrative action internally to actively hide that from you (the person being spied on),

(2) Alexa performs actions based on internal incentives, not customer requests (and you'll find out if you ask for Alexa to repeat what was heard, so let's block that functionality), and

(3) Amazon is actively destroying the data, to coverup their wrongdoing, in hopes this will prevent a class action lawsuit and/or huge fines from SEC and international equivalents (it won't).

Interestingly, Alexa (and Amazon) is admitting with this new response that they did knowingly leak sensitive customer data related to healthcare (i.e., AlexaCARE). And they're making the decision to further obfuscate Alexa interactions in hopes you'll stop caring about Alexa spying on you and Amazon mishandling your data, your privacy and your security. Wow.

(1) US Tech Corporations (e.g., Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple) are losing huge profits, as people have migrated to TikTok.

(2) US Tech Corporations (e.g.,  Meta, Amazon, Google, Palantir, Apple) gather ungodly amounts of data about us every day, without our knowledge or consent. They then trade that data for kickbacks and government subsidies. If US Corporations lose all that data, they can't get all that government $$.

(3) Freedom of speech, and information share. US Corporations receive kickbacks for media censorship, which in turn restricts the information available to parts of the United States. It becomes difficult to execute propaganda campaigns when you are losing your customer base to TikTok. Can't let the people know the plan as it's being carried out, else they may rise up to defeat it.

(4) US Tech Corporations (e.g., Google, Amazon, Meta) have repeated tried to infiltrate TikTok to take profits and cause service disruptions, with little success.  If Big corporations violate TikTok service agreements, ByteDance can sue those corporations, and win.

(5) US Tech Corporations (e.g., Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft) don't own the contract for managing TikTok data, which means they can't access it and/or sell it off in the form of under-the-table deals (again without our knowledge or consent) without permission from ByteDance and/or Oracle. This poses an issue because they've faked their earnings reports for enough years that without this backdoor data brokerage, some tech companies may go bankrupt.

(6) Recall #2 and #5. US Tech companies are well aware of their dirty deeds, and now they are under threat of a non-US company leveraging the same campaign, at their expense. How many government officials used TikTok in secret locations, with possible classified information share? How many tech employees used TikTok and knowingly or unknowingly shared classified information? And in general, how much data does China actually have via TikTok? We can't reliably verify this.

Do note, this could have been addressed if corporations and government actually gave a shit about data privacy and security in the US. However, corporations saw fit to put profits over people, and lie about their own security practices and their financial positions. Government cosigned it. And now, here we are, enduring propaganda campaigns aimed at stirring up hate for all things Chinese.

Push US companies to build better, safer technology instead of banning TikTok, as this would actually protect the United States and its residents.

Anterior cingulate gyrus controls behavior regulation, including emotion processing and vocalization of emotion. It's linked to social cognition and our pro-social capacity.

If I understand the article and paper correctly, after suffering sexual abuse, a child's brain has a hard time grounding itself spatially, and is in perpetual fight-or-flight mode. More things are perceived as threats when one cannot ground oneself or others visuospatially. Perspective taking is negatively impacted, as the brain is at reduced capacity to link to working memory and update perception (i.e., once a threat always a threat). Attention regulation is impacted. This helps explain the link to borderline personality disorder and panic disorders, and why victims have a hard time talking about their trauma. The brain changed; it's really not their fault. And it points to PTSD/cPTSD stemming from child sexual abuse as a possible source of widespread ADHD misdiagnoses. It can also help explain one's susceptibility to cults, due to their rigid, repetitive structure; it's predictable, and that predictability is perceived as safe even when it's objectively not.

You want reviews? Make a product/service you think is good, release it, ask verified purchasers for feedback. If you coerce a verified purchaser, then the review is deleted and your product offering is dropped (i.e., reranked to the bottom of page 1, then page 2, then page 3). In this way, you've incentivized ranking a no-review product above a fake review product. And, buyers learn you tried to cheat the review process and take advantage of them.

When Youtube came out, I watched videos; engaged with the product/service. I never received an email asking me to provide a fake review of it. Instead, I liked so much that I shared videos with my friends, resulting in them using Youtube and sharing videos with their friends. Same with TikTok, and Facebook, and Apple Macs + iPhones, and Amazon. When Facebook started to suck, people stopped using it.

Today, a whole bunch of bots pretending to be Facebook users won't change the fact that a significant portion of the population believes Facebook sucks and is not worthy of engagement.

When you erode customer trust such that no one believes any reviews because it's all fake, people will stop engaging with your stuff altogether.
