\- Where is the best place to learn and improve golf in Chicago area? I am in the Southloop.

I was hoping to receive some assistance. Thank you in advance. 

I am currently in TN and intend to reside here. I am working for a MA based company and intend to continue to work for the company. I have reported this to the HR and my paystub reflects my new address. 

1. Besides occasional travel to other states including MA, how will I be taxed?  Should I pay MA tax to avoid fines at the end of the year?

2. What do I need to do prove my new residence in TN? 

3. Do I need contiguous residence without any travel in between?",24,"['quakerorts: Normally you pay taxes where you actually perform the work, but with the new dynamic of remote work, that might change.\n\nYour employer will need to register in TN for employer accounts to pay unemployment taxes and possibly other things to TN.\n\nYou will file a part year resident return with MA to report only the wages earned in MA. \n\nCheck your paystubs to make sure wages are being reported to TN and not to MA.', ""tariqabjotu: You don't owe MA tax just because you're working for a MA company.
