Yeah, **I** can get by with the FIreTV app on my phone, but... that won't work for the seniors.

I hope you can help me because amazon's chat is no help.  We have a fire tv registered under my husband's account and we have a family plan and we have already joined together. We have a family amazon prime music account. BUT I can't log in to my own account on the fire tv. So if I listen to music it's just his playlists, and I'm messing up his algorithm. Amazon chat says to unregister and reregister the fire tv under my account, but that can't be done every time we just want to listen to music right!? Please help.

Update: Here is what chat says

 

As I checked and see that Pre installed app only you can able to access on your Fire TV,Courtney 

You can not able to sign out , sign in that the reason I request you to de-registered and re registered the device on your account,  Fire tv play song under registered account only you an't able to switch the account,Courtney 

Only you can able to switch profile in Echo device 

currently there is no option to switch profile on fire TV,Courtney 

To help you with it, I'll take this as a feedback and forward it to the appropriate department for consideration. We will carefully review your suggestions.  

I’ve forwarded your concern to our development team and we'll consider your feedback as we plan further improvements. We're regularly working on improvements to your device experience."	1	['dalmarnock: They’re correct, you can’t change to a different music account on a fire tv - it’s locked to one Amazon account and the only way you can change that is to set it up under that different account.\n\nBest you can do is share a playlist from another account via email link - open that link in the amazon music app (on your/his mobile) associated with the account the fire tv is in, heart/follow that playlist and then hopefully you can see that under playlists in the fire tv app.\n\nIt’s an understatement to say that apps, echos and fire tvs aren’t that well integrated when it comes to amazon music and multiple users…']

I have a Toshiba\_TF-43a81ou21 that I had for a few years. After getting real sick of it constantly being out of space I did a factory reset to see if starting out fresh and installing some of my apps and transferring them immediately to an external storage would help.

But much to my shock, once I did that I lost access to the developer options, and more importantly, to be able to install apps from unknown sources.

I know that in these TVs they should be under ""Device and Software"" instead of ""My Fire TV"". but the option for Developer Options is not there...

it only lists 

* About
*  Legal & compliance
* sleep, restart 
* Reset to factory options.

I did a search for Developer options and got an option to install it, which I did. However, when I told it to open i just got the same old ""Device and Software"" menu with the same options....

So then in downloaded another app called ""Developer Tools Menu""

That had a bunch of useless options but it also had a couple that seemed relevant, called  Advanced Options and another one called Developer Tools and put them both on, still nothing...

I know that I had that option before since I had a couple apps that I had installed previously and quite honestly are the ones I use most often. But ever since that reset I simply cannot seem to tell it to accept unknown sources anymore.

I honestly do not know what else to try at this point. I hope someone can help shed some light into this situation because not  being able to install those two other apps I had before basically renders my smart tv useless to me.

The model number of the TV is NS-75031NA22.

But, it sounds like that TV is not compatible with echo home theater which I don't understand. The TV has eARC. I thought that was what was needed in order to use the sub and echo studios as a 2.1 sound system.

What am I missing here? Is the echo home theater only compatible with the Amazon branded fire tvs, but nothing else?

So if that's the case, what are my options? Is there any way to use these studios + sub as a home theater system? What if I hook them up using the optical audio cable, would that work? Would I have to connect them both or could I connect only one and have it pair wirelessly with the other and the sub?

She has an older high end Sony 4k TV and uses a Freesat satalite box to watch TV.

I can use the Alexa button and say ""switch input to HDMI 1"" which works great but she struggles to nail that phrase everytime. If I could make it work by saying something like ""switch to Freesat"" that'll be much better. 

Ideally if I could get the live TV button to switch the inputs that'd be perfect but I doubt that's possible.

The app menu screens are fine. Other apps work fine. What’s the problem?	1	"[""wasp898: I have the same problem. It seems that Fire OS mis-detect whether HDR is supported by the TV, so it tries to play HDR content even when it's not supported. Sadly, I don't think HDR can be disabled via settings on most devices, but you can look into yours. I think Fire Cube or like other newer devices do have a setting for it.\n\nMore details on HDR here. It means High Dynamic Range, which is a format that allows  videos or photos to encode the darkest details as well as the brightest ones. Imagine taking  a picture of a sunset... sometimes you are forced to focus either on the sun or on everything else, thus making either the sunset look pale or everything else darker. In theory, with HDR you can have both, which is closer to how our eyes perceive the environment.\n\nStreaming services will encode content in HDR which is a higher quality format (and sometimes make you pay for it, like Netflix). Your device - mainly your display - will have to support HDR, meaning that it has to display a wider range of colors. That's mainly a brightness thing actually. Most displays, including TVs, can display up to 500 nits of brightness, but you need more than 1000 nits to properly display HDR content. If the streaming device - like the fire stick - misdetects whether HDR is supported, it will try to play the content in the wrong format, resulting in a muted or darker tone to the video, as the lighter details will have brightness values that cannot be achieved by the display.\n\nEvery streaming service will anyway encode content in other formats, which would be picked up instead if the TV does not support HDR. If the Fire OS settings allowed HDR to be disabled, every streaming service would automatically stop delivering the wrong format to your device.""]"

I'm a bit stuck in setting up my bedroom fireTV Stick.

I have an old 26"" Samsung TV which is controlled just fine by the fireTV remote. However, I use the LineOut of the TV (because its speakers are terrible), doing that I can't control volume through the TV anymore.

I have a small class D amp (noname) which works fine, however I have issues get it to work with the remote. The Stick tries two sets of commands when I choose the ""not in list"" option, then it gives up. I had to choose Soundbars because with AVRs, it doesn't even want to try.

Basically I only need on+off and volume up+down. I already found out the exact IR codes for these with an Android app. I mean, I guess there is a chance that the IR protocol is the same as some device I just don't know about - so I guess my question is, is there any database where I can slam in the IR codes which gives me names of brands which use the same?

Best Regards

//edit - just in case someone from Google lands here. I don't have a solution, but I found a workaround. With this project: https://github.com/mattcuk/IRtranslator you can build an intermediate device which translates Amazons IR codes.

The Fire TV OS is becoming fairly capable at gaming with Amazon Luna and Android games kicking off Amazon's new gaming hub. 

But, in just a few minutes, you could be playing Xbox Game Pass Ultimate titles as well (over 300 of them). There is no official Xbox Game Pass app, but you can install and use the Android app in minutes.

One of our writers, Pedder, put together some step by step instructions for getting it going:

My Fire Cube (Ge 3) is in the AV closet, connected to the AV receiver. I also have a few other sources connected to the receiver.

I successfully set up my Projector (as a TV) and Receiver (as an AV Receiver) in the setup. I can successfully turn the volume up and down on the AVR with the Fire Cube remote, which verifies that the internal IR blaster in the Fire Cube can successfully get IR messages to the receiver. I've also verified in settings that the Fire Cube has detected the correct receiver range (RX-V6A).

But now, when I try to switch inputs, the Fire Cube only seems to be able to change inputs on the projector, which is useless to me, and most users with switching handled by an AVR, I would assume.

Every time I turn on my TV, it's logged into someone else's account on Spotify, TUBI, or another app. I'm also concerned about the privacy of my Ring Cameras, including my doorbell and spotlight cam. I've noticed that if I use the remote app on my phone, it shows other people's Fire TVs.

As a low-key person, I'm worried about people viewing what I'm doing inside my unit. Even though I don't use my real name on the account, it shows my real name as a user. Is there anything I can do to keep people off my device besides getting my own internet plan?

The reason being is that a travel router can act both as a client to the complex wifi and act as its own wifi AP with a router in between all in one nifty package.  I'm a fan of the TP-Link AC750 Travel Router (TL-WR902AC) as it supports 2.4GHz and 5GHz in client mode and produces both 2.4GHz and 5GHz for your devices.\n\nI used it on a cruise ship recently where I had one Internet access account via ship's wifi, but I had to have my phone and my laptop online at the same time.  Rather than buying two Internet Access accounts, I bought one, used it to authenticate the travel router, then connected my phone and my laptop to the travel router's AP instead of the ship's AP and I was up and running with no issues.\n\nThe reason why I like the TP-Link is its versatility.  You can configure it if your network needs change later on and it's small enough to toss in a bag when I travel.  I do other advanced configurations with them and really make them work.

Recently I've purchased a Toshiba 65QA7D63DG with Android TV onboard, but I like my TV Stick better so decided to use stick with this TV

Stick successfully detected the manufacturer and 910 ir-profile was selected

The problem is that everything works fine excepts the Power Off function. When I click on Power Off button on TV Stick remote, TV switches screen off for а second and right after that turns on again

And the funny part is that sometimes I can turn off TV without any problems on the first try, sometimes on the 10th and sometimes just can't and have to use original TV remote

Mute button works in the same way, but volume can be controlled with +/- buttons, so it's not a real problem

Off course I've tried all other profiles for Toshiba and different remote setting regarding timing and repetition

Was even browsing through other TV manufacturers produced by Vestel (like Toshiba) and found that JVC/Alba/Bush profiles can be used also, but the problem with power button remains

Looking for an idea how to debug this issue

If you are using Fire TV Stick with Toshiba, please share the ir-profile number you are using right now (mine is 910)"	1	['vahrameev: solution was very simple - update remote at least to 134 firmware']

It was cheap and had Fire TV functionality so it was perfect for the bedroom.

Eventually it slowed down and always ran out of space so I bought a Gen2 cube.  Reset the TV, made it ""dumb"" and had it just use the last input and did everything through the cube.  Everything worked great.

&#x200B;

I upgraded to the Gen3 cube and for some reason the remote that comes with the TV, even though I paired it with the cube, only controls the TV.

&#x200B;

Fire TV functionality is not enabled on the TV.  There are no remotes paired to the insignia fire tv, and HDMI CEC is disabled, but I cannot use the remote that came with the gen3 with the cube.  Home takes me back to my inputs list on the tv.

&#x200B;

I bought the Alexa pro remote and that works how it should, but I cannot turn the TV off with the pro remote.  The TV turns off and back on.  I have to say ""Alexa, turn off the TV"" to turn the TV.

Before I did this, I upgraded my Gen2 in the living room with the Gen3 and I do not have these issues so it's strange and frustrating.

&#x200B;

I just bought Fire TV 4k Max but the problem is that I live in Slovakia and here its not possible to buy this device so I bought it from Austrian E-shop. The problem is that apps like Showtime or HBO MAX are in appstore Unavailable. I can see them there but I cant Install them as there is stated ""Unavailable"". I found it its because Im in country in which Amazon services like these are not supported. I bought this device so I can be able to watch showtime and hbo max. But now Im unable to do so. I can download them via third party appstore and they work but not like they are officially installed on the device so for example I cant use voice commands. Question is, how can I make those apps available in amazon app store? I tried VPN to set to Austria, United Kingdom or USA but nothing works. Im desperate.

For instance, I'm watching SlingTV. Stop watching a program. Exit to Home screen in FireTV. The next day I turn on the TV and the screen flashes by the Home screen and goes to SlingTV  


Rinse, repeat no matter which app.  Same is happening on both TVs I have

I have a LG `55UM7100PLB` smart TV ([specs](https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/3c4e1909)) and a Fire Stick 4K Max (latest `v7.6.3.3`).

I got a couple of 4K videos Dolby Vision that are not playing well (I'm using both latest *Jellyfin* official app and *Kodi v20.1* to play them): the videos start playing, audio is on, playing fine, but video is just black!

**Important to notice**: all videos play just fine when playing via USB drive directly connected to TV, so my TV just supports Dolby vision and all!

The Fire Stick is connected directly to the HDMI port (no adapters) and WiFi speed is very high (those videos are played via LAN network). I tried to change HDMI port and switch to another WiFi network, but same result. I  also tried to disable *HDMI ULTRA HD Deep Colour* on my TV and to disable HDR on the Fire Stick (it was set to Always on), but still nothing changed.

The Diagnostic tool on the Fire Stick says that Dolby Vision support is **OFF** and it just makes no sense, since my TV supports it and plays Dolby Vision movies via USB!

Any idea on how to fix my issue and play those videos fine?

**update**:

it seems that my TV does not support Dolby Vision but it does support HDR10 and HLG, so the fact that I can see those movies from USB it's because of some compatibility profile! So, if that's the case, is there a possibility to transcode only Dolby Vision files (in Jellyfin or Jellycon or Kodi)?

Thanks"	6	"['Somar2230: Your TV does not support Dolby Vision it does support HDR10 and HLG.  Some Dolby Vision profiles have a compatibility base that will play on your TV.

I understand that they are not necessarily compatible out the gate with each other but I'd like to sync them somehow. I hate the regular FireTV's commercial buttons of Netflix/PSTV/HBO/etc and wanted a sleeker look.

I've tried both holding the home button and doing the combo of left button + return + three lines and neither of them seem to be able to work. Is there anything more behind the scenes I can do? I figure if both are bluetooth it must work somehow, given you can use a PS4 controller as a remote for this TV."	4	"['Richg542: No, it is not possible..', 'rmalbers: [AFTVnews.com](https://AFTVnews.com) had an article a while back that showed which remotes work with which ftv devices.

But, if you went the try and get help from Amazon, it's the same answer to every question. We are sorry you are having this problem, try unplugging  the device for 30 seconds and plug it back in. Have a nice day. \nDickHeads. You can look at 100 issues, and that's all they say. In other words. Your on your own, go away and stop bothering me. \nAnyway, i think the blue light is the pairing light for the remote. All these smart devices, and every second day, they unpair the remote.  Since you have done the unplug and remote reset, you may have to go to a factory reset. Which you shouldn't  have to do. They have no answer no fix, so what? Next week  you have to do it again. It's  not just your tv, it's almost every smart tv device on the planet. Just google smart tv won't boot, and you can read about 100s of them and 100s of videos. \nThe other ridiculous thing they want you to do is  don't have anything connected to the tv. Try a different wall plug, one idiot said take the tv to a different room. Are they for real? Unplug the router for 10 minutes, some of these devices won't boot up if they can't reconnect to wifi and bluetooth. I don't know what you can try now, before a factory Reset. Try the router and tv shut down 0nce more,  and I think the last thing I read was, when you turn it back on, do nothing for about 20 minutes and hopefully the screen will change, I don't know what it will charge to, they didn't say. Maybe grey instead of black. Has that tv got a reset button on the back somewhere?

It might have pooped out.', ""dracsbak: Is its power supply ok? \nIf it is, unplug it completely for 10 minutes, I'll tell you why. \nFor the last months, I have been looking and forums and Technician websites and Youtube. Dozens or hundreds of smart tvs, fire tvs, android tv boxes are all having issues with sound, power, Bluetooth, wifi, remote controls devices turning off, not turning on, you name it, it happens to 1 device or another. All the advice, including the customer care service for the brand, is, try a reboot, however it's not good enough any more, the new method is called a power cycle. The device, including the router has to be completely disconnected from the power at the wall for at least 10 minutes to drain off residual power. You can speed this up a bit by holding the power button for a few minutes if it has one. Some devices are worse than others, where everything has to be unplugged and once the device is back up and running everything can be reconnected,  or paired again one by one and this not only happens once, but some devices are having these issues every week or 2.\nIf the power cycling doesn't work, it's factory reset. Some people are giving up and finding something better. One brand of tv box is so bad, you can't use any of the ports at all, all external with their own power supply. Philips tvs, Toshiba fire tvs, and other fire tvs are all copping it. I have 7 android tv boxes and not a problem because, they need daily if not every few hours, all the running apps force stopped, all the system cache cleared, the cached data cleaned, and completely shut down with no power connected, these manufacturers, have no cleaning tools or advice other than shut down, reset, unplug and so on.

Is it some technical limitation that can't be fixed?	gen66	2	12bqcyn	fireTV	https://www.reddit.com/r/fireTV/comments/12bqcyn/can_someone_please_give_me_a_reason_why_my_sony/	"
TV is Sony X900F (XF9005), firestick is connected to the correct hdmi port (2), only 2 and 3 suppor hdr on this tv.   
I just spent the last hour comparing YouTube HDR videos, I pause them and I keep switching between the TV's android YouTube app and the Firestick one. The native one has deeper and more pronounced colours, it kind of pops off, it has the WOW effect, on the firestick is a bit washed out (but not much) and the pop off is kind of missing, it's nothing super noticeable and you get used to it, but when you keep switching between them it's obvious and annoys me. I want to use the firestick because it's amazing and fast but this thing is a deal breaker unless I fix it. Also the TV settings for HDR settings (colour, brightness/gamma etc) are identical on both apps.  I also tried somehow tweaking the TV colour settings for the firestick but there's no way to make it look better.

I played with all possible firestick settings, RGB/YCBCR/10bit/12bit /everything on auto/tried manual HDR settings/ nothing fixes it. 

  
I'm just starting to think this is some kind of technical limitation brought by the HDMI connection or something, or Sony's native android app processing does something better to the colour which the firestick just can't, something connected with the internal programming of the device? 

Any opinions on this topic are highly appreciated , thank you in advance!"	18	"[""rmalbers: I think you are just seeing the quality of the video processing produced by the sony chips, at least that's sure what it sounds like from the testing you've done.

It's just that different films, every once in a while, look like they could use a tweak here and there. Before you know it... everything's screwed up again.

There are currently two cases where voices are just drowned out by other sounds:

1.	Streaming football from DAZN and WOW here in Germany
2.	Listening to metal from Spotify

For 1. everything sounds great, except the commentators which are really hard to understand. For 2. my mian examples are Slaughter to Prevail - 1984 and Lorna Shore - Pain Remains I. Especially in the Lorna Shore song, I can barely hear the guy at all, since he is almost completely drowened out by all the other sounds.

First I thought it might be my sound system but it is very clearly the Cube, since everything sounds perfect coming from my PS5 and my TVs built-in smart stuff.

Turning on voice enhancement doesn't make the voices any better to understand, everything that is in that frequency range get boosted, so it's still very hard to hear anything but it's louder.

I don't have it enabled because of that and I also don't have the volume levling feature enabled. Any idea how I can fix it?

(I initially Jack sparrowed content to keep it all in one place, because these boxes kept forcing me to open separate apps just to find a single movie or show, not knowing what channel, network plus max blah blah blah some show was on, having to guess which one it might be in and then check one by one til I find it, then realizing by the time I actually found it I was no longer in the mood to watch a happy go lucky comedy and instead needed to watch some psycho murderous thriller movie out of sheer frustration so I have to start all over. Whereas on a jacksparrow platform, you just type in the show and it comes right uo, no need to having guess what network or premium plus max app it was on. Then Apple TV made the same hing that barely worked, now Alexa seems to almost work except half the time it's missing seasons or shows all together! Is jacksparrowing still the only available option to see EVERY show in one place/search engine?

#TLDR: What specific, step by step, concrete instructions do I need to SAY to Alexa in order to bring up “Seasons and Episodes” for “HAPPY DAYS SEASON 1”

#TLDR2: What specific, step by step, concrete instructions do I need to SAY to Alexa in order to PLAY “Fear the Walking Dead” in English (the language it was filmed and released in)
..

Truth be told I don’t even care about that show, I was trying to play the first episode for someone who hadn’t seen it in a long while and it’s just giving the same issue as so many other shows that magically just don’t seem to have content (or even basic metadata!)

TMDB never had issues finding any episodes or scraping it from any of the connected players, of any season and it’s essentially free, yet this premium dependent cube can’t even find the first season of one of the most popular shows of all time.

**What if I want to watch “Fear the Walking Dead” in ENGLISH?! I know, crazy idea right, asking Alexa to find an English Speaking show in English, such a crazy request!**

PS: keep in mind I’m not asking for any illegitimate sources or rule-breaking sources. I simply want to know how to do this legitimately (as I already know how to get the content illegitimately so there would be no point, so please don’t infer that’s a request.)"	1	[]

I couldn’t also find any clues on my remote. The manufacturer also will not reply to me, but has said in a question on Amazon, that the only remote that works with the projector is the included remote, but I know that is not true of the included remote is infrared, so it obviously has infrared capabilities and a profile code.	0	[]

Current Hardware:

- Toshiba 55LF621U19 FireTV
- Sonos Arc Soundbar (Connected via eArc to TV & hard wired to network)
- Apple TV 4k (Connected via HDMI 2 & hard wired to network)

Behavior:
- When the TV is left powered down overnight or for more than a few hours and powered back on, I get no audio through HDMI 1/eArc.
- If I pull the power on the TV and boot it back up, the eArc connection is again recognized and I can use the Apple TV on HDMI 2 after selecting it with the Fire  TV controller.
- If I use the Apple TV remote to power all off, then immediately use it to power back on, the TV will properly find the eArc connection and switch to HDMI 2.

Things I've tried:

- Reset TV and attempted to run it while not connected to the internet. Hand-off to the Apple TV was slower and often failed. **Result:** Ended up allowing TV to connect to network and run updates.
- Ran TV while connected to network, but not logged into Amazon account. **Result:** No discernible difference in behavior. TV would still fail to pick up eArc overnight.
- Connect Sonos to hard wired network. **Result:** No meaningful change to behavior.
- Reset Sonos Arc. **Result:** Still fails to connect over eArc on overnight powered down state.
- Reset Apple TV. **Result:** No difference in behavior. This was a longshot, as it is a newer device.


I'm all for any ideas that people might have. Unfortunately, the Sonos Arc doesn't have optical audio, or I'd have tried to set that as an output."	0	[]

I just purchased an Amazon Fire TV Stick 4k MAX.

Mainly for Kodi, Netflix and 16/32 bit emulation

Everything works perfectly, except the emulation stuff... Because of the gamepad.

I've purchased an OTG cable for tv sticks and I tested it with my Android phone. It works fine. I can connect USB sticks, I can connect a sixaxis controller (by USB). All good.

But when I use on the Fire TV Stick...

USB memory sticks work, but I can't manage to connect ANY USB Gamepad.

I've tried:

\-Clone XBOX gamepad -> [this one](https://www.amazon.es/Power-Enhanced-Wired-Ctrl-Midnight/dp/B08F43YLZN/ref=sr_1_10?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3U1JW50JCYFQ6&keywords=power+a+xbox&qid=1680194415&sprefix=power+a+xbo%2Caps%2C108&sr=8-10)

\-Sixaxis PS3 controller

\-XBOX 360 controller using the USB cable.

\-Stadia Gamepad through USB

Nothing worked.

The only gamepad I managed to use was the Stadia gamepad using bluetooth. But I can't play games with the bluetooth imput lag. I know it's minimal, but it's there and I notice it enough to destroy my gaming experience.

So... Is there any solution to play using USB interface?

Or, at my last alternative... Is there a recommended bluetooth controller without noticeable imput lag?

Thanks everyone!"	2	['humbertog: PS4 and XBOX One controllers are officially supported, most emulators and game apps also support these controllers by default so for me this is the best option, I know these are a little more expensive than generic game controllers but they totally worth it']

I've reviewed this forum and know that ""The last three voice commands used and the last (or currently open) app, will appear in the side panel as available shortcut options."" when trying to program Button 1 or Button 2. When I first got the remote, I remember being able to do this.  But lately, my prior voice commands do not show up as an option when trying to select what I want the buttons to do.  I only have the option to assign the last app launched and the other standard menu options - but no option to assign recent Alexa instructions provided.

I want to assign Button 1 to switch to Antenna for OTA tv. I want to assign Button 2 to show my Recast recordings.  When I give Alexa those verbal instructions, it executes the command with no problems.  I've tested several innocuous verbal commands (trying both the remote Alexa button and the commands to the Fire Cube directly) like ""Show the Weather,"" ""Show Options,"" ""Show My Stuff"" but none of the instructions show up as recent activity when trying to Program Button 1 or 2 on the Remote Pro.  

I've tried repairing my Remote Pro to another Firestick and am having the same issue.  I've also tried unpairing and repairing my remote and unplugging and restarting my Fire Cube 3. 

It seems like something is preventing the Fire Cube from remembering what my voice instructions were.  Anyone else come across this issue?"	3	"[""Tampammm: Just a related question to what you wanted to do with Button 1 for the OTA Antenna/Guide view.\n\nThere is already a button on the Remote that brings up the Antenna/Live Guide, I would suspect in exactly the same way.

They're all combined on there. \n\nPlus I can choose my favorite channels from each service. Like 10 OTA Channels, 8 Sling Channels, 5 Philo Channels, and 2 Freevee Channels. And then these 25 favorite channels appear first when I hit the guide button. \n\nEither something is wrong with your Guide button or you need to go into the Live TV option in your Settings and fix that. Check the Manage Channels and Sync sources options. \n\nYou shouldn't have to waste one of your program buttons on this. That's what the Guide button does.""]"

But the way these TV's go, the built in Ethernet port only supports up to 100mbps and while on wifi I can get a lot higher speeds, it can be inconsistent to say the least even on a mesh network. So being that these TV's have a USB 2.0 port, I purchased a UNI gigabit Ethernet port adapter which on USB 2.0, it should still support up to 480mbps. but unfortunately for me, it didn't work. The tv wouldn't recognize it, and I tried everything I could get my hands on. Forgot the wifi network, turned on adb debugging and off again to try and sort of reset the USB port, reset the TV itself and nothing would work. So my next idea is I have a USB with Ethernet hub at home and I purchased a USB c to USB A adapter to see if this will work. If anyone has any other suggestions or ideas, please let me know. Something has to work.

Edit: here's an update. I found a gigabit Ethernet hub that actually works and it's honestly pretty great.

Currently looking for a low end tv for my bedroom for casual use such as watching my shows and playing a lil bit of ps5. This this one seems decent. Currently the best selling tv on amazon. Reviews seem positive, as a whole, too.

The fire tv features are cool too, but not a necessity as I already own a firestick. However, this tv supports airplay, which attracts me a lot.

I know, it’s on the low end of tvs but I don’t mind as I’m upgrading from a 32 inch 720p tv so I’m used to below par picture lol. I just want to see if anyone has any knowledge on this tv because I wouldn’t want anything that’s unreasonably bad, even for a low end tv.

My intention is to use the tv on basic mode and use hdmi for my firestick (i have cool sideloaded apps on it),  my ps5 and airplay to stream things straight off my phone.

The tv was released in september 2022 so there’s not too much information on it other than the amazon reviews i looked at."	0	[]

This will return a list of mount points.\n* The ""Mounted On"" field of one of them (usually the last one) should look something like ""`/mnt/expand/<guid>`"" where <guid> is the unique identifier for the extended memory partition. It be a long string of nearly 40 letters, numbers, and hyphens. Copy the <guid> for the next step.\n* In the shell window type ""`pm move-package <package-d> <guid>`"" and hit return, where <guid> is  the drive identifier from the previous step and <package-id> is the application ID you want to move. For example the application ID of Netflix is ""[com.netflix.ninja](https://com.netflix.ninja)"". After a delay ADB should report ""Success"" or a failure message. If is says ""Success"" the app is now in extended storage.\n* To move an app back into primary storage just execute the same command without the <guid> on the end, i.e. ""`pm move-package com.netflix.ninja`"".\n\nIf you don\'t know the application ID of the app you want to move, the ""`Uninstall APK`"" button in adbLink can be helpful because it lets you search for an ID by just part of the ID string. For instance, if you want to move Tubi, click the ""`Uninstall APK`"" button then type ""`tubi`"" in the ""Filter"" field and hit return or click ""Apply"". The list will be filtered to only applications with ""tubi"" in the ID and you will see that the Tubi ID is ""[com.tubitv.ott](https://com.tubitv.ott)"". Make sure you click ""Cancel"" and not ""Ok"" when you are done searching for application IDs. Note that some application IDs have no obvious relationship to the application name. For instance, the application ID for the ""Background Apps and Process List"" app is ""io.github.visnkmr.bapl"" so the uninstall APK window may not be very helpful for ones like this. I recommend you install something like [App Info](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devrimtuncer.appinfo) on your FireTV device which lets you find all your apps by display name and then check the application ID from there. I don\'t think App Info is in the Amazon app store so you would need to sideload it manually.\n\nIf you start your stick and it gives you a list of apps with updates, make note of them but don\'t do the update here. Open adbLink and move each one to primary storage and then perform the update. Then you can move them back out to external storage again. Trying to update an app in external storage will fail with a message about there not being enough room.\n\nThis method works for almost all installed applications, including the ones that FireOS normally doesn\'t give you the option of moving. However, it will **not** work for FireOS ""system"" apps which can not be deleted. These include Amazon branded apps such as Alexa Shopping, Amazon Kids, Amazon Music, Amazon Photos, Files, GameCircle, Prime Video, Silk Browser, and Screensaver. Pretty much anything you install yourself can be moved.\n\nI learned how to do this a couple of years ago from [this page](https://troypoint.com/expand-fire-tv-stick-4k-internal-storage/). It covers both FireOS 6 and FireOS 7 instructions. With FireOS 6 it is the only way to move things to external storage because the OS has no GUI options to do it. With FireOS 7 you can move some things to external storage with the GUI, but not everything, as you found out.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAlthough I wrote a lot of explanation here, there are really only three commands you need to use for moving apps to and from extended storage...\n\n    df -h\n    pm move-package <package-id> <guid>\n    pm move-package <package-id>\n\nThe first one is just to find the guid of the external app storage. The second one uses that guid to move an app from primary to external app storage. The third one moves an app back to primary storage.', ""rmalbers: Ya, that is probably true but you do have something strange going on with it.

Outrageous-Theory-10	1	1221ly8	fireTV	https://www.reddit.com/r/fireTV/comments/1221ly8/toshiba_fire_tv_model_43v35ku_stuck_on_pair/	"Puppy ate the factory remote. We've been using the Fire tv app as a remote for a while, but kept having a hard time pairing/working so husband bought an aftermarket Fire tv remote for our Toshiba Fire TV model 43v35ku. 

Remote worked fine except no voice control - husband took it upon himself to try to factory reset to set up voice control per some article online. I guess he misread something and now our tv is rendered useless. 

I have tried everything, power cycling remote, changing batteries, rebooting the tv by unplugging pressing power button then plugging back in to bring up a ""consol command"" type screen with the option to factory reset, clear cache, update via USB and some other options. We have done literally everything as far as troubleshooting goes.

Also read that hardwiring ethernet to tv has worked for others, however, there is no ethernet port for this model that I can find. There is an ethernet adapter apparently on Amazon but I'm just not sure if it's worth spending the money on this or if there is ANY other way to get this working.

Anybody have ANY input at all? Im about to rip my hair out and scream. 

tl;dr Toshiba Fire TV Model 43v35ku stuck on pairing remote screen, done all possible troubleshooting besides hardwiring ethernet cord because no adapter present, considering buying an ethernet adapter but already dropped enough money on this crap & not sure if it will even work.

my TV displays a little notification in the corner when it displays 4k content, like Dolby Vision. I noticed for a long time that this notification sometimes pops up several times during the movie when i stream on something like Netflix. I assume this is because at random points the connection gets word, Netflix switches to HD and then back to Dolby Vision when the connection gets better again, basically jumping between resolutions. 

As a fix i thought about connecting the FireTV to ethernet and i bought that little Amazon Fire Ethernet Adapter. Now inset it up, only to discover that it only supports 100mbit connections.

This only happens on my Gen 3 Cubes. Everything else is fine. When you add the Gen 3 Cube to a multi-room music group the lyrics button won't function. I should say that it does function in the sense that when you hit it, it is supposed to be global meaning all devices with a screen in the group will either turn lyrics on or off. But when you do this on the Gen 3 Cube, all devices with a screen will stop showing lyrics ""except"" for the cube. The lyrics are locked on and will not turn off.

Also you are supposed to be able to say ""lyrics off"". This works on all other devices ""except for the cube""  its like that phrase was removed from her vocabulary.  She says back ""which device would you like me to turn off?""

When I look at the commands in the app, it even will show that some times (or say it couldn’t understand me). Now, my cube gen 1, I could have sworn there was a setup that allowed me to calibrate the cube. Is there something like that? 

Gen 1 still works but was looking for more of the hardware (integrated ethernet and so on) of gen 3. May return it if I can’t get it to keep listening.

Ps, even the remote doesn’t work 100% of the time. Device is in same location as the gen 1.

In general, these kinds of secret spells must be cast exactly.   They are trying to only let people who know the magic spell in while avoiding any accidental activation.  If you don\'t do it right from the start, it may not matter how many times you click on device name.  And when you do click 7 times, you must do so exactly seven times, quickly, and stop.    Other than counting to 7 instead of 3, assume the instructions for the holy handgrenade (monty python) apply:\n\n>And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying, \'O Lord,bless this thy hand grenade, that with it thou mayst blow thine enemiesto tiny bits, in thy mercy.\' And the Lord did grin. And the people didfeast upon the lambs, and sloths, and carp, and anchovies, andorangutans, and breakfast cereals, and fruit bats, and large chulapas.And the Lord spake, saying, \'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin.Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.

If you are too fast, the remote will not have time to send the seven commands.

If you are already in developer mode, it will say something like ""no need, you are already in developer mode"".  This was the first button on the about screen.  I did not navigate up or down, left or right.\n* After that, you can navigate back to the previous screen, click on developer options, and the ADB menu button will be right there for you to click on.\n\nNo unnecessary button presses.\n\nSince it isn\'t easy to turn developer mode off once on, I was not able to test how forgiving it is when it comes to deviations from the proper timing or pressing the buttons too many times.  It does appear, however, that extra presses will just say ""No need, you are already in developer mode"" rather than preventing you from getting there, but I can\'t verify that easily.\n\nThe screen shots in these instructions look similar to what I saw, other than the name of the stick being different.\n\n[https://www.firesticktricks.com/developer-options-firestick.html](https://www.firesticktricks.com/developer-options-firestick.html)\n\nAlso, you said in one comment that you ""pressed under device name"".

If you press on any of the other buttons, it will not work.   And by device name, they mean something like ""fire tv stick 4k"" in the menu, not where it says ""Device name"" on the right.  That is unreachable by the cursor and trying to reach it may make the developer mode unreachable until you start over.

I left it overnight hoping it might fix itself but it still has no audio this morning. So I unplugged the stick from the HDMI port for about a half hour and now it won’t go back into the port.

It’s as if it’s a completely different kind of plug. It won’t go into the one it was plugged into this morning or the other HDMI port. 

Nothing happened to it (no bumps or falls) between it working yesterday and this.

I don’t want to force it and damage either device.

A few caveats:

We can't airplay from apps like Netflix/HBO/Hulu etc because their video addresses are encrypted.

You can airplay your photos fine but the videos in your ""Photos"" app will stutter a bit, like all 3rd party airplay apps. We just can't process these at Apple TV's performance level.

It's pretty good at processing YouTube videos,and remove the ads ;)

Screen Mirror performance is decent.

So, got it all set up but I do not see a way to connect this to the Recast that is also on my network. I saw where I can connect another antenna but not a way to get the fire tv to pick up the Recast. Anyone else run into this issue?	13	"[""huntergatherer555: I don't know anything about TV's w/integrated FireOS (I have a dumb TV with a FireStick to make it smart), but the the indoor antenna (or coax from outside) does NOT connect to your TV ... it connects ONLY to your Recast DVR box.\n\n  This is a great advantage, as you can place an indoor antenna anywhere that is BEST for maximizing your reception ... and the Recast goes near it (whereas the TV itself is likely NOT going to be located in such an ideal position).\n\n  The Recast then uses your Wi-Fi to beam this optimized OTA signal to ANY TV that has FireOS (be it a Stick, Cube or integrated in the TV, itself). This is particularly good for households with multiple TVs, as all each one needs is an inexpensive FireStick to receive the optimized OTA signal.\n\n  They could be located in 'dead zones,' but get great reception, w/out needing separate cable runs from a 'split' coax.\n\n  In doing the initial setup of the Recast, you use the 'Fire TV' app on your phone (downloaded from Google Play Store for Android). In following the directions, you will end up doing a required Channel Scan, so you should have tried to find the best location/orientation PRIOR to that! You should have used one of the common websites ('antennaweb.org'; 'rabbitears info' and/or 'fcc.gov/media/engineering/dtvmaps') to establish approx. HOW MANY stations/channels you should reasonably be able to pick up in your particular geographic area.\n\n  I happen to receive 130 individual OTA channels, but I live in Houston only 8-9 miles from the main 'antenna farm' (in an upstairs apartment with a window facing the right direction) ... whereas others may live in rural or mountainous areas, or areas with tall trees, and may get very few channels (or none).\n\n  Point is to have an idea what to reasonably expect after the Recast does its channel scan! I also recall the directions for 'pairing' the DVR to your Wi-Fi network not to be the most intuitive and might require a couple tries to have success. It just depends.\n\n  The final issue is that Amazon announced last August that they were no longer going to 'support' the Recast going forward (basically abandoning it), but would 'guarantee security updates for another 4 years.' That's not much solice, if the 'DVR Manager' software or the 'EPG guide' become progressively more dysfunctional!

If you have a link to a source where Amazon says this (not speculation), I\'d really love to see it.\n\nPlease note ... all of the continuing problems with the Recast DVR are CAUSED BY AMAZON""S SOFTWARE \'UPDATES!\' \'Updates\' are supposed to improve functionality ... NOT KEEP BREAKING THINGS! ... and this has been the case all along ... not just since last August, when they said they\'d no longer \'support\' it.\n\n  As far as genuine support, here is what has happened to me recently ... \n\n  1.) On March 12th, I was recording the 3+ hour Oscar Awards (plus a couple other series episodes later for 9 PM) and watching a recording. All of the sudden, my FireStick 4K spontaneously rebooted! I\'ve only ever had that happen once in the past! After the reboot, I could no longer watch my recording (or ANY of them). None of my Live Channels would play, either!\n\n  I go into my DVR setting and it will no longer show how much is left in my Storage (I have enough to record, so that\'s not an issue) and get nothing but \'loading\' bubbles related to my Network Info (i e. it has disconnected the connection), even though when I go to check the FS\'s \'Network Settings,\' it shows I am still CONNECTED to my 5 GHz channel (\'153\'). I even \'forget\' it and sign back in, it indicates that it\'s connected. I go back to DVR settings, but still indicates it can\'t/won\'t connect! Also will NOT allow Restart from the menu! I do all the normal stuff (unplug Recast, FireStick, Router and reboot it ALL in proper sequence), but Recast still won\'t connect and keeps acting like it\'s not on the SAME network as my FireStick when it IS.\n\n  Finally attempt a re-connect using the phone\'s \'Fire TV\' app, but it wouldn\'t work (also remembering how unintuitive the instructions were originally). Finally hit button for Amazon to Call Me for \'help.\' They did, I was transferred to a \'Recast Department specialist\' and spent an hour getting NOWHERE!! We also un-paired and re-paired the Recast (the software confirmed the pairing) ... and NOTHING! Plus the whole \'pairing\' crap forced me to Rescan my considerable number of channels (which the tech didn\'t warn me about) and lose all my Formatting/Favoriting, etc.\n  Oh, and he was also UNABLE to connect to my TV to take over my screen, to visibly SEE what was happening, which is generally very helpful ... but I guess you need a Recast that is not interrupting your Network in order to do that, right?\n\n  He finally gives up and says he\'ll \'Submit a Ticket\', but, of course, can\'t tell me WHEN it will get worked on, let alone solved! Said he\'d check back with me next day whether he had any news, or not. Ha! Well I haven\'t heard from him since!\n\n  By this time, it was early AM and checked (again) to see if any \'updates\' available to download (in small hope it might correct the problem) and there finally was one. Note, they don\'t install if I click on them anymore (just locks up), so I just usually put stick in sleep mode and the install (usually) happens overnight. But next day, the Recast, Channels, Recordings still won\'t function! But later that evening, for no apparent reason, the Recast decides to connect to my Network! But I still have lost 5½ hous of recordings ... but I\'ll take the hit (again), if it keeps functioning as it\'s supposed to.\n\n2.) For a few days (and more overnight \'updates\') the Recast is working, BUT many episodes of it NOT letting me SET certain recordings, multiple recording FAILURES (which I\'ve rarely had prior) and frequent \'disconnects\' when trying to PLAY recordings (even though my Network IS connected, my phone connection is fine, etc). But now I can usually get it to function by doing combination of reboots, network \'forgetting\'/reconnecting, etc.\n\n  But keep in mind, NONE of this is really a Network problem ... this is a case of Amazon \'breaking\' connection to a WORKING network with their F\'d Up software updates!\n\n  Well, that was until YESTERDAY! Planned to WATCH (not record, mind you) the World Baseball Classic final between \'USA and Japan\' and record 4 hours of OTA programs ... but Recast decides to sh*t itself AGAIN (like Oscar night so few days ago)! And did I not remember to mention earlier ... NONE OF MY APPS WILL FUNCTION! ... because they need working network to function ... and my Recast has sabotaged it!\n\n  Also, when Recast is f*cking me, SOMETIMES my phone can pull my OTA channels thru my phone\'s \'Fire TV app\', but sometimes NOT! But I need my apps to work on my FireStick so I can get \'FS1,\' so I\'m STILL screwed!\n\n  *So, you tell me ... DO YOU THINK AMAZON IS PROVIDING ME FUNCTIONING SUPPORT (with their 4 years of \'security updates\')? ... or are they \'screwing us all up the keister?\'\n\n  Now imagine my interminable rant multiplied thousands of times!! THANK YOU AMAZON FOR (NOT) CARING ... AS ALWAYS!', 'MacaroonMother5883: Interesting also.  I have a hunch that maybe the two products are not integrated?  That would suck.', ""Tampammm: Yes, here is the article I read that pretty clearly states that the Recast is going to be fully supported through the year 2026.  And not just limited to security updates.\n\nhttps://www.aftvnews.com/amazons-fire-tv-recast-over-the-air-dvr-isnt-dead/\n\nThats absolutely crazy about all those one off issues you've had with your Recast!  But not uncommon though. I've read a number of people complaining about all sorts off weird issues with Recasts.\n\nI actually got one of the very first refurbished Recasts in 2019, and only paid $125 bucks for it.  Other than one or two times with some wacky connection issues with it, it works like a champ and never fails me. \n\nI must say though, I don't use it as much for recording anymore. I have subscriptions with YTTV and Philo now, so 90% of my recordings are on the loud through those services.\n\nI love the Guide for the Recast as it consolidates OTA, YTTV, and Philo all into a single view for me! And I can cherrypick my favorite channels from all those services into one unique favorites guide."", 'huntergatherer555: \'T.\'. Yes, I have read \'Elias\' article\'s previously (and many others), but what he says in your linked article is not the same wording as he uses in the embedded link to another of his articles.\n\n  First off these are Elias\' INTERPRETATIONS of what Amazon states on their own site. NOWHERE does Amazon actually state that \'software will be fully supported,\' nor do they guarantee the Recast DVR to function as it is supposed to for that length of time!\n\n  As Elias mentions in his second article ... ""Amazon has now officially declared its policy regarding Fire TV software updates to be a guarantee of at least 4 years of SECURITY UPDATES (my caps) after the device is last available for purchase.""\n\n  Amazon ONLY guarantees \'SECURITY\' updates and don\'t even define what that means (what that actually entails). As far as I know (at least w/phones), \'security updates\' are merely to help protect against virus/malware hacks and don\'t do anything to guarantee your phone will keep functioning perfectly for the next 4 years!\n\n  At least with a phone, no one argues the importance of decent security updates, but what does that even mean wrt their DVR? What security does a DVR even require? I have little to no worries about this. IT IS AMAZON THEMSELVES WHO HAVE BEEN CONTINUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RECAST\'S CONSTANT FUNCTIONAL BREAKDOWNS!\n\n  I\'m glad you have had pretty good luck with yours (and I love mine when it\'s working), but all you have to do is go to Amazon\'s own product \'forum\' to see the plethora of issues and complaints practically from Day One. And that\'s while it has been formally supported ... now it\'s NOT (other than \'security updates\'). And how would any of us know if they were even doing that?\n\n  Again, I hope from a practical standpoint that Elias and you are right, but from my personal experiences (and many, many others), this is ALREADY not the case. If it was, I wouldn\'t be sitting here with no Live TV, no ability to use my Apps, no ability to set Recordings and no ability to watch my previously recorded videos.\n\n  For me, anyway, this is no longer just an inability to do RECORD SERIES (which by itself is kind of the main function of a DVR, in the first place). Now I can do nothing, but pray Amazon gets off their collective asses!\n  I\'ve learned not to hold my breath.', ""Tampammm: Are you aware that Elias Saba actually works for Amazon as a Product Manager for the Fire devices?\n\nSo I think given the fact he is an internal manager there, and he gives a pretty thorough explanation of what the Corporate policy is there as it relates to how Amazon determines the life cycle execution of their product coverages, I'm not seeing or hearing anything to suggest it won't be supported through 2026.\n\nActually, this fact seems to be substantiated given your recent Recast technical issue, and the fact you were routed to an Amazon Recast technical representative. If they had in fact cut off support with the product with last year's announcement, they would not have entertained your inquiry at all. \n\nNow, having said all that, does it mean youre going to get quality service, or that the Recast is a quality product? It looks like a big fat no on that one!  LoL, and most unfortunately. \n\nI guess it's the luck of the draw on how Recast might act or perform for any given user. \n\nThe weird thing is, despite all its warts, the Recast gives me (as a Fire user) things that Tablo, HDHomeRun, and any other of these devices can't give me! So in that regard, all these competing products are inferior to the Recast.  It's as simple and plain as that.""]"

I also have a 2019 model of the Fire TV 4k Stick and I have rarely ever had a problem with it.

Here is what is going on:

It is hooked up to my Denon receiver then to a Vizio TV, no ARC  or CEC enabled.

* About every 3-5 clicks of the volume button it changes the volume 4-7 ticks vs the .5 it is supposed to do and normally does
* Plex freezes a lot
* Sometimes the device gets completely hung for 2 or 3 minutes and no buttons at all works
* This morning I had no audio whatsoever including clicks as I move around the menu

All of these issue resolve except the volume ticking too much per button click by restarting the device.

I have no sideloaded apps and have 1.35 Gig out of 5.33 available.

I don't know what to begin to look at, but the settings are no different than my older stick other than controlling my receiver volume since the older model did not have that capability.

Usually, I'll connect from my phone (while using Spotify) and the Fire TV will come up as an option but not anymore. Even when I open the Spotify app using the stick it will go where you want it to go but it will not play any music. Like you can see the play button but nothing will happen.

Kodi_Fan_Omicron	6	11kxar0	fireTV	https://www.reddit.com/r/fireTV/comments/11kxar0/hdr10_broken_again_after_the_systemapp_firetv/	"Just another example of Amazon not caring if they break functionality for FireTV devices, and pushing out untested system-app updates.

Haven't watched any HDR10+ specific content lately so only noticed the problem yesterday and yesterday is also the day the new 'FireTV_Player' app-update got forcibly pushed to my device, along with 16 other system-app updates. Anyways, I was using the FireTV Cube (2nd Gen.) where I noticed HDR10+ only worked correctly if you switched to 'ALWAYS_HDR' in the settings, but NOT with the setting left on 'ADAPTIVE' like I've always had it set too. The build number of the FireTV_Player app-update I received started with 341.

Fix was easy, just used the TotalCommander file manager app to select the 'FireTV_Player' app and then Delete(uninstall) the app to have the system fall back to the last stable version that was embedded in the full firmware update. Which rolled back the app version to 335.x, which according to this repository ( https://github.com/Pro-me3us/raven_firmware ) of update files version 335 was released back in November 2022. I had previously saved version 338 to my downloads folder on the Cube after it was forcibly updated back in January, so I at least went ahead and updated to that version to double-check that HDR10+ worked again with 'ADAPTIVE' being set in the settings, and sure enough it worked. Don't know exactly when HDR10+ actually got broken, maybe version 339, 340, or 341; only took notice because my AppleTV library of content wouldn't output HDR10+ thus it led me on the journey to figure out why.

If Amazon FireTV Settings automatically had the option to *UNINSTALL_UPDATES* to system-apps like AndroidTV/GoogleTV then this wouldn't be such a frustrating ordeal that tends to happen way too much with the various system apps that get forcibly updated outside of the standard firmware updates.

Hope this post helps at least one person, cause we all know Amazon's Customer Service wouldn't have had a clue on how to fix the HDR issue."	6	"['kresbok: I have some issues but with Dolby Vision, like flikering and going black, this was another push update, they broke DV...

Sometimes this was accompanied with the TV complaining about the remote in some way when turning on randomly. 

We called customer support after this happened for a week straight and they informed us of how you have to manually update the TV; we did such and all worked well again!  For a week. 

Not the TV is back to its old shenanigans after refusing to turn on this morning until I swapped batteries in the remote.  It’s back to forcing the screen back and forth from HDMI and Home (despite these auto options being turned off), the Home menu is laggy again, and we checked for updates once more but there is nothing  there to update to!!!

I’ve soft reset the TV and still have this problem; never had this happen with any kind of TV I’ve had before.

It seems like different apps just use those buttons for their own purposes, and I'm not sure but maybe those buttons only work as I expected when you're passing through a cable box. 

For context, I have programmed my TV to adjust its brightness level using the ch +/- buttons.  My goal is to use the Fire TV remote to do the same.  Here are some potential avenues to make this work, would love any suggestions on implementing these on the Fire TV side.

* Have the Fire TV remote send IR commands for ch +/-, this is what I thought might work without modifying anything, but that doesn't seem to be the case. 
* Have the Fire TV send HDMI-CEC commands to the TV using those buttons.  I can likely make this work on the TV side (I have full root access on the TV).
* Have the Fire TV send API requests to the TV.  If I could have those buttons just execute curl commands I can make that work on the TV side.

Update: The only thing I was able to get to work is if I tell Alexa to switch to Antenna (which doesn’t actually work), then I can ask Alexa to channel up or channel down, then it uses IR to send ch+/-.   I can’t make those remote buttons do anything at all.  I’m not going to be able to do what I want without fully rooting the FireTV, so I’m just going to send it back."	4	"[""Tampammm: I've discovered those Channel Buttons do not work with the TV.\n\nThey have 2 other uses:\n\n1) For linear streaming service subscriptions (like YouTube TV, Sling, etc.), they let you go up and down on the channels within their lineup.

If the Wi-Fi network you are connected to is slow or congested, then the speed test result may not be as fast as what you would get using only 5G cellular data. Similarly, if the 5G network you are connected to is slow or congested, then the speed test result may not be as fast as what you would get using only Wi-Fi.\n\nSecondly, some phones are capable of combining Wi-Fi and cellular data together to boost speeds using a feature called ""Wi-Fi Assist"" or ""Smart network switch"". In this case, if the Wi-Fi network you\'re connected to is slow, the phone will automatically switch to using cellular data for faster speeds. However, this feature may not be available on all phones, and even if it is, it may not always work reliably.\n\nIn summary, whether a speed test on a cellular phone receiving both Wi-Fi and high-speed 5G shows a greater speed than either Wi-Fi or cellular alone depends on the quality and speed of the network, as well as the phone\'s capabilities and settings.

My mother is a 91-year-old quadriplegic due to a fall a few years back. We got her an Echo shortly after her accident and she loves it. She can check the time, get the weather, listen to news, music, audiobooks etc. We have a lamp module hooked up in her room so that she can turn on and off the lights. We even made a simple wi-fi controlled relay box that hooks to the nurse call button, so that she can call for the nurse using Alexa.

We will be moving mom to a new facility and are looking into furnishing her new home. On mom’s wish list is “I want to be able to change channels using Alexa” I’ve started to research this, but I am a bit overwhelmed with all the items I am having to address ahead of this move.

The ideal setup would allow mom to turn on and off the TV with her voice. Change cable channels (mom likes to watch local news). Adjust the volume etc. All of this with only her voice, no remote or button pressing needed. To date, she hasn’t shown much interest in streaming services. 

Based on my limited research, it seems with with some options you have to press a button before saying “Alexa”. That isn’t really won’t work for mom since her mobility is so limited.

I don’t know a lot about Fire TV options and my research thus far has left me more confused. Since we need to get a new TV anyway, I thought about looking at Fire TVs, or at least getting a Fire TV Cube.  Looking for suggestions as to a setup that would work for mom.

I use my Fire TV for the F1 TV app and to use Acestream on my LG WebOS.

As I started testing I noticed that the audio had a brutal delay. As a workaround I started adjusting the delay from VLC or Ace Engine but in the F1 app it does not allow that adjustment.

Today I came up with something. The HDMI port where I have my Fire TV connected I used before for a PS4 and had the sound configured in a special way.

I set those sound settings for that HDMI interface to default and it fixed the problem.

The HDMI settings on my LG were having a conflict with the Fire TV settings and the audio was really crappy and delayed.

Hope this can help someone."	0	[]

Where is it?', 'CalmDownFriend: I thought the cube did have pass through. when you select ""Best available"" it won\'t play in atmos? They won\'t allow you to select atmos because not all content is available in atmos.\n\nBest available does work for me on my old firestick 4k, but just on amazon prime and disney+', 'Apprehensive-Place90: Only gen 3 supports lossless audio.', 'Apprehensive-Place90: I know, but when I played on Plex for the first time it asked me for passthrough so I confirmed.

Agree on the fire stick have 3 4k max and works fine on BA with all sources.', ""Locutus508: I do not believe best available is passthrough. If it were, you wouldn't get navigation feedback and Alexa audio overlaid with streaming playback.  The Cube can't do this unless it's decoding the  audio in the player.  In addition, you would also not get Volume Leveler or dialogue Enhancer when set to best available. However, both of those still work. From my testing, there is no passthrough capability when using streaming apps.  Also, on my cube when set to best available, all audio is sent as a higher quality bitstream, HBR bitstream instead of traditional bitstream as it is from streaming apps.  This can only occur if the Cube is re-encoding the audio.  Decoding and then re-encoding is not passthrough."", ""Locutus508: Yes.  I have a gen 3.  I don't doubt that you can get passthrough using Plex.  Thats why I said streaming services.  The point I am making is, you don't get passthrough audio when using streaming services.   This is unfortunate as re-encoding degrades audio quality.  If they are going to decode because they want to overlay Alexa, they should just leave the audio decoded and send that to the receiver as uncompressed audio.\n\nAs far as Plex, what happens to Alexa's responses when you are playing something from Plex that you know is playing in passthrough mode.

Again thanks for checking."", 'Apprehensive-Place90: Thanks to you too, now I know it’s better to use the Plex app and streamingsapps by my tv and for the lossless movie sound I use the cube.', ""Locutus508: The problem is, there is no perfect device including the apps on the TV.  Each device has something that doesn't work on one that works on another.  In addition, it varies by streaming service.  For example, you will likely not get 5.1 audio or dolby vision on the Hulu TV app.  So, even though the Cube re-encodes, it still may be better than the TV with some services.  In addition, you probably don't get frame rate matching on the TV.\n\nIn my case, I have a Bravia (Google TV), the Cube, an Apple TV and the latest Roku Ultra.  I use the Apple TV the most.  But you won't get lossless audio from Plex on the Apple TV.  You will get the best audio from streaming services, however.  The very latest Roku Ultra will do passthrough audio, but it has other issues.  The Nvidia Shield (which I don't have) also does passthrough audio.  It also has other issues.  The Apple TV isn't perfect either as some streaming providers like Peacock have issues with its app on the Apple TV.  I do use the Apple TV most because it works the best overall.  I fallback on one of the others in specific cases.  I rarely use the built in TV apps on my Bravia (Google TV).\n\nI understand why the Cube decodes in the player.  What I don't understand is why they re-encode the audio before sending to receiver.  It's possible this makes it simpler for them or so that it works with older systems that have limited HDMI bandwith.  Who knows."", 'Apprehensive-Place90: I like Apple TV also a lot but what you said, it doesn’t support lossless audio and that’s a must for me these days because of my gear. You mention the decoding uses a lot of bandwidth, figures maybe why my sound sometimes cuts out for a second?', ""Locutus508: I'm not saying it uses a lot of bandwith necessarily.  I'm saying some older systems can't handle ATMOS over LPCM+ Dolby MAT which is how Apple TV delivers ATMOS.  If you have a modern system, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIf lossless audio for local playback is your only concern, the Apple TV isn't the platform.  The Shield, the most recent Roku Ultra or the most recent Cube is.  If your concern is streaming, well thats the problem where one device won't do.  But, to me, the Apple TV gets most of it.  The best situation, however, is to get multiple devices,  There is a nice chart for streaming features listed below.

TheLimeyCanuck	2	114ult0	fireTV	https://www.reddit.com/r/fireTV/comments/114ult0/has_anyone_managed_to_get_a_firestick_4k_to/	"I have just reconfigured the OpenVPN server running on my home LAN so that I can use my travel Firestick 4K as if I was streaming from home even though I'm not, and it works great. Now I want to do the same thing with the FS4K at our summer getaway four provinces away so that when my wife and I are watching something there other family members can also be watching something else back at home without it looking like we are streaming at two different locations.

When we are at our summer place for the six-eight weeks we spend there each year I can just manually connect the OpenVPN client the way I do when I am travelling closer to home with my other Firestick, but every so often we let friends stay there when we aren't using it. They aren't going to know how to connect via OpenVPN before streaming movies, so I want my FS to automatically connect to the VPN when it starts up.

The Android OpenVPN client software on the Firestick has a setting to try to reconnect to the VPN if it was connected when the device was shut down, but it doesn't seem to work. Even with it turned on, when the Firestick is connected to my home VPN and rebooted, it doesn't attempt to re-establish the tunnel when it restarts. Has anyone tried something similar with a FireTV device and got it to work?

Thanks."	1	['chrmnxpnoy: I would just get a dedicated travel router (I use GL.iNet Beryl) and use OpenVPN on it.  Connect your Fire TV stick to that router.  I did this method while abroad in Asia and was able to still use YouTube TV there.']

It's averaged 25-127 max, but seems to fluctuate a lot. Actually had buffering and this is on 300mb FTTP. I tried a spare Dell USB3 ethernet adapter and that wouldn't actually fit the socket on the FireTV.

Is the TPLink a dud? The built-in ethernet is ok, 90mb or so on average.

I have a .m3u playlist that I play through VLC for Android on my Firestick.

Does anyone happen to know of a way to control how the remote interacts with VLC? Thank you for any help you can offer!"	0	[]

The USB port puts out 5 volts at .5 amps max. This has worked fine for a week or so now. There's nothing wrong, but I'm thinking ahead. Is there a chance my Firestick will burn out my usb port due to the power draw? How much draw is needed for the device itself? I know it will, at most, pull 1 amp due to the technical specifications printed on the device as per US law. Realistically though, what are the odds from your personal experience? Please and thank you, I appreciate any information or advice.	11	"[""Finnzz: The biggest danger of using the TV's USB is that you will eventually corrupt your Fire Stick and brick it.\n\nA lot of TVs don't provide power to the USB port when the TV is off.  If the Stick was in the middle of updating the firmware  because it was idle, and you turned off the TV, cutting off the power, that could easily brick the stick.  You run a smaller risk of bricking the stick cutting off the power while FireOS is in the middle of some important process.  Either way, long term you are greatly increasing the chance of a bricking.\n\nRegarding power consumption, under regular usage 0.5A will suffice.  The current usage will increase the harder the SOC is working.  So if you were doing anything intensive you might notice a slow down, or the Stick will just reboot."", ""AndyPryceManUtd: I have a JVC 4K Android TV and I power my Firestick 4k Max from the TV's USB port.

It's annoying because I brought a brand new amazon basics 48gbps 10foot cord for it, but the cord might be too heavy pulling on the back of cube, which I have to put on a high shelf, because if I put on shelf below tv I think it's too close to C1 speakers.  and I don't have many other long cords to test it with.\n\nOn a separate note:  \nThe alexa responses in my cube also seemed to be terrible, my other alexa devices get commands right a million times more often then the cube.

Their cube is on HDMI 1 and their satellite receiver is on HDMI 2. When on HDMI 1 saying ""Alexa, switch to satellite."" It does as expected and switches to HDMI 2. Now this is where the trouble begins. 

When watching their satellite TV on HDMI 2, when you say ""Alexa"" it immediately mutes the TV and the cube seems to immediately stop listening for a command as the alexa light on it goes off and a light blue light goes from left to right on it, while switching the TV from Mute to having the sound on back to mute again. 

This is frustrating because they are unable to use alexa commands while watching satellite tv as well as unable to switch back to the cube home screen with their voice. Everything else works as intended when they are on HDMI 1 on the cube.

Their TV is an LG C1 and they are using the TV speakers. Only thing hooked up to the TV is the cube and the satellite box. I have tried everything I can think of to solve this and have come up empty.

I have a 3rd gen cube hooked up to my LG CX65 with non of this issues at all.

I installed a new launcher on my Fire TV about a year ago (can't stand ads on a TV I paid for), and I somehow completely bricked the Fire TV launcher. I kinda just said ""whatever"" since some settings had standalone apps, but others didn't (i.e. audio out, notifications). However, I recently found a way to launch the fire tv settings via the launcher through ADB. 

`.\adb shell am start -n com.amazon.tv.launcher/.ui.MainSettingsActivity`

Why this is important is because Dolby Vision content is notoriously darker than regular HDR10, this is intentional.  \n\nDepending on your LG DolbyVision can be especially dark if you are using an ambient light sensor mode (don't use ambient sensor).  On my TV I have to use Dolby Vision custom in order to control the TV backlight level. The regular Dolby Vision profile may not let you change the brightness.  \n\nThe idea is that DolbyVision is dark because the brightness is controlled by the creator so that you get something closer to what the director intended.  But on many TVs that aren't able to go above 700-900nits, it will look dark."", 'mlsto: Not sure about all of this but not seeing  Dolby vision on the fire tv, it just has a terrible dark resolution, really bad tv.

1675338033.0	02-Feb-2023 03:40:33	Can HDR contents look different on a 4k Firestick compared to watching directly from a TV/native apps?	Mumford_and_Dragons	1	10rnuq9	fireTV	https://www.reddit.com/r/fireTV/comments/10rnuq9/can_hdr_contents_look_different_on_a_4k_firestick/	"I have a Samsung QN800A 8K TV but I watch my 4K content via a 4K Firestick (2020) with Stremio streaming App.  
I've setup necessary settings both for TV and Firestick (I'm no AV technician, but I havent left it at default settings like most consumers), so it should be at best image possible!  


With HDR content, sometimes in [dark scenes](https://imgur.com/Q9H7ETF) there is some 'grey fog/film' transition, that then dissapears.  
Turning down/off *local dimming* I think fixes this, and I think it happens as it makes very dark scenes 'visible', thus giving it a 'grey hue look'.

  
But I'm wondering does the 4K firestick somehow make HDR content different compared to watching 4K content directly from the TV / Native apps? I dont have Netflix, Disney+ etc so have no idea.

Thanks"	6	"[""jaruba_dev: i have never seen something like that happen tbh, my best guess is that this is indeed caused by some wonky TV setting\n\nalternatively, TVs have an HDR state, so the TV handles the HDR functionality, not the android apps, maybe ur TV is going in / out of HDR state when this happens\n\nfirestick is really not the best device for this, but i really don't think that the firestick device or Stremio is causing this, most probably a wonky TV feature / setting"", ""Important-Comfort: It's probably how the TV is handling the HDMI input differently than the internal app.\n\nOn my Roku TV I can make adjustments for each HDMI port independently."", ""Finnzz: Most TVs have independent display settings per source/HDMI port.

I'm trying to set up an Omni Fire TV for use by an elderly person with cognitive decline and I have a few questions.

1. Is there a way to set it so it doesn't ask what user profile to use every time you turn it on?  I logged into my amazon account and added a new profile for her.  I didn't try removing my profile yet but wasn't sure if I could since it was set up using my account login.

2. I set up a Dakboard in order to display time, day and event calendar.  The Silk browser will show the last page every time you bring it up so I think I'm good there but it may be difficult for her to find it and get into it.

Is there a way to set up an Amazon command synonym for ""Open internet browser""?  For example ""show my calendar"" or ""show my schedule"" to bring up the browser.

3. Is there a way to keep it from powering down?  I didn't turn on the sleep timer but it still shut itself off after I tried leaving it on overnight.

4. Any other usage or setup tips that would be good to know? I'm planning to get TV over antenna plus whatever free streaming channels there may be such as news.

5. The screen saver has the capability to show photos from my amazon account. Is there some way to restrict it to just one folder or set of folders? It could be a nice feature but not if it's just going to show any random picture from the last 20 years.

Thanks."	7	"['beenburnedbutable: If it only has one profile it won’t ask, it will just login. \n\n3. You can try setting the sleep timer to a very high number. \n\n4.

I figured I should be able to easily modify this command to remap the Prime Video button to Plex (or Jellyfin), so I ended up digging into logcat myself and I got it working! In order to remap the Prime Video button to Plex, this is the command I used (modified from the original):

NOTE: it's only com.amazon.venezia because I disabled Prime Video in Debloat Toolbox, so the button takes me to the app store and not Prime Video. I tried restoring Prime Video and changing the command to match to avoid issues with Amazon App Store, but that didn't seem to work for some reason.

NCAAF is over for this season. The replay site is at: nflreplay.net. You can use that in Amazon\'s Silk browser; use a bookmark. Now, for NCAAF, and any other events, it\'s possible to record by scheduling two (2 hrs each) recordings, back-to-back. Just don\'t overlap the start/end times because that won\'t work. The neat thing about the NFL site is access to past games, playoffs, even the previous season! And I\'m fairly sure that commercials are skipped. At any rate, you can always FF and RW as you wish.

I recently updated my dads fire stick to the latest one and he is having an issue that I have no idea how to fix. 

My dad has hearing aids he can connect to the tv that works with the fire stick and also with his cell phone. He said if he’s watching tv and a text alert comes though the tv will pause. This is fine, but he says after he presses play it will pause again over and over and over.

MarcianTobay	1	10jmg13	fireTV	https://www.reddit.com/r/fireTV/comments/10jmg13/firetv_remote_app_ios_gets_stuck_on_one_button/	"When I use my official FireTV remote app, it sometimes gets “stuck” on one button. At seemingly random times, it will begin to repeat my most recent button-press endlessly. The only way to stop it is to force close the app, reopen the app, wait for it to load, and then press a different button. Does anyone know what causes this or how to fix it?

DETAILS:
- FireTV: Toshiba LF621U19
- App: Official FireTV app on iOS. Fully up to date.
- Internet: Both iOS and TV are connect to same wi-fi. 2.4 gHz. Router in the same room, about 15 feet away.
- TV was previously connected through Ethernet. Issue persisted then, too.
- Previously had TV connected to both the 2.4 and 5.0 signals from my router. During this time, it was hard for my phone to consistently connect. Once I dropped everything but 2.4, it connects way more consistently.
- No other technical issues.
- Has happened with both volume and directional keys.
- It happens with directional keys so often, navigating menus is practically off the table.

Right out of the box, plugged it in and it boots up to the Fire TV logo, stays there for 60 seconds, then a black screen for 2 seconds, then back to the fire TV logo.
Endless loop. Had it like this for over an hour.

I've tried with various services plugged into each HDMI slot. Tired all of the buttons on the remote, and the power button on the TV. 

Powered it off, unplugged it, plugged it back in, numerous times. 

Wondering if there is a way to boot to a thumb drive and flash the firmware, or if I just need to wait for woot to contact me about a replacement. ( They don't have phone support, only 24hr email response. )

Called Amazon support, but since I bought it from woot, they won't help, since the device isn't registered to my Amazon account yet.

It says Home Unavailable which is understandable as we haven't had proper WiFi installed yet (we've been trying to work on this since our last visit) so I try go through the Network's list and connect to my hotspot (or anyone's).

 Comes up with my hotspot (and others)  'not in range' so I re scan then it pops up with my hotspot as 'saved' and id I click on it  it just freezes. I cant go through the rest of the list of hotspots but can go back to main screen (which is obviously not connected)
Does this when I try use my mum's hotspot instead. If I try 'forget' the hotspot, it let's me input the password but then freezes again when it tries to connect. 

Tried changing the input (ie replugging the FireTV stick into a different HDMI port), unplugging and leaving it an hour and plugging back in, rebooting from menu/remote, and checking for an update which didn't work. 
  
I know an update would fix this as its a Fire TV Sticl 4k on Fire OS 6.2.8.9 and the latest version is 6.2.9.4,  but it won't let me update cos it brings up the 'network disconnected' prompt.

I would like to be able to watch TV on the actual TV and not my laptop before I go home, and also my brother signed up to and forgot to cancel a £35p/m NowTV sports membership on this FireTV stick through my amazon account  and the only way for ne to cancel is to access the NowTV app from the FireTV stick.

Anyone else experiencing this issue? I'm wondering if maybe an update broke something under best available audio option. 

Is there a known good place to give feedback to developers about this for possible fix? This is my first ever amazon device.

I recently got the latest Fire TV Cube. I have connected it to a Bluetooth receiver which is connected to my speaker system via 3.5mm jack. The Fire TV Cube is connected to a monitor. Since the Cube doubles as a smart speaker as well,  I've also been using it to send voice commands. But it seems, the Bluetooth connection takes a while to connect as I'm seeing that the first 1-2 words frequently don't get announced. For e.g. If I say ""Alexa, what's the time?"" Instead of saying ""The time is 2 AM"", it'll say ""is 2Am"". Is there any solution to this?

IndieScent888	2	106xqdl	fireTV	https://www.reddit.com/r/fireTV/comments/106xqdl/factory_reserting_fire_tv_with_no_remote_how_to/	"Hi all, I have a Toshiba FireTV 3rd Gen that has just been sitting in sleep mode for months. Now, the date is set to August of last year, the time is wrong. It’s also severely out of date but will not update despite having ample storage (more than the recommended 500mb). For reference I’ve been through the official troubleshooting steps for both these issue, including setting the time zone again and restarting the tv, both through the settings as well as unplugging for one minute. The last thing I have yet to try is a favorite reset. 

My problem is I have no physical remote, and am using the FireTV app. I’m certain a factory reset would erase my wifi settings among other things. Does anyone have a solution for how to reconnect with no physical remote? Or do I need to shell out $30 for a new remote?"	6	"['MikhelB: Does it have ethernet port?

There is very little that can be changed in the router and turning off IPv6 is one of them.  The Fire TV has issues with WPA 3 with IPv6.

I went ahead and did a factory reset because I saw suggestions online saying to do that. Now that I did that it is stuck in a reboot phase. It shows the logo and then just turns off and reboots over and over. Not even sure how I would fix it because the screen is only up for about 5 seconds at a time before it reboots.

Works perfectly with my TV when watching local TV.  


Problem is, when switching to the Firestick and using Netflix, the audio plays through my TV speakers only.  I have tried EVERY single setting, switching off dolby and using PCM (I think that's right) leaving it on auto, nothing works.  


Only solution I've found is connecting via 3.5mm which sounds absolutely atrocious.   
""Why not use the bluetooth directly with the firestick?""  
Because then it requires me to power off my TV transmitter and go into the firestick settings every time and manually connecting them via bluetooth, which is pretty much asking the impossible of my 63yr old mother.    


The TV settings seem to be very limited as well, what does everyone think is causing this issue?"	0	[]

Volume control works both with the TV it was attached to, and later with the soundbar it was attached to (and then this soundbar to the same TV). You pressed the volume buttons on the stick's remote, and the volume level of the output device changed.

This was done via HDMI-CEC, but the PC monitor and the older TV I want to use don't have CEC, so I'd expect to have some software volume control - I mean, to put out a variable volume sound signal set with the stick's remote control, instead of a fixed volume signal where the remote control sets the volume of the output device instead of the volume of the sound signal.

This is something any media player ever can do, including a Xiami Android TV box I had, but for some reason the Fire TV Stick 4K Max just puts out the volume to the max and the volume buttons don't do a thing. I've deactivated the CEC options, but still no success.

Thoughts? Or is this a weird lack of this stick that can't be fixed?

I currently have a Fire Cube v2, which aside from the laggy home menu still works fine when plugged directly into my TV.

I've also got an AVR, and unfortunately my TV's eARC input appears to be faulty, so I'm experimenting having it on another HDMI port.

This means the Cube will need to be plugged into the AVR to enjoy decent sound. However, it suffers from the colour space problem when plugged into an AVR or soundbar, which is apparently fixed on v3 and the 4k Max. ([https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D54P00006zSvxnSAC/colors-are-oversaturated-too-red](https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D54P00006zSvxnSAC/colors-are-oversaturated-too-red))

Firstly can anyone confirm the newer models work properly through an AVR?

Secondly, I only use the standard apps (no external apks / emulation etc) - will the 4k Max provide as good an experience or is the Cube v3 that much better? We do use voice commands but have an Echo in the room too, which I expect can control the 4k Max?

Finally, the new Apple 4k TV is a similar price to the Cube - what do people think of that?

I know there are other options like Shield/Roku etc but last time I looked at them, either certain UK apps were missing or HDR / atmos support was on some apps but not others and so on. I like that everything just worked on Fire :-D

Thanks in advance!"	29	"['jlipschitz: I received my 3rd gen cube today.  I have hated the Fire TV devices in the past, but the specs were looking better than the aging shield pro except for the number of GPU cores and the physical Ethernet port.  I tested it with TrueHD Atmos, DTS-HD MA, DTS-X, DTS 5.1, and Dolby Digital Plus.  Everything played flawlessly in Plex.  No transcoding took place.  Sound came out of all of the speakers, even the up firing ones.  I played some very high bitrate files as it did not skip a beat.  On WiFI 6E, it tested at 340Mbps.  \n\nI have it connected to a Comcast XB8 router.\nThe sound system is a Sony HT-A7000 with rear speakers and the SA-SW5 subwoofer.  \n\nEvery app that I use works great as well.\n\nMy only complaint is that my apps are a thin strip towards the top and everything else is junk that I don’t care about that I wish that I could remove from the Home Screen to simplify it.  There is no option to customize the Home Screen components.  After coming from ROKU, that is frustrating.  If that is the only issue, I will deal with it.', '08830: Out of curiosity, what TV model do you have? I had a Fire TV Cube v2 and experienced the color space issue when transitioning from DV/HDR to SDR but I was able to fix it by changing the color space setting in the mobile app of the TCL Roku TV. \n\nI have an Apple TV 4K (2nd gen - which I use primarily) and recently picked up the 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube. I have not seen any of the color space issues on the 3rd Gen Cube and generally speaking, it’s slightly faster than the 2nd Gen Cube. The reason I upgraded was for the DT-HD and Dolby TrueHD passthrough. This is perfect for Plex and my local content library. Apple TV doesn’t support those audio codecs, unfortunately.\n\nI like the new Fire TV Cube in terms of performance and the hands-free experience. In addition to support for DTS & Dolby True HD, I like that the new Fire TV Cube has support for external storage and an HDMI-In port. To test it out, I plugged my Apple TV into the Fire TV’s HDMI-In and it works perfectly. Telling Alexa to switch to Apple TV works seamlessly. A major downside with Fire TV is the Home Screen. It’s messy and filled with ads. I also dislike how poorly many of the apps perform on Fire TV OS. For example, Netflix is slow to navigate compared to the Apple TV where it is super fast. Plus, most of the popular streaming apps don’t currently support frame rate matching on Fire TV whereas nearly all of the popular apps do on Apple TV. \n\nWith that, I recommend you give Apple TV a try. It’s a better overall experience, in my opinion. But, If you’re happy with the Fire TV experience, then I’d suggest upgrading to the new cube or the 4K Max.', ""Important-Comfort: I don't have this issue with a 4K Max plugged into a Denon AVR, but I didn't have it with an original 4K stick, either."", 'K_ThomasWhite: From the OP: ""Finally, the new Apple 4k TV is a similar price to the Cube - what do people think of that?""\n\nNo option for adding a thumb drive to the Apple TV?

Otherwise, the Max and Cube provide the same experience. I would recommend either device, but if cost isn't a critical factor, the new Cube is the way to go."", ""Tampammm: You were very specific (well done ) stating you only stream standard generic apps, and that you already have Echo support, etc.\n\nGiven that particular situation, I'd say just stay with your Cube 2 or a 4K Max.\n\nI've got the new Cube 3, but I require more power and storage  for the things I do."", ""TheRealArangast: Thanks guys, it seems like the Cube 3 is probably the way to go - it will perform at least as well as the v2 and supports all the formats.

I have that in a routine for turning it off and on.

Also as you know the only way to hard reboot a TV is to physically unplugging for one minute or so. Screw that, made a reboot routine with a 2 minute delay.

**Note:** Even with the Alexa app and Fire TV app, if my TV has the power killed to it, I have to turn it on with the actual remote so IFTTT will not power it on, only controls it going to and from sleep mode

For basic control used Google Assistant and Google Home with Alexa + IFTTT + Alexa Monkey.

Set up 6 basic commands:

* Pause TV
* Resume TV
* Mute TV
* Unmute TV
* Turn Off TV (sleep mode)
* Turn On TV (sleep mode)

Alexa didn't have a skill for muting and unmuting with Alexa Monkey so used *Custom* and tried a few phrases until Alexa muted and unmuted the TV. 

So there you go got six basic functions for Google and my Fire TV to talk. The next time my phone is ringing instead of diving for the remote I can just say ""ok Google, activate mute TV""."	1	"['zoeygirl69: I know someone might say get an IR blaster and use an echo....\n\nBecause my TV didn\'t sell, Amazon in their infinite wisdom broke it.

Brand new Fire TV Stick 4K Max

**All apps work fine except Prime Video. Prime Video app loads, shows library and previews (with sound) for highlighted shows/movies. Once I select a movie and click play I get a black screen or stay on the same screen.** The same happens when clicking to watch trailer. There is a ""click"" sound from the TV confirming the select button was pressed while ""watch movie"" is highlighted

I have:

* Factory reset
* Installed all updates
* Cleared Prime Vid cache
* Cleared data
* Reset (on/off) Fire Stick
* Unplugged Fire Stick for 15 mins
* Reset router
* Prime Video membership is current and valid
* No other device is simultaneously using the Prime membership
* No VPN
* New TV (LG C2)
* Tried another HDMI port
* Installed Prime Video app over the existing installation
* No internet issues (other apps load and stream as normal)

Is there a way to uninstall the Prime Video app so I can reinstall it?

Over Christmas I picked up a Toshiba Fire TV 55C350 and it works great on its own. However, I ran into some problems trying to connect my Razor Ripsaw to it for streaming purposes.

&#x200B;

I just cannot get it to display an image at all. It says ""No Signal Detected"" each time I try.

I have tried the following:

1. Disconnecting all cables from the Razer Ripsaw HD 4k

2. Connecting only the USB-C to the Razer Ripsaw, then to my PC.

3. Connecting the HDMI Cable into the Razer Ripsaw ""In port"" to my PS5.

4. Step 3 allowed for Video and Audio to come through on OBS.

5. Connecting the HDMI Cable into the Razer Ripsaw 'Out Port"" to my Fire TV.

&#x200B;

Step 5 completely cut audio and visual on OBS while at the same time giving me the ""No Signal Detected"" message on my tv.

Removed the cable from Step 5 and everything reverted to how it was on Step 4.

Basically, once I connect the capture card to the Fire TV it all goes wonky.

Are there some settings I should be looking at? I tried contacting Razer Support and gave them a bunch of PC related info that really shouldn't matter since it works fine with my old tv, the only change is the new tv. Also, just to clarify, This is a Fire TV, not a Firestick.

It appears it can only turn on and off my tv and receiver and change volume. If that's it, what a monumental waste of potential. The ir blaster seems to work well. Am I missing something.

I searched the sub and saw a similar thread from 4 months ago, but without any clear conclusion. I have an Xbox Series X console connected to one TV, and a Firestick 4k connected to another TV in the house. I'm looking to get the Xbox Android app to run on the Firestick so that I can remote play from the console.

I sideloaded the apk, and it installed without error, but when I try to run it, it just closes after a second or two. No error message or anything. I also sideloaded the Gamepass app and that one works well and I can play cloud games, but I have some games that don't support cloud and that I'd like to stream from the console to my second TV, and that's only possible via the Xbox app (god knows why Microsoft decided to make two separate Xbox apps, but that's the situation).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fireTV/comments/z93hxd/best\_setup\_for\_optimal\_frame\_rate/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/fireTV/comments/z93hxd/best_setup_for_optimal_frame_rate/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I have a FireCube New Gen. A Pioneer AVR and a 2018 Samsung MU6179.

&#x200B;

The first thing I did was connect the Cube to the AVR.

&#x200B;

Cube --HDMI-- AVR --HDMI ARC-- TV

&#x200B;

Sound was all OK I think, but the frame rate in 2 apps (ARD and ZDF (German public broadcasting)) did not match. They run in 25 frames, and the cube could not switch the frame rate, because that probably did not work via the AVR. Cube ran in 59.94 and thus it jerked quite a bit. In Netzflix, Kodi and Amazon Video but I had no problem. Only with the above apps.

&#x200B;

Have then connected the cube directly to the TV

&#x200B;

Cube --HDMI -- TV -- HDMI ARC-- AVR

&#x200B;

Now the frame rate is adjusted cleanly automatically and the apps no longer jerky. But there is no more suround sound - no idea why. 

&#x200B;

So I have to accept the jerking or no suround sound - what a shit.

&#x200B;

Someone similar experiences or tips?

I am on a wired connection with 250Mb down (4k looks amazing coming from a 720p TV)  

Prime video works great, audio is synced perfect. Video works perfect. 

I am using a soundbar with HDMI arc, I've tried each audio setting separately while clearing netflixs cache and force closing and restarting it each time. 

Upon googling I see many people recommend going to audio settings and using AV sync. I have no such setting on my TV which is on the latest update as of today. 

Optical and Aux both dont work at all on this setup for some reason, I cannot get any sound to come out of the bar if I try to use those with this TV. Otherwise I'd try those and see if it persists. 

Any ideas? I love this TV and really would like to watch those amazing Netflix originals. Thank you"	1	"[""AC2BHAPPY: Ok I am an idiot.

I moved it to a spare bedroom and swapped it with the older ""dumb"" TV - which I then attached a Fire Stick to. Thinking this would stop the issue.  


But it didn't - it's now doing the same thing - though because my Xfinity cable box is attached to a different HDMI it only happens when the Fire Stick HDMI input is selected (i.e. to get a good night's sleep - make sure the TV is switched to cable before going to bed).

  
In any case, this is extremely annoying. Anyone else have these issue(s)? And any idea how to stop them? Turn off auto-update perhaps (presumably that might be causing the problem?)"	1	['TheRealFarmerBob: “Oh!” “You found one of the new features.”']

Higher bandwidth does not mean less latency.  \nHigher speeds will not provide any benefits at all.\n\nAlso From the Moonlight FAQa  \nWhy doesn't the bitrate slider go beyond 150 Mbps?  \nThere are a few hardware and software limitations at play.  \nThe hardware video decoder on the client must have the capability to actually handle the video bitrate you specify. Since almost no content is produced at a bitrate above 100 Mbps, it's unlikely that the hardware decoder and driver could handle a 1 Gbps video stream even if you have a 1 Gbps network connection.  \nEncoders also have limitations regarding the amount of data they can encode from the source video. NVIDIA's GameStream tuning for NVENC is optimized for very fast encode times to ensure low latency. While this ensures frames are delivered to the client as fast as possible, it also limits the encoding hardware in terms of how much encoding it can do in the time window.  \nFinally, GeForce Experience itself also caps the bitrate that it will use for encoding, regardless of what Moonlight asks for.

When I Google it I end up with how to make it turn on to the last used input or just a black screen fix. Neither of those apply to my problem.

I tried searching but couldn't find an answer so hopefully someone here can help me. I have an insignia fire tv and am running my fire cube to watch TV since the picture quality is way better and there is way less buffering. 

But here is the problem, I can only switch to an input once. If I turn of the TV (sleep mode I think) when I turn it back on it won't load the HDMI port. I just get a black screen and an ""HDMI 1 press lll for settings"" box in the bottom right corner but the input won't load.  Switching to an unused port does the same. Not even a message about no input. If I restart the TV, it will load the input once again. But any changes in inputs or power gets me back to having to restart the TV so see the fire cube again. Any suggestions as to why the input won't load more than once without having to restart the TV? Thanks in advance"	0	[]

Setup:

* Samsung QN90BD (has ""Anynet"" their HDMI-CEC)
* Cube 3rd Gen (connected to Samsung HDMI 1)
* Sonos Arc (connected to Samsung eArc) - volume controlled by tv volume via eArc/CEC
* Samsung XG2 xfinity box (connect to Cube Input)

Also to note, the Cube automatically detected the TV during setup as Samsung

The Cube and cable box is in a cabinet and cannot be reached via external IR based controllers.  The cube is correct controlling the XG2 box via cube emitted IR. and I would expect it to control the TV via CEC, however this seems to not work.

Anynet (HDMI CEC) on the Samsung is enabled, and it works fine with both my old stick devices (ftv stick 4k max and chromecast with google tv) allowing me to turn the tv off using my stick controller.  Both were connected via the same HDMI cable that runs to my cabinet, and sat in the cabinet, so I know it's not an issue with where the cube is located.

The Cube however appears to not have any ability to turn on/off the tv or control the volume.

I have temporarily resolved this with a wireless ir repeater, but would prefer to not have to use this."	3	"['altjj: Happens the same to me with samsung frame 55.', ""mcbridedm: I tried on all 3 of my Samsungs and pretty sure it's a Samsung specific issue.

Scooter310	9	zpdyks	fireTV	https://www.reddit.com/r/fireTV/comments/zpdyks/why_would_they_make_the_search_function_worse/	"So as of this week, they have been making changes to the general search function on fire tv. All if it seems like a step backward. I have no idea why they would do this.

Example 1: If a show or movie was on multiple platforms it would show a lower banner on the screen with the apps it was on and Alexa would say "" I can do that on disney plus or Netflix. Which would you like? Now it just says something like ""use the next screen for options"". So now you have to either pick up the remote or say alexa select up to 3 or 4 times to choose the right option. 

Also apps that have prime channels but you pay through app and not through prime channels have now stopped taki g you directly to the app or show in the search function  that they are available as part of your subscriptions like they did a week ago.
If I ask fir action movies it will show a bunch of movies. Some will show purchase options and not ""play now"". However if you click on it it will say buy, rent, or watch now with HBO max. Why would I buy or rent it if I can watch it with my subscriptions? And if it is available to play now why would it say purchase options instead of play now like it used to? 

All of this is a stupid step backward."	2	"['jlbob: They want you to forget your subscriptions and take your money simple as that.', ""mertzi: 1.

For context, I have a early TV that is ""HDR capable"" which basically means it accepts an HDR signal, cranks the backlight and contrast up to max and displays everything horribly.  I'd much rather have an HDR signal and keep my tuned backlight and contrast settings but there's no way to disable HDR on the TV end, and as a lot of you know not on the FireTV end either.

I had a couple of these EDID dongles for other reasons: https://a.co/d/68ZLmhb and thought, bingo. What if we changed the EDID and told the FireTV the sink doesn't support HDR!

I got no signal though when plugging the above dongle in line. I read further and noted that people had said the FireTV provides little or power through the HDMI connector so I went searching for something that was externally powered and found this: https://a.co/d/gKzrYVa and set it to 4K 5.1

I live in New Zealand (A country the fire cube never sold in) but shipped the fire cube in because it's just handy having a fire tv and echo all in one. We've recently started getting NZ based apps that the fire cube is even promoting to me on its feature section at the top however I'm unable to download these, it says unavailable when I click on them.

The same thing happened on my Fire Stick 4K, however I was able to get that working and downloading the apps there by re registering my device and changing my amazon account country, sadly this trick isn't working for the Cube, they don't even come up as something ive purchased like a app on a different device usually would show up.

Is there any way around the geolocation blocks on a Fire Cube?

Use that to download the APK from the Stick, then use the remote install option to install the APK to your Cube.\n\nThis is a few steps, but once you get it down, you can do it in under a minute.\n\nThis will give you the Amazon app store app versions, but I'm not sure if they will auto update through the Amazon app store after you install them on the Cube."", ""Richysgames: Sadly this way doesn't work, you try to make it install it through the website and it has a x beside a greyed out device title."", 'Richysgames: With this way, when you go into the store does it register as you having downloaded it?   \n\n\nI pulled them off my fire stick using ADB and installed them via a file manager but now when I say click ""Spark Sport"" under featured apps and games, it brings up the store version saying unavailable however if I click the app i downloaded, it brings it up so the apps are working but now i effectively have two of everything.
