1. A newly registered domain from namecheap
2. Cloudfare account
3. self hosted apps - Home assistant , Plex , adguard , homer etc on multiple containers

I prefer to host every service individually instead of add ons on HA ( unless needed ) . So if I want to install docker ( looking for the right docker compose file ) for cloudfare , but wondering how to setup certs (if at all needed) 

What I want to do -

I  want to access the selfhosted apps remotely . With multiple reads I  understood I need to have a dedicated domain ( if not duckdns ) ,  cloudfare account . Also want to use a reverse proxy - Traefik ( have been reading this is better than nginx  ) 

But I am not clear on how I should connect all these and access securely and safely .

If my understand if wrong or need a change in my direction , please let me know .

if you need any other info , I will update my post accordingly.

Basically the smart LED strip is just plugged in and then you use an app (or your voice) to turn it on and off. The actual strip lights are connected to the ""driver"" which I guess is just the little controller unit box of the LED strip.\n\nSo I bought a couple of these strips for about 24 feet of cabinets as well, with breaks for the microwave, fridge, and then jumping across to an island. All of my breaks, I just soldered connections to some low voltage wiring and then soldered back to the next section of LED strip.\n\nBut I have no idea if my LED strips are dimmer now because I have no way of knowing voltage / resistance / how that interacts with the total distance of my runs, etc.  So it\'s all pretty confusing to me.', 'ankole_watusi: To be clear: “Diode Led” is a brand and excellent quality.

Additionally, you won't be able to control dimming or color/CT adjustments from the switch.\n\nThe more 'smart' way of doing it is wiring the controller to unswitched power so it's always on, installing a smart switch, and linking them through a hub. (I use Home Assistant, but some of the other more full-featured hubs like Hubitat, etc might work.) The smart switch never actually switches power to the LED controller (and doesn't even need to be wired to the LED controller at all), but just sends a wireless signal to your hub, which 'translates' the button presses and controls your LED strip. If you use a Zigbee or Zwave smart switch and LED controller, they can be directly 'paired' together. A Wifi switch flashed with ESPHome or Tasmota, paired with a compatible LED controller flashed with ESPHome, Tasmota or WLED would be another option."", 'ankole_watusi: Govee is a budget consumer brand - It’s night and day vs the Diode Led and W.A.C. lighting brands the Frito-snatching electrician above recommended.', ""Fritos_on_my_sub: Thank you, I wrote it up fast at work so a few typos but that's fine. For your situation that little box attached to you led tape is most likely the driver yes, unless your tape is running off direct 120v from the outlet. It is most likely the driver dropping it down to whatever voltage your tape is running off. Im a little confused to what you're wanting out of your system but if you want it to be controlled by a smart switch you have to make the outlet it's plugged into a a switched outlet. There's many ways of doing this including a master line voltage and slave wireless switch set up they make from many different companies. You can do this if you want to avoid cutting sheetrock. They make these type of smart switches as well such as the lutron cassetta system my personal favorite for the moneys worth. But if you are going to mess with the outlet and real 120v wiring I would always recommend calling a electrician. Those solder joints you made in between tape lines could cause your light to be dimmer if the solder jobs wasn't up to snuff. The brand I like diode lighting makes little wire to tape adapters with tiny little terminals so you don't need to solder. I'm not sure if it would work for your brand but they do exist. Also yes tape can get dimmer over distances but not in how you think. They're ran in parrel so it's not like Christmas lights that get dimmer. But the longer the tape the more wattage it will require which will mean you will need a stronger driver to run them. Yes voltage drop can \nbe a problem in these systems but for most people it's not a issue they need to run into unless it's a large project or just has applications I'm not aware of."", 'JPInMontana: Ah, that helps.

StudioZanello	8	138qcws	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/138qcws/lutron_caseta_dimmers_not_playing_well_with/	Last week an electrician installed 10 Lutron Caseta dimmer switches to control my *existing* lighting comprised of 9 Philips Hue bulbs, a WAC track with 12 halogen spot lights, and kitchen under-counter LED strips and one over-the-sink round led light.  Even when the Caseta dimmer in the kitchen is in the full-off position, the LED strips continue to glow and the over the sink light strobes intermittently all night. In the bathroom when the Caseta off button is pushed the Philips Hue bulbs in the mirror sconces strobe just before turning off.  Worst of all, the Caseta dimmer controlling the WAC track lights in the living room has a barely tolerable 60-cycle buzz when at minimum and maximum but at the mid position is unbearably loud.

You can use those to have the automation check to see if those conditions are met.

ACE and Do-It Best will likely be more expensive, but you're likely to have a knowledgeable person help you out if needed. Free popcorn is always a plus with those hardware stores. Home Depot is an option for home delivery, and they have a better track record for selling devices with the proper certification than Amazon. Returns are often painless. I specifically make these recommendations for high voltage items because these companies do a good job on filtering out items that lack the proper safety certification. The cert doesn't mean the product is reliable, it just means the product likely won't short out and cause a fire when it eventually fails someday.\n\nEbay has also been a good source. If you're buying something with questionable quality to begin with, you can at least directly support a smaller seller on Ebay, and you'll often times have better customer service with Ebay.\n\nFor cheap home automation products that are not high voltage and run on Zigbee, it's usually best to just skip Amazon and buy from Aliexpress.

It's a great vacuum on its own, and has been going strong for well over a year now for me, I just don't get much value out of the mop function.\n\nIf I was buying another one I'd maybe try and find one that can automatically empty itself - I have to empty the dust bin after every cycle (2 cats, lots of fluff), and if I forget and it runs automatically with a full bin it ends up being a bit of a waste of time cos it doesn't actually pick up anything"", ""GiveMeTheBits: I have the dreame z10 pro running valetudo, and it does all the things you mentioned plus auto empty.

I've perused the wiki and a lot of old posts but am struggling to come up with a firm direction here.

Me and wife have two young ones, and we're both Apple Watch users. We'd like to be able to control some devices using Siri (or suitable shortcuts from our watch). We don't want Alexas or Home Assistants all over the house--not feasible. We're looking to start small -- some lighting/fan controls, a few outlets. I want to be able to control them via voice commands to my Apple Watch, and I also need them to have physical switches that work.

I'm told that Zwave/Zigbee > WiFi, and I'm happy to take the plunge, but I'm confused as to what I'd need to buy to use that and if Siri would even handle it. I.e. do I need a HomeKit hub AND a Hubitat? Do other systems like HomeAssistant allow you to use Siri? What I want to avoid is 6 different apps to control different things (Lutreon, Inovelli, Kasa) or multiple hubs. It has to be suitable for my wife, who won't put up with nonsense like that. 

Looking for advice/ideas. I am an engineer but not a software developer...I can do some scripting but generally shy away from too much custom buildout. Happy to spend a bit if it's wise to do so.

Thanks!"	6	"['mgithens1: I’d say you’re starting from the wrong angle….  First, the watch is a terrible interface to control anything. I’d go far as saying an 8 inch tablet would be as small as I’d be willing to go.

This will prove to be very tedious and you’ll abandon this method in a very short time.\n\nSecond, the goal of home automation isn’t to move a light switch to your wrist or to a different spot in the room.  The goal is to automate the task… every item brought into the system should be there to add to the magic.  The garage light should turn on because you opened the door and should stay on for like five minutes after the doors are closed and no motion is detected. My master bedroom light is not automated, but a double click on the switch lights up the under bed lights… which also come on when my feet trip the under bed motion sensor at night.', 'NicoLeOca: With home assistant, you can expose any device to HomeKit and control it via Siri.\nMy experience is really good.\nHowever, I doubt that controlling a lot of devices with your watch is convenient', ""Squeebee007: I use Home Assistant with its HomeKit capability to expose everything I want to HomeKit. \n\nPeople are saying the watch is a terrible interface, and they are not wrong, but what the watch does do well is put Siri on your wrist.

And I'd need physical switches to still work as well for visitors/in-laws/etc. With the kids our schedules are rarely suitable for timed events, and the kids or cat will set off motion sensors. I never liked Siri but am now finding it helpful for some voice commands when my hands are full. I want to bring that to bear on some home devices.

His fiance was left with dozens of unfinished tech projects, encrypted hard drives, multiple e-mail accounts, cloud storage accounts, and a password list that he hadn't updated for a few months. She reached out to me to help her to sort through and try to figure out what to do with all of the stuff.

It caused me to think about my own projects and family and reflect on how they might handle it if I wasn't there to explain. I've started making changes to my systems and my approach to projects to keep them in mind. Some of the changes I have made so far include:

1. I created a separate e-mail account for the house itself. This is a shared account that we both have access to and includes our bill notifications, mail delivery notifications, etc.
2. I'm moving all of my automation accounts to the house e-mail - almost every system wants your e-mail address, I simply started using that one instead.
3. I'm working on migrating my password library to my local server and establishing a printed password library that will go into the home safe. (I have grave concerns that this will not be enough or stay updated and I'm looking into how to automate this if possible)

I'm looking for instances where using NFC tags makes more sense than simply executing a macro on my smartphone. In particular, I'm curious about situations where NFC tags provide added convenience, ease of use, or functionality that a smartphone macro couldn't.

For example, I've found that using NFC tags for sharing Wi-Fi passwords or connecting to a Bluetooth speaker with a guest's phone are both more practical and user-friendly than using macros on my phone.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences with NFC tags in home automation settings. What are some other scenarios where NFC tags really shine and provide advantages over smartphone macros?

Thanks in advance!"	6	"['aquatoxin-: If my husband or I scans the NFC tag on the dog food, it switches a binary variable in Home Assistant to TRUE.

Question about using aqara smart switches with tuya smart lights/bulbs	spvn	2	137ft50	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/137ft50/help_question_about_using_aqara_smart_switches/	"Googling this question only comes up with a ton of people saying ""you shouldn't use smart switches with smart lights"" but nobody actually explains why. I want the following use case:

* When I switch on the smart switch, the light should switch on based on it's last settings in the app (e.g. colour, brightness).
* When I switch off the smart switch, the light should just switch off.
* I am aware that when the smart switch is off, I cannot change the colours/brightness of my smart lights (duh). However, I will still be able to use a voice assistant/motion sensor to turn on the switch, and the light will come on

Is all the above correct? Because I’d be totally ok with this use case. I don’t foresee myself adjusting the brightness frequently but would just like the option to occasionally."	2	"['ArgumentativeNutter: yes you either need to wire your bulbs straight through so the relay isn’t capable of turning off power to the bulbs, or buy a switch that supports decoupled mode like aqara d1/h1.\n\nyour use case is how i have mine set up. aqara switches in decoupled mode, hue bulbs and a script to set colour temperature while the bulbs are off (but have power). \n\nthe switch is configured to toggle the bulbs in home assistant. \n\nif my home assistant or zigbee modem breaks i can just long press one of the switch buttons to reset it and use it like a normal switch again.', 'Ninja128: >I don’t foresee myself adjusting the brightness frequently but would just like the option to occasionally.\n\nIf the only thing you want to adjust is brightness, why do you need smart bulbs at all? A smart dimmer switch would accomplish this without the extra work of a smart bulb + smart switch configuration. Usually the only reason to get a smart bulb when you already have a smart switch is for CT/color control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Googling this question only comes up with a ton of people saying ""you shouldn\'t use smart switches with smart lights"" but nobody actually explains why.\n\nThe only reason they say that is because:\n\n* Typical WiFi smart switches don\'t have the ability to be configured in decoupled mode where they don\'t cut power to the bulbs. If they don\'t configure the switch to be decoupled from the bulb, or just bypass the switch so the bulb always receives power, having Zwave or Zigbee bulbs dropping off the network can wreck havoc on a Zigbee/Zwave mesh.\n* Typical hubless ecosystems can\'t handle dimming or CT/color controls from the switch.\n* They don\'t want to deal with the hassle of having to turn on the switch (either physically, through an app, etc), waiting for the bulb to reconnect, and then adjusting the bulb brightness/ct/color. \n\nThat said, any decent home automation platform (Zigbee, Zwave, Home Assistant, Hubitat, etc) can definitely handle this. Additionally, if you\'re okay with the extra work of turning on the switch and then making bulb adjustments, it will work just as you outlined.\n\nI use Home Assistant, and smart bulbs or smart LED strips controlled by decoupled switches in a few locations and it works perfectly. The switches never cut power to the bulbs/strips, so I don\'t have to worry about turning the switch on before controlling the bulb/strip directly, and I have full dimming and CT/color control from the switch itself, in addition to any automation/app/voice control.']"

Was deciding between Gerda Tedee (top quality Polish brand) and Yale Linus. Went with Linus cause it was cheaper and want to get a Homepod mini for it acting as a hub  for remote access in order to NOT to get another router/gateway ie the Yale Connect (already got an Ikea Dirigera at home). 

Thing is that I watched some guy on YouTube just now who said that if the Linus lock is connected only to the Homepod, you will only get remote access to functions that are in the HomeKit and will not have remote access to anything that's in the Yale app.   


How limiting is that? What can I do by only using the HomeKit? Am I going to get notifications on my phone that the lock/door was opened when I'm away? Really want to up the security a bit here. Having someone broken into your home is an awful feeling..."	0	[]

TheBitchenRav	1	1375b3l	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/1375b3l/need_help_with_google_home_powered_switches_how/	"I have a water pump that I want to run for exactly 30 seconds using a Google Home powered switch. However, when I try to set up a timer for the switch using the Google Home app, it only allows me to set it up by the minute, which is not precise enough for my needs.

I was wondering if anyone has faced a similar issue with Google Home powered switches and found a workaround to make them turn on and off a water pump for a specific time period, such as 30 seconds?

I appreciate any help or advice you can provide. Are there any third-party apps or settings that I can use to achieve this functionality? Thank you in advance!"	4	"['Nick_W1: Turning a pump on and off with a smart switch can burn the switch out quite quickly if it’s not protected, or rated for inductive loads.\n\nJust be aware, it’s not as simple as “connect to a smart light switch”.', 'Ninja128: As the other poster noted, make sure the switch is rated to handle the pump. Inductive loads like motors, pumps, compressors, etc, have huge startup current spikes, and can wear out most consumer smarthome relays fairly quickly.\n\nIf you can\'t find an appropriately rated smart device, you can connect a normal smart device to a beefier relay or even a contactor to handle the load. The smart switch will handle the smart connectivity, but the relay/contactor will actually carry the load. Sometimes adding an RC snubber circuit is enough to absorb the current spikes.\n\nAs for the 30s runtime, look for smart devices with ""inching"" capability. Several of the Sonoff, Shelly, and eWeLink devices can do this.\n\nIf you had an Alexa instead of GHome device, I\'d also recommend something flashed with Tasmota, but it\'s a lot more involved to connect to Google Home. (With Alexa devices, it\'s literally one extra click in the Tasmota config, and it automatically shows up in Alexa.)\n\nThere\'s also the more full-featured home automation platforms like Hubitat and Home Assistant, but they might be overkill for a single device.', 'TheBitchenRav: Even if it is a small pond pump?', 'Nick_W1: You may be Ok, depends on how big a pump it is, and what kind of switch you use. If it’s small enough, and you use a switch with a relay, you are probably Ok.\n\nThere are people here that are switching well pumps and sump pumps, and the relays in the switches burn out in a few months.']"

This is just for fun. I like the idea if only that it would make me smile every time I come home at night.

What radar sensor can I use to detect a vehicle in a 30' radius? The 30 feet (10 meters) is flexible, though farther is better. Also detecting people is fine but not required.

I can build (relatively basic) electronics. I looked at 24GHz sensors, such as the [SMR-333](https://www.innosent.de/en/sensors/smr-333/) (sparse [datasheet](https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/InnoSenT/220201_Data_Sheet_SMR-3X3%20_2.3.pdf)). That gives I and Q, without signal processing. I dug into the signal processing and it's quite involved to track speed and direction. I'm thinking about trying some simple processing using FFT and CFAR, if I see strong frequency peaks then I call it good enough and declare something is in range (radial movement). Maybe even skip the FFT and just look at the real valued signal.

Ideally there is an I2C or SPI sensor that does more of the processing, then I can just integrate it into my electronics and not rely on my own janky processing. Does that exist?"	6	"['schadwick: If you don\'t have one already, you probably didn\'t know that you ""need"" a surveillance system. Check into Blue Iris with CodeProject.AI, which can trigger alerts (and MQTT messages as automation triggers) when detecting cars, people, animals, etc. I realize this is not the answer you sought, but you might enjoy a change of tack, and enhance your security at the same time.', ""Ninja128: They aren't exactly cheap, but some of the [HRXL Max Sonar WR Series](https://maxbotix.com/pages/hrxl-maxsonar-wr-datasheet) should be good out to 10m, with options for both TTL and RS232 outputs. They're also compatible with ESPHome, if that's your thing."", ""tungvu256: cams with AI is probably your best bet.\n\nI like Reolink. it has AI and vehicle detection. 4 cams with 6tb hard drive is about $600 though....  pretty easy to set up as seen here [https://youtu.be/XXpYhUU02G4](https://youtu.be/XXpYhUU02G4)\n\nthere's also Frigate if you just want 1 camera"", ""n4te: It's an interesting idea to use a camera. I hadn't considered it, thanks! I do plan to have a Unifi G4 Pro camera pointed in that direction, but it's intended for a good view of the driveway which is already past the address marker. I'd like to detect cars farther out, any car in the cul-de-sac.\n\nI could add another camera. Maybe it could be hidden in the address marker itself, so probably not a G4 Pro. I have their doorbell and the person and package detection doesn't work at all for me, so I don't trust them to detect cars. I'm not sure if I could get the video out of Unifi and a discrete camera probably makes sense.\n\nI'll dig into it more, though I may still try out hacking a radar sensor. I wish there were sensors that handled more of the hard parts as individual parts. On the full solution side of things the Aqara FP2 looks really neat, at least to detect people, but is IPX5 so probably not suitable for outside."", ""bluezp: Presumably this is only necessary at night given that it's about lighting up the sign. So you would need bright IR lights to reach farther but if they're looking for only a 30ft radius would a camera sending video to blue iris and codeproject.ai be able to react fast enough to change the brightness before the car has passed by already? Haven't used it before so I'm genuinely curious."", 'n4te: Those are super cool, thanks! ~$125 is fine. They can be up to IP68, so should be OK in the weather, though rain may reduce range. The range charts are a bit weird. It looks like the 10m sensors have a detection cone of about 60cm (23.6""). I was hoping it would be wider. The wider sensor range is only 5\'. They need direct line of sight of course. They look like a metal disk, so at least they aren\'t unsightly.\n\nI\'m not sure these are great fit given the narrow detection cone, but they are really neat and I\'ll keep them in mind for other things!\n\nI recently needed a ""trip wire"" kind of sensor to detect entry at the top and bottom of a staircase. I ended up with an [AFBR-S50](https://www.broadcom.com/products/optical-sensors/time-of-flight-3d-sensors/afbr-s50mv85g) lidar sensor (~$75). It was a huge pain. The sensor itself is relatively dumb and Broadcom provides the smarts in driver software, but to ""protect"" their IP it is a precompiled shared library for Cortex-MX processors. I wanted to use ESP32-C3 so I had to change to ARM and figure out how to make that work (spoiler: STM32CubeIDE is a mess). I couldn\'t get the Broadcom examples going with my slightly different processor, but I got a new project setup. Now I\'m waiting on a PCB from JLCPCB, then I\'ll finally try it.\n\nAnyway, it looks like the ultrasonic sensor would have been much easier than all that and may work just as well for the ~4\' narrow beam detection. If lidar ends up failing, I\'ll give utlrasonic a try for the staircase sensors. They are already enclosed in 1"" pipe, so the design barely changes. For lidar I glued watch glass over one end of the pipe with a cable gland on the other end. For ultrasonic it\'d just screw into threads.']"

It’s based on the esp8266 module (as are a lot of iOT devices) which is an embedded microcontroller with wifi. One side of the device is connected to mains power via a plug and electrical cord. Then inside the device I’d cut one of the thick traces with a rotary tool so that the device was now a dry relay. Instead of switching 110v power to the device connected to its output terminals, it would instead complete a circuit between those wires (er —that’s my memory of how it worked). Basically it did whatever the wall switch would normally do. \n\nThen I connected wires from the output side of the switch to the switch terminals on the garage door housing. The same terminals used for the wall switch, I just doubled it all up in there. \n\nNext step was to open up the switch and flash it with the open-source Tasmota firmware. I never ran the switch using the Sonoff cloud-based iOS or android app. \n\nBooting the switch with the Tasmota firmware exposes a configuration web page, on which I configured it to connect to my home wifi. Once it was on the home network, I gave it a name and set it up to communicate via the MQTT (mosquito transport protocol) to a raspberry pi I use as an automation server that’s running a mqtt daemon and the automation environment node-red. \n\nWithin node-red I configured a graph of nodes that, when triggered, would activate the switch for a couple of seconds and then release.

I know there are single hardwired motion sensing light solutions, but we want a wireless remote trigger on the driveway to control an entire circuit of hardwired lights on the house. 

If possible, we would also like to still manually turn on the exterior house lights if needed using the physical switch. 

Does anyone know if there is a product out there?  I can see parts of the solution but not the entire package:


I see four key needs;

1.) battery powered remote sensing with ambient light sensor to only work at night, 

2.) transmitting and receiving at longer ranges of roughly 150-200 ft to…

3.) switch on an electrical circuit of exterior lights, AND 

4.) also working manually with the hardwired switch.

The price of Philips bulbs were much higher than others when I started with our smart home journey years ago, so I never looked beyond that it was a closed, expensive, system at that time. It now seems more open than when companies were trying to lock people into systems and brands.\n\nIf your driveway has a clear view of the house, few trees and shrubs, you might still have issues with signal depending on what your house is made of. Big windows that have a view of the driveway will help. \n\nMost people will have a zigbee mesh network composed of lots of zigbee devices that are also repeaters, but it sounds like your network is going to be limited to just the driveway light switch and the motion sensor. The light switch should act as a repeater and be at the front of the house, so that will help with the far off motion sensor. \n\nThe only issue with PIR motion detection, besides maybe signal, is that they can pick up a lot of movement from trees and scrubs in even a light breeze. Since your driveway is so long, it also will need to be set up with a long enough delay before turning off to allow the cars to travel up it, and for the passengers to exit the vehicle.  Your driveway lights might be on a lot more than you would like. You probably can use a geolocation routine with Hue, so if the motion sensor doesn’t workout you could just not use it. \n\nEven if geolocation didn’t suit you, the smart switch probably can be turned on at dust and off later in the night where you never have to adjust the time as the system will keep track of the shifting sunset times. \n\nWe usually know when someone will be coming over; so just turning on the driveway lights for visiting friends and family at night probably wouldn’t be an issue, especially with a smart switch that can be turned on from anywhere.']"

Child thermostats would be placed in every room in the house so until specifc rooms reach some temperature the main heating system will be providing heat to the room. This would mean i also need to change temparuture regulators on radiators that would be compatible with such system. It would be nice if main control had wifi compatibiliry to connect from outside world (could setup a server). What I would like to avoid if possible is creating electrcity wires to child thermostats and regulators (batteries?) but if not possible I plan to provide it.

What I currently have is single circle heating system, all radiators on single pipe circle with gas central heating on one thermostat in one room, when this room reches desired temp all rooms start to get cold which results in that bathroom is usually cold even after providing it full presure and regulator on 100%.

Also have knowlege how tu setup RPI and use API-s in js, Go, Python. If system has open API that would be awsome but not required, I would satisfy with closed system.

All sugesstions are more than wellcome."	12	"['boondogglekeychain: Honeywell Evohome I moved to from nest a year and a bit ago. This gives you one main stat which is the control panel and each radiator can have a smart TRV which can have its own temperature set using a built in temperature sensor or, can be linked to a room stat or another radiator smart TRV. You could have as many as you like. The issue will be your bathroom as probably not great to put a smart TRV in there but if it’s open fully then it will be on when any other radiator is on so it should at least be on more than it is now.\n\nI believe Hive offers very similar\n\nNest would let you have multiple stats but don’t think they do smart TRVs.\n\nEdit: I’m sure you’re aware but what your problem indicates is that your radiators are not balanced correctly and your thermostat is in the wrong place. Ideally you would have the stat in the coldest part of your house (hallway near front door for example) near the one radiator in your house with no TRVs. Then, all the rooms warm up first, their TRVs shut off and finally when the stat reaches temperature it shuts the boiler off and the whole house should be at the correct temperature. So you might be able to fix or greatly improve your heating for free. But that of course doesn’t help if multiple rooms are poorly insulated or open windows etc, that’s where a smart system will help', 'Blackhawk2479: I have had great results with [Tado](https://www.tado.com/gb-en) \\- central wired thermostat plus TRVs with built-in thermostats all connected to the boiler via wireless bridge, each individual TRV can call for heat as required.

Also I think I don't want thermostat in bathroom as other rooms will be over heated.\n\nI will try to regulate it few more times but still I think its wrong position of thermostat. Do You think it might be something else?"", 'PurppleMushroom: This is more of a wish than a need, we are not freezing, just trying to raise comfort a little bit more and play with a new thing, adding WIFI capability and per room heating without closing manually all other valves.  \n\n\nHow do You stop radiator in unused room to stop working without manually turning it off?', ""Blackhawk2479: The reading from the TRVs is usually within 1 degrees Celsius of the readings from my HomePods in other parts of the rooms, but as far as I know the TRVs are calibrated to accommodate being closer to the heat source, so I'd expect them to be fairly accurate.\n\nI think adding multiple sensors is overkill, and you're trying to over-complicate things, personally; if a room feels a little cool, up the temperature a bit, don't obsess over numbers."", 'ankole_watusi: I don’t. I can turn it off manually if I’d like. But the room temperature doesn’t contribute to the set point in any case. \n\nI have one-pipe steam BTW. Sounds like you have two-pipe water.\n\nSteam valves shouldn’t be throttled. And should only be turned off while system is cold, so as to not trap water in the radiator.\n\nYou’re asking for a very expensive solution, as you’d need variable bypass valves at each radiator I should think. Are there already manual bypasses for balancing the system?', ""PurppleMushroom: Maybe I already have TVR but its not smart. Not sure anymore when You put it like that. I believed I can regulate the temperature of the radiator depending on room temperature but not 100% sure.

Also the radiator to stop consuming warm water and sent it to next radiator after desired temp is reached.

I opted for this over an IR blaster as it has two way communication (to make it simple for housemates that don't care about this stuff) and I can control it from outside my home.  I also like that you can check CO2 levels. 

I've just seen that Switchbot have released a Hub 2 (AUD$100) though and I'm wondering if this is a cheaper option.  I like the inbuilt thermometer/hygrometer functionality and since I gave away a Switchbot meter plus to my sister I'm already due to get another one (AUD$25) so if for an extra $75 they do the same thing besides read CO2/TVOC levels I'm thinking to just get the Switchbot.  My current Switchbot meters aren't linked to any hub so I like that I could now see the readings if I'm not at home.  

[https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-hub-2](https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-hub-2)

I don't have any automation set up at the moment but I plan to in the future.  I currently have a vague understanding of terminology and systems but no real understanding of how they work and speak to each other.

My current list of smart devices include my iPhone, Google Home Minis, Fronius smart inverter for my PV panels, 7 x Switchbot Meter Plus and my new Mitsubishi aircon.  I'll also be getting a Hydrotherm heat pump which is Tuya based.  From what I understand as well, I would need a Sensibo for each smart appliance (aircon, heat pump etc) but the Switchbot Hub can control multiple devices as long as they are within line of sight? (which my heatpump and aircon would be)

I'm hoping this purchase will be smart enough to do basic stuff now without locking me into a particular eco system when I start doing home automation (not sure which way I'm going to go, I have no coding experience but I'm switched on and willing to learn)

Recently my landlord installed a fan in my bathroom to help with the air circulation. However he did the bare minimum and installed the fan in-line with the bathroom lights. No separate controls for the fan and the lights, no biggie. I figured we would really benefit from a timer switch, basically so we can leave the fan on for a preset amount of time after a shower. This sounded like a simple enough project for me to undertake.

The first product I purchased was a [Leviton LTB60-W](https://www.amazon.ca/Countdown-Incandescent-Resistive-Inductive-Locations/dp/B07ZZQQD7R/). I turn the breakers off and take the old switch out. I immediately notice how old the wiring is compared to the rest of the appartment. One black wire (hot), one white wire, no neutral, no ground... I then read the user manual for the Leviton timer switch and immediately realize it won't work without a neutral. No-go.

I then set my eyes on the [GE 15318](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Countdown-Required-Included-15318/dp/B007BJULYS) and purchased it. I get to work and install the sucker but it doesn't work. I go to the troubleshooting section of the user manual and. My heart sinks when I I read that the switch won't work if it's not grounded. Once again, no-go.

In the process of reinstalling the old toggle light switch, it proceeded to basically disintegrate. ... No-go. I went and bought the simplest fucking switch, a [Leviton 05601-2W](https://www.leviton.com/en/products/5601-2w) Decora rocker-style switch. Installed it without an issue, and the bathroom lights and fan are now back to being functional. But shit, guys, I still want a timer switch.

So, /r/homeautomation, I humbly admit my defeat, and I turn to you for advice. Is there a timer switch on the market that will work without a ground nor a neutral ?

Long time Nest user over here. I've always loved the cameras' quality and how the security system integrates with my door locks. However, Nest is no longer giving monitor support for their alarm system, I think it's a sign to move entirely off the Google ecosystem. So here's my needs and let me know what you think is best:

&#x200B;

1. I'd love if the door locks can integrate into the alarm. It's annoying to have to enter a code twice and I love that I can disarm the alarm when I unlock the lock.
2. I'm looking into switching camera systems completely, but this is where I am not sure if I can live with the cameras being separate from the alarm system. I love seeing the clips when the alarm goes off so I can quickly diagnose what is going on.
3. I'm looking to switch to Ecobee for the thermostat which seems like a no-brainer.
4. Ideally I'd like for the system to be integrated with Homekit since I'm basically using that to manage everything already. I have a Homebridge instance, but a direct integration would be more ideal since I'm reaching the lazy stage of my home automation journey in life and I don't want to have to troubleshoot integrations all day.
5. Lastly, I'd love for it to be a monitored system. 
6. Aside from the monitoring fee, I'd love if I can avoid a monthly subscription fee. I have a Synology NAS and a Ubiquiti Dream Machine so I can easily host the video locally too. However, I don't mind paying if it's a quality product.

&#x200B;

So what would your recommendations be for:

* Security system
* Cameras (indoor and outdoor)
* Door locks
* Doorbell

&#x200B;

Stuff I've already considered:

* Aqara - It's not monitored, but also I've found that their sensors have some connectivity issues. Again don't want to have to be constantly troubleshooting.
* SimpliSafe - No direct integration with Homekit.
* ADT - I'd prefer to not be tied into a contract and also I think ADT is always one generation behind in technology.
* Ring - I'd rather not give Amazon more money and data. I trust them less as a company.
* Ubiquiti - I'd love to use their cameras, but no direct Homekit integration and seems like they don't have an alarm system other than their entry management."	1	['Lightingcap: I would look into Alarm.com dealers.  An alarm.com system with a Qolsys panel can connect zwave devices so can integrate your lock and alarm. You can setup a rule to disarm when the lock is unlocked with a code. \n\nIt has ecobee integration as long as the dealer turns it on (which there is no reason not to). The ecobee integration is limited in functionality however (no scheduling as of right now, I believe).\n\nHas indoor and outdoor cameras integrated. \n\nYou can find dealers that don’t require a long-term contract. Full disclosure: I work for one. We have month to month contracts and you pay for the equipment up front. \n\nThe only thing I think you would be missing is HomeKit integration. Google tells me there might be a homebridge plugin, but I don’t know if or how well it works. \n\nI will warn you that it’s definitely a security system with smart home capabilities. The automations are fairly basic and you are somewhat limited in terms of what equipment can be connected compared to a full featured home automation platform. \n\nIf you don’t mind going DIY, you can buy everything from a company like Surety Home or AlarmGrid and set it up yourself (I’m not affiliated with either of them, but I’ve seen good reviews for Surety). It’s certainly a cheaper option than going through a local dealer, but you don’t have the option of a tech coming out to setup or fix things. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.']

New house and I would like to automate my outdoor lights and some indoor lights.  My front porch lighting is on a triple switch (1st pic).  I would like 1 or possibly 2 of these switches automated so my porch lights come on at sunset / off at a preset time, possibly on for \[xx\] minutes if a motion trigger is hit.  The 2nd switch is a hallway light on a duplex with another switch in the house and the 3rd is the upstairs hallway - also on a duplex with a second switch.  The second pic is my garage light - 2 switches / I only need to control one (the outside light).

Any suggestions?  New \[to me\] house, so starting from scratch / there's zero automation currently installed.

You need to be willing to put up with interesting side effects at times, and know how to (or be willing to learn how to) dig into issues and integrating different components together. It’s better now with the hubs and glue automation tools but I wouldn’t call it plug and play.']"

We previously had roller blinds from Home Depot along with cheap blackout curtains over the top of those as there was lots of light leakage on the edges.

&#x200B;

This setup worked - but the issue was that we would never open the curtains and blinds as it was just a pain in the butt. Curtains not so bad but then you have to battle the roller blinds which liked to jump or just do battle with you in general.

&#x200B;

So I'm of the mindset to get fully automated blinds/curtains. I'm hoping to get a combination that achieves 3 separate states:

1. Blackout
2. Privacy (let in light, but not let anybody see in/out)
3. Totally open

At a minimum, I would like the step from 1-2 and back 2-1 to be automated. If I had to manually move from 2-3 and 3-2 that would be acceptable.

&#x200B;

Has anybody found a reasonable solution for this? I've seen where you just have two roller shades - a privacy one and a blackout one. I don't love that though as I think there will be significant light leakage since with our windows the shades will have to be installed outside of the window frame - not inside the frame. So I'd love to have something like privacy roller + blackout curtain that wraps around some - but automated curtains seem expensive/rare.

[https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B09BYQL9TS/](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B09BYQL9TS/)

However, my wife brought up a valid point: What if we're upstairs or downstairs and want to let the kids in without physically going to the door?

I assumed there would be a door buzzer that's compatible with Alexa, but after researching, it appears the answer is a bit more complex. There are WiFi smart locks and door cams that can display the video feed when the doorbell rings, but it seems like there isn't a way to control a smart lock directly from that screen with a button. Instead, we'd have to use a voice command like ""Alexa, open the front door.""

Is there a way to integrate the smart lock with the video feed on the Echo Show? Or should I consider a more traditional, hardwired approach? I'm also a bit worried that someone could find a window that's cracked open and shout, ""Alexa, open the front door!""  Hence why the button seems like a better approach.

Looking for a smart heating system that can call for heating via an open therm connection, has smart TRVs for radiators, and can work with external cheap room smart temp sensors and other home assistant routines. 

Detail
So at the moment I have a Bosch EasyControl setup for my central heating - I originally chose this as I wanted the central unit to fire up my combi boiler only when a radiator called for heat. 

I’m going to be upgrade my heating soon to have:

- a central thermal store, supplied by:
- a wood burning stove in the lounge with a back boiler on for water
- PV Solar panels (excess electricity with heat the tank
- combi boiler adapted to still heat the thermal store if needed

The thermal store can still take similar opentherm connections like a boiler can, however I’m wanted to make the system a bit more advanced so I can read when the store is full of hot water - potentially have excess if the wood stove is still on - so I can be more “generous” by upping the target temp on the eTRVs throughout the house. 

Unfortunately it looks like Bosch aren’t really supporting the EasyControl setup and have moved onto a new smart home v2 that doesn’t have a direct opentherm connection to turn on heat. 

I appreciate any recommendations of either full setups or individual pieces where I can combine the connection directly to the store, smart eTRVs, wireless temperature sensors which I can put in rooms and also attach the the thermal store, all of which I am automate through Home Assistant.

I have very little home automation - just a couple of wifi lights, and couple of appliances attached to Google Home / Nest.

Into the small hours, often waking us and the kids, we have reported to the police, but without evidence, they can't really do anything.

This is a Zigbee Bulb that is connected to SmartHub Aeotec hub. The UI clearly says they are connected via Zigbee

I also never gave the Bulb Wifi Cred during setup.

So that's good. However when I took out my ethernet cable and just kept the WiFi on, the local control was not working. That is, I was not able to Turn on/off these lights.
Put back the ethernet cable on, and voila. Everything works.

Which is strange, because I never set up these lights against a WiFi. Also the SmartThings clearly says it's connected via Zigbee Switch.

Now when I go back to the Routine, the routine does not say that these are Local Control.

So weird.

1. If the Bulb is connected via Zigbee, how come no local control.
2. If the bulbs are not connected via Zigbee, why does Smartthings say so. And if not, then how are they connected. Surely not WiFi since I never gave any credentials.

So I've been playing with the HLK-LD2410 occupancy sensor and have found it to be a very good unit overall once you get the app and spend some time dialing it in. I was wondering if anyone had tried using one over a bed shooting straight down through the ceiling drywall. I'm not looking to turn things on, I just want to use it to make sure the ceiling fan doesn't get turned off when no motion is detected by the PIR in the room when we're sleeping.

I know I could use a pressure sensor on the bed as another option, but the house infrastructure makes it easier to use one overhead as I have extra Cat5's going from the attic straight down to the automation rack in the basement. 

Any commentary?"	6	"[""fredsam25: This is one of those things that's highly dependent on your particular setup, the thickness and composition of your drywall, the positioning of the sensor, the distance to the bed, the comforter used, how quickly you want to detect the unoccupied condition... Etc. Without doing some testing, no one can tell you what will work for you. \n\nIn general, I can tell you that the algorithm to determine with to do with the occupied/unoccupied state is even more important than the sensor itself. You probably don't want the fan starting and stopping based on you being positioned poorly in bed or leaving it on all day because the cat is in your bed. Getting those edge conditions worked out based on time of day, temperature, delay start/stop timers, runtime timers... etc, will go a long way to make the automation work, even with a poorly tuned sensor."", ""inorganiccentipede: You want to have the sensor in the ceiling to make sure the ceiling fan doesn't turn off?  Not to be obtuse here, but is the positioning of the sensor and fan going to avoid the feedback loop of the fan moving causing the sensor to think there is occupancy?"", ""rsachs57: No pets or kids to worry about, it's just me and the wife, both in our 60's so other living things aren't a consideration. The room already has all the timer stuff set up using feedback from the alarm system and works fine, it shuts down the lights, fan, TV and audio after no motion is detected for an hour and gives you a verbal warning through the room's speakers 30 seconds before it shuts down the room to give you time to move around and stop the shutdown. What I'm after is when the room shuts off I want the fan to be bypassed when we're in bed day or night since us old retired folks are prone to random naps. I'm not concerned with temperature so much, we just like the fan on low to keep the air circulating. Though now that you mention it there is a temp sensor in the room and since the fan has 6 discrete speeds it might be fun to have it adjust the speed depending on the temp.\n\nIt took me some time to dial in my first one which is in our lower bathroom. These mm sensors are tricky since you have all the adjustments for distance and sensitivity and how you angle it is critical. That one does turn on the lights when you go into the room after sundown. I was using an IR sensor in there but for those extended stays I thought the built in combo of motion and steady state occupancy would work better since having it turn off after 10 minutes would sometimes lead to the room shutting down at night and leaving you in pitch blackness.  Not a big deal for us but not so good for visitors.\n\nSo I was really most interested about sensitivity through the ceiling since I don't want to have a box mounted on the ceiling over the bed, the wife wouldn't like that much.

The room is pretty big and the fan isn't directly over the bed, so I think with some careful calibration I can pick up the bed and not the fan motion. Since the sensor picks up motion in somewhat of a cone shape I'm hoping with some careful aiming and distance / sensitivity calibration I can pick up just the bed and avoid the fan.\n\nI have read the mm sensors can be triggered by high air motion alone so that'll be another unknown until I actually try it."", ""fredsam25: I hide electronics in smoke detector housings.

They make their own zwave radios and have leveraged the whole zwave SDK to include utilities no one else does. (They could, they don't because it's work they don't want to do)\n\nNow, what is zwave? It is a purpose-built automation technology based on a 900Mhz mesh network. There is a non-profit that manages licensing, handles extensions to the standard, and ensures all devices go through 3rd party testing for standard & security compliance.  Several security systems support zwave (Honeywell, GE, Alarm.com) while others are based on zwave (Ring, Vivint) because some zwave devices do meet UL standards for security uses.\n\nIt is in its 8th generation (800-series devices) and covers the gamut of low-bandwidth devices (no cameras or audio feeds). Many 1st gen, 100-series devices can still work, however old locks before the 500 series have been deprecated as the security landscape in 2023 is vastly more hostile than it was in 2002.\n\nIt doesn't support tcp/ip, so it can't have malware, can't report on your activities, and cannot be remote-deactivated. Being 900Mhz it doesn't compete with or even touch your router. You could have up to 232 of them on one $35 zwave radio. \n\nLight switches, and all other constantly-powered devices act as relays, taking the low power signals and boosting them back to the controller. As a result, battery powered devices can last for several months.\n\nAside from the zwave radio, you need automation software running on an always-on device. You don't need much more horsepower than a raspberry Pi for automation, but many people will use a small form factor PC so they can add cameras. \n\nI like Homeseer because it's been around for more than 20 years, scales well up to hundreds of devices, it is rock solid, runs on Linux or Windows x86 or Arm, and works with a huge number of technologies other than zwave."", 'peterxian: Z-wave is a low-power radio frequency standard for smart devices.

Certainly the Linear and Nortek are (labeled 908Mhz is Z-wave North America freq), but the Lutron Diva is not even a smart dimmer (just a LED-specific regular dimmer) and most TP-Link smart devices use WiFi (2.4ghz) for communication. \n\nZ-wave devices need a hub (called a ""[controller](https://www.thesmartesthouse.com/collections/gateway-controllers)"") that runs the network software to make everything work. You can ""build your own"" hub using a z-wave usb stick connected to a server running open source software like Home Assistant with ZwaveJS. You can also buy a hub from a reputable vendor like SmartThings / Aeotec or Hubitat. If you want to combine both the Z-wave and the WiFi devices into a single architecture, some (not all) hubs that can do that. If you want to bridge your hub to a Apple/Google/Alexa ecosystem, some (not all) hubs that can do that, too. Choosing a hub can be challenging, because they tend to lock you into their set of capabilities, so put some thought into it before buying. \n\nAs others noted, these devices were probably already associated (""paired"") with another hub, which I guess you don\'t have.

With either, you can host them locally with your desired version of Z-Wave - you should only utilize [700 or 800 series Z-Wave](https://atrim.co/zwave/z-wave-800-series-comparison.html) for your hub and can do so with a [Z-Wave stick](https://www.zwaveproducts.com/collections/z-wave-controllers-for-developers).\n\nGiven the previous owner / tenant left a bunch of these unwired, it's very likely that they disconnected them from their own hub prior to doing so.

So you aren\'t missing any major security features and the operational improvements on range and battery aren\'t critical.\n\nAt worst you are missing out on features that were available in 500 chips but not common until later. For light switches that would be central scene, where double/triple tap can be used to trigger scenes (all lights off, all lights on, dim straight to 20%, etc).  It\'s nice but since the UI is non-intuitive ,it\'s not super popular for good reason. (why would you click a light switch more than once?)\n\nSo there\'s no downside to these.\n\nExcept....the addiction.  You might be like ""hey, I like having lights on timers. That\'s nice"" and be done with it. Or you could get the bug to automate......everything.  You see how you could tie lights to your washer, or use the lights to signal presence to adjust the thermostat. \n\nThat is the downside.', ""Ninja128: Those don't even look like they're 5th gen. The similar Go Control WD500Z***5***\\-1 are the Zwave Plus/500 series version.\n\nWhile I can agree with most of what the other poster discussed, one big issue with Zwave devices prior to the 500 series was their inconsistency with reporting status. They're fine if you just want remote control, but they're a PITA if you're trying to use their state to trigger an automation. You can set up your controller to poll the device for status updates, but that's still slower than real updates, and puts more strain on your network (especially with the number of switches you would need to poll here.)"", 'GruntXIII: Do you also have your front door lock on z-wave?

All of them will keep out casual thieves, virtually none of them will stop a determined thief with a hammer or a person with a nail gun (go watch Lockpicking Lawyer on YouTube. $30 and a trip to Lowes will let you open any lock in 5 seconds). And even if it did, rock+window=theft. \n\nThat is an older, 300 series device (https://products.z-wavealliance.org/products/1025. ""zwave Plus:No"").  \n\nThe PITA issue with these is that to prevent someone stealing the encryption keys during enrollment, the radio gets turned down to 1mw, which has a range of 3ft. So you have to move your controller to the front door to link the lock. Then you have to run one or more maintenance tasks to identify relay nodes (meaning those light switches) and configure the mesh route back to where the controller actually lives (which is almost never 3ft from the front door).  Some controllers did that automatically or had good tools (i.e. homeseer) but back then most didn\'t.\n\nThe 500 series keys introduced a ""modern"" key exchange model. Prior to that, many zwave controllers actually shipped with a small battery pack so you could carry it through your house. So it wasn\'t that the 300 series was insecure but that it\'s security model was highly inconvenient. But yes, in theory, if someone was within 3ft of you during enrollment (or lurking in the bushes with a can-tenna) they could get your zwave keys to eavesdrop on your network and issue commands to some pre-500 devices (locks had a few extra defenses to prevent replay attacks but non-secure 100-300 devices lacked that).\n\nSo while it\'s a nuisance to configure that lock, it\'s a perfectly fine lock. And in use, the lock has no network security issues.', 'rlowens: So now you know why they were abandoned.']"

Hi all! I was hoping to get some advice on wiring: I’m trying to connect a smart WiFi switch to my Elite Screens Spectrum 2 motorized projector screen (110v). The screen has a power cord with an in-line three-way switch (UP, OFF, DOWN) that attaches to the screen assembly by an aviation plug. 

As you’ll see in Pic. 1, there are three wires (black/load, white/neutral, and green/ground) leading from the electrical outlet towards the inline switch. The load wire is soldered to the OFF position. 

From the switch to the projector, the Black and Red Motor wires are soldered to the DOWN and UP positions on the switch, respectively. 

Both the neutral and ground bypass the switch. 

I learned the color coding from a reviewer on Amazon who successfully rewired their inline switch to a remote-controlled (not WiFi) switch with three positions: UP, OFF, DOWN. (Pic. 2)

I’m not sure whether I should get a single- or two-relay switch. If I needed a single-relay switch in Pic. 3, I could follow the wiring from Pic. 2. 

However, I’m not sure if this switch in Pic. 3 would allow me to reverse the motor. I should point out that the WiFi switch would be controlled by the Tuya app.

I’ve already successfully wired a two-channel WiFi relay switch to a 12v actuator using the diagram in Pic. 4 for DC motors, but I’m just not sure about how to wire an AC motor.

In the case of AC motors, I imagine the red and black motor wires would be connect to the COM and NO ports. The green/ground would bypass the switch altogether. Bu what would I do with white/neutral wire? 

Thanks for reading all of this. I was trying to be as detailed as possible. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"	8	"[""Nochange36: Why aren't you using the 12v trigger option?

Kethlak	3	134qkse	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/134qkse/haalexa_setup_moving_from_wifi_to_zigbee_do_i/	"Every light switch in my house is currently a wi-fi smart switch. I want to change them all to Zigbee. I have a handful of separate Aqara Zigbee sensors which are connected to my Home Assistant with a Conbee II stick, but I need to be able to control my light switches with my Alexa.

Do I need a separate Zigbee hub (say, if I went with Aqara switches, for example), or is there a way to get my Alexa to see the stuff in Home Assistant? Would a hub be a better idea for other reasons?

More information:  
When I originally set up all my smart switches, there was great debate online over whether Zigbee or Zwave was better, or whether they would last, or whatever. At the time, I just went with wi-fi since I knew it had been around a long time and was likely to be around for a long time. As I added more and more devices, I ended up with more than 32 (cell phones, tablets, laptops, all the switches in my house), which was a problem I didn't even know was a thing, and I solved it by getting a set of 3 Google Wifi routers which I believe do some kind of mesh thing but I don't understand it because I'm more of a software person. The routers are giving our family issues in that every week or so, the internet just goes out for no apparent reason. This is easily remedied by unplugging the main router and plugging it back in again, so I know it's not a modem issue. I tried swapping the main router and one of the child routers, but I still experience the same issue. So I'd like to be able to get a new router, but I'm kind of tied to the current one by my smart home unless I set up my own mesh thing which I don't think I'm ready for. It looks like the Zigbee protocol, at least, is going to stick around for a while, and the router is driving me crazy so I'm ready to make a change."	6	"['tarzan_nojane: The Conbee II stick is the only zigbee ""hub""/controller you need.

Able_Loan4467	1	133rn96	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/133rn96/making_an_mqttenabled_open_source_ventilator/	" I'm making an open source energy recovery ventilator system that I would like to have basic smart home integration, and I have been able to get the system working with [Adafruit.IO](https://adafruit.io/)  no problem. 

 I figure I  should keep it really simple for compatibility.  Basically it recieves  CFM commands for how much fresh air to bring it, in cubic feet per  minute, from MQTT topic X (which you can specify through a web page  configurator).  It reports the uptime in milliseconds to a separate MQTT  topic just so you can see it's still working.

What systems should I test  it with?  I want the most general purpose, open source, reliable  approach I can get.  Home assistant/mosquitto?  


  I tried to find  transmit-only dimmer switches to try to get working with it, but they  don't seem to exist.  I could probably use a regular smart dimmer switch  and steal it's reported position.  It has to be scalable to CFM though, or I can change my device so it accepts the standard values these devices transmit.   The reason I need to test is that I know little about home automation  stuff.  Like, can I get a switch to send whatever range of floating  point numbers to whatever topic I want, or are they all rigid,  unprogrammable?"	1	"[""mmattice: There are several dimmers that are made with Espressif chips which either esphome or tasmota will run on.

Manually controlling the erv seems tedious as well.\nIt seems like having other sensors tell the erv they're seeing bad stuff would be a better indication of the need to ventilate.\nAn mqtt subscription of erv/input/# with each of those other sensors sending to a unique topic in that tree would allow for a PID loop per source to factor into overall flow.  This would allow things like a gas stove being on (and the nitrous oxide they produce) to affect the flow more than a co2 sensor.\nFor example, that co2 monitor ticks up front some baseline you've set, sends that ppm to the erv and the erv decides based on how far off nominal it is how fast to move the air.  \nYou could also have inlet and outlet temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors on the erv slow it down if you're cooling/heating the interior too much for the climate control systems to handle, or need more makeup air to cover for the stove's hood.""]"

I work in Business Intelligence and own a home with just a few HA devices. I want to get to a point where I own my own data. Generally speaking, is there any recommendations in this regard?

For my setup specifically, this is what I want (at this moment):

* Thermostat (Emerson Sensi) - ideally, I want to store the room temperature, heat/cool state, thermostat temperature (cool to 25c, heat to 19c, etc.), run times, start/stop datetimestamps ets. (anything that I can get really)
* SmartLife Temperature sensor - temperature/humidity data throughout the day (hourly?)
* SmartLife Smart Plug - electricity usage, on/off, datetimestamps, etc.
* DLink Smart Camera - video footage, datetime stamps of activity (if any)
* Ring Video Doorbell - video footage, datetimestamps of activity
* Alexa devices - datetimestamps of routines run, and any other data I can get my hands on

I have a virtual server (hypervisor) with several Linux VM's. I have some coding/scripting skills in Python and other languages. I also have some reporting infrastructure (db server, gateway, power BI licenses, etc.) and want to run my own analyses on these data eventually.

I know this has become a novel, but I'm aware that its hard to get video out of Ring and DLink, so if someone has gotten it working GREAT! but I'm not holding my breath. I also think that the sensi might have something but I'm sure it's limited.

Does anyone have any thoughts?"	6	"['sgxander: Your own coordinator such as Home Assistant is a good start. All its data is kept on device and is yours.

And I'm afraid I'm a bit lost. I've talked to our electrician and he gave me the following recommendations:

\- wireless based systems (zigbee, zwave and friends): these can be unreliable if your house uses a lot of concrete. They've had bad experiences in the past and don't recommend it anymore. They say it is the cheapest to install.

\- KNX: has its own set of wires and independent power supply. It's therefore very reliable. It has a pretty wide industry support so finding components that support KNX is easy. However, they say it's very expensive (though it wasn't clear to me if the expensive part was the devices, installation or management software).

\- Wiser: another wired system. That was his recommendation. He said the cost for that is less than a KNX system. 

&#x200B;

For a bit of context, the house under construction is in Europe. It has 2 floors, the bottom floor has concrete walls. The two floors are connected by a 40cm concrete slab and concrete stairs. The top floor is mostly open plan. The house is expected to have Full wifi coverage via a mesh of \~3APs. There is ethernet available in all rooms.  


What is important for me is that the home automation doesn't rely on any cloud service to function properly (I don't want my stuff to be bricked if the provider pulls the plug). If necessary, I have enough experience to run any kind of server software to control my house (there will be a dedicated server somewhere in the house).

&#x200B;

I'm currently leaning towards KNX, due to it being fairly standard and the fact that it can be run totally locally. The extra cost given by the electrician scares me a little, though.

&#x200B;

From this information, what do you think would be the most reasonable choice for a home automation system?"	66	"[""VeryAmaze: I assume you've researched what capabilities KNX can provide and see yourself using those. In that case - If you can spare it, I'd totally go for KNX in a new build. You can later even integrate it with more agnostic hubs like HA.  \n\nKNX is a very reliable standard, it just works. The expensive part is kinda everything lol. No lights deciding they no wanna listen to the hub, no upgrade bricking stuff. It's a fine ecosystem.  \n\nWhether KNX is *worth* the money for you vs going fully open source HA+fiddling with random AliExpress switches, I don't think anyone can tell you that. But if you are looking at a professional setup KNX is golden, can't go wrong with it.  \n\nI'm personally fully DIY with HA and random AliExpress finds, it's not rocket science and I enjoy the twiddling, but if I was doing a fully new build I'd get KNX and augment it with HA.  \nFor the ZigBee point, yeah concrete is a bitch. Had/have the same problem. It's sorta like treating it like a weak WiFi antenna, you need to create a good mesh. Not for the faint of mind I suppose."", ""ChipBeef2354: I can't imagine spending substantial amounts for a wired proprietary system in this day and age. Think about where we were just a few years ago in technology.  You seem to be under the impression that there isn't an off the shelf solution and that you have to flash everything with tasmota or such. I think your builder is clueless on the wireless protocols. \n\nZigbee and Zwave are mesh networks, with proper placement of just about any type of mains powered device they can reach pretty much anywhere in a house. 10ft thick concrete walls, no problem, signals easily pass through doors and what sits next to nearly every door in every room.......Light switches. So as you can see this is a non issue.\n\nIf you do go Zigbee or Zwave either use mains powered sensors as much as you can, or at least use one that can use aaa batteries. Life is so much more convenient at battery change time. Also remember multi sensors are your friend. Sure they cost more but they give you a lot more data/capabilities with just one device to change batteries in.\n\nEcosystems to look at: Home Assistant, Hubitat, maybe Smarthings but that's questionable anymore, and since you're in Europe I believe the new Homey Pro may be a good choice, but info is kind of sparse.\n\nAnother recommendation is to run ethernet to multiple spots in every room and to every location outside that you could possibly want security cameras.  Be sure to think of the future, 1 GB/s is kind of standard for now but it wont be in 10 years. Don't cheap out on the cabling.

In other words, after spending a non-negligible amount on home automation, when you wake up in the middle of the night to go pee and you turn on some lights, would you expect that it\'s a no drama 3 minutes sleep interruption because everything always works, or are you going to accept the scenario of ""ffs the mesh isn\'t working again, I\'ll have to pee in the dark, and tomorrow to reserve an hour to debug/reset stuff and get it fixed, but hey, at least it was cheaper""?\n\nWireless makes sense for retrofitting something that\'s absurdly expensive to modify and modernize (historical buildings), for a temporary convenience while renting and not being allowed to do permanent changes, maybe for the ones on a budget which will then need to trade the financial savings for a loss of reliability, and for the lazy. I\'ve heard a thousand excuses, whataboutisms, claims based on cherry picking evidence or not having any evidence at all, sales pitches disguised as disinterested helping advice, you name it. The fact remains that wireless, by its nature, is subject to uncontrollable interferences, and will ALWAYS perform worse than a wired connection.\n\nThat being said, I will not tell you what to do because it\'s your decision. But I can share my experience, so that you get a sense about the costs and whether they are ""too expensive"" for you, as the electrician has stated. I am currently renovating a house - its first renovation since its construction some 60 years ago. It consists of basement, ground floor, first floor and an attic that is being converted in living space, with reinforced concrete floors. I\'m going with KNX and here are the costs I\'m expecting:\n\n* ETS Lite license: already have it, but it was like €180 with the discount after completing the fairly easy training online;\n* 65 light and socket circuits controlled over KNX + 5 raffstores and 1 garage door (roll type, not sectional) - I kinda went for all I could dream of, but essentially these will be controlled by 2x 24-channel switching actuators at €390 each, 2x 16-channel switching actuators at €290 each, and one actuator for up to 8 window rolls at €260; a total of €1620, or €22,80/controlled circuit, although if I were to consume ALL available channels then it would be around €16/circuit;\n* Some 33 ""switches"" with 2-8 buttons each, at around €60-€85 each depending on the number of buttons; I\'ll roughly estimate the costs with these at under €2200;\n* KNX cable at €49/100m, and I doubt I\'ll need more than a roll, as KNX can be branched out in a star topology.\n\nSo roughly €4000 for all standalone functionality with near perfect reliability.\n\nFor control I\'ll use an IP interface (€100ish), and for integration with other systems and app-based control, local or remote, OpenHAB will be running in a container on a SBC (another 150€ for the SBC, shared with other applications). There are dedicated visualisation solutions but they are expensive af, starting in the 4 digits. Thanks, this I can roll on my own with some hours of one-time configuration in a browser, for free and with no running costs other than the couple watts of power consumed by the SBC.\n\nA KNX motion sensor with light sensor at around €120 will control outside lights - that\'s the only one I need.\n\nWith a light intensity and wind sensor, I can automate the window rolls for energy efficiency and protection in case of strong winds. And OpenHAB can supplement that with current time/date, twilight calculation, and weather forecast.\n\nHeating will use a different system, where I can accept lower reliability of radio communication (the valve doesn\'t need to instantly open or close, it\'s fine if the radio message is repeated a couple minutes later) at a significant cost saving.\n\nFire/smoke will have a dedicated professional-grade installation making it much more cost-effective over decades.

No problem with single switches, but having trouble figuring out the wiring for a 3-way. I have two switches which control exterior lights that I want to replace with [Claro smart switches](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BYPD5WPG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&th=1).

One of the switches has two sets of wires connected, two red and two black, with the neutrals spliced together.

The other switch has just one set of wires connected, red and black with the neutral.

This doesn't look like any 3-way setup I've seen online. Any advice on how to wire up these switches is much appreciated!

Edit:

Here is a table of the load on the wires in each switch configuration.

S1, Switch 1, S2 = Switch 2; U = Up, D = Down; R = Red, B = Black, W = White

Any help or ideas would be appreciated 👍

Edit: Solved!

So...Alexa will only make announcements based on the status of locks and certain, very specific, lights. So I made a virtual lock in SmartThings that unlocks when the heater turns on, and a routine in Alexa that makes an announcement when the virtual lock is unlocked.

Sharing my notes for posterity (also [sent as a PR](https://github.com/tasmota/docs/pull/1223/files)). The tutorials I found were mostly [like this one](https://blakadder.com/pir-in-tasmota-integration/), outlining lots of extra configuration, and the [official Tasmota PIR docs](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/PIR-Motion-Sensors/) suggest adding a bogus relay so the PIR ""switch"" shows up.

This worked for me very simply, however:

1. Flash the ESP8266 with Tasmota (I had an Adafruit Huzzah, used the Generic 18-pin Tasmota board config, and the Chrome web-based flasher and a 5V USB FTDI worked great).
2. Set up WiFi and MQTT (I already had Mosquitto configured with HomeAssistant).
3. Configure a pin as a switch using the Tasmota web UI.
4. In the Tasmota console (also accessed through the web UI):
   1. \`SetOption114 1\` to [detach switches from relays](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/#setoption114)
   2. \`SwitchTopic1 pir\` to set a custom switch topic, so the switch is discovered, per [Tasmota HomeAssistant Supported Entities docs](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Home-Assistant/#mqtt-discovery-removed)
   3. \`SwitchMode1 1\` to set the [switch mode](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Buttons-and-Switches/#switchmode) to follow (ON/OFF as the PIR triggers/resets)

Then using the Tasmota integration (which HomeAssistant automatically suggested), the device was autodiscovered with a sensor that shows on/off. (I edited the sensor to be named PIR and have a sensor icon.)

Robot mower that is cheap and returns to doxk up a narrow corridor of 50cm so it's out of sight. Doesn't need to be connected through home assistant but that would have been a bonus.

Reslly wasn't sure where to post this under seeing robotic mower seem to brand specific on reddit.

Little more detail....

I have a worx landroid already and used to have it do the front and back yard but now have a dog. I had it setup to open a small access door then push a gate open to go from rear to front yard, but I now have cold feet about my dog escaping eventually.. So now looking at two robot mowers, with a cheap one for the front as I'm considering having it mow the front council strip at night, so prepared for it to go missing if it gets stuck and someone takes it before I realise.

Challenge I have is ideally I'd prefer the charging dock to the up a narrow corridor of say 50cm so it's hidden.

However the landroid needs to drive in from the right and out to the left so won't work.

We have a brand here called Gardena (I'm in Australia) and that has a seperate guide wire but that needs 60cm clear on one side and 30 on the other as it offsets its return. So that won't work.

I've looked at the moebot s5 but that seems the boundary wire comes out the back of the dock. I can see any videos of exactly how the mower returns though so I cant be sure.."	4	"['Paradox: Check out the Ecoflow BLADE.

1682698988.0	28-Apr-2023 09:23:08	Looking for advice and how to upgrade my home network to more reliably service 100+ WiFi smart home devices	RealDiels	68	131zm8z	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/131zm8z/looking_for_advice_and_how_to_upgrade_my_home/	"Hi! I have been using smart home devices for a while now, but I am a total noob when it comes to home networking. My current home set up is very novice level, but I am moving in the next month or so and would like to plan out a better home networking set up in my new home. 

**My goal with this post is to explain a bit about how we plan to use the network, features I do/do not expect to need, and experience with my current set up. With that, I would greatly appreciate any community advice on topics to research further!** Considering I am such a novice, I know it will take me a bit to understand the ins and outs of even a basic home network, so I am prepared to learn/research for a while before committing to any purchases. With so much to learn, I will doubtlessly have follow up posts in this subreddit as I focus in on purchase decisions. 


**Current home set up:**

* TP Link Archer A7 (AC1750)
   * We have two of these (one smart home devices, one for other devices like phones, game consoles, etc.)
      * While accumulating WiFi smart home devices I realized our router/WAP was overwhelmed. Adding a second certainly helped, but hasn't been foolproof.
   * Both sit next to each other on the lower level of our house and serve the entire house (only two floors)
      * (I know now that this was likely a terrible choice lol)
* I had no knowledge/understanding of 1g/10g technology at the time, so I imagine that everything is at least bottlenecked to 1g.
   * The speed has been fine for all of our use cases but network reliability is another question...
* Only a few devices are hard wired (home office laptop, game consoles, a few smart home ""hubs"")


**What we are looking for in a new set up:**

* We have **lots** of smart home devices (probably pushing 100 at this point), many of which are WiFi connected.
   * I do plan to reduce reliance on WiFi smart home devices in the future (switching to Z-Wave or Zigbee), but even still our network will have a large amount of devices connected. 
   * **Connection reliability of our smart home devices is one of the most important features I am looking for in a new home network set up.** 
      * Seriously, any advice on keeping these devices reliably on-line would be much appreciated!!!
* We have very little need for ""fast"" internet. 
   * While I should probably plan for future use of 10 gig internet, 1 gig is honestly fine for 99% of our current use cases. 
   * In terms of speed, our current set up (likely all 1g) is a-okay for us. 
* I do work from home, so connection reliability is required there. 
   * My laptop is hardwired in at our current house
   * This set up works fine now, so I don't feel the need to ""upgrade"" anytime soon.
* Very occasionally we play multiplayer games online. 
   * We can hardwire our game consoles in the new house.
* I am highly interested in setting up a few VLANs for normal use, smart devices, and maybe a guest network.
   * This is a topic I'll definitely need to research further to understand the set up involved. 
* My understanding of VPNs is very thin, but I would like to have the ability to 1) protect my entire home network with a VPN and 2) ""remote in"" to my home network while I am away to solve issues for my family.
   * I believe those are separate VPNs, right? (my noob-i-ness is showing lol)


**New house networking plans**

* Our new house is unfortunately not wired with any sort of ethernet. 
   * I believe I could ""easily"" wire the first floor and unfinished basement for 10g
   * The second floor would require a lot of wire fishing that I am not prepared to do, so I may need to live with an ""extender"" access point on the second level.
   * I've read about powerline adapters and MoCA
      * Sounds like powerline adapters are finicky at best, so I plan to stay away from that.
      * MoCa sounds more reliable, but I am not sure if there is even coax available on the second floor of our house. If it is available, our second floor WAP could be connected using this method instead of installing it as a wireless range extender.
* For wireless networking, I plan to include one WAP on each level (basement, level 1, level 2)
   * Level 2 may need to be a range extender as there may not be a hardwired connection available (see bullet points above).
   * The new house is fairly ""square"", so hopefully that helps with coverage from a single WAP on each level. 
      * I can add more if necessary in the future. 
* I have read about Ubiquity's line of UniFi products
   * I am considering a Dream Machine Pro and some access points (I don't think I have enough hard wired devices to need a dedicated switch yet)
   * I get the feeling this would be overkill for what I need. 
      * The myriad of features seem great. Though expensive, it seems like it would do all I need in one package.
      * Considering I am a novice, adding more and more components from the getgo might be asking for trouble. Thoughts? Happy to look into other systems as well!

Thanks for reading this long write-up, and have a wonderful day :)"	80	"['chassett1: I was in the exact same scenario and made the jump to Ubiquity UniFi system. It is AMAZING. The folks over at r/unifi are very helpful and this guy’s tutorials are spot on. [tutorial](https://youtu.be/vI5-aIL1l6w)', ""clt81delta: I am a former Network Engineer, now working in the Cyber Security space. I also dabble in home automation, and am a fairly handy man.  A few thoughts.\n\na) You need no less than three access points covering your residence.  5Ghz APs provide half the distance of 2.4Ghz.  And you want to factor in resiliency.  The system needs to function with at least one AP being down (maint/patching/failure).\n\nb) Avoid mesh wireless systems (strictly speaking Wifi here) where one or more Access Points is connected to the network via wireless (wireless backhaul).  Your APs should be hard wired to the network.  Best approach is usually a PoE powered Access Points connected to a PoE Switch.\n\nc) This is dependent on your use cases, but generally speaking your internet connection is your bottleneck for the whole network. 1Gbps is more than sufficient if you don't have a multi-gig internet connection.\n \nd) It used to be common place to see a chase running from basement to attic where the builder would run duct work for second floor vents.  If you have a single heat pump, there is probably a chase.  If you have a dedicated heat pump for aecond floor, there wont be a chase for duct work, but you may have a radon system that is piped internally (vs externally).  You might be able to get something through that chase.\n\nIf you do, pull a loop of string through and secure on each end with a little eye hook or something.  Now you can attach wires and pull them up without loosing the string for next pull, or future pull.\n\nIf you do not, you can always run the exterior from basement to attic, a couple of wires would easily tuck into corner trim of vinyl siding.  Drill a 1/2 in or 5/8 hole, a pair of Cat and maybe a Coax, tuck it in, caulk the two holes.\n\ne) Network Topology / Security / Usability....\n\nThere are two ways to approach this...\n\ne.1) Run a flat network with a single SSID.  Setup is easy, there is no vlans, you run whatever wireless equipment you want, or have laying around.  Nice APs, repurposed wirless routers with DHCP disabled, doesn't matter, it'll work.  You accept that all of your devices, guests, iot devices, etc sit on one network, it is what it is.  It is simple and works.\n\ne.2) You run a more complex network with at least two networks, and multiple SSIDs.  You need a firewall, a managed switch, and managed access points that support mapping SSIDs to VLANs.\n\n... \n\nIf you go with Ubiquity, a lot of the complexity is handled for you in exchange for money.  You have a slick UI that configures the firewall, switches, and APs, and you can run that simple flat network, or the more complex one, your equipment will support it.\n\nOtherwise you piece together your own system.  Assume you are manually setting up a firewall, switches, and APs, and then creating vlans and mapping them through the equipment to SSIDs at the APs.\n\nAt this point I'll focus on the firewall because everything else is set it and forget it. \n\nOPNsense is a free firewall platform but you provide the hardware, if you dont have something, it's probably a few hundred bucks to get a multi-port low power box to run your firewall platform on.  It's an open source system, community support.\n\nI used pfSense/OPNsense for years, great platform.  \n\nToday, I run a Firewalla (Gold series). It is a newer platform, a little pricey (on par with Ubiquity USG?), but really really slick.  Management is done via app on phone, has push notifications for things like new devices connected to network, someone trying to communicate with know bad site, etc. Its built on Ubuntu, includes a software package called Zeek(Bro) which allows you to see traffic flows between devices inside your network and the outside. Supports multi-wan, port aggregation, acts as VPN server, and can connect to third party VPN services.  You can even pin specific networks, a device, or groups of devices to a third-party vpn profile so that all of their traffic egresses via the VPN.  It also tracks devices via MAC address, which makes applying securiry controls to dual stacked (IPv4 + IPv6) networks so much less complicated.  (Its the bees knees)\n\n\nSwitch... TPLink, Netgear, Ubiquity, used Cisco, etc.\n\nAP... TPlink, Ubiquity, Ruckus\n\n\nf.) Design Theory\n\nLets start with the premise that I dont trust any device, and therefore my ideal topology from both a design perspective as well as a security perspective is a single network+wireless where the access points provide full isolation between all of the clients (basically a guest network) and where all unnecessary traffic is blocked.\n\nIn my house, this is impractical because a) I need the home automation server to communicate with equipment, b) I want to be able to cast media from my phone to TVs and Speakers, use a network Printer, and c) because most devices actually need to talk to at least a few things on the internet.\n\nTherefore, my design is as follows.\n\n* vlan1, mgmt network, no wifi\n* vlan2, open network, wireless without client isolation\n* vlan3, fci network, wireless with Full Client Isolation\n\nMy network equipment, security panel, and home automation server sit in the mgmt network, egress is blocked by default.  I've written allow rules for the home automation server to do what it needs, and only what it needs.\n\nPersonal devices for me and my partner, streaming devices, and connected speakers are on the open network.  Egress is allowed by default, I have placed the streaming devices and speakers into separate groups, and limited what they can communicate with on the internet.\n\nBy default, all orher devices would be placed into the third network with full client isolation.  They cant talk to each other, but they can egress to interent.  No need to build separate networks for IoT, kids, or guests\n\n* Traffic netween networks is blocked by default.  I allow it where needed, for instance the home automation server needs to reach out to the speakers in order to cast messages.\n* I have a block applied to all networks that prevents access to known bad sites (its a feed applied to a block rule on the Firewalla)\n\nIt's not overly compex, but provides sufficient isolation and control where its needed and is flexible.\n\nIf say for instance I wanted to host a minecraft server, I would simply build another network, place the minecraft server into that vlan, and configure the necessary firewall and nat rules (port forwarding)."", ""HowYaGuysDoin: I'll give something different than the ubiquity suggestions. At least this is what worked for me. \n\n\nI replaced all the phone jacks in the house with RJ45 (network) jacks since the builder used cat5 for the phone wiring. I put a gigabit switch where all the phone lines used to terminate. Cat5 does gigabit no problem here. \n\nThen, throughout the house I have different routers acting as APs, specifically Netgear R7000s. Each router has a different SSID for it's 2.4ghz band and the same SSID for the 5ghz band. \n\nUse channels 1,6,11, for 2.4ghz or a setup that does not cause any overlap based on bandwidth.

Not running sshd on that server.  Even more secure?  Not connecting that machine to a network at all.   Obviously, that's quite extreme, but anytime you allow anything or anyone access you reduce security.  Anytime you add any device to a network you reduce security.

These items are often self discovered on your network and just pop up. Or you can choose from a “menu” and say I have UniFi and a integration menu will walk you through installation. Other companies make it harder to integrate. (Some Tuya devices are a PITA!) It doesn’t stop the savvy community from eventually figuring out a way though. It’s just not as easy. In the end you have a central location to see all the data/states. Since you can see all the information in one place, you can also action from the same place. Turn on the bathroom fan and play music when you get out of bed, sure.  Shut off all the tvs when the garage door opens.. ok.

Planning to connect with a smart relay so I can turn it on and off remotely. What I really want to do is have it turn on automatically when I'm outside and turn itself off automatically when I go back indoors. Also have some existing smart outside lights that I would add to the automation. We use HE + alexa.

I was wondering about a motion sensor, but if I'm just outside sat down in a chair reading or eating I wasn't sure a standard motion sensor would reliably stay active. I already have a contact sensor on our garden door that turns the lights on when I go outside after dark, but have to turn them off manually. For a variety of reasons leaving the door open the whole time I'm outdoors isn't practical.

Anyone have any suggestions?

Edit: Water feature is a ""tree"" made of copper and has small stones at the base not an open pool of water.

So here's the thing: I'd like to put 2 or 3 cameras in my house and probably 1-2 outside (front and back). I'm looking for a budget but reliable solution (yay), likely with no 3rd party cloud storage.

I'm currently running Home Assistant on a RasPi III and I use Deconz (and NodeRed). So Zigbee is needed (I think).

I've looked around but I see vast price ranges for wifi cameras, and it's really confusing.

The requirements I would have are:

\- Wifi or Lan (I can hook some to my Orbi router or statelites)

\- They can be on battery, I don't mind having to charge them from time to time. 

\- Preferably no drilling massive holes in the walls (inside. Outside it's ok)

\- Should record only when active and movement is detected. Idealy I can just send a command to activate the cameras when I leave.

\- Can detect pets (I have a cat).

\- Easy integration in HA. If there's a native app in addition that's cool, but not really a requirement.

Any suggestion that comes to mind immediately ? :)

Thanks !"	6	"['tungvu256: i like Eufy and best of all, no monthly fees. all videos are stored onto mSD cards. easy to set up as seen here: [https://youtu.be/x-6bFD44t6Q](https://youtu.be/x-6bFD44t6Q)', ""theclawfr: Alright, thanks y'all for those answers.\n\nI'll do some more digging with these infos and I'll post my findings here (or rant, or questions :p)"", 'Working-Inflation-61: Commenting as I am after the same. Tried to bring my HK Eufy system into homekit and it was veey clunky.', ""zorruno: My suggestions (from years in the security industry, and I have a decent sized Home Automation system) based on your questions:\n\n- You already have HA? great. Install motioneye as a HA addon- Buy any camera that allows RTSP streaming.  Much easier to integrate in HA/Motioneye, but there are plenty of other integration options.  You don't actually have to integrate a CCTV system into HA, but it does allow a few nice functions such as showing cameras on HA displays and activating things on motion etc\n- buy a cheap NVR, and connect your cameras to this too, for local recording.  If HA is down, you still get video storage.  You might even be able to integrate this to motioneye for playback etc (I don't bother).  For simplicity, a pack or cameras with an NVR can be the way to go 9if the cameras also support RTSP)\n- I don't use Wifi - I run Ethernet to all cameras (and drilling holes is fun).  If you can do this it makes it many times more reliable, more secure and allows much higher frame rates/resolutions.  Mesh Wifi is pretty good these days though so up to you... a mix is probably not a huge issue.\n- Build a battery backup system for it (easy if you use 12/24V cameras) or use a UPS.  Having wifi cameras makes this harder.\n- I like to use POE where ever I can, it makes things so much easier (except maybe a power backup system - where 12V is slightly easier)- Don't use battery cams, they:\n  a) will likely have a low battery when you need them most\n  b) will be massively compromised on FPS/resolution etc for the $ spent.\n  c) will have to be installed at a reachable level to change the battery... so easily compromised or pulled down.  Also you have to reset your view each time you put them back up.\n- You can set the cameras up to record whenever... time based, movement, on command, by sensor, whatever you like.  I suggest recording 24/7... and just tweak the movement overlay to avoid moving trees, traffic etc.  Modern video codecs pretty much use no hard drive space if there is no movement.\n- not sure why you want to detect cats?  If it is to 'not record', or 'not notify you' then good luck.  You need some pretty smart stuff to distinguish between movement of various things on CCTV (there are some good AI/Raspberry pi video projects). Remember though, if you are worried about using up recording storage, just get a bigger hard drive.\n- I have a policy (I have a family) of no cameras inside... but hey it's your house.\n- no idea why you mention zigbee here, this isn't what zigbee is for.\n\nHTH"", ""kaizendojo: I've got a number of different brands/types of cameras in HA (many of them review units) and over the years the most reliable and compliant within HA have been the Arlos.  Yep I know their issues, but in terms of support in HA (via the third party Aarlo integration) they just work and they check off all (almost) your requirements.  You can run up to 5 cams without a subscription, but there are some cloud components.  On the positive, this allows for a really good integration in HA using the Aarlo setup.\n\nAgain, I know it's not the most popular solution, but I've been using HA since the zero point days and even though they kinda worked natively, once Aarlo came out it just got better and better with more features.  There's even a custom Lovelace card that's awesome."", 'SNKWIRED: For the motion eye solution I have been trying to use motion eye and I can get it to take snapshots without any issue but it will not record any motion and I have run through the tutorials and I am not getting it to work']"

No Amazon either\n\nI’m not committed to Home assistant, nose red is probably easier for me as the UI is very similar to some commercial software I use at work.

Sadly Alex rotates back to the States soon and I'll have to become a law abiding tax payer again.  \nNode Red has done everything I need for the last 6 or 7 years without any problems albeit I've never tried integrating AV stuff beyond basic device control. The weak spots are the lack of multiple user controls and the stock dashboard nodes which are a bit aesthetically limiting although there are external solutions like uibuilder which lets you build web front ends with a variety of development stacks and pass data back and forth with NR. Similarly if you want individualised user menus and widgets it's easy enough to handball something at a level to keep the kids or guests out of the heating and alarm controls etc. but personally I wouldn't attempt anything that needs to be fully secure. It's certainly more work to add devices than a front end like HA but gives you complete flexibility and for me has been incredibly robust and trouble free. The documentation is a little sparse in some areas but generally adequate and support on the forum is excellent, it's not unusual to get replies from Nick O'Leary or the other core devs. There is a third option, there are an increasing number of people who use HA for the speed and ease of adding devices with simple controls and call Node Red to handle the more complex stuff. When I first started with Node Red it wasn't really an option for me but HA now supports Node Red integration and has a reasonable automation editor rather than using a text editor to create a ton of yaml scripts. \n\nHave a play with Node Red,it's easy to install native on Linux, Windows or Mac, it's available in bundled Docker IOT stacks or for Raspberry Pete Scargill's script which installs Node Red,Node.js, Mosquitto, InfluxDb, Grafana and a number of optional admin tools etc."", 'Mirthgiver: Thanks for the detailed response!\n\nI’m about to move into a new house with a lot more options for HA (currently renting) so I haven’t really had a good play with this stuff.

My mother, sister and I live in the same town and there are a few big ticket items/tools that are collectively shared between us (because, why would we need three table saws when none of us are contractors?). While each item has its own home that it normally lives in, it's not uncommon for someone to take something for a project, put it out of the way in a shed or garage and forget about it, leaving all three households scrambling to find it when we're ready.

**The Idea**

I thought it would be a fun little project to figure out how to track these items so we can always tell where it is and, if we happened to loan it to someone not in the family, where it was last. 

My first thought is to put an NFC tag on each item - that's easy enough. The part I don't know enough about is how to then read/store that data? Is there some kind of reader that would have enough of a range to cover a house? (I know the 'N' in NFC is *Near* so that's likely my first flaw)

Ideally, we wouldn't have to remember to scan an item in or out, we'd just be able to look in an app or website and see whose house an item is and, if it's not in one of our houses, who had it last and when it left.

I don't know how well this fits in with ""Home Automation,"" but I didn't really know where to start and am open to ideas!

Thanks!"	15	"['SirSkip: So the more I Googled, the more I realized how stupid I was in trying to over complicate this.

Here are some suggestions to help you debug and potentially solve the problem:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Implement a watchdog timer: A watchdog timer can help reset the ESP32 if it gets stuck due to unhandled exceptions or issues in the code. You can use the built-in ESP32 watchdog timer, which will reset the microcontroller when it is not ""fed"" periodically. You can find more information on how to use the ESP32 watchdog timer here: [https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/wdts.html](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/wdts.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Monitor the available heap memory: Periodically print the available heap memory using the \\`ESP.getFreeHeap()\\` function to check for memory leaks. If you observe a continuous decrease in available heap memory, you may have a memory leak that needs to be addressed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Reconnect to Wi-Fi and MQTT periodically: It\'s possible that the Wi-Fi or MQTT connection becomes unstable after some time. To mitigate this, you can implement a periodic reconnection logic to reconnect to Wi-Fi and MQTT if the connection is lost. Keep track of the last successful connection time, and if a certain duration has passed, attempt to reconnect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Check for any blocking code: Ensure that there are no blocking calls (like \\`delay()\\`) that may prevent the ESP32 from handling the Wi-Fi or MQTT connections properly. If possible, use non-blocking code with timers or state machines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Use the latest version of the libraries: Ensure that you are using the latest version of the libraries in your project, as they may contain bug fixes or improvements that can help resolve the issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember that debugging intermittent issues can be challenging, and it might take some time to identify the root cause. It\'s important to make changes one at a time and monitor the system to see if the issue is resolved.', 'Nick_W1: Don’t use delay(); in loop(). It’s a terrible idea.

If it can't check-in with the other deceives on the network or if the other devices don't ping it back, it rests itself. If there have been too many resets in a short amount of time, it drops back to a backup wifi network and reports the issue via email to me. If it cannot send the email, a light turns on alerting me that things have hit the fan. Meanwhile, all the IOT devices are logging their activity on a server on my network that backups to dropbox.

Just moved, and now I have spectrum internet, so I went and ordered a new router (tp link archer ax21) and set it all up. Made a guest network for smart devices that's 2.4ghz only, just like the last time I set them up and set the security to wpa2 all the normal requirements. However this time the plugs just wont connect, I've tried unplugging it, changing settings on the router, different means of connection, different apps (bn-link and smart life) all the basic trouble shooting options and nothing works. It just wont connect no matter what I do, any suggestions would be appreciated.

&#x200B;

SOLVED: Make sure in the guest router settings that "" Allow guests to access your local network "" is on \*facepalm\*"	4	"[""MikeP001: You didn't mention factory resetting the devices - you'd need to start with that.\n\nIf you haven't before you do, the easiest way to move them over is to use the SSID and password from the network they were on previously.\n\nTUYA devices are generally pretty easy to put into pairing mode and to successfully connect.  Are you certain they're failing to connect to your wifi?  Make sure you're confirming failure from the device's LEDs vs the apps.  It could be you've prevented the guest network from reaching the internet, or your phone from logging into your account properly, or maybe even using the wrong account - it may not be a wifi issue at all."", ""rsachs57: I would start by resetting al the plugs to default, then try them on your regular network. Typically guest networks are designed to block traffic within a network but allow guests internet access and that's about it.\n\nYou can also go to any resale store and they usually have some old routers around for a few bucks. You can set one up as a dedicated 2.4 access point and run all your devices on it while keeping them off your main wifi. I use an old Linksys router for that purpose and it works well for all my smart crap."", ""hanzoisbesthealer: How would I factory reset them? I thought that was the whole, leave off for 10secs then hold for 5 part it was describing, or leaving them unplugged? \n\nI deleted them from anywhere I could. The apps just wont find the plugs when its in pairing mode (rapid blinking) the apps never find anything and the plug just stays blinking. I had it blinking slower (which I thought was the reset) but idk\n\nThe guest network connects to internet on my phone, I sign into it when I'm trying to pair them and I ran a speed tests and what not, its connected. I'm just dumbfounded and/or just dumb"", 'MikeP001: The reset clears out the old SSID/credentials so you can use your new wifi credentials.\n\nFast blinking I believe is ""ez"" mode, and slow blinking is AP mode.  AP mode should let you connect for direct setup from your phone - use it when EZ mode doesn\'t work.  Sounds like you might want to have a read through the manual, and depending on how you\'ve created your guest network you may need to make sure your phone connects back to it when setup is complete.  You may need to disable any security settings on the guest network that prevents guest devices from talking to each other so your phone can find them locally.']"

Is this possible? If so, does anyone have any recommendations?"	6	"['briodan: I have the same thermostat. With zwave devices you generally need a hub to connect them together.\n\nYou mention an app you have to control it, so I would venture you already have a hub of some kind. \n\nDepending on the hub you might have different options for temperature sensors though obviously zwave ones are possible.\n\nNow zwave sensors are pretty rare a quite expensive compared to other protocols like zigbee.\n\nHaving gone down the path of using remote sensors to control a thermostat I can tell you the hardest piece might be to get a rules engine robust enough and enough knowledge to write the rules.

Thus battery powered applications for simple devices like switches and sensors is where is shines. \n\nZ-wave is simple to set up using an app like SmartThings but a good hub will cost you US$100 to 150.  That will also allow you to do a lot of customizing in how your home automation is set up, when and under what conditions things run, etc.   \n\n\nIf you do decide to set up z-wave, there are some temperature, humidity, light, and motion sensors that have amazing battery life.

Assuming single furnace/ac unit. Multiple furnaces/ac units might be doable because you could control them separately.\n\nMost houses have a single furnace/ac that’s connected to all the rooms in your house. When it runs it pushes hot air through all the ducts. However because some ducts are longer then others some have more split, turns the same amount of heat it not delivered to every room. Also not every room will be equally insulated etc so might have different heat loss.\n\nIf you put in a remote thermostat in a cold room it will run the furnace/ac until that room is at the desired temp, however it will also heat/cool up the other room at the same time. So while that room will be at the temp you want others will be hotter./colder\n\nTo deal with that you need some kind of automated zone controls, something that will change the dampers in your hvac system to close out ducts to warm rooms or open them more to cold rooms.  A remote thermostat will only help if you have the zone controls in place.\n\nA better place to start would probably be to have an hvac person come to look at your house, they could look to adjust existing manual dampers to better balance air flow from the furnace/ac to hopefully get you to that close enough mark.', ""CallMeTrinity23: I wasn't aware that this would end up being this difficult.

It is the first Z-Wave Dimmer I've seen with a physical knob. You can turn the knob to dim and you can push the knob down to turn on and off. You can also use the up, down, left and right buttons to turn the lights on and off as well but I just use them to report scene commands. The dimming is very smooth. I bought the item directly from the manufacturer then got it 10 days later from China.	16	"['chuyskywalker: I bought one as well ($30 + $32 shipping) and I\'m not as impressed.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/whRkscD.jpg\n\n_(Test setup, I also don\'t have a neutral wired switch house...)_\n\n1. First, it\'s not in the ZWaveJS database yet, so I can\'t reconfigure anything for it (via Home Assistant). The dimmer/on/off all work, but I\'m unable to change the device settings (like dim time, scene triggers, etc). I\'ve [opened a request](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/issues/5693) about it, but have no idea what that time frame looks like. I\'ve pinged the company about this and they\'re going to look into it.\n\n2. I\'ve had the unit crash twice. The button simply goes unresponsive and you can\'t do anything. Press, toggle, twist all just fail to do anything. This is a very large red flag, imo, but it\'s likely a software issue, so it could be addressed with a firmware patch. Though, needing to flip a breaker to restart a light switch...\n\n3. ""Any color the customer wants, as long as it\'s black"" :D\n\n4. The ""up/down/lef/right"" is very sensitive on mine -- I\'ve been routinely accidentally activating those instead of the push. The knob has a single ""button"" and whatever detects ""determine tilt on press"" is very sensitive. This means that when I go to press the knob inward, if I press on any edge of the knob, the slight tilt from not being dead center often triggers the up/down/left/right instead of the straight down action. \n\n\\#4 happens _a lot_ and is the reason **I won\'t be buying more of this switch**; I (and the family) would hate these switches for the frequent and frustrating behavior of getting a press gone wrong.\n\nI\'ve been hunting around for a good smart dial for a while and also have an Insteon i3 Dial. By comparison, the i3 Dial only has twist and press, but this ends up being far more reliable an interface -- there\'s never a ""wrong interaction"" with that unit, ever. I also prefer the behavior on the i3 when rolling counter clockwise (dimming) that you can roll as fast as you want and you\'ll end up at ""dimmest"". With the ZKS31, doing this will turn off the switch, and then you have to roll one click forward to get it to the dimmest. This is likely something that could be a parameter as well, but I don\'t think it is currently.\n\nIn the pros category, the ZKS31 has a **much** nicer dial. The i3 is far to shallow and it makes using the dimmer unenjoyable -- it also just feels like plastic rubbing on plastic, blegh. Also, ZKS31 is on zwave and while I don\'t really have any major objection ""yet another hub"", the Insteon ecosystem is closed source and they\'ve already folded once; it\'s not confidence inspiring. Having all my switches be zwave would also completely mesh the house.\n\nUltimately, I\'m going to hold off on going with either product and wait for something with the simpler interface of the i3 but zwave and knob quality of the ZKS31.', 'kigmatzomat: So how much was it?

So today I looked at the supported command classes on the Z-Wave Product Page [here](https://products.z-wavealliance.org/products/4779?selectedFrequencyId=2) and noticed that the supported command classes in my device manual and the ones on this site are different.

I have a Waferlock bluetooth smart lock, and find the lack of integration with the rest of my smart home very irritating,

And I had a thought: I could turn on Bluetooth logs in the developer settings on my phone, capture the traffic between my phone and the lock which tells it to unlock, and then emulate this on a little Linux box (Raspi or equivalent).

Of course, I will almost certainly need to change the Bluetooth MAC id on the Raspi to that of my phone, and if there is any encryption between the lock and the phone it wouldn't work. However, my guess is that a cheap Chinese smart lock probably relies mainly on the MAC address for security.

Has anyone (with any BT lock) tried similar? If so, did it work?

Thanks

Robert"	1	['Sharpopotamus: Home Assistant and Bluetooth Proxy is probably your best bet: https://esphome.github.io/bluetooth-proxies/\n\nIf you don’t want to run a full HA on an rpi within Bluetooth range of your lock, you could install an esp32 running Esphome within range instead']

Just a cheap robo vacuum to make her life easier. She loves it and still uses it today, every single day on a schedule. The robot's name is Rosie. She moved into the apartment behind my house which is 100% hard floor, not carpet (not hard wood, just.. hard floor. Laminate maybe? Vinyl? Dunno. Looks like fake shiny wood, cheap). 

I'd like to get her a new bot. I was thinking a mopping robot since most of her floor is now solid and not carpet (other than a few rugs). I've seen a lot of reviews and it looks like the iLife shinebot w450 is a seriously good option, even if its slightly over my price range. I'd really like to see your opinions on other ones. I was thinking either I get her a mopping bot or I get her a better vacuum (maybe combo?) with lidar. Not sure. 

She's a VERY cleanly person. She has 1 cat. Most of floor is a shiny fake wood, but she has rugs in some areas. Because of how cleanly she is, this robot isn't needing to mop up pet and kid messes, just a light clean of hair, fur, and dead bugs lol. Just little stuff. I see a lot of people saying that most of the bots are just like a swiffer, which honestly would work fine for her. I just want to get her a nice little gift, an upgrade. My biggest concern is her lack of upkeep. I've seen some reviews stating the robots needed a replacement pad mid cycle or more. I like the idea of the self cleaning ones or the ones with tanks that can go like a week without care. She doesn't empty the robo vacuum tank every single day and I think that asking her to do that for a mop or a new robot would be too much. 

Based on this info, what do you think a good budget option would be? Thanks in advanced!"	1	['Bionic_Hamster: I haven’t looked at new options recently…when I purchased mine years ago the roborock vacuums offered the highest bang for your buck in terms of value…I suspect this is probably still the case. Whatever you end up with I highly recommend something with built in mapping (e.g LiDAR).']

I currently have a handful of rooms that use Hue bulbs with a bridge and want to keep them as they are. 

Desired attributes:

\- Decora paddle that resets to center after pressing. I want to be able to turn a switch back on via app/voice that has been turned 'off' from the physical switch.  
\- Works with Google Home  
\- Can turn Hue bulbs/lightstrips on/off  
\- Available with and without a dimmer  
\- Support for 3way/4way (low priority, but nice to have)  


My main concern is finding a powered smart switch that will play nicely with Hue bulbs. I am fine with the switch only toggling them off/on(can control scenes via different methods) as long as they can be turned back on via any method(physical, voice, app, etc).

I'm considering purchasing a new smart oven for my home, and I've narrowed my options to the June Smart Oven and the Anova Precision Oven. My main goal is to cook juicy and delicious chicken, pork, and meat dishes.

I'd really appreciate it if anyone who has experience with either or both of these ovens could share their thoughts on which one does a better job at cooking these types of dishes.

Just bought a home and looking for recommendations on smart light switches. ALL lights in the home are DIMMABLE LED. I was reading through some and apparently dimming light switches is a great thing depending on time of day (no duh since I blinded myself this morning in the bathroom / kitchen with all the recessed lighting installed it feels like a surgery room). Looking to improve my QoL.

All living room lights (2) and each individual room have Philips hue bulbs already. 

Requirements:

1. I prefer things that work with Apple HomeKit since I am already well invested **BUT** I also have a **HOMEBRIDGE SETUP** so does not need to be HOMEKIT ***as long as there is a HOMEBRIDGE PLUGIN***.
2. Dimmable vs non-dimmable pros & cons - **recommendations for dimmable switches**
3. no need for light sensors since it is an open floor plan I feel the sensors would not do a great work as I typically have my Hue lights on mainly.
4. Budget: No real budget - I want the best of the best, but if you know an affordable route that would be appreciated as well :)
5. Prefer to be same brand

Nuances:

* 2 switches have a separate switch for FAN + light
* 2 switches control both light (cannot rewire)
* 3 Bathroom switches (not sure I really need smart switches in bathroom)
* 3 separate areas in home have 3-way switches (stair lighting, kitchen, & upstairs hallway)
* Porch light switch
* Garage light switch (the light in front of garage is covered by smok🙏🏽e glass housing or else I would do an auto bulb based on light outside)
* Between garage and home there is a covered walkway that has a light - I would love to have this auto turn on when I arrive at night so I can walk into home comfortably.

It also has native support for Homekit.\n\nThe dimmers don\'t need a neutral line but the on/off switches do.\n\nWhen you say ""2 switches have a separate switch for FAN + light"" do you mean something [like this](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-15-Amp-Combination-Double-Switch-White-R62-05224-2WS/202027008)? Most smart switches take up one ""gang"" of space per switch.\n\nCaseta supports three or four way switches by using their remotes which mount in the space that a switch would normally take up.

Smart bulbs require constant power. Trying to deliver constant power to a smart bulb, but additionally introducing smart logic into a controllable switch is extremely difficult. I'm currently trialling the Inovelli 2-1 Blue Zigbee smart switches with Smart Bulb Mode, and I'm not 100% happy like I thought I would be. 

# The golden rule
My smart home revolves around one golden rule: **never, ever** should a situation result where my home is made dumber than it was. i.e. a switch should never just not work, a light should never not turn on or off on command, etc. 

# The objective
Find a way to have smart switches that can control a smart bulb, but can *also* control the physical electrical circuit. 

# So, why is it so hard?
## Problem 1: Smart bulbs require constant power

For years I've had Philips Hue bulbs around my home, and I've just had those external Hue  Dimmer switches stuck to the wall next to other dumb switches. The moment guests come over, the physical switches end up in various states of array, and the Zigbee mesh is patchy. 

The electrical circuit must stay closed / on in order to power the bulbs. There are switches that can be installed in place of the physical switches and communicate to Home Assistant to control the bulbs, but if Home Assistant ever fails/crashes, these switches are now useless and I lose the ability to flip the physical circuit without the breaker — golden rule broken. At least with the external Hue Dimmer switches, I could just resort to the physical light switches for a ""dumb lighting"" experience again. 

## Problem 2: Home Assistant / Appliance failure

Zigbee has Bindings where a Zigbee switch can communicate directly to a Zigbee bulb *without* a coordinator (Home Assistant, HomeKit, or other). This mitigates the need to worry about the uptime of the appliance — great! ... Only if the switch continues to operate independently well. Again, if there's no ability to toggle the physical electrical circuit, I don't want it. 

# What do you want?
-	A switch that can operate in a Smart Bulb Mode where the circuit is always closed, and button pushes send Zigbee commands. 
-	A switch that can fall-back to operating the physical electrical circuit. This is what the Inovelli 2-1 cannot currently do simply. 
-	A switch that can always operate, independently of the Zigbee mesh. If the Zigbee mesh is down or there's interference, the switch should still be able to be used to toggle the circuit or be put into non-Smart Bulb Mode. The Inovelli 2-1 becomes entirely non-responsive when it has troubles staying connected to a Zigbee mesh, which it does do occasionally. I've seen it twice over a month now. 

# What's the current solution?
Honestly, I'm thinking of foregoing all smart bulbs altogether. Keeping dumb, dimmable bulbs around the house connected to smart switches introduces features like the ability to be remotely controlled, but ensures the lights are always able to be operated no matter what. 

Smart bulbs are making having a stable, simple smart home really difficult. I love, *love* having dynamic lighting features. Setting various scenes is something I do all the time; but, if I have to sacrifice this feature just so I can have an easy to manage smart home without complication, then I'm choosing that every day of the week. 

# How do you control your smart bulbs?
Do you have any advice for me regarding physical controls and smart bulbs? Do you have any similar experiences? I'm tired of troubleshooting basic features when my housemates complain that something as simple as a light switch ceases to work. 

Everything should physically work as expected **with no exceptions to the rule**, and smart features should *add* functionality that's nice to have without interfering with current access."	30	"['ArgumentativeNutter: Aqara switches have a decoupled mode where the button doesn’t toggle the relay automatically.

I am lookin go to upgrade my system so that there I can receive notifications on my phone, arm/disarm from my phone, and be able to do home automations with the sensors. Central monitoring with cell service would also be a plus.


A got a quote from a local installer to switch to a Qolsys Alarm.com panel with cell service and central monitoring for $36/month.


Another option is to hire an electrician to install an outlet in the closet so that I can connect Ethernet to Envisalink and keep the Vista 20P panel. Envisalink has cell service and monitoring for $17.50/month.

If it does anything other than reverse when it hits the 2x4 and go back up again, I wouldn\'t trust it around my small children. This is a safety system that might exist even without visible sensors, although I wouldn\'t be surprised if it was missing.\n\nHave you ever noticed the little ""UL"" or ""ETL"" marks on appliances?

Since it\'s just tracking whether you\'re ""pointing into"" one of several possible 2D zones, and the Kinect has a limited POV, it only works when you\'re standing roughly in a specific spot in the room. With an array of multiple Kinects, it\'d be theoretically possible to get a full absolute 3D representation of an entire room, which would then allow placing targets in 3D space, and getting much more practical gesture tracking.

There was a great library available to work with Kinect, and I just used that. It\'d give you real-time skeleton vectors for any detected people in frame. What I did was basically take the elbow vector and hand vector, draw a vector in-between, and then extend that vector out from my hand. Then, I defined a 2D plane with its center being the Kinect camera, and defined a bunch of rectangular zones on that plane, each corresponding to a light in the room. Then, I took that extended hand vector and projected the point at the end onto the 2D plane, and checked whether the point is inside any of the zones. Lastly, I set it to just call the appropriate REST endpoint on the home assistant API if the user clenches their first while their ""pointer"" is in a particular zone. You can see all this happen on-screen in the second half of the video.\n\nI remember reading a bunch about absolute 3D room-scale tracking using multiple Kinects in Processing. That would really be the way to go if I were to revive this project now. You could actually have the light triggers positioned in 3D space and just do a hitscan using the pointer vector whenever the user does the gesture. That would allow moving around in the room freely while gesturing.']"

I’ve been using HomeKit automations for over a year now and been exclusively in the apple ecosystem. 

Is Bixby better? Or even close to the complexity of HomeKit? Genuine question."	11	"['Squid8742: Bixby is Samsungs go at home automation.

Maybe just karma farming?\n\nI certainly wouldn\'t change phone brands to change automation ecosystems.  There may be a bixby equivalent to a homekit hub but since I disabled it on the same day I got my phone I haven\'t followed it\'s progress.\n\nA more sensible question might be ""which is better, homekit or google home"", for which the correct answer is ""doesn\'t matter, only use them for voice, not automation"".', 'pjvanrossen: That last statement is a bold one, cause it very much depends on what you want in a ecosystem.

I use switches, dimmers, sensors, non of them HomeKit-compatible. Can automate the most craziest things. Thnx to that Hubitat hub all of those things are tied together, automated and exported in a orderly fashion to HomeKit.

So what can they make? \n\nSimilarly, with a bunch of lights, appliances, sensors, thermostats, data access from their respective phones, regardless of their price, WHAT CAN BIXBY AND HOMEKIT DO better than each other! If you still don’t get, I’m not sure how clear I can be!', ""Sorry_Sorry_Everyone: Homekit is better if you have a lot of Apple devices and don't want to spend too much time scripting complex automations. Shortcuts is great for automating things local to your phone or computer but less so on the *home* automation. This is because it's not compatible with other many types of devices but apparently that's not as important to you. \n\nSamsung SmartThings is better if you have a bunch of Samsung devices and/or if you prefer a more open system that interfaces with more devices. To most people in this *home automation* subreddit, compatibility with other devices is more important. This compatibility enables more automation potential. \n\nHowever, if you prioritize compatibility and capability then I would skip right past smartthings and go straight to something like Hubitat or HomeAssistant where the automation potential is endless. \n\nFor the purposes of your Twitter debate, neither is universally *better*. It depends on what you prioritize, but for your specific use case/requirements, Homekit is better""]"

I\'ve seen a few posts of people who have shown off their smarthome calendars and I thought there is no better time than the present to go from lurker to poster. Feedback is greatly appreciated!\n\n**The Setup**  \nIts a 21.5"" touchscreen monitor running on Android.\n\n**My Problem**  \nMy wife and I had paper and digital calendars and we had to have weekly syncs to make sure we didn\'t double book each other. We often missed a sync session (or two) and I quickly didn\'t know what was going on in our lives...I hated that feeling. So I started on a journey to solve it.\n\n**My Development Journey**  \nI am not a developer, just a lowly Product Manager so I had to lean on friends and co-workers for support along the way. Thanks to all if you are reading!\n\nI started with a DakBoard running on an old laptop mounted on the wall. I struggled with the UI not being easy enough for me at a glance and planning into the future. It was really good at bing a smart home hub but didn\'t meet my standards for best and easiest organization system available.\n\nI then procured a large Android touchscreen tablets and just loaded up Gmail onto the screen. Obviously all the calendaring functionality was there but I struggled again with the UI. I had a hard time picking out my specific activities at a glance. We also have a AirBnB in our basement and I wanted to track that on there as well. So that is when I started to design my own UI.\n\nI used a grid pattern calendar with dates on the y axis and names on the x axis. This made it easier for me to pick out the specific information I was searching for faster. This also allowed me to have a specific column for my Air BnB without being on our personal calendar. This also allowed me to have a continuous 30+ day view of events, so as the day finishes it is removed from view and a new date added at the bottom. I drew it out on paper and had a friend digitize it. I then went to a developer friend and he was able to code it all together pretty quick. (paid them both, I\'m not a complete mooch)\n\nI had some friends and family express interest but they don\'t all use Google, so I found a API that can authenticate every calendar system. I realize I could have done this myself, but I don\'t want to be responsible for securing and maintaining this regularly so a few bucks a year is good enough for me to sleep well at night.\n\n**Problems I\'m Working On**  \nScreen Burn - I had it set up to be bright during the day when in use and dim at night which could be lit up when the screen is pressed. Having the screen on that much was a bad idea and I got some screen burn after 3 years now. I am working on two solutions: 1) Having three settings - ""On"" ""Dim"" ""Off"" and a dashboard to control them so I minimize time it actually needs to be on. 2) Having it move slightly so the date lines are not always in the same spot, just a few pixels in all direction on a timer.\n\nKids - My brother has kids and I think its weird having to create a Google/Apple/Microsoft account for a 2 year old. I think I can use the API to make the kids to act almost as meeting room. Therefore they could have their own column without having to have an authentication and therefore account. Once they are old enough to have an account it\'s less of a problem.\n\nSharing Calendar Views - This was a request from my parents to be able to see their grandchildren\'s calendars so they can plan to go to soccer games or schedule babysitting. I\'m not quite sure what this looks like in practice, whether it\'s always on or just a pop-out to get a glance when planning. But for them, I will work on it.\n\nShow More Details - I want to be able to add some functionality to show details of event when it\'s tapped on. Standard on phone and computer for good reason.\n\nGarbage Day - I currently have recurring calendar meetings for garbage/recycle/compost pickups, I think it would be wayyy better if there was just an icon next to the date and not clogging up my personal column.\n\nTasks - I love seeing what is coming up next, and I want to get the same visibility for things I need to do now and in the future. I imagine sipping my coffee in the morning and noting what I have to do today and this week at a glance. Bonus points if I can gamify it for myself to encourage getting things done.', '5h4d0w: What touch screen / android setup are you using?', 'UnderqualifiedITGuy: Ok folks — let me through, someone’s gotta ask the real questions around here. What is this Stampede party that’s happening on July 14th? 😂', 'original_flavor87: Why not use a presence sensor to turn the screen on or off? Since it’s android couldn’t you run fully kiosk to control it?', 'Far-Ad-9679: Here\'s some suggestions:\n\nI think almost all the functionality you want can be done with the right calendar app without needing coding.\n\nCalendar app: My calendar app of choice is business calendar. It displays my Google calendars (multiple calendars color coded for at-a-glance simplicity and it\'s very easy to toggle on and off the calendars you want to overlay...a must when you have a busy life)\n\nCalendar organization:  This is purely personal choice/opinion.  Like you, I have multiple calendars to organize.  Just to name a few, I have ""Work"" (orange... Used to show the days I work a nontraditional schedule), ""Mom and Dad""  (yellow... Used between me and the wife),  ""Personal"" (blue... Just used for me if I want to notify myself if there\'s a sports game on TV or something else no one else cares about), ""Family"" (green... Used as a catch-all to organize the things all 6 family members want to see: 4 kids\' soccer events, kids\' school calendar, custody schedule, trash night, etc )... With 4 kids under 13, there is no reason to have their own individual calendars yet, but they can also access and edit the family calendar from their phones...as they get older I may break off individual kids to their own toggle calendars instead.  All of these events are defaulted to the color of the associated calendar but can be changed individually if needed.\n\nKids: Young kids can create their own personal calendar if they have Google accounts and you can share them with yourself, but they aren\'t very good at it so that\'s why while they are young all 4 have their events added to the ""family"" calendar instead.\n\nSharing calendar views:  when you create all these different calendars from your Google account, you can control sharing (read only or editing ability) from Google.  I share our  ""family"" calendar as read only with grandparents and I can even help my elderly mom with her calendar by edit ability between her and I on yet another ""Mom"" calendar shared between just her and me.\n\nView: I would suggest a half and half view...Calendar/Agenda Your 30 day agenda view seems excessive for an ""agenda"" view.  Use a 30 day calendar ""month"" view on top (again look into business calendar app... I love its month view because it shows text, icons and more of what you want in the 30 day view). Do an agenda type view for bottom half of your screen view.\n\nShow more details:  Using agenda view as part of your display would give a few days worth of your agenda (with more details if desired).  The agenda part can be scrolled downward to see more days (I notice your calendar has a lot of blank days, business calendar agenda view eliminates wasted space of the blank days if no events are present).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzhyv9yzavva1.jpeg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4ea06ab80ee982b7caca111e19213c38368edb75\n\nAgain, with your long portrait hanging display, I think it would better serve you to split it.  While you may prefer to have your buddies edit the code for you, you can similarly use widgets to accomplish a similar view.  Here\'s an example with two business calendar widgets on my phone screen (it would look much nicer on your larger screen)\n\nToggling views:  So you have each calendar organized into columns, I\'d prefer something like business calendar that manages multiple calendars (or groups of calendars), with single tap toggling.  If you tap the top of the month widget it enters the app itself.  Inside the app you have the ability to toggle your choice of calendars at the bottom of the screen. When you exit back to view the widget you can have it show either the last view you created or can always show a default setup with calendars that you prefer.\n\nTasks:  business calendar also has a tasks widget but I don\'t really use tasks, I just use my calendar for those kind of reminders.\n\nTo solve burn in:  I would agree with the suggestion for a present sensor but another idea would be to use  Android lock screenv which allows you to display photos then you can tap/swipe the screen to view the calendar when you want to see it.. The Android lock screen allows a rotating photo display of your favorite 3-5 pictures or simply connect it to Google photos album of your choice. This way if not looking at the calendar on your cool big board, it will be displaying favorite family photos. I do see that you like to have it on during certain times to remind yourself to look at it, so maybe there\'s some kind of slide show you can incorporate to change the screen to something else during the times you would normally have it in ""dim"".\n\nTrash night: Although I have it as a weekly recurring event on the mom and dad calendar, it becomes easily overlooked among the chaos.  I use a simple automation on our nightstand lights using Phillips hue bulbs that turn on and red every Tuesday night at 8p which reminds me to gather up the trash and set it out for garbage truck that comes early the next morning. Normally the night stand light turns on and blue (easy on the eyes) every evening 45 min after sunset. If I say ""reading lights"" it turns the nightstand lights bright white.   If I say ""snack time"" it pauses TV, turns lights from blue to orange and lights the way to the kitchen.  When I return, I say ""I\'m back"" and it sets the lights back to blue. I tell you all this because on trash night the lights stay red all evening as a reminder to myself until I say ""I\'m back"" after I take the trash out.', 'infernalsatan: And it can also show flight information too', 'AutoBot5: This is something I’d like but don’t want to drop a lot of money in time in creating it. \n\nFamily of 5 and we all have something scheduled 7 days a week.

I’ve got several motorized blinds from SmartWings with HomeKit motors and one of them is no longer recognized by HomeKit.  I love the blinds but they have been a bit buggy with HomeKit and now one of them is no longer recognized.  I thought I read somewhere that a solution was to do something to the motor that would make it Zigbee enabled but it involved getting some sort of hub.  Does anyone know how this would work?  If so, which hub would you recommend I purchase?  All of my smart home devices are HomeKit so I want to be able to operate the blinds and create automations/scenes through HomeKit but would like to find a way to have a more stable and consistent connection.  I’m fairly well versed in smart home devices, but don’t have any experience with aftermarket hubs or anything.  Here’s what I currently have in my home.

Apple TV 4K (x2)
Apple HomePod Mini (x2)
Philips Hue hub, lights, switches and motion sensors (dozens)
Ecobee Premium Thermostat with 3 remote sensors 
Eufy Security Door Lock

Schlage Encode Plus Home Door Lock
Aqara Camera Hub G3
Aqara Door and Window Sensor
Aqara Wireless Mini Switch (x2)

SmartWings HomeKit motorized zebra blinds (x6)
Samsung Smart TVs (x2)
Sony Smart TVs (x2)
LG Smart TV
Hunter Smart Ceiling Fans (x3)
DuraBlow Gas Fireplace WiFi adaptor through Smart Life app

Thanks in advance!"	3	['peterxian: SmartWings HomeKit motors mainly use Bluetooth wireless; their Zigbee motor is a totally different model, they can’t just be converted (the exception are the new Nano shades, which were sold only via indiegogo, that use Thread wireless for HomeKit).

I just bought a house with a ton of built in speakers, and I'm trying to figure out the best way to be able to unlock their potential, and need help! I'm generally setting up the house with Google home/nest products, and I'd like to be able to say ""OK Google, play \[good music\] in \[room\]"" and have it magically work.

The speaker set up I'm dealing with is as follows:

1. there is a speaker built into the shower, which I am excited to have working. There's two wires that runs behind the wall and comes out somewhere else in the bathroom, with two sets of bare speaker wires. I understand I'll need some sort of amp, and then also some way to connect this to Google. I was thinking something like this may work: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y67PZB1/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y67PZB1/). But then it relies on bluetooth, and my understanding is that I'd then need to make that shower speaker my default speaker for Google home, which sounds like a problem since I want to use other speakers for other things and not have everything played in the shower. So then is it that I need something with Chromecast built in? Essentially do I need to buy an old Chromecast audio, plus that small amp, and then maybe two smart plugs so the chromecast audio and amp aren't unnecessarily always on? Is there any simpler way?
2. There are a bunch of speakers in the kitchen and living room, with the million speaker wires running through the walls and meeting in one big messy spot. Similar to the shower I'd like to be able to be able to say ""OK google play music in the kitchen"" or in the living room, or both. I think I need some sort of more complicated larger amp with chromecast built in and at least two different zones? But I'm dealing with something like 28 banana plugs for the speakers, plus an rca cable for a subwoofer, and every product I see only allows for some small amount of speaker outputs. Is there an easy fix for that? Like some sort of device where I can plug in, say, 14 speaker wires on one end, and only two come out the other end so I can then plug those 2 into a more simple ample/receiver? What would that device look like?

I appreciate any ideas. It sounds complicated, but the tl;dr version: I have various existing old speakers in different rooms and I want to make them smart and working with Google. How (without spending crazy amounts of money)??"	4	"['Evening_Medicine_339: For the shower speaker, could this combination work:\n\n1) Current $20 Chromecast (with Google TV): [https://store.google.com/us/product/chromecast\\_google\\_tv?hl=en-US](https://store.google.com/us/product/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US). \n\n2) The HDMI from the Chromecast plugs into this HDMI audio extractor: [https://www.amazon.com/LinkS-Extractor-Splitter-Converter-Chromecast/dp/B00XJITK7E](https://www.amazon.com/LinkS-Extractor-Splitter-Converter-Chromecast/dp/B00XJITK7E)\n\n3) Use an RCA to 3.5mm cable to connect the output from the HDMI audio extractor to the AUX input in an amp like this: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072Q157FY/ref=ox\\_sc\\_act\\_title\\_1?smid=A28DFNI3481CTT&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072Q157FY/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A28DFNI3481CTT&th=1)\n\nand then I connect the speakers to that amp. \n\nThe hope is that I can then speak into a Nest Mini and say ""OK google, play music in the shower"" and 3 separately powered devices and $70 later, music plays in the shower. \n\nWhat do you all think???', ""ChitlinNoodleSoup: I don't think the Google Home devices have audio outputs, so you're going to have to use Bluetooth.

Looking at these two and the wiring in the manual. So If I want to control something with wires I need to run 2 cables to it? 230V and then the circuit to the device I control? (Page 9, Bosch manual).

And if I use Tado wiring I just run one wire to the device I control? (Page 4,5, Tado manual).

I just want to check what is the ""standard"" and if I need only C wire and in case of Bosch also 230V?

I will not be doing the wiring but I research my options.

As a renter, it is difficult for me to install wired smart switches, and so as a workaround I'm trying to find a way to put physical battery-powered buttons in the room to control a number of smart bulbs and smart plugs. My goal is to minimize the number of hubs I need to purchase, but to also have something that will allow me to grow this network when we buy a condo in the next year or so.

I am invested into a couple of ecosystems already:

* Amazon Alexa (4th Gen Echo with Zigbee Hub, various other smart speakers without hubs)
* Philips Hue (mix of 1st/2nd gen bulbs, a few Zigbee bulbs, and 2nd gen hub)
* IKEA Tradfri (controls closet lights only, Tradfri hub)
* Tuya (outdoor dimmer plugs, wifi, no hubs)
* Treatlife (indoor dimmer plugs, zigbee, no hubs)
* Neo Smart Blinds (4 blinds, 1 hub)

For battery-powered, surface-mount Decora buttons, I've found these two so far:

* [LeGrand Radiant Smart Scene Controller with Netatmo](https://www.legrand.us/wiring-devices/radiant-collection/switches/radiant-wireless-smart-scene-controller-with-netatmo-white/p/wnrcb40wh)
* [Treatlife 3-Button Scene Controller](https://www.treatlife.tech/products/copy-of-wireless-scene-controller-with-zigbee-hub-for-treatlife-devices-up-to-9-scenes?currency=USD&variant=44883456131394&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping)

Unfortunately, the Treatlife Scene Controller won't configure directly with Alexa, it just comes up as an on-off switch. Is there a magic hub that will work with all of these things without having to buy each brand's proprietary gateway? Ideally I want IFTTT or Alexa to create the routines where if button x is pushed, light y changes (or blind z goes up), and for these things to not happen at the proprietary hub/software level. I think I'm getting more and more confused as I keep looking for what seems like it should be a really simple connection.

Thanks in advance for the help!"	3	"[""Ninja128: Just set up Home Assistant with Zigbee2MQTT and a USB Zigbee stick coordinator, and you can eliminate the Alexa and Ikea Zigbee hubs and use any [Zigbee device](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/) you want.

I recently enabled my custom sound detection routines for Alexa. Like dog barking sound, then do this, beeping sound then do that, snoring sound, then do this and that.

I wonder if anyone figured out how to do ""custom sounds"", then do this.

For some time now I have been caring for my grandfather who lives 40 min away from me in the outskirts of Munich. Since I am so far away, I always worry about whether he is alright. I always looked for solutions to calm my mind. During a project at the university, I then developed intelligent adapter plugs together with other students. The aim of this plug-in is to record when a technical device in the household is used (e.g. TV, refrigerator, bedside lamp). During the first few days, it is determined how often a person in need of care uses the technical devices in the household. If there are subsequent deviations in usage behavior, this could indicate health problems. For example, if the bedside lamp comes on eight times a night instead of twice, this could indicate insomnia. If the refrigerator is opened only twice a day instead of five times, lack of appetite could be the reason. In such a case, a relative is notified directly by SMS. It is important to note that caregivers will not be able to see the daily usage behavior of the persons they care for, i.e. they will not be able to see how often the TV is used. They will only get a message once typical behavior deviates.

What do you think about this solution?"	3	"[""jds013: I'm getting on in years...

# What is Viseron?

Viseron is a self-hosted NVR deployed via Docker, which utilizes machine learning to detect objects and start recordings.

Viseron has a lot of components that provide support for, among other things:

* Object detection (YOLOv7, DeepStack, Google Coral EdgeTPU)
* Motion detection
* Face recognition
* Image classification
* Hardware Acceleration (CUDA, FFmpeg, GStreamer, OpenVINO etc)
* MQTT support
* Built-in configuration editor

Head over to the [documentation](https://viseron.netlify.app/) to find out more!

# What has changed?

The main feature of this release is **Authentication** for the frontend.

It also improves on the user experience, showing cameras that failed to setup directly in the UI.

Check out the release notes for more information and screenshots: [https://github.com/roflcoopter/viseron/releases/tag/v2.2.0](https://github.com/roflcoopter/viseron/releases/tag/v2.2.0)

# Whats next?

I have a lot of planned features ahead. The ones that i will be working on for the next release are:

* Create multiple users
* Better live streaming
* 24/7 recordings
* Developer experience

Looking for any tips as to what to expect here.	D-TOX_88	8	12umyny	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12umyny/i_have_an_interview_for_an_entry_level_design/	"Hey folks, this post is geared towards professionals, obviously.

I have an interview Monday for a Shade & Lighting System Designer role. (Good lord I hope my interviewers aren’t on here… 😂)

Pretty sure it’s entry level, but that’s ok. The only 2 challenges (I like challenges) are these qualifiers:

• Strong working knowledge of signal flow for shades, lighting, network and control
communications
• Proficiency in at least one software tool (DTools, AutoCAD, Revit, Lutron,etc)

Here’s the thing: 10 years ago I was graduating with a BA in theatre performance, and I had a strong technical focus on scenic lighting and carpentry. Not a ton of design, but lots of leadership in executing designs and understanding design choices (a bit of design in my class work). I’m super quick with new technologies, and 10 years ago, I had novice experience with programs like Lightwright and Vectorworks (not sure if anyone here is familiar with those but I feel like those are most comparable.) I remember absolutely NONE of it so I am not confident in my ability to speak about proprietary software functions, but I know if I had the chance I could learn these software reasonably fast. Certainly within the job’s/leadership’s expectations.

I feel like my resume pretty clearly reflected my experience transparently but confidently.

I am absolutely confident I could do this job. I’m not super confident I could convey that effectively on Monday in the prelim video call. I realize after typing this out that I’m probably way better off than I think. But professionals: what do you think I should expect in this call?

I'm building a home and setting up for home automation from scratch, and wondering if I'll need all these different hubs & bases or if I could (for example, run Hue off Alexa (via ring). I don't want to over-simplify and lead to issues, but wondering if things are redundant. 

Here are the technologies I'm bringing together:

1. Lutron Caseta: Mix of Diva, Claro, and Pico Devices connected to Lutron hub.
2. Ring Alarm Pro: Mix of sensors connected to pro base station
3. Hue: Exterior lights, x9 connected to hue hub
4. Ecobee: Thermostat
5. Sonos: Arc + 3x amps
6. Logitech: Harmony Elite & Hub
7. Alexa: Show 5 + Various Devices

I'm home running CAT6A to each room, and I plan to connect all these hubs to a switch in a media closet.

My Questions: 

1. Anyone anticipates interference from running Ring Alarm Pro and a Deco X60 mesh network simultaneously.

2. Can I cut a bridge or two, leveraging the Ring Erro router to be the base station for Hue?

For the most part they work great. My only issue is the bead connector which will sometimes pass through (while making a sickening sound as it makes its way) but more often than not gets stuck. Besides the strain on the motor, this introduces a whole host of problems in recalibrating my upper and lower limits, etc. Has anyone found a solution to this issue besides spending $100 on bead joining pliers I will use one time? Installing an infinity chain kind of defeats the purpose of these motors to begin with. If I was going to go through the trouble of getting up there to disassemble, etc I would have just bought tube roller units. I seem to remember when I was researching blind motors one of the more expensive companies used to send a special connector for this very problem. Someone please help!	0	[]

WhatWouldVaderDo	1	12u949m	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12u949m/starting_my_home_automation_journey_in_2023_zooz/	"I just moved into a 5-year-old house (in the US) and now have a HomeAssistant VM up and ready to go. As a first step on my home automation journey, I’m looking to install smart switches for lights and ceiling fans. I’m leaning towards Zooz switches since the price is right and I like the idea of building out a zwave network.


From my research, when working with lights, Zooz switches are great. I’m also going to be installing approximately five ceiling fans. I know that I need some kind of fan controller since attaching normal dimmers is asking for catastrophic trouble. All of the rooms in this house are wired with two switches, one for the lights and one for a fan, which is nice. But for whatever reason, there’s not a single fan to be found in the house, so I need to purchase some.


So, I guess I have two questions. First, is starting a new install with Zooz/zwave a good idea right now? I don’t think I’m willing to wait for matter to get its shit together and for devices to be released. Second, assuming that I go with Zooz switches for the lights, what is a good fan controller to pare with them to give me automation over fan speed and on/off status? If there is a particularly good combination of fan controller and fan, I’m open to suggestions.


Thanks so much!"	4	"['killinintheframeof: You can tie them both into a zooz (zen 30) two in one switch. The top paddle controls your lights and dimmer while the bottom controls your fan load.

In the meantime, I have seen the Hue remote and would love to get it for my Hue lights.  However, I would like to get something similar for my Wyze lights as well.

I ended up replacing all of my light switches in the house with Wyze switches and it seems to work great, my only warning is with that many lights/switches I had too many devices on my 2.4 wifi and had to set up a second wifi router (throttled and connected through my main router) to handle all of the devices."", ""spiritsavage: Thank you!

Not positive, but if my understanding is correct, this is not likely anytime soon. \n\n- Will need to have a standardized API to chatGPT. Thus it will be a subscription model that hinges on a B2B contract w/ chatGPT. GPT is changing so quickly that this might not seem feasible right now for a set and forget type box (ie Alexa). Obviously, Amazon would prefer to develop their own, so that's an issue there, but I mean like a random up and comer delivering the box with the API ability built in. OpenAI likely doesn't want to have anything set in stone, and I can see them breaking all sorts of connections if someone integrates too early.

Amazon and Google are trying to save money, so if MS leveraged their AI investment to fight when everyone else is running, it could pay dividends. \n\n- Nvidia delivers a box. They have GPU farms already going for other services. If they have bandwidth available, they could try to jump in market with a box of their own.

My small family has recently purchased our first home and it comes with a pool. We have two young children and would like some added security.

There is already a pool gate, and we are paying to get our children trained to swim, but we would still like some extra security.

How safe are these?  I will use them in the bathrooms, so everyone at home will be very close to a sensor.  Are they a potential cancer risk, or any other risk.  Thanks for any help.	14	"[""mooremo: The two things to consider for health risk in devices like this are the energy in individual photons from the source and the number of photons per time. The first can be approximated by wavelength and the second is measured as power.\n\nWe can split electromagnetic radiation into two categories, ionizing and non ionizing. Photons that have lower energy levels are non-ionizing; this includes types of radiation such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, and visible light. The lower energy levels mean that non-ionizing radiation does not have enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms and molecules, which is a process known as ionization and is where the labels we are applying come from.\n\nIonizing radiation, on the other hand, has enough energy to ionize atoms and molecules, which can lead to direct damage to DNA, and in turn, may increase the risk of cancer. Think Ultraviolet, X-ray, and Gamma Rays. Non-ionizing radiation does not have enough energy to cause these direct DNA changes.\n\nThese devices use a frequency that is not ionizing so you're safe there. \n\nNext we care about power. Even non-ionizing radiation can have negative health effects. A powerful enough flash light can blind or even burn you even though it's not ionizing and we know that enough microwaves can heat food enough to cook it.\n\nThese kinds of sensors use less than 1W of power, typically much less, and you'd only get that full amount if you hugged the sensor. As points of comparison, inexpensive microwaves are often 1000W and most WiFi routers use well in excess of 1W.\n\nSo you're safe here as well.\n\nTLDR; if you have a WiFi router in your house or own a cellphone this isn't going to change much for you as far as health risks go.

Is it possible to use them with Hue/smart led bulbs so I can control them wirelessly if/when needed?

This way I could still take advantage of the switch controlling the lights like with normal switches but leverage the “smartness” of the Hue bulbs when needed. 

Not looking to use the switches to dim the bulbs, it would be done via home assistant or Hue app. Just trying to save some money by getting these switches and do the smart stuff with smart bulbs.

I've read about Home Assistant and Home Bridge, what do you guys use?

I am somehow tech savy but have zero experience with VM's. I just want to automate this task, so maybe Home Assistant or Home Bridge may be overkill? Which alternatives do I have?

Originally it was one suite that was subdivided at some point in the past.  The thermostat is in the neighbor's suite and we operate on different schedules.  My business has a fixed 9AM-5:30PM schedule while there's is a mostly by appointment.  My ideal scenario is to have a schedule that covers all of the set business hours and then have a presence sensor that overrides the schedule when people are working during the scheduled away time.  It would also be nice to have a secondary control panel in my suite.  There is no thermostat in our suite so it would have to be some kind of wireless connection back to the main thermostat.  If that doesn't exist we can just use a phone app, but a panel would be nice.  I also need to have a remote temperature sensor to place in my suite.

I have recently bought a eufy g20 robot vacuum.  I have tested it in my friends house, where it works as expected.  However, in my apartment, the robot will not navigate properly and if you pick it up and place it back down again in a new location it might give an error saying strong magnetic field detected.  So i suspect that there is some magnetic field under the floor of my apartment that the robot reads as magnetic strips.

I have tried googling the issue and found quite literally no results.  I tried contacting eufy support but they said that the robot must be faulty even though this error hasn’t occured anywhere else.

I was wondering if anyone else had encountered a similar problem and if so, did you manage to fix it?  Or is my problem actually caused by a faulty vacuum rather than just the design of my floor.

We are renovating a 900 sq. ft. ranch so I'm thinking about things like smart switches as move wiring/outlets.
Our current house is pretty much full of Hue bulbs, and while it's worked well enough I think switches is the right call for the new home. We have a WiFi lock, Roomba, a few outlets, but no hub (yet?).

Sounds like we should get a Pro bridge to ensure she can continue to do this?\n\nI'm more onboard for learning/intergrating/adapting to systems; she just wants things to work reliably and be straightforward (as well as visually appealing, she already said she wants the Diva rockers over the Claro buttons). She is open to moving away from HomeKit in the future if it makes things simpler and more streamlined, but only if there's a clear reason to do so. We both agree that the Hue and other things we have here work fine, but it could be better, which I think a hub would solve? She's a database analyst, but she says she has no desire to ever automate things, she just wants to be able to control them from her phone or tablet. She has talked about wanting to get a Pi to run an irrigation system and our future greenhouse though, so I do think she's into automation if she sees the benefit."", ""Seanmells: Have you used the LEAP plug-in with your regular bridge?\nLocal communication was a big advantage for the Pro Bridge, but if telnet is being phased out and LEAP is available for the standard bridge I'm not sure the Pro is as necessary."", 'Seanmells: Did you go with standard or pro bridge?', 'emarkd: I\'m honestly not sure on that as I am also an Android user.

What I couldn\'t do, however, was use things like motion sensors or lux sensors to turn lights on and off, because Google Home doesn\'t support those.

I'm looking for a decent external camera with ""real"" motion detection. I tried TpLink and Blink but they get triggered by lights, wind, even grains of dust...

I also tried Eufy - which seems to have a good detection technology - but connecting to the camera is a real pain (I managed only once).  
I used to have Piper security cameras, which worked very well. Rather than relying on algorithms, they use a piezoelectric sensor and was pretty reliable (1 false positive in 5 years of use). I cannot seem to find anything like that on the market.

I don't need face recognition, just reliable movement detection.

I bought the FP2 about 20 days ago on AliExpress for $75 from a seller that I’ve dealt with in the past. I simply messaged them, asking for the FP2 and they sent me a *“special payment link”* and 15 days later I had it.

I fully disassembled the device, tested some features and managed to integrate it in Home Assistant via the HomeKit Controller Integration. It's still reliant on the Aqara Home App, to initialize it and create detection zones. It has an ESP32 board inside, so maybe ESPHome is possible down the line.

What's neat is, whatever zones you create in the Aqara App are exposed as separate entities in Home Assistant and change state individually when a person is detected.

The sensor is extremely capable and accurate, it pushes live data of a persons position in the app almost immediately. The detection time is instant, no need for a PIR sensor pairing anymore.

It has a both a pump/filter and a heater, which is a 110v in-line spa heater.  They’re both plugged into an outdoor 20a outlet on a dedicated 20a circuit protected by a gfci breaker, drawing about 17amps combined.  The outlet I have now is a programmable timer type that works okay, but has limited capabilities.  I’d really like to swap it out for a WiFi connected outlet so I can remotely manage the heater/pump, but these seem to be hard to find.

RealMrIncredible	6	12s11g4	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12s11g4/home_cctv_system_through_ip_cameras/	I'm looking to move from the Eufy camera system to a DIY system. What software / cameras do you recommend for this?	23	"['i8beef: I\'ve tried a lot of brands. Some insights:\n\n1. 9/10 of the recommendations you get here will be garbage for low light conditions because no one looks at sensor sizes. Small sensor = less light captured = bad image, and there\'s NOTHING you can do to fix that. Buy the right hardware FIRST. I think good recommendation is something like 1.2 for color night vision, and 1.8 or something like that for IR? If you can actually find a sensor rating for most of the recommendations for cheap stuff you\'ll find here, you\'ll find most of them in the 3.0 range instead: WAY too small. On the other hand, if you don\'t need low light, you wont see a lot of benefit from a larger sensor either...\n2. Resolution can be important, but works AGAINST sensor size for image quality (again, less light per pixel). 4k is great for (a) close range identity or (b) long range presence... but if you want this for actual security, higher res isn\'t always better. You have to choose this based on intended mount / use. Also, if you\'re looking to actually identify anyone, DISTANCE to target is a huge concern. If you mount your camera on the roof, you will never actually identify someone you dont know. So for example a doorway camera is better mounted 6-8 feet high, and with a target identify range within a few feet.\n3. If you want to be able to actually identify anything, mount 6-8 feet and target the right range, or you\'ll just get ""presence"" and not be able to tell what anything is. If you mount it to the roof of your house, 30 feet from who you are trying to identify, you will never get anything useful out of it.\n4. Cheap Chinese, unfortunately is the best I\'ve found. Dahua / Hikvision or rebrands. Consider them ""unsupported"" past purchase though, and lock them down to not talk outside the network. I like to use a dedicated NVR with PoE so the cameras JUST talk to that, and I only have to lock down the NVR. I currently use EmpireTech which are Dahua rebrands, and am probably happier with this than the others I\'ve tried (Hikvision, Ubiquiti, Reolink, Eufy, Wyze, Dropcam, couple others).\n5. That said, all NVRs are crap. The target if you go this way is ""does it give me the minimum I need to get a stream out to something more useful?"". I prefer CONSTANT record on such a device, as I\'ve never found a ""record on motion"" that did good enough for me to trust it in a pinch.\n6. Want object detection? The Dahua NVR actually does better than expected.... want GOOD object detection? Frigate is really your only answer. Buy a Google Coral unit if you do this or it\'ll eat your CPU.\n7. Want different stream types (HLS, etc.) outside RTSP? Almost NO ONE does it out of the box... but there are Docker images and such you can use to do it (I use this to get an HLS stream for my Google Homes).\n8. BlueIris is basically the gold standard for ""functional"" NVR software. You have to run it on a Windows server still I think. I got tired of keeping it up and running, so I just went to out of box NVR, and then dedicated other software products for detection, restreams, etc... but pretty sure you can\'t go WRONG with BlueIris here. Synology Surveilance Station is better than I would think if you have one of their NAS\'s... but I\'ve never found a solution here that was actually GOOD.\n\nMy setup is the following:\n\n1. EmpireTech / Dahua color night vision 4k cams: one mounted above garage overlooking the driveway (presence on property), and one at the door (identify at door). These have a 1/1.2"" sensor which means the color night vision ACTUALLY WORKS and these are fantastic, way better than ANY other camera I\'ve had which are usually in the 1/2.5"" - 1/3.0"" range. Even if you go nightvision instead of color, go for a larger sensor, I think 1/1.8"" is the recommendation for a non-trash nightvision camera.\n2. EmpireTech / Dahua NVR which gives me an isolated PoE network, and is the ONLY thing the cameras talk with. This does constant record on a 9tb drive (expandable, and gives me about a month of constant record). It provides RTSP streams for the rest of my architecture. It captures motion event times and such, and has a surprisingly decent OBJECT detection on it which I CAN\'T say for any of the others i\'ve tried... though I dont REALLY use it.\n3. Frigate for object detection and a Google Coral. Its not perfect, but its good for the ""alerts"" I want to the home automation stuff.\n4. Various RTSP-to-X restreaming Docker containers. RTSP is the camera standard. Little outside cameras themselves actually support it which is... stupid. I restream my RTSP to HLS, HLS-LL, tried WebRTC but never had luck, etc.', 'tungvu256: 6 Amcrest 4K cams with 6TB is about $1000. easy to set up as [seen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFs-rF-khhw). basically, you want any system with open standard ONVIF.

Fairly straight forward to configure and get going. I’m not using the mobile app so not sure if that’s something you need but I can’t comment on it.

I believe it requires their cloud connection for the mobile app.\n\nFor cameras it depends on your needs, again reolink cameras are usually in the top 5 list for cameras, check out the hookup YouTube channel for some very good comparisons.', ""Kv603: Some cameras have features which can integrate with your home automation solution, either through a [plugin](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#camera) (for example inside /r/homeassistant) or by having the camera (or NAS) make an outbound API call when an event happens.\n\n\n> What software / cameras do you recommend for this?\n\nI've tried a few DIY approaches, but got fed up with maintaining the OS and software, so I switched to Surveillance Station NVR pre-installed on  a  r/Synology NAS  (There are other NAS products with similar offerings, including QNAP and ASUStor)\n\nI went with different brands of cameras depending on location, use, and budget;  a mix of ONVIF-conformant cameras, all connected through a Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) managed switch.\n\n> I'm looking to move from the Eufy camera system\n\nSome, but not all, [Eufy cameras may work with Surveillance Station](https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/c05vyj/rtsp_to_synology_nas_is_awesome/)\n\nAll cameras which actually conform to ONVIF Profile S (and some cameras offering RTSP/H.264) should work with any recorder which conforms to ONVIF.

Ubiquiti was kind of like that too, PLUS a closed system. Polish but not as much substance (to be fair to Synology, it was MORE substance than I WAS expecting though... just better options around if you want to DIY).\n\nBut in the end I found my needs were just better served with a simple NVR doing constant record... The Dahua can actually capture from multiple streams so I can do constant capture of a lower res + motion based events capturing full resolution if I want... but I only have two cams right now, and the month of full res capture it gives me is plenty for my needs.\n\nAlso of note, I don't and won't expose these to the internet or want an app I can watch them with.

I am in the process of upgrading my small woodshop dust collection system to include automated blast gates, current sensors, and remote on/off. If all goes well, when I turn on a tool the split-core CT will sense current, triggering an automation to open/close the correct blast gates and to turn on the dust collector. I have the blast gates and CTs working but now need to figure out how to remotely toggle the dust collector. 

I tried emulating the RF remote using ESPhome and RF receiver/transmitters but couldn't capture the RF remote codes. It might be a proprietary code, not sure.

So I have turned my focus to a hard-wired solution on the dust collector. 

**Could anyone recommend a ESPhome / Home Assistant compatible switch that would work with a Laguna 1.5 HP CFlux1?**

You can save a couple bucks using an ESP8266 but if you have an ESP32 on hand go for it.  \n\nAs far as where to put it... Well you could do a couple things but it all depends on what you want to do..  Personally I would do one of two things, remove the original switch and such and install your SSR in it's place or install it in parallel.  Installing it in parallel will make it so that you can use the original remote if needed for something like using a hose for cleaning up the floor and such.  Removing the original control and replacing it means it's 100% controlled by the ESP you are using which can easily be triggered by a button press on the machine (just drill a hole and run a couple wires from a button to the ESP and set it up as an on off switch in the software) however if there is any protection circuits you may lose those.\n\nAnother option is to take a multi meter and see which circuit you want to tap into.  There are a ton more advantages and disadvantages but it requires you to sit down and figure them out.  IMHO you want to leave in as much safety and protection as possible while making it perform as desired.  I would probably run a parallel setup with the original controller  But you will likely need to bridge one of the lines on the contactor to make that work.  Basically figure out the neutral (L1 on the power cord) and disconnect that from the contactor on both sides and wire nut them together.  Then add a wire to BOTH legs of the L2 on either side of the contactor and tie those into the input and output on the SSR.  \n\nJust be sure to check all your connections and make sure nothing can short out on you and be safe while you do it which means unplug when your hands are near power.  That should be a given but there are some people out there who dive in without thinking, LOL.""]"

My biggest challenge in researching is that the SEO drowns out the actual answer I’m looking for. 

I wanted to add a Lutron Caseta Fan Switch, but the wiring for the light and the fan is somewhere in the ceiling and consolidates to a single line down to the switch box. I’m renting so it’s not worth it to me to even bother with that chase. I know because of this, I can’t use the fan dimmer switch and Hue Lights. 

My question is, if I were to put a basic Caseta Smart Switch in place of the old switch, could I still turn the fan off from the switch and turn the lights back on with a Hue Smart Dimmer Switch (or app)?

Could I turn the fan back on from the Lutron app?

Would this setup work or would it cut the power to the Hue lights entirely when I “turn the fan off” via the switch/app?

I’m ok using the pull strings to manage the fan speed, but was really hoping to be able to turn the fan on and off remotely without impacting my Hue lights. 

If that’s not an option, my other question is if it’s possible to just bypass the switch altogether so the power is always on, only manage the fan from the pull tabs, and add a Hue Smart Dimmer for the lights. Would this be a possible alternative?

Is there another option I’m not considering? (Hue lights > Smart Fan capabilities)

Thanks for the help!"	2	['MantisMB: The fan and the lights will be controlled by the light switch only. If you want to control the lights, they would have to be done through an app or the pull strings. \n\nThe Lutron switch does not differentiate between the lights and the fan.

I was going to buy the Aqara hub and sensors, but it looked like if I got that then I would be ""stuck"" in their ecosystem. I may want to replace my Ring doorbell and add some cameras around my house eventually so I did not know if I wanted to commit to theirs. 

So I looked at Home Automation. I have a RPI 3 I haven't played with in a while, so why not I thought. Then I started seeing ""Zigbee"" pop up so I started to read what that was all about. I know how some of these projects can go as on paper it sounds like you set it up and don't have to fiddle with things until a battery dies or something, but I have done plenty of projects where you are constantly fiddling with it. I don't mind some up front work and a little fiddling with it, but I don't want it to become my only hobby for the next few weeks.

At this point, what I want is a good Smart Home ecosystem that isn't super expensive, has plenty of options if I want to add things later, and doesn't have a subscription. 

Any suggestions?"	7	"['SmartThingsPower1701: What I did for my water sensors is I went with a few different brands.  I use the Ecolink water sensor (ZWave) that has about a 3\' wire on the probe, these I put behind things like my refrigerator. dishwasher, washing machine, toilets, etc. Anywhere that I wanted to test for water that would be hard to get to, that way I can change the battery in a place like under a cabinet instead of having to pull the appliance. I also used some Zooz ""pucks"" (ZWave) under my sinks and some Aeotec sensors (ZigBee) by my water heater and in my basement.  Since I use SmartThings as my environment, I\'m protocol agnostic, as long as I can find a driver for it, I don\'t really care how it talks to my hub.  I have them tied to a Dome water valve shutoff (ZWave), so that if there\'s a leak detected, the water to the house is shut off to prevent any damage. I also have the system text me as to which sensor detected water and turn the lights in strategic rooms to bright red, to let me know there\'s an issue. Zooz also makes a highly rated valve shutoff (ZWave).  I\'ve been using SmartThings for about 4 years now, and with the platform migrated to local control, it\'s a really good time to give it a go, if you haven\'t picked a platform yet. The automation engine is really easy to program and pretty robust, this has been upgrade over that past few years as well. The latest hub is now made by Aeotec, but it\'s essentially the SmartThings V3 hub rebranded. SmartThings spun their hardware division off to Aeotec a couple of years ago. Once you get those going, there\'s really no limit to what you can automate. I have smart plugs, blinds, roller shades, contact sensors, vibration sensors, etc.', 'kigmatzomat: Ring uses zwave, which is an open standard that predates Ring.

For this I need like a liter of water at around 90 degrees C. 

What I have started doing some time ago was using a super simple electric kettle and and a SmartPlug: I leave the liter of water ready on the kettle the night before and turn on the kettle, but with the smartplug off (its a plastic switch).

Then in the morning I have a quick script to turn on the smart plug for 3 minutes (the exact amount to get that much water to the point I want).

  
This approach, although simple and easy, has some problems: 

* If I have more or less water, those 3 minutes will get hte water to an inadecuate temperature.
* Sometimes the kettle's on switch doenst stay on.
* If I take a lot of time to get to the water after the script finished, it goes cold.

So i was taking a look at ""smart kettles"" but they dont seem to have a remote activation feature - at least the ones I can see in Europe.

What Kettle can I use to automate my water warming routine for the mate?

Thanks!"	3	"[""xMasaru: There are kettles, where you can set the temperature (like [https://www.amazon.com/COSORI-Electric-Temperature-Stainless-Protection/dp/B08BFMV68M](https://www.amazon.com/COSORI-Electric-Temperature-Stainless-Protection/dp/B08BFMV68M))\n\nHaven't used it before but you could maybe use the kettle in combination with a SwitchBot Bot ([https://eu.switch-bot.com/pages/switchbot-bot](https://eu.switch-bot.com/pages/switchbot-bot)) to start the kettle.\n\nNot sure about the 3rd point though"", 'Xeon2k8: So how i see it is \\*usually\\* after an automation is done you dont need to interact with the object anymore, and here since what you are doing is automating a part of the whole process of preparing mate you are only saving 3 minutes (round about), since you have to use the water immediately after, else it will cool down.

Normally those tanks are heated by Sun (I'm on Cyprus), and in cases of bad weather electricity is used (as little as possible). I want to see the temperature in the tank (in few places), and to control electricity to the tank, with 'local first' approach (e.g. switch on the wall overrides robots), and no clouds.

Few important discoveries:

1. Cyprus and UK requires using of dual pole switches for water heaters (so called 'cooker switch' or 'heater switch'). That means, both live and neutral must be disconnected in OFF state. This disqualifies about 99% of all zigbee relays I found. I'm in the process of finding zigbee-controlled relays for double poles (and 20A relays...).
2. Water temperature is a more complicated problem then I anticipated. A simple DS18B230 is okay, but the water tank is pressurized with a pump, well insulated (a think layer of insulator is around it, with tight metal cover). Having inputs only from outlet is unreliable, because outlet is cooling down when not used. I'm still searching for the way to get to the tank temperature.
3. Even without #2, transmission from the roof is a problem too: zigbee do not penetrate, and all wifi devices I saw for that (e.g. Sonoff THR320D) are cloud bounded.
4. Any solution should be weather-proof (I can shield from direct rain on the roof, but not from moisture).

This is 'progress report', not a success story. If you can correct me or know a (partial) solutions to the subproblems, please, advise."	7	"[""silasmoeckel: Sounds like you need what's typically sold as a pool pump relay (40a double pole).  Comes in z wave or wifi, zigbee per usual is a disappointment.  Z-wave is local no idea on the wifi version having a local api or not.\n\nOnly good ways to get a valid temp is get a sensor up under than insulation or install a small circulator loop."", ""DoodleRoodle: Listen, you're overthinking it. \nI'm in cyprus and I was solving the same issue, and its not many cloudy days in cyprus. Just get a bigger tank, or install an instant gas boiler..."", 'amarao_san: Thank you! Sometimes a single word in the query do the job!

At least I won't need to poke into heavy duty wires."", ""amarao_san: Bigger tank will take more electricity to heat up. Gas is not an option for multi-stories buildings (and it do nothing in terms of 'knowing how much hot water is in the tank').\n\nThe easiest way is just to continue to guess how much to warm up, but I really like to get some data."", 'DoodleRoodle: I was measuring temp on the surface of the highest positioned copper pipe that was delivering water to the house. You may tie your sensor to the pipe with metal wire l and cover it with insulation.', ""amarao_san: Yes, but it not answer question about 'how much hot water is in the tank?'. Imagine having tank (lets set to 100L for simplicity) at 80C, and input water at 20C. At T0 we have 100L of 80C water.\n\nWe open tap, used about 50L of 80C water. If we do this fast, the output will be about 80C, because water mixes slowly, and cold water is at the bottom. We wait for 20 minutes, water slowly mixes, and we get output temperature around 65C (50C will be if everything is mixed evenly, but it's not). We open tap, get 10L, and water drops to about 60C.\n\nHow much hot water is in the tank? If I wait for 20 more minutes and take 10L more, what is the temperature at the end? I can't predict.\n\nSo, my goal is to have few sensors to see temperature at the output (top), at the bottom, and somewhere in the middle, or may be, even more.\n\nBasically, my question is 'for how long can I have hot shower', and hot shower can be diluted with cold water or not.\n\nI bet, after I get enough sensors, there going to be crazy math, which will end in lookup table based on experimental data.""]"

I have a small but growing net of Built on Thread devices - 2 Eve smart plugs, a Nanoleaf bulb, and the new AppleTV with the Thread Border router. Works great, love it; going to try to only buy quality Thread devices from here on. 

On my iPad, the Home, Controller, and Eve apps all show & control all of my devices, Thread and wifi; and the Eve app shows the members and roles of the Thread network - Yay!

On my iPhone 14 however the Home, Controller, and Eve apps all show & control all of my devices, Thread and wifi; **BUT** Settings/Thread network just shows a generic 4 devices, a message that says ""Checking Network Status,"" and a pinwheel that's been going around for days. Uh oh. Clearly the phone has access to the network because the iPhone communicates fully with all devices?

At first I thought the iPhone app just needed a little time to discover the Thread stuff, but that isn't working out. Not a serious problem, I can do anything I need or want to do, but this is a vexing puzzle. 

Anyone know why the iPhone will not show the Thread network in the Eve app?

Thanks!"	2	['Most-Sort5470: Is your phone on the same network as your iPad?

Thanks.	btadams1971	2	12r5bnt	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12r5bnt/my_amazon_smart_home_frustration_just_hit_its/	"I think I just drew the last straw buying an HD Fire Tablet to use as an echo device/dashboard. I just purchased the worst of Amazon products it feels like, I was hoping for something I’m realizing Amazon doesn’t care about. Customization and customer satisfaction. Please, please prove me wrong. I can’t be having all of these issues, it doesn’t make sense. What am I missing? The potential is amazing, but such a need for control by Amazon is ridiculous. Please change my mind!! I have googled these questions, searched this group, and gone through every setting. Please keep in mind I do not have the time to completely switch right now, I’d rather stay in the Alexa ecosystem if I can. If the Alexa app or show mode are so ridiculously in customizable, is there a third party app that will load in the tablet, either the fire or an iPad, that reads the devices in Alexa just as I have organized / input them? If anybody would know it’s you guys. 


Big things:
I bought this for show mode to control my home devices already in Alexa. But I can’t do the following, which is crazy!!
- I can’t set screen to stay on, or even open to “show mode” when there is motion in front of it. 
- I can’t choose which routines to show, it shows all 50 I have. 
- I can’t add rooms to favorites, click on that room, and see devices in that room. 
- I can’t get rid of the top overlay that worthlessly says Device Dashboard!
- I can’t change background,  Amazon is choosing one single ugly color for me. 
- I can’t move location of items, I want categories at top. 

Amazon has done a great job with Alexa, it does 100% of what I want, but they are treating customers like we are dumb. Like they know what we want things to look like and interact with. Things that are easily customizable if they would let you. I have gone out of my way to buy Alexa enabled devices, totaling about 8k now through the whole house. I’m starting to question that. The ecosystem works great, but if I can’t customize why bother?! I’m almost ready to sell all of my Alexa devices that don’t include Apple Home support and move on. But it would be a burden with my current workload. It’s frustrating. If smart home is just a side gig for Amazon I’ll move on. That’s what it seems."	12	"[""aaahhhhhhfine: I'm so confused about why people give cloud providers money for this stuff.

You can either have something that requires minimal set up or something that has customizations but not both. \n\nMinimal set up means the tech is ""opinionated"". The designers made all the decisions for you so you don\'t have to make any decisions.  Except if you don\'t like those decisions, tough luck. Apple mostly exemplifies this across their entire product line. \n\n\n\nCustomizations means the designers know there is no one-size-fits-all and tend to either rely on set up wizards, leaving features off until enabled, or using some mostly innocuous setting.  The problem is that most design teams that aren\'t opinionated also waffle between the three. Even if they are consistent, users either complain about the barrage of set up screens, leave features disabled that they didn\'t know existed or are irritated by because they couldn\'t figure out where to change it. \n\nYou, as a consumer, have to pick which one you want. Can you find something opinionated in line with your preferences? Or can you find a customizable platform that hits your sweet spot of acceptable defaults/ease of use?\n\nMaybe you will like homekits defaults more, but Apple doesn\'t have smart displays and I don\'t know if the iPads have an always-on mode. If it doesn\'t exist now, you will probably never see it in the future because ""opinionated"".\n\nAmazon hasn\'t seen financial value in product options on Alexa, so they haven\'t bothered. If they thought you\'d pay them money I can guarantee Alexa would look like the AWS product line with three options for every scenario and you would be mad for the opposite reason.\n\nGoogle is trying to be opinionated but is being more of an jerk because they don\'t commit to anything.\n\nI went with homeseer. It is customizable but the process is fast and has a straight forward if-this-and-that-or-this-and-that-then-this-and-that UI.

One of those kids is special needs and Alexa makes her life work. I’m not messing with that. I work 65 hour weeks, with “0” time to get calls from home because the drapes won’t auto open again and my three year old is in meltdown because she can’t get the bathroom light on with her friend Ziggy (one of Alexa’s wake words). It rarely has issues, and I can purchase a ton of basically plug and play items. I have no need getting deep into the weeds, nor over complicating it. I don’t need the house to know if I take a dump twice on Tuesday, order Metamucil and schedule a doctors appointment. I just want it to work. This does, it’s just ugly as sin, and un-customizable to such a degree graphically that I often wonder if Amazon engineers are hijacking our cameras and having “laugh at our users parties” when they get frustrated trying to find obvious preferences.

I've decided on Lutron Caseta for all the lighting indoors and out (pot lights, chandelier). That part is solved, at least as far as I know.  


However, I am stumbling on the best way to handle some strip lighting.

1. In the wetbar I will have 3 shelves, each with RGB Strip for backlighting (about 8' long)
2. On the desk, that runs the entire length of the wall (16') I will have strip lighting aimed up behind the desk, lighting the wall behind the monitors.

I plan to use automation and sensors for the strip lighting. Basically if occupied during office hours, have the strip lights all on white. If after hours, set a different scene. There will not be a light switch to control these. 

  
I have an electrician setting everything up. But as a bit of an automation newbie/nerd (I have homekit and Lutron in my existing home)  I wanted to ask here for some advice first.

**Options that I've come up with (please feel free to suggest)**

1. Electrician said he would run a transformer, and strip lights, hardwired, we could have a standard switch. (Not going to go this route)
2. I could use 2x Lutron Caseta ELV+ switches + remotes to control the strips. However, how would I control the colour or mood lighting? It seems I'd need to use a standard strip light remote for this which is not ideal.
3. Use homekit compatible standalone off the shelf strips. I think this is the best option, as it allows me not to have to buy additional caseta switches + remotes. However, I'd prefer something hardwired, and I can't think of how the kitchen shelves would be setup, I assume on 3 more strips making 4 standalone strips in total?
4. **Other Ideas?** I assume there is some sort of transformer + hub out there for RGB lights that would connect with homekit, and allow me to do everything I need, but I am having no luck googling what it would be called (that is if it exists)?  


Also while I have you, if we are going hardwired, what are the best strips out there that have the least amount of hotspots possible?

Thanks in advance."	0	[]

PixelDaisy	2	12qupah	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12qupah/improving_device_ir_signal_or_ir_cloner_signal/	"I'll give my best to recreate the scenario as in previous post (whose content I managed to lose somehow while uploading video). The problem I am facing is that the IR remote control needs to be clicked a few times (even if it's facing directly towards the device) in order to send successfully a command. I am blaming the device IR receiver for that. Not only the remote control, but also the IR cloner device faces the same problems, whereas it works nicely for other devices (that exhibit no issues with their remote controls).

I am pretty sure all of you faced this at some point in your life. The thing is, I wasn't paying much attention to that and it didn't bother me, until I decided to automate my ceiling light. This would require me saying voice commands until it turns on (IR cloner has no information about the state of device), since the ceiling light is controlled over IR.

Has anyone come up with a workaround or got an idea how this can be solved without buying a new ceiling light?

I'm considering purchasing some Eve motion sensors. However, I'm a bit confused about the new version available since yesterday.

The older version (let's call it Eve Motion) was listed as €39,95 on Eve website and other online retailers, while the newer version (Eve Motion with Thread) is listed as €49,95.

However, I'm not sure if there are any significant differences between the two versions in terms of features or performance. I reached out to the Eve support team, and they told me that the only difference between the two versions is the addition of Matter support in the firmware of the new version.

I thought that Matter support was already available with a software update for the old version (or was it just the thread compatibility?). Does it even makes sense to speak about Matter at the firmware level ? I thought it was more of an ""app level thing"".

So I'm wondering if there's any reason at all to choose the newer version over the older one, considering the €10 price difference. 

Would anyone here be able to shed some light on this issue or have any other insights about their differences? I would appreciate any help or advice you can offer.

I'm lucky enough to be gut renovating a Brooklyn brownstone. I'm just starting to think about what smart home features I want (and/or want to avoid) in the home, and am curious for some advice. 

I'm particularly curious about things that are hard to retrofit later. So far, here's what I'm considering.

(1) Lutron lighting system. We want to use some prettier third-party switches (like Meljac or Forbes & Lomax), which means we need to spring for the very pricy HomeWorks set-up, for at least the main dining/kitchen floor. Not totally sure if it's worth it, and we're debating skipping smart lighting altogether (or doing it only in the floors with bedrooms).

(2) Ubiquiti UniFi WiFi. Currently Planning to go for ceiling mounts wherever I can.

(3) Ethernet drops. Planning to have one in every room, plus wiring for the ceiling mounted WAPs. 

(4) Smart lock. We've a traditional brownstone door – someone suggested Baldwin locks because it hides the smart hardware? We also have a vestibule, and so are hoping to do smart locks in both doors, so we can, e.g. let Amazon in to the first lock and deliver packages. 

(5) Smart breakers? I've heard a bit about this, but I'm not sure exactly what the benefit is, and if I need it. 

(6) HVAC / Thermostat – We're doing Mitsubishi mini-splits. Curious for recommendations on the best way to control these. 

(7) Security Cameras? – Intruiged by Ubiquiti's local storage option

(8) Server rack? This maybe isn't a home automation thing per se, but I'm probably going to have a server rack. 

What else should we be looking into?

A few notes about me / the house:

* I'm a software engineering (with a networking background), so I'm OK with more technical/DIY automation, but I want to keep things (a) rock solid reliable and (b) easy for non-technical family to use. Ubiquiti fits the bill perfectly here – I'm happy to manage the configuration, but it's just as easy to use as any other WiFi system, and it's super reliable. I do want to avoid a bunch of duct-taped Raspberry Pi's though. 
* The bottom floor will be a rental unit to start, though we'll eventually reclaim it and use it as a parents/in-law suite over time.

I'm looking for advice.
I have a common courtyard with multiple other apartments with a common garage door that opens to the street. Inside the courtyard is each of the apartment's individual garages with our own garage door.

The door is 50 to 100 feet from my unit, so I could have some transmitter in my unit that would likely have enough range to open the door.

The door shuts automatically after a set timeout, so I never need to know the status of whether it is open or closed.

Both openers are Liftmaster and are from within the last 15 years.

Any advice on a combined solution that could handle both doors? Or any split solutions?

My current thought, since I'm somewhat out of ideas, is to attach a Switchbot to a remote and put it in a plastic bag outside my unit.

Now that incandescent bulbs are becoming scarce, I'm being forced into using LED bulbs. But, as experienced LiteTouch users know, the Dimmer modules have leakage between the circuits. Essentially, if any one circuit is one, the other circuits get a small amount of current. That didn't matter for incandescents, but LEDs are so efficient that they glow. 

I've read that LiteTouch used to sell Load Resistors that you'd install either in the fixture or in the module cabinet - the idea being to present enough load on the circuit that the small amount of current wouldn't light the LEDs. 

Does anyone have the specs on those Load Resistors, or installation instructions/guidelines?"	0	[]

1681733295.0	17-Apr-2023 05:08:15	I am not happy with Savant Pro, am I stuck with it?	StupidIdiot8989	2	12pdm0z	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12pdm0z/i_am_not_happy_with_savant_pro_am_i_stuck_with_it/	"**TLDR:** Rep who implemented my system is super flakey and I am unclear what I would be lacking if I remove savant pro to save myself the frustration of dealing with him, or anyone else.

  
Renovated my home 7+ years ago, at the time I had no clue what I was really getting myself into, but the architect who managed the renovation highly recommended we go with savant pro due to all the various lighting we have.

Current day, I want to change some aspects of what was set up, for example I want to add a sound bar to my tv, I want to add smart thermostats to my HVAC system, I want to update the savant pro software, etc. - A lot of things that were once working in savant pro are now no longer working (sound system, Apple TV, cable tv)

The guy who set us all up is super flakey and always has excuses, which are total b.s more than half the time. I am so tired of all of it and I am wondering if I can simply remove Savant Pro and stick with Lutron for lighting + shades and use apple home for the thermostats and TV? 

What exactly would I be lacking if I got rid of Savant Pro? 

It's unclear to me what the benefit of having Savant Pro is, I feel like so far all it does is overcomplicate everything and force me to rely on some 3rd party rep who never shows up. (From what I understand I can't set up savant pro myself without an expensive license.)"	5	"[""BAFUdaGreat: Sounds like you just need a new AV/Savant firm to deal with instead. If your system is pure Savant control, then you just can't get rid of it and expect other things to work. You need to find an alternate local vendor who can take over your system and make it do what you want it to do. I know a few senior people at Savant: if you feel comfortable, post your ZIP and I'll relay it to them and see what other firms in your area can help."", 'TheLutronguy: Any system can be swapped out for another.\n\nFrom what you describe, and I could be wrong, you have Lutron for lighting (RA2) and Sonos for music. Savant Pro if I recall was the programmable remotes with a guitar pick shaped ""controller"". Savant and many other Smart Home systems are typically used to bring together a variety of systems in a home and have them controlled under 1 system. Instead of going from 1 app to another, you have 1 GUI (interface) that accesses everything. Plus you should have the ability to create macro\'s or strings of commands based on certain conditions.\n\nSonos can be controlled from it\'s own app, so you don\'t need Savant for that.\n\nDepending on how your Lutron system was designed, hopefully you have keypads and dimmers / switches around the house and the keypads look after day to day functions. Savant should have just given you a secondary way to control lights, so again, you don\'t need Savant for your lights. Hopefully you have a Lutron bridge which will give you the ability to control lights from a Lutron App.\n\nAs for TV stuff, there are plenty of programmable remotes available, \n\nMany here also use Home Assistant which is a DIY smart home system that you could set up to control a lot of things around the house.', 'StupidIdiot8989: Thank you for your response I really appreciate it. I am not sure I want to stick with a system that requires a 3rd party. I can do majority of these installs myself. I just feel that there is only so much I can do with savant since it requires a license. My understanding about my own system is that everything is actually lutron but I have a hub that is savant. All the relay switches are ra2, along with my light switches, my sound system is connected to sonos amps. Given all that it is unclear to me why i even have savant? So I am wondering if I can just replace the hub with a lutron hub (knowing that it’s not as simple as swapping them out) I just want to be able to do things on my own, and that being said what exactly am I missing out on if I switch over?', 'StupidIdiot8989: Thanks this was the kind of explanation I was looking for! I do have regular keypad/dimmers but unfortunately the bridge is savant. Tv isn’t an issue to be honest, I only use Apple TV and very much prefer using the remote instead of the savant app to control it. After doing some research I think my HVAC is too low voltage for any type of smart thermostat anyway so I don’t even think I could add it to savant even if I wanted to. \n\nCurrently the only thing savant controls for me is lights and blinds, Sonos stopped working with savant a long time ago and more recently the tv stopped working through savant as well. I’m happy to change bridges to lutron if they have an app where I can just set up my lights settings but if it requires hiring a rep to program for me then forget it!', 'BAFUdaGreat: Your Savant control system sits on top of every single other system (lighting, AV, etc...) and is the only means for ""direct control"". Example: how will you control the lighting without it? Most likely the all the lighting scenes and button presets are that are in the Savant system won\'t work. You\'ll need to have a Lutron programmer in to ensure that those settings will still work outside of the Savant system.  \n\n\nSavant is a high(er)-end control system that is designed to interact with many other system below it (just like Crestron and Lutron).  \n\n\nHome integration is specialized and as such requires licensing, training and certification. There would be $0 cost to you to have another firm(s) in to see what can be done to ""fix"" your system. Just getting rid of it will cause you more problems.']"

Thanks!	26	"['No-Scale1239: You’d need to find the processor. It is likely a Radio Ra2 Main Repeater, which is a white box about 6x8” with a long antenna on it. \n\nOnce you have the processor, you need to connect it via Ethernet to your router. However, depending on how it is configured it may not connect automatically. \n\nIn order to use the current Lutron app, and then connect to it via Google Home, you would also need a device called a Connect Bridge. There may already be one, but you haven’t found it yet. If there isn’t one, it’ll need to be added. \n\nThis is a custom programmed system, not something you can modify yourself in its current state, especially if there’s no Connect Bridge. Once you have app access via a current app, you can make some modifications and schedules as a homeowner, but any more advanced programming will be done by a Lutron dealer. \n\nThe best course of action is to find out who installed the system, and schedule an appointment for them to come help you get it going in the way you want. If you can find them, any other reputable Lutron dealer should be able to help. They will need to cross their fingers and hopefully extract the programming from the system.\n\nThere’s also a chance this is a different Lutron system such as HomeWorks QS or another HomeWorks generation.

Here is some details about my setup:

* 1 Smarthings v3 hub 
* 2 kwikset 914 door locks (zigbee)
*  25 open close sensors (mix of zwave & zigbee)
* 1 garage door (chamberlin w/ myQ)
* 15 in wall on/off light switches (mostly zwave GE brand)
* 5 on/off smart outlet plugs (Zigbee)
* 2 water leak sensors (zigbee)
* 1 Ring door bell
* 5 ring cameras  
* 5 Amazon Echos across the house to enable voice control

One of my doorlocks recently became ""missing"" from smartthings, and I've tried for days to re-add it with no luck.  I'm also not very happy with lack of features in the new smarthings platform.  For these reasons I'm considering switching from Smarthings to Hubitit.  I would like some advice on the following:

* How hard is Hubitat to setup and configure?
* How long would it take to migrate all my devices?
* Based on my device list above, is there any compatibility issues I might have?
* Are there any key features that smartThings has that Hubitat does not?"	2	['Weyoun2: https://community.hubitat.com', 'eben89: 1 - easy enough.

Love it, works great and is rock solid. But I really want more options in my Master Bathroom.

What I really want is bright, pure white light in the mornings while we're getting ready for the day, but the option for dim, warm lighting in the evenings if my wife wants a nice bath or whatever. Obviously Caseta can pull off the dimming, but not the tint shift.

I know that Philips Hue is very popular for this sorta thing and would probably do exactly what I want.

I think that works....    


Any problems with that idea? Anybody have a better one? Is there an option using zigbee or z-wave that I'm missing, so I don't have to buy another hub? Or is Hue worth spending for?

It’s easy to reduce the function of a vibration sensor to monitoring things that - well - vibrate. 

But these sensors (at least the aqara, and I’m assuming more do) also have sensors for their orientation in 3D-space via their x/y/z coordinates, and acceleration sensors will also record tiniest individual movements/nudges. 

That means for example that a vibration sensor on _the door_ of a washing machine can detect spin cycles and whether the machine is being moved, but it can also tell you if the door is open or closed and even _how widely_ open the door is through the x/y/z coordinates. 

A vibration sensor on the top of a rolling garage door would give an indication of the door’s status with more detail than just open/close, it could even tell if someone knocked!

On a door knob it would tell _from which side_ the door was opened!

We want to add the function of being able to turn them on or off and dim them from a smartphone/alexa and potentially setup sentry mode with Alexa. 

Currently on the inside of the wall to the lounge we have a single switch with a rotary knob. 

On the outside, is a 4 Gang which controls the lounge lights + 3 others in the house. 

Are looking to replace our current switches with PDL Iconics push button, including the dimmer function. I am not sure if it's required to change anything, but it would be useful if the switch that controls the lounge lights is stateless, so it can effectively be controlled in any order from either the physical switch or app.

Human Centric Lighting is another term for this.

Besides Lutron Ketra, are there any other options available in the US market for single family homes? Ideally I’m seeking something closer to Philips Hue pricing. My understanding is that regular RGB and tunable white bulbs do not have sufficient Equivalent Daylight (D65) Illuminance ratings to have impactful influence on circadian rhythms.

These are some options that I learned about from previous posts and I’ve done some additional research since, but haven't found anything available in the US.

I have two motors controlled by channel 3 of my remote. At some point recently one of them started acting wonky - it wouldn't go up or down with a press-and-release, I would have to hold the button down to get it to move. I unplugged the other one on that channel and proceeded to try to fix this one. I'm not sure of the exact sequence of events that got me here, but here's where I'm at:

The blind is at the top of its range, almost to the top of the window. If I press the down button nothing happens. If I press and release the up button it moves down about an inch and stops. If I now press and release the down button it moves up about an inch and stops. OK, so it's acting like the limits are set really close together and the buttons are reversed. Here are the steps I follow:

1) I press the up and down buttons together and the motor jogs. 

2) Per the instructions, I press and hold the My button to reverse the buttons. According to the instructions the motor should jog to confirm the button reversal, but nothing happens. Up still makes it go down, and Down makes it go up, and it's stuck in a range of just a couple of inches. I can't seem to make the buttons reverse.

3) At this point I want to set/confirm the upper limit, so I press the down button to get to the top of the range. Since it seems that the buttons are reversed, I press the My and up buttons together. At this point it should move down so I can set the lower limit, but nothing happens. The shade is stuck all the way open.

3a) I try repeating the above process, but when I get to step 3 I pretend the buttons aren't reversed. I try pressing the My and down buttons to set the upper limit, but the shade still doesn't move.

I've tried doing a factory reset on that motor with the unplug-plug-unplug-plug sequence, but it doesn't jog after plugging it back in the last time and doesn't appear to get reset. Some things I read say it's 3-8-3 but the instructions say it's 2-10-2. I've tried both with no luck.

At this point I'd be happy to just get it all the way back down and unplug it so I have privacy, but I can't even get it to move down at all. Any suggestions?"	2	"['deignguy1989: Which Somfy motor, meaning what type of shade are you controlling.  A factory reset for most Somfy motors either involves a button on the motor or a small hole you place a pin in and push, holding it until you get three jobs.

I’ve been selling Somfy motorized shades for about 13 years and I’m not familiar with a plug/unplug sequence to reset, but that’s not to say that’s not out there!', ""redrocketman74: This is the procedure I found:\n\nhttps://www.somfysystems.com/en-us/blog/post/how-to-reset-your-rolling-shutter-motor-to-factory-mode\n\nI'm not sure what kind I have or how to tell, I bought new construction and they were already installed. They're 24V so maybe that procedure doesn't apply. I don't see any sort of reset button on the end of the roller but they're covered up with valences that are caulked on and I was trying to avoid having to remove them.\n\nI unplugged the motor and took the dog for a walk, came back and plugged it in, and pressed the up and down buttons together until it jogged. At that point I was able to push and hold the Up button and it would move really really slowly down about 6 inches and then stop, I would release and then press and hold again and it would go another 6 inches and stop, and I finally got it all the way down. I'm starting to think the motor is just crapping out.""]"

However, contactors are designed to handle higher current loads and can better manage inrush current arcing as compared to regular relays. Here's how a contactor can handle inrush current arcing more effectively:  \n>  \n>Contact Material: Contactors are usually built with more robust and durable contact materials, such as silver alloy or silver tungsten, which have higher conductivity and better arc resistance. This helps in minimizing the contact wear and damage caused by inrush current arcing.  \n>  \n>Contact Gap: Contactors have a larger contact gap compared to regular relays. A larger gap ensures that the arc has a longer distance to travel, making it more likely to extinguish before it can cause damage to the contacts.  \n>  \n>Arc Suppression: Contactors often incorporate arc suppression mechanisms to help extinguish arcs quickly. These mechanisms can include arc chutes or magnetic blowouts that use magnetic fields to stretch and cool the arc, making it easier to break.  \n>  \n>Coil Ratings: The coils in contactors are designed to handle higher currents and dissipate heat more effectively. This allows contactors to consistently manage inrush currents without overheating or malfunctioning.  \n>  \n>Current Ratings: Contactors have higher current ratings compared to regular relays, which means they can handle larger inrush currents without experiencing performance issues or damage.  \n>  \n>While contactors are better equipped to handle inrush current arcing, they are more expensive and larger in size compared to regular relays. For this reason, contactors are typically used in high-current applications where inrush current handling is a critical requirement, while regular relays are used in low-current applications."", ""Ninja128: Gotcha, but that seems more like an issue with your specific GE/Jasco units than all-on-one units as a whole.

The starting current can be 5-7 times the full load current (running current). Assuming a full load current of 10 amps, the starting current could be around 50-70 amps.\n\nThe resistance of 12 AWG copper wire is approximately 1.588 ohms per 1,000 feet at 20°C (68°F). For a 350-foot run, the total wire length for a round trip (to the motor and back) is 700 feet. The resistance of a 700-foot 12 AWG copper wire is:\n\nResistance = (1.588 ohms/1,000 feet) × 700 feet ≈ 1.112 ohms\n\nAssuming the worst-case scenario with a starting current of 70 amps, the voltage drop across the wire can be calculated using Ohm's law:\n\nVoltage Drop = Current × Resistance Voltage Drop = 70 amps × 1.112 ohms ≈ 77.84 volts\n\nUsing 12 AWG wire for a 350-foot run with a 1.5 HP motor during startup could result in a voltage drop of approximately 77.84 volts in the worst-case scenario. This is a significant voltage drop and may lead to poor motor performance or even failure to start.\n\nSome rough estimates for a single-phase motor:\n\n1. Starting current: The starting current (also known as inrush current or locked rotor current) for a 1.5 HP motor can be 5-7 times the full load current.\n2. Running current: The full load current (FLC) or running current for a 1.5 HP motor at 240V is typically around 9-10 amps\n3. For a 240V system, the maximum allowable voltage drop for the branch circuit would be 7.2 volts (240V \\* 3%).\n4. For a 350-foot run and 3% maximum voltage drop, you would need a 6 AWG copper wire.\n\nThat's an expensive wire run, especially pulling it all up, since it's direct burial it's even more expensive.\n\nInstead, you could also consider a step up transformer at the source, bump the 240 up to 480, then bring it back down (step down) at the load, keeping the existing 12AWG wire run and solving the problem.  Either way, this requires a $$$ investment.\n\n>To calculate the target voltages for a step-up and step-down transformer to power a 1.5 HP pump with a 350-foot run while keeping the voltage drop within the 3% requirement, we need to consider the allowable voltage drop and the resistance of the wire.  \n>  \n>Calculate the allowable voltage drop: Allowable Voltage Drop = 240V × 0.03 = 7.2V  \n>  \n>Calculate the round-trip wire resistance: Assuming we use a 12 AWG copper wire with a resistance of approximately 1.588 ohms per 1,000 feet, the total wire length for a round trip (to the motor and back) is 700 feet. The resistance of a 700-foot 12 AWG copper wire is:  \n>  \n>Resistance = (1.588 ohms/1,000 feet) × 700 feet ≈ 1.112 ohms  \n>  \n>Calculate the maximum allowable current to maintain a 3% voltage drop:  \n>  \n>Max Allowable Current = Allowable Voltage Drop / Resistance Max Allowable Current = 7.2V / 1.112 ohms ≈ 6.47 A  \n>  \n>Assuming a full load current of 10 A for the 1.5 HP motor, we need to reduce the current in the wire to meet the 3% voltage drop requirement. We can do this by increasing the supply voltage using a step-up transformer and then stepping it back down using a step-down transformer near the motor.  \n>  \n>Calculate the required supply voltage to achieve the max allowable current:  \n>  \n>New Supply Voltage = 240V × (10 A / 6.47 A) ≈ 370V  \n>  \n>So, you would use a step-up transformer to increase the voltage to around 370V and then use a step-down transformer near the motor to return the voltage back to the required 240V. This should help to minimize the voltage drop over the long distance and keep it within the 3% requirement.""]"

Looking for some advice. I moved from an apartment where I had my automation on point. It was a small place with limited stuff to automate.

I'm in a house now and need some help automating. I have a smart thermostat, a couple of smart outlets, and a smart lamp (bulb). 

What I'm thinking of automating are:
- curtains: https://ca.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-curtain?currency=CAD&variant=39935776522305&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=VV_Pmax_Curtain_CA/OR_220221&gclid=Cj0KCQjwlumhBhClARIsABO6p-ziVDOulCsXtG1ccWmnsPbYt6BEyRVwcWQQT6Nksl2X11NVgoS6oT4aAvtYEALw_wcB
- blinds (just shades)
- 2 dimmers
- 1- 3 light switches

Lastly, I have 4 hallway fixtures that have 3-way switches, one of them has 3 switches (9 shrugged
Switches altogether). What are your thoughts here?

Lastly, I don't want someone to flick off the light switch and kill a smart bulb so I'm hoping for smart switches over bulbs.

Tia!"	8	"['shadow1515: For switches I like the GE Enbrighten line. They come in rocker or switch format so you can replace whatever you have without needing new faceplate. The add on switches handle 3 way situations flawlessly in my experience. And they come in both Zigbee and Z-Wave so you can use them with whatever hub you want and keep clutter off your wifi network.', 'rcroche01: Replacing switches in that hallway (or anywhere) is easy. I use Zooz switches throughout my home. You only need to replace the switch that brings power to the circuit. The remote switches can remain ""dumb"".\n\nI do recommend getting your smart home devices off your WiFi as much as possible. Today with a dozen or so devices it really doesn\'t much matter. But you will keep adding devices now that you are in a home. I don\'t even know how many devices I have, the last count I did was well north of 150. WiFi is not designed for that.\n\nWhat smart home platform are you using? The biggest here in the DIY space are SmartThings, Home Assistant, and Hubitat. Each of these would involve a single hub that connects to your network (wired Ethernet or WiFi). These systems, in addition to creating and managing your Z-Wave and ZigBee mesh networks, would gather all your disparate devices into a single system. They all can then be made available to voice controllers (Google, Alexa, Apple, etc), wall tablets, etc.', ""roblu001: I actually have the wifi situation covered (2 AP's with a few subnets for various device groups). But I'll look up the ge enbrighten line and the hub.\n\nFor the add on switches, would I be able to simply replace 1 switch in the circuit?\n\nAlso, do they have dimmers?"", ""roblu001: I know wifi isn't designed for it, but I've got 3 floors and I just got my wifi setup perfect to have coverage over the whole house. I would hate to have to introduce more wireless noise and hubs"", ""shadow1515: There may be dimmerless ones but I always get the dimmer ones. I've never tried replacing only one switch in a three way circuit, not sure if it would work or not.\n\nTo clarify they don't need a specific hub, if you have any hub that does Z-Wave or Zigbee they will work as long as you get the protocol that works with your hub (I know many/most will do both anyway)."", 'rcroche01: Valid point. That\'s why I keep as much as I can on Z-Wave.\n\nYour house is ""vertical"" mine is horizontal. I built a ranch that is over 3,000 square feet. So like you, first priority was rock solid WiFi. I chose eero for a mesh WiFi network and put one eero Pro in each corner of the house.\n\nFor things that are stationary (TVs, desktops, etc) I ran wired Ethernet to keep those things off the WiFi.  In my mind WiFi was for things that are mobile (phones, watches, tablets, laptops, etc).\n\nAnd like you, I didn\'t want my smart home devices to interfere (I knew then there would be many).\n\nEnter Z-Wave. Different frequency so no wifi interference. ZigBee and the new Thread run on the same 2.4ghz band that most of your WiFi runs on (don\'t forget that WiFi also can jump to 5ghz if there is a better connection to the device there).\n\nSo I decided that at much as possible, I would keep smart home devices on Z-Wave. I would use ZigBee only for low power battery operated sensors that use very little bandwidth (door/window contact sensors, water leak sensors, etc). Everything else (lighting, blinds, locks, etc, etc, etc) went on Z-Wave which is down on 900mhz or thereabouts.', ""roblu001: Thank you so much for sharing your setup! (Very impressed at the methodical nature of your setup, very good use of the various networking mediums)\n\nI'm using the Ubiquiti Unifi line of Access Points. PoE wired access points (I wish that they were more intentional and added the other radios to the AP's, 2.4ghz, 5ghz, z-wave, and zigbee).\n\nI'm glad to hear that Z-Wave works on the 900mhz frequency because that would not interfere with the 2.4ghz and 5ghz frequencies I use today (some devices I have are only 2.4ghz so the zigbee could actually present an unavoidable competition on the band and noise that would degrade the connection)\n\nMy issue is that I only have about 1,000 sqft of floor space (Plus garage and utility room) but its distributed across 3 floors. In a slightly different configuration I could have 1 AP in the middle and cover the whole house (potentially even in my current setup). With a house this size there is a limit to the number of devices that I can/will have on my network. I currently am maxing out at about 19 devices (across 2 APs). I could realistically see 10-15 more devices in the future, but even 35 devices in total will still be easily manageable across 2 APs."", 'rcroche01: My brother and nephew both have the Ubiquiti system. It works well for them both.\n\nIf 35 devices truly is the limit, then yes you are right. WiFi will handled it just fine. I will just say that when I built our house two years ago I never imagined we would have the number of smart home devices that we now have two years later.\n\nOne example... My initial setup included no water leak detection. It just wasn\'t on my radar. But reading in here got me thinking. So I bought a leak detector for under the water heater and an valve actuator to shut off the water main. Two devices, right? We\'ve since added water sensors under the washer, under the basement utility sink, under the dishwasher, and in the utility closet where a sump pump send the basement bathroom drainage up to the septic outflow. \n\nMy ""water security"" system was non existent, then became two devices, and is now six devices. The ""device creep"" in the smart home world is crazy!']"
1681561035.0	15-Apr-2023 05:17:15	Do I Have to Create a Scene for a Scene Controller Remote if All I Want is a Single Device Toggle?	ostrichsak	2	12n0gai	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12n0gai/do_i_have_to_create_a_scene_for_a_scene/	"I'm using a Vera Edge as a controller although I think this applies to most Z-Wave-based controllers. 

I recently installed a Minoston S2 SmartStart 4-button remote via Z-Wave. My desire is to have each of the 4 buttons on the remote device toggle a single Z-Wave connected device on the same controller. 

When I initially installed the device I used Generic Z-Wave and things didn't start off too well. I contacted Vera support and they changed something to make it a scene controller. I now have access to the four buttons from within Vera to assign a function to each button. The only issue is that my only options to assign to the buttons are scenes. 

Is there a way to have: ""Button #1 toggle that light on/off"" and ""Button #2 toggle that fan on/off"" and nothing more? 

That's all I'm looking to do with each button is use it as another way to toggle devices within the room on or off when I don't want to use Alexa or a physical button elsewhere in the room. I really don't need something as complex as scene control with these buttons. 

Do I really need to s/u some elaborate scene for EACH of these buttons on all of these remotes to gain simple toggle functionality?"	7	"[""McPostal: Yes. Create a scene for each button. Scenes can be one action or many actions. It's the easiest way to accomplish your goal. Scene it's just the terminology they use for a trigger to cause an action or multiple actions."", ""silasmoeckel: That device supports associations you can do on/off or dimming.  You have to set those up in vera it's under the device options tab.\n\nThis gets you on/off and dimming from this devices directly to the others (works if the hub is off etc)."", ""csanner: Honestly thank you for asking this because I'd been in disbelief and thought there was just something wrong with my particular controller"", 'kigmatzomat: You are asking two questions, one explicit, one implicit. \n\nFirst, the explicit: Do I need a scene?  Well, Scenes/routines/events/etc are the foundation of automation.  Why? Because people want different things and there is rarely a default answer that works for a plurality of users for devices with no explicit use case, like a generic remote with multipurpose buttons.\n\nLet\'s take your case: ""Button #1 toggle that light on/off"" and ""Button #2 toggle that fan on/off""\n\nWhat if someone else wants that remote to control a light with button 1 for On and button 2 for off?  Or button 1 is for ""brighten"" and button 2 is for ""dimmer""?  Those are 3 different scenarios that require 3 different configurations. If your option is the default, the other 2 people will be on here in 2 days asking for the opposite.  Alternately, the product is too limited and the market rejects it.\n\nSo yes, requiring configuration of an automation is appropriate for a device with no explicit use case. \n\nNow, the implicit question of ""why is this so hard?""\n\nWell, vera was never that great of a product. I had the vera3, veraplus, and bought an Atom out of curiosity.   Your only options were luup scripts or buy PLEG, which may not be an option any more.  (AltUI had some extra features that might cover this but is it available after Vera/Ezlo attacked all their devs?)\n\nNow I have homeseer. There are at least four ways to set up ""toggle"" functionality. \n\n1. button controls a ""toggle"" virtual device, with an ""on"" event and an ""off"" event based on the virtual device.\n2. A single event using variables based on the controlled device\'s current state\n3. Scripting with .net\n4. Get a plugin like EasyTrigger where setting up the toggle event takes 15 seconds. \n\nOption 1 is the baked in approach, with simple, individual steps that have minimal learning curves and sets you up to leverage the inherent features of the platform. 2 is elegant but requires a very precise approach. 3 has the advantage you can easily maintain and leverage a code library...if you like scripting.  4 saves a lot of time....is it enough to justify the purchase given option 1?\n\nOther controllers will have other options.', 'ostrichsak: Seems much more complex than it could be if they added a list of devices in addition to the house modes and scenes that already exist. Seems like a simple toggle option for devices for remotes would be a very useful feature. \n\nHow do I create a toggle for a device on a scene? I see I can s/u a scene that says ""If device is on, turn it off"" but I don\'t see a way to also add the inverse to that same device and same scene. \n\nPlease tell me I don\'t have to create an ""on"" scene as well as an ""off"" scene for the same device and take up two buttons on the remote to simply turn one device on and off? That would dramatically impact my plans for these devices.', ""ostrichsak: Thanks for the reply.\n\nI found the Associations section you're talking about. Am I wanting to modify the Association settings for the device I want to control (a light for instance) or for the remote device I want to use to control that device?"", 'silasmoeckel: You associate the device you want to control with this unit.']"

After my Graber automated shades stopped working with Alexa a few weeks back, I finally found time to investigate this week. I did a full reset, re-added them to Alexa, and did lots of research re: why they still weren't working - but no progress. Finally I called their customer support, and discovered they're aware that their Alexa integration broke some weeks back.

I've been in communication with them since, and strongly suggested they email all registered owners to let them know the integration is down, so other folks won't waste time like I did. However, they refuse to do this (they claim they've done this on FB/Twitter - but who follows their shades manufacturer, and in any case I can find no trace of the posts).

For anyone considering Graber shades, please learn from my experience.

* Undoubtedly they had plenty of notice of a breaking change on Alexa, and opportunity to deploy a fix - but they let it break.
* They now won't communicate the issue to owners trying to figure out the issue themselves (which will not be possible, since the integration is broken).
* There is no ETA for a fix.
* The motorization is EXTREMELY temperamental the rest of the time - my system needs to be reset every few weeks, even after a replacement under warranty.

If you're in need of automated shades, I'd strongly recommend going any other route."	13	"['marmarama: The Graber motors use Z-Wave, no?\n\nPerhaps this is the time to setup Home Assistant, get a Z-Wave dongle to control the motors, and integrate with Alexa through HA.', 'truthlesshunter: Same with me.

Short of that, I guess the easiest way to implement something like this with an existing one, would be to get a smart momentary switch that would turn off for 2-3 seconds when triggered. Does something like that exist, or would I need to deal with that in the programming of my smarthub?

Word of mouth has landed me wealthier clients with a lot of work and jobs on new builds with contractors.

My challenge is how to think about pricing my services. I can tell I'm going to get in over my head if I don't think about this the right way. 

Any advice for me starting out?

Note: I do have a distributor in my area with good wholesale pricing on equipment."	11	"['olderaccount: The hardest part is dealing with post installation support. \n\nA lot of integrators do great at first when they have a lot of new installs and few legacy customers to support. Revenue from new installs more than pays for support. \n\nBut as new installs slow down while your install base grows, supporting legacy customers starts becoming an ever increasing percentage of your costs. This is where most integrators go bankrupt. \n\nI think the only way to survive in this business is to be expensive and hope you find enough customers who can afford you and are willing to pay for the quality you bring.', 'nick2253: I have a friend in the business, and we\'ve discussed his model a few times.\n\nWhen he started, he thought the money was in the install work.  Charge a bunch, help people create giant, complicated smart homes, and the money poured in.  What killed him, and forced him to change his pricing, was the support after the fact.  Clients kept coming back to him asking for help with this or that, needing troubleshooting help, setting up on a new device, etc.  He gave out his time for free as part of the ""install cost"", but quickly burned through all the value of the install money.\n\nNow, however, he has a completely different model:  everything is based on support contracts.  When you come to him, he now negotiates an install with a minimum 12 month support contract.  The install is charged at hardware +5% or so (depending on the discounts he is able to negotiate with OEMs) and a flat labor fee (charged based on his internal hourly rate and an estimate of the complexity of the install).\n\nHis support contracts usually are equivalent to between 2-4 hours of labor per month (depending on the complexity of the install), and offer support for most home automation issues.  This also covers him for reinstall labor for defective devices and troubleshooting time if the system goes sideways.\n\nWhen he switched to this model, he found that his best clients actually started using him more, and recommending him more, since the ""support contract"" model gave them confidence that their home automation investment would work for the long-haul, and wouldn\'t be a one-and-done, obsolete next year, kind of thing.

Even if you have a wholesaler for things like TV\'s, it\'s not easy to charge more than typical advertised pricing, which means you might be able to make 20 points, which barely covers your costs of handling (picking up and delivering). Other items could get you 30 - 50 points. Items like Nest, Sonos, Google home etc offer so little profit, you have to make sure your business model is based on your labour charges. \n\nAre you looking into selling Smart Home systems like Lutron, Control 4, Savant, Elan, RTI? These systems are dealer only and do offer decent margins on parts, as well as the opportunity to charge for both labour and programming. When done right they should work well. They do require a commitment from you too.\n\nIf you are getting into higher end home and higher end systems, it is also time to create a contract that outlines what is being sold / installed and what ""warranty"" you personally are including. No one has to hold you to free service for the rest of your life. Clients do like to have a comfort level that you will look after them for free for the first 6 months for example. After all they might have just spent $100k on their system. In your contract be very specific, for example items like cable boxes can fail, but they are not your product, you might have only had a charge to install and set them up. Outline what your service labour costs are, and the difference between a free service call because something you did messed up VS a manufacture warranty call which you should be able to charge for. Most Manufactures don\'t pay you to pick up and send in a failed unit, they might fix it for free, but it will cost you time and effort.

Does anyone have experience interacting with large appliances for monitoring purposes ?

Few years ago I bought induction hob from BOSCH that had wi-fi built in but it turned out that phone app is not supported in region I'm in and in general it ended up as big failure. Zero documentation, zero support from manufacturer and I wasn't feeling like opening it and tinkering.

I'm trying to get some knowledge for available devices (fridge, washing machine, hob, microwave, oven)

Well.... I don't want to use it for its intended use of turning on and off the mains powered lights via switch, app or voice command.

I have been looking for a smart remote for some time, but am limited by product conbatibility.

I plan on using the smart switch to control my other connected devices such as smart bulbs using automations such as -
If switch 1 changes to on> turn on bedside lamps. 
If switch 2 changes to off> close the blinds.

Currently I can do this on my installed mains powered smart switch, but that also controls the downlights in my house. If I could convert one to battery power, I would have a portable smart remote that could be fully customised  to suit all of my current smart products.

Alternatively, you could set up a [Milight hub](https://github.com/sidoh/esp8266_milight_hub) (which also translates button presses to MQTT topics) and use any of the commercially available Milight remotes as inputs.

The best, yet the most complicated, solution is to split the single light switch into two switches.

Most of those are one sealed unit I think.\n\n\n3. I dunno. Your one switch is powering both sets of lights, so you can't send power to the Govee bulbs without also lighting up the ceiling LED. I'm not sure without seeing the wiring behind the light switch, but if you're REALLY lucky and the ceiling light circuit AND a separate Smart Bulb circuit terminate in the one light switch box, you could potentially run some kind of Shelly relay (Google is your friend here), which could turn on and off the two different circuits based on the number of times you flip the light switch. If the lights are all wired into each other and you only have one set of wires being controlled by the switch, this won't work.\n\nBottom line, I can't think of any way to control the Govee lights without the ceiling light being on, unless you want to mess with wiring, which I don't recommend unless you're comfortable with that.\n\nHopefully somebody else can be more useful here."", 'ferbulous: Are you using smart switch as well or just normal one', 'Ok_Performance_2370: What about changing LEDS to smart LEDs?', 'ninjersteve: You can place a load controller (on/off or dimmer depending on whether the fixture supports dimming) like a Shelly or Aeotec right behind the ceiling fixture and then use a smart switch and/or app to control them.', 'Steelyp: I would get a smart toggle switch like this:\n[jasco switch ](https://byjasco.com/ge-z-wave-plus-wall-smart-switch-light-almond-toggle-500s?utm_term=&utm_campaign=SL+-+PMax+-+Smart+Home&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_tgt=&hsa_grp=&hsa_src=x&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_mt=&hsa_ver=3&hsa_ad=&hsa_acc=2023482469&hsa_kw=&hsa_cam=18468658461&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkoqYss-p_gIVPmxvBB0quABCEAQYASABEgJr-vD_BwE)\n\nThen since the bulbs are smart you can program the pendant lights to not come on unless the switch is double tapped or turn off on a double down or something\n\nEdit: this assumes you already have some smart home hub and a z wave or zigbee hub for the switch.

1681439837.0	13-Apr-2023 19:37:17	Problems with Shelly 1 connection to my Home WiFi	verylittlegravitaas	3	12lgr0l	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12lgr0l/problems_with_shelly_1_connection_to_my_home_wifi/	"Hi. I recently purchased several Shelly 1's to automate some low voltage switches around the home. I was able to wire up the shelly and configure it correctly by connecting to its access point, but I can't get it to join my home WiFi. I've also tried using the app to automatically configure the device to join my WiFi, but after the initial detection of the device AP it never is able to join.

I found a similar post [that recommended](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/zwi1bh/shelly_devices_keep_pending_for_first_connection/) a few things

* Enable cloud mode (some day I want to setup HA, but not today)
* Use a static IP outside the DHCP range

I'm using an earlier iteration of Google WiFi. I have two access points in bridge mode connected by ethernet. I can receive a signal in the location of the shelly on my phone, but it's not super strong, maybe it's a connection strength issue? I'll try bringing it closer to WiFi to see if that makes a difference.

I'm finding troubleshooting difficult because as soon as I configure the shelly to connect to WiFi I lose any connectivity to the device. If I want to try something else I have to reset it and therefore presumably lose any logs or other helpful information about why it can't connect to my WiFi.

Any ideas?

EDIT: 

How I resolved the issue:

What eventually enabled me to successfully add the device was to walk far enough from my WiFi so that when I added the device through the Shelly app and chose the SSID to connect to, instead of having to guess which of two SSID was for 2.4 Ghz I only had one to choose from in the Shelly app's WiFi picker. So I assume that was the 2.4 Ghz AP for my Google WiFi."	12	"['MikeP001: When you say ""not able to join"", is that really what you mean?  Joining it to a wifi network isn\'t very difficult and many customers have already done it.  Often people will be confused by an app failing to find the device vs the device joining your network.\n\nCheck your router status to see if it\'s actually failing to connect.  If not connecting it\'s something with your security, or you\'ve got band steering enabled, or similar.  Many routers will have logs that will show the client\'s attempt to join and why it failed which may help.\n\nIf it is connected then the problem is the app, try checking the FAQs, likely there\'s a setting (firewall maybe, or DNS?) on your router preventing it from reaching their cloud service or the app from finding it locally if that\'s how it works.  To check if remote works, try turning off wifi on your phone to see if you can reach it via the data network.  If it\'s local often it\'s because your phone connects at 5GHz and the router blocks discovery messages between bands.  If you can\'t have separate SSIDs for 2.4GHz vs 5GHz google did have a silly workaround involving walking far enough from your home for the phone to loose it\'s 5GHz connection and switch onto 2.4.', 'ww_boxer: Step 1, learn:  https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Nest-Wifi/Setting-up-2-4GHz-IoT-Devices-on-Google-Nest-Wifi-December-2022/m-p/312849 \nStep 2, Get a real router.', ""verylittlegravitaas: I'm now able to add the device.\n\n> If you can't have separate SSIDs for 2.4GHz vs 5GHz google did have a silly workaround involving walking far enough from your home for the phone to loose it's 5GHz connection and switch onto 2.4.\n\nIf I understand correctly what you (and Google) are saying is that although Google WiFi supports 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz, each Access Point is advertised separately, but with the exact same SSID, the same name. When I tried to configure the Shelly thru its AP and Web UI I'm only able to enter an SSID and password. I assumed that given the device can only connect to 2.4 Ghz it would choose the right SSID, but that doesn't appear to be the case.. does the SSID get advertised on a common band regardless of what frequency you ultimately use?\n\nWhat eventually enabled me to successfully add the device was to walk far enough from my WiFi so that when I added the device through the Shelly app and chose the SSID to connect to, instead of having to guess which of two SSID was for 2.4 Ghz I only had one to choose from in the Shelly app's WiFi picker. So I assume that was the 2.4 Ghz AP for my Google WiFi."", ""verylittlegravitaas: I suspected the router was the issue. TBH Google WiFi's been great up to this point, but this may be the reason to upgrade.\n\nOne thing I don't understand is that Google WiFi supports both bands. As far as I understand, there are two SSID's one for 2.4Ghz and one for 5Ghz. I understand my phone and other more sophisticated devices will negotiate the better of, or multiple of bands to use, but if the Shelly only operates on the 2.4Ghz band why can't it just connect to the only SSID it should be able to see, the 2.4Ghz SSID my Google WiFi router should be serving? What's my phone or any other device connecting to the router have to do with it?\n\nEDIT:\n\nFrom this [Google support post](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/6293481?hl=en-AU):\n\n> Devices that support only the 2.4 GHz band (an older phone, for example), will automatically connect to the 2.4 GHz band.\n\nShouldn't this apply to the Shelly device when I manually configure its client WiFi mode?"", ""MikeP001: Good stuff :).\n\nRight, each AP advertises an SSID on each band, they just happen all have same name and password (though typically different BSSIDs which are usually ignored).  2.4GHz only devices like the shelly can \\*only\\* see the 2.4GHz signal (no matter what the SSID names happen to be).  Almost certainly it's successful connecting to your wifi when told the correct SSID and password.\n\nYour phone can see both bands, and usually picks 5GHz because it's faster/better in most situations (or is pushed over by band steering on the AP).  The only disadvantage of 5GHz is it doesn't reach as far.\n\nI've never looked at the shelly protocol but my guess would be discovery is via UDP and the google router is blocking it between bands or APs.  So when your phone switches back to 5GHz the app doesn't see the shelly and so assumes it didn't connect.\n\nSo right, walking far enough away weakens the 5GHz signal so the phone connects to the 2.4GHz signal.  Now the app can see the shelly when it comes online and reports success.  TBH it was a bit silly of google not to allow an SSID name difference or at least to disable a band when necessary."", 'ww_boxer: I am not sure about this, I am totally 2.4GHz. During the setup sequence there is a point where the phone and Shelly communicate directly.  If the phone is talking 5GHz and Shelly 2.4GHz it’s a problem.

Just my guess.', 'verylittlegravitaas: I know it was an AP connection problem not a Shelly app network discovery problem because although Google WiFi functionality is limited I can see a raw list of devices that joined the network, or have joined recently, and the Shelly was never listed. So it must be something to do with the initial connection itself. Maybe the band steering logic you mentioned.', ""verylittlegravitaas: I'm not using the app connect the device because I had issues.. probably related to what you're saying.

Did you bring the shelly with you?\n\nI was curious about this: \n\n> instead of having to guess which of two SSID was for 2.4 Ghz I only had one to choose from in the Shelly app's WiFi picker.  \n\nThe shelly should be looking for available SSIDs, not your phone (unless the shelly coders are bad at their job).  The shelly isn't capable of seeing the 5GHz band/SSID, it only has a 2.4GHz radio.  If you've got multiple APs would see multiple 2.4GHz signals with the same SSID.  It actually doesn't matter, it'll pick one when it boots/connects (supposedly the closest/loudest, but not always).

It lets you choose an AP to automatically configure the Shelly to use and it showed two AP with the same name, but different mac addresses. It didn't include any info about bands, so I assume one was 2.4 and the other was 5. I'm assuming the app just makes an internal system call to get a list of APs (Android). When I walked far enough away from my house 1 of the dupes consistently disappeared, and my phone said it was connected with 2.4, so I picked that remaining AP in the app and then it worked.\n\nWhen I connected directly to the Shelly AP to configure WiFi it never gave me an option to provide a mac address, so I assume something got confused in the initial connection negotiation. Using the onboard Shelly config I had no way of listing available APs, but I guess when the Shelly app configures the WiFi maybe it can provide that additional information through an API to choose the right one?

The SSIDs in the list almost certainly were showing the 2.4GHz signals from each of your APs.\n\nI don\'t know what you mean by ""provide a mac address"", you don\'t do that.  You just pick an SSID from the list the shelly itself can see, provide the password and (in theory) the shelly will connect to the closest, loudest AP with a matching SSID/password when it starts up.  It can\'t and won\'t connect to a 5GHz signal.  I\'m pretty sure your problem was the router doesn\'t pass shelly discovery messages between bands or APs - esp if it was sorted by going further away with your phone.', ""verylittlegravitaas: Got it. The list had a unique ID next to each dupe AP that I assumed was AP by band but, maybe it was the physical APs themselves. IDK.

I am trying wrap my head around how I can get my house ventilation in Home Assistant with Zigbee..

How it works now is that there is a 3 mode rotary switch in my kitchen that controls the ventilation of my whole house, when I take a shower I am suppose to turn it on the highest mode but you can image that this is forgotten quite often since the switch is such a inconvenient location.

Does anyone what kind of Zigbee device would work with this? I don't care about the button itself, It would be nice to still be able to use it but it certainly not a must. I am also fine with something hidden in the wall.

I already have a humidity sensor in my bathroom which I can use to control the ventilation if I figure this out.

I am from Europe if that is going to make a difference and I can pull a neutral wire there if necessary.

How the machine works:

Middle button is lowest speed of the fan

Left rotation is middle speed of the fan

Right rotation is the maximum speed of the fan

Thanks in advance for the help!

Here are some photos of the wiring and the button:

Alarm must also be hardwired. Does anyone have some specific product suggestions that you have had success with?	6	"['cornellrwilliams: The easiest solution is to buy a normal analog alarm system then connect a relay like A ZooZ Zen17 Z-Wave Relay to the sensors or to the alarm output.

The alarm systems also usually have a 12v output as well so if you were to have multiple sensors and any of the go off it will send a 12v signal on the output.\n\nOPTION #1: Take the 2 wires that come off the rate of rise detector and connect them to S1 and C on the Zen17. Then take one wire from the control panel and connect it to the C terminal on the relay side then connect the other wire from the control panel to the NO terminal.\n\nOPTION #2: Take the 12V output from the control panel and Connect it to the C and VC terminal.\n\nI personally prefer option 1 because I can test the system by sending a Z-Wave command to the device to open and close the relay.

In some cases, you only need one smart switch and leave the other dumb switch alone. In other cases, you can use one smart switch but have to rewire the dumb one.

Typically both switches on a circuit do not need to be smart-enabled; only one. \n\nFirst get a [non-contact voltage tester](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=non+contact+voltage+tester) and figure out your wiring. Removing the plate but not the switch, check which wires are ""hot"" and whether the lights are on/off in both positions of both switches. One wire will always be hot (the ""line""); another is hot whenever the lights are on (the ""load"") and the ones that alternate are travelers. The wire that is never hot (and probably white, but *never* bare copper) is neutral. If you do not have neutral in your box, again you need to factor that into your purchase.\n\nFinally you are ready to buy a smart switch.

I don't use the pullcords because it's high ceiling. No electrical wall switch, fan has power direct to it. Currently controlled by battery powered IR wall switch. What is best solution to control via wall switch (wired or wireless, smart or IR) and voice (Google Assistant) without one killing the other. Looks like options are Bond Bridge vs Smart Fan Wall Switch, But I don't know all the pros and cons of each enough to decide. Cost is a factor. TIA

&#x200B;

Long Version:

Looking to automate my ceiling fan/light in my bedroom, but don't know the right solution.

I believe my options are between a Wall Smart Fan Switch and a Bond Bridge IR Hub

&#x200B;

Setup:

I currently have a multi-speed ceiling fan (AC Motor) with light.

Harbor Breeze Coastal Creek 52-in Brushed Nickel LED Indoor Downrod or Flush Mount Ceiling Fan with Light (5-Blade)

The fan is not wired to a switch, but is also hung from a vaulted ceiling, so the pullcords are never used. The current control mechanism is this wall-mounted battery powered RF(?) multi-button switch. I believe this was purchased separate from the fan and includes a receiver installed within the fan mount itself. This allows dimming of the light and multi-speed control of the fan (I believe this is independent of the multi-speed control by the pullcord.

&#x200B;

Considerations:

This fan burned out (I currently still use the light). I am looking to replace it with the same model, but would consider looking at a different model if the price is right and it includes a solution for smart control.

&#x200B;

What I Want:

I'd like a solution that allows me to control the fan on/off, fan speed (preferred, but not necessary), and light on/off. I'd like to control all this both by the wall switch as well as through google assistant. Most importantly, I don't want the wall switch to interfere with the ability to use google assistant (e.g. like how a smart bulb would be dead if the switch controlling the lamp it's plugged into is turned off). The wall switch can either be the current wireless RF switch I use or I can run power through the wall from the attic (not ideal, but possible if necessary) for a hardwired switch/smart switch.

&#x200B;

My Options:

Smart Fan - I haven't researched this much, but I'm assuming this will be more expensive. The replacement of the fan I currently have is only $89 and the Bond Bridge is $99. I'd imagine a smart fan control switch would be around $70.

&#x200B;

Smart Bulbs - These would work for voice control, but would be rendered useless if I switch off the light from the switch, killing power to the bulb.

&#x200B;

Smart Switch - This would require me to run power to/from the box in the wall where my wireless switch is located, so not ideal. I think this gives me all of the control I'd want, though. Better than the Bond Bridge because the smart home would know the status of the lights and fan as opposed to the Bond Bridge, which just sends out control IR signals with no feedback.

&#x200B;

Bond Bridge - This is something I just learned about today. I believe this would work hand-in-hand with my current wireless IR control switch (basically mimicking the control behavior). This would prevent the switch from killing the Voice Control and vice versa because all the control is still actually happening via the IR receiver. My questions about this are, what is the benefit if the Bond Bridge vs the Bond Bridge Pro? What is the range of the Bond Bridge and Pro? Can I use one Bond Bridge to control fans/devices in multiple rooms or is its range limited by walls/distance?

&#x200B;

Please could someone with experience help me decide which solution is best and most cost effective?

TIA"	6	"[""skinforhair: I recently got a Bond Bridge for a similar issue. I did not get the Pro. Their website has a comparison: https://bondhome.io/product/bond-bridge-pro/\n\nThe Bond Bridge works well for my fan with basic on/off, speed, and control and dimmer for the light. It's basically like the old-school universal tv remotes that could copy IR codes from your original remote, then duplicate the button pushes, but it accepts input from you over WiFi via the app. \n\nIt integrates well with Home Assistant, and I also have it controlling my Fireplace."", 'matheson993: My setup includes a sonoff wifi fan controller in the canopy of the fan, that I installed on an old fan. That gives me control over the lights and fan speeds. But when someone turned off the switch I would lose control (like a smart bulb does) I then installed a zooz scene controller that bypasses the switch relay and always powers the fan but controls the light and speeds as scenes. It has been working great.', 'cmeyer86: I\'m assuming your fan and fireplace are RF? Are they in different rooms/on different floors? I\'m curious what the range is on the Bond Bridge and its reliability at greater distance. If it has the range to control multiple fans in all 3 of my upstairs bedrooms as well as a fireplace in my living room (not completely necessary to automate) from one central location, then it\'s certainly the cheapest option for multiple devices. However I like the idea of a smart switch being able to give me feedback on what the actual state of the fan/light is instead of just blindly toggling state. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSemi-unrelated:\n\nHome Assistant opens up a new can of worms that I think I might find myself getting into. I currently use google home for all of my smart devices. All wifi devices set up through their separate native apps and linked to google home. No Zwave or Zigbee or whatever other protocols there are that require smart hubs, etc. I strictly use the Google home app as my ""Control Center"" and I use multiple google mini speakers and a google hub display for voice control. I cast to multiple chromecasts often. With the smart switch idea (which seems many options aren\'t wifi) as well as a dream I have of putting under-cabinet lighting with motion/voice/routine activation, It seems like I might be surpassing the capabilities of google home automation. I\'m curious how easy Home Assistant is and how well it works with Google Assistant voice commands through the google mini speakers. What is the initial cost of hardware? I really don\'t know much about it. Will it work with all the devices I currently have linked in my Google Home? This is really a question for its own post, but I\'d appreciate your input.', ""cmeyer86: Do you use the sonoff controller with google assistant/Google Home? Does it integrate nicely to control lights, fan state, and fan speed nicely from Google home app or voice command via google mini speakers? Also, because it's wifi, I'd imagine this means that google home would know the current state of fan/light even if it gets changed with the RF remote contol? As long as the state is monitored by google, I don't think I'd even need the zooz switch. I'd just use the wall-mounted remote or see if I can get my current  RF in-wall remote to work with the sonoff controller. Because I don't have a hard-wired switch, I wouldn't have the issue of accidently turning power off to the sonoff."", ""skinforhair: My Light/Fan and Fireplace are on the same floor, but I actually put the Bond Bridge downstairs in my network room almost directly below them. I'd say it is probably between 20 - 50 feet from each device it is controlling, and going through floors and around some concrete with no apparent issues. I don't know the full range, unfortunately. \n\nThe app does do a good job of keeping track of on/off states, which is very important to me. One issue I have is that the light/fan is on a physical light switch, and then has the IR remote to turn the fan on and off (and also control the dimming of the light). If the physical light switch kills power to the light, the IR remote and Bond Bridge cannot control it or see what state it is in. Ultimately, I may hardwire the physical switch to always be on, then mount the IR remote to the wall in its place to be the on/off switch. This way the Bond Bridge will always be correct.\n\nThe fireplace was just extra for me. I don't actually ever want to automate it to turn on, that seems potentially dangerous, but I did want to have a backup way to turn it on if I lost the remote (which is the only way to turn the dumb thing on), and to automate turning it OFF if it was ever left on.\n\nI believe the Bond Bridge will integrate with Google Home, but YMMV. I haven't played with it.\n\nI love Home Assistant. It is totally worth having my own in-house system that doesn't rely on any cloud services for my home automation. There is a lot of 3rd-party integration for multiple technologies. I have a mix of Zigbee, Z-wave, Wifi, Smart TVs, Alexas, etc. It can be run on a variety of hardware. I used to run it on a Raspberry Pi, but it needed to be rebooted about once a month. Now I'm running it on an $80 mini computer that I bought off Amazon, and it runs like a charm."", ""matheson993: Mine is running in home assistant, and I don't use Google assistant but it does say that it is compatible. I do use it with Alexa and that works fine. It also comes with its own RF remote, although the labeling on the RF remote  is pretty bad but you get used to it. And yes, it would know the state at all times. Plus the sonoff wifi controller is dirt cheap.""]"

The problem is that they randomly start flickering and it's hard to reproduce as it doesn't happen all the time.

I have six 75W bulbs on this line, and initially, I was told that the dimmer switch couldn't support them. So, I got a higher 960W one, but the problem persists. These bulbs are on a multi-line/switch, and the only thing I haven't tried is changing the secondary switch.

I have a second line with four light bulbs, and sometimes it happens on these as well. Sometimes it happens on both at the same time, and sometimes it's on one and not the other. I've noticed that sometimes when it happens, if I dim the lights a bit, it'll stop, but sometimes it doesn't help either.

One of the things that make it worse is running the dishwasher, which is on a separate breaker line, so I'm not sure why this would have any effect.

I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or advice on what I could try next to solve this issue. Have any of you experienced anything similar? Any help would be much appreciated!

The remote is using 2 AAA batteries. The idea was to keep the remote wireless if possible and connect the ESP32 to my Home Assistant server so I can control the lights with my phone if needed.

|SW10 - Color Temp. +|4 - 11|

Buttons 7-10 can also be held down, I’m not sure if it's relevant.

Can anyone help me with some cool or out of the box automation with them?
PS- All I have is 3 bulbs and 1 echo dot 4.0"	1	['randomHiker19: Out of the box you should be able to group them into a room (assuming they are all in the same room) and control them together with one voice command (on/off, and level for dimmers). That’s not an automation though.\n\nThe nicest automations with lighting are often motion-based, location-based, and/or schedule based but that does not work for every one’s needs in certain situations. Alexa has some limitations in terms of expressiveness of automations.\n\nWith what you have there you could setup geofencing to turn lights off or on when arriving or leaving, assuming you live by yourself, I’m not sure if Alexa supports multiple users for geofencing when all users leave.\n\nYour echo has a built-in motion sensor (ultrasonic) so you could setup lights to turn on when you enter the room. The trick is knowing when to turn them off, sometimes a period of inactivity can get annoying depending on position. Ideally you could configure it to only turn on lights if dark and motion is detected, but that’s a bit more than Alexa routines can do nicely. You can restrict a routine based on motion to run only within a time window but you cannot set that window relative to sunrise and sunsets meaning it requires adjustments through the year.\n\nYou can set a light to turn on or off during a schedule relative to sunrise or sunset (certain rooms, porch lights, etc) but cannot combine that with another trigger like motion. This works for lights you always want on regardless of what you’re up to.\n\nFor more powerful rules on when things should run you would need a more advanced smart home hub, many of which can also be integrated with Alexa and other devices you have.\n\nIf your Alexa is in your living room and you only walk in there first thing in the morning you could setup it up to play the weather, news, or a pod cast based on motion. You can configure Alexa routines to only run once within a set period of time, that way it only happens once per day.']

I'm in the process of setting up an entertainment center and want to add some custom LED lighting using WS2812B LED strips. I'm aiming for a clean and tidy installation, so I'd love to find a device that combines a power supply and a programmable microcontroller (like an Arduino or ESP32) in a single enclosure.

My requirements are:

1. Power about 10 meters of WS2812B LED strips (I'm fine with using multiple devices if needed).
2. The microcontroller should be programmable and compatible with standard libraries like WLED or FastLED, as I'd like to create custom lighting effects.
3. A single enclosure that houses both the power supply and the microcontroller, to minimize clutter and keep things tidy.
4. Ideally, the device should plug into a standard 115V power outlet.

I've done some research and found a few Wi-Fi-enabled LED strip controllers with integrated power supplies, but most of them don't seem to be programmable in the way I'm looking for. I've also considered building a custom solution by housing a microcontroller and power supply in a custom enclosure, but I'm wondering if there's a more straightforward option available.

Has anyone come across a product that meets these requirements, or do you have any suggestions for a DIY approach that would achieve my goal? I'd appreciate any insights, experiences, or recommendations you may have.

Thanks in advance for your help!"	2	"[""Ninja128: I'd just DIY your own enclosure.

There are multiple glass break detectors and motion detectors in the house as well, in addition to hardwired smoke alarms.

I am retrofitting the system and trying to figure out how many hardwired contact sensors I have that are in use. Some windows have both wired and wireless sensors on them. I assume in those situations, the wired are no longer in use.

Is anyone able to get more insight by looking at the panel? If not, I will test each window individually, but wasn’t sure if experts might be able to offer any other guidance based on panel.

There are seven wires with resistors on them. I don't know why they used that particular method for connecting the resistors to the panel. It would've been easier to use a B connector (small insulated connector that goes over wire connection and is squeezed shut). The resistors are used so that you can tell if the wires are open, closed, or shorted. I can't tell if the phone jack in the bottom right of the panel is connected to panel. I can't see it's not connected to an existing phone line.\n\nYou would need a wireless receiver for the wireless contacts (or possibly motion detectors). Terminals 4-7 are for a keypad or wireless receiver. It looks like you have two wires going to each terminal so you either have two keypads or a keypad and receiver.\n\nYou can look at the keypad and it will indicate what zones are open (not secure). If you have an alpha keypad (shows words) it will make it easier to see what areas are being monitored. The question is would you have the master code to go into programming if needed? An alpha keypad makes it far easier to program the system.\n\nThe second picture shows a wireless device. There are a couple types of them. There would be a magnet connected to a door or window that is near the contact when the door or window is closed. Another version of the wireless contact will let you connect an external contact to it. It just depends on what works best for the situation.\n\nThe bottom picture is just a standard contact, used for doors or windows.\n\nThe main question is whether the alarm system will communicate to an alarm monitoring company (monthly charge), or be a local alarm (with a siren). It may be easier to install a new system that uses wireless communication for the sensors (doors windows, motion).\n\nI used to work for ADT / Tyco and another security company afterwards, and this is an ugly installation.

The reed switch does not appear to be in use.  So it is being used as a wireless transmitter for a wired contact - possibly the one visible on the window above it.  In other words, that window may have a wired contact, but there's a good chance it's being monitored by the panel through that wireless contact mounted below, not via a pair of wires going back to the panel.\n\nAn easy way to tell is to fault that window, and get the panel to tell you which zone was faulted (just look at a keypad if you don't  have voice chime).

While I could add a smart bulb (I have extras) I honestly would rather just do a normal dumb light. My ideal setup is that when I turn on my light switch, both the room light and the lamp (on the other side of the room) would both turn on. The light switch only connects to the room light, not to any outlets. It would bee cool if other devices could also be turned on this way as well. 

Can anyone offer a solution to this problem?

Edit: I don't believe my light switch has a neutral wire, considering that most of my house's outlets isn't grounded. I think this would disqualify some smart switches.

Edit #2: Given the size of my room, I decided to just add a brighter bulb (1500 lumen was the brightest Daylight bulb I could find at the store), which seemed to work out well enough.

But given the advice, the next best option looked to be adding a smart switch and linking it to a smart bulb or plug. Buying an extra module seems to be too expensive compared to a single bulb or plug. 

I was intrigued by the small internal smart switch someone suggested but ultimately went another direction.

I'm looking to replace the Sommweb garage door service with something home/local as it has been constantly failing on and off for few months now...especially weekends !

I have their web/API mini appliance (picture shown) which connects to their APIs and also the mobile app version with same API connection.

I am not the best with electrics so was looking for something which could fire the relevant radio signals at the garages like the remote control does, and then be integrated with Home Assistant /Alexa ? (Rather than being wired into motors of doors)

I would really appreciate if anyone could point me in the right direction as happy to go and research Home Assistant but really not sure on what I need hardware wise to control the doors ?

Thanks in advance.

I have an alarm panel, that has 2 output terminals, 12V DC each, to indicate arm and disarm status. Means when armed, it has 12V DC voltage. When disarmed then no voltage. I'm trying to figure out, how to use this output into my smart home app ( could be anything, apple home, tuya, Ewelink etc etc) 

As far as I'm concerned there are no smart switches that can use a DC voltage as an input signal (not input supply) or even a dry contact as an input , it can only control dry contact outputs. Any ideas? 

For example if I connect an ewelink smart switch ( the Autogate type that accepts 7-32V DC as an input supply) then the switch would only be powered when the alarm is armed and offline (no power) when the alarm is off. And even if it's armed and powered, the status of the switch in the app is non relevant."	10	"['kigmatzomat: You mean the zooz zen17 doesn’t exist?  Shame.

Use the same keywords to see if you can find an equivalent."", 'fredsam25: There are a few types of contact sensors, ones with built-in sensors and ones you are meant to add a sensor to, like a magnetic reed switch or even a physical switch. If you happen to use one with an internal sensor (those are usually small and battery operated), you remove the internal sensor and solder in wires in place that you run to the relay. If you use one with an external sensor/switch, you simply wire the relay in place of the switch. For example, you could use a Shelly 1, and wire the relay output to the SW input.', ""enghong: Hey man, seriously thank you for the reply. I appreciate it so much. I've read up about what you said and I'm listing it down , correct me if I'm wrong. \n\nI found a 12Vdc relay, and it has 2 input terminals, Vcc and grd. I assume that I will need to wire the 12V DC + and 12V DC- from my alarm output terminals to the corresponding vcc and grd of the relay input. [Photo of said relay](https://i.imgur.com/NCe1eeL.jpg)\n\nNext is an aqara door sensor ( or Tuya door sensor) which is battery powered. Like you mentioned, I have to open it up, and solder 2 wires to connect it to the relay. And since the armed mode of the alarm would output 12V DC + , the Aqara sensor should be connected to the  Normally open and Com terminals ?  Or can I just stick the contact sensor onto the relay without wiring? Would it be enough to sense the magnetization of the relay?\n\n[Photo of an aqara door sensor with soldered cables ](https://i.imgur.com/Vi1d5lv.jpg)\n\nWith the above, when the alarm is disarmed, nothing happens, the relay is not energized. Once the alarm has been armed, the relay would be energized, and the Aqara contact sensor would detect the magnetization of the relay, and send a signal to my ZigBee hub, to get a status ? Am I thinking this correctly?\n\nOnce again thank you for the reply"", ""fredsam25: Yes, that relay should work. Almost any 12v relay will work in this application. Yes, wiring to the normally open and com will work. You can also wire to normally closed as well. Either way works, because you are looking for a change in state. You can label either state as you wish. \n\nThe way you have soldered to the sensor is fine. (could probably use some more flux next time, and you want to support those connections mechanically so that they don't get stressed, but electrically, it should work. \n\n> Would it be enough to sense the magnetization of the relay?\n\nThat is an interesting idea. If you wanted to use it in that fashion, you would instead buy an electromagnet instead of a relay. The only limiting factor would be the power the alarm system can deliver. You'd have to look up the alarm system and see what the rating is. Then you'd have to try out some electomagnets to see if they are strong enough to trigger the reed switch. Something like this only pulls ~0.05A (similar to what that relay module pulls):\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3387AA/\n\nYou could also combine the two ideas: alarm triggers relay, relay powers a strong electromagnet (using a secondary power supply), electromagnet triggers sensor. But then you are introducing a lot of points of failure. Not to say it won't work, but you'd need to work out the bugs."", 'enghong: Hey man \n\nI managed to get it sorted. Hooked up a ZigBee smart switch with dry contacts to arm and disarm.\n\nFor the outputs, followed your recommendation, hooked up a 12V DC relay and a ZigBee contact sensor (soldered) and voila, everything works in homekit/tuya. \n\nThanks for the help !', 'enghong: Hey man,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much.

That folks can get them to work with many devices without failure is proof that it\'s possible.  I have both wifi and zigbee - zigbee drops more commands and responds slower than wifi.']"

I’m looking for a remote operated wifi padlock. I want to be able to open an app and press unlock from work, so delivery drivers can drop a parcel inside a porch cupboard.

I need traditional control at the wall over any Smart Control via voice or app. 

I’m leaning towards using halo wiz pro lights because I need recessed lighting in places where there are joists. I could skip smart lights but I like being able to tune the temperature.

The switches have been the harder part. I’m currently using a Pico remote as a scene controller (via HomeKit)  with the wiz retrofits for the evaluation. I’d prefer powered switches where the tradition switches would be installed so it’s easy to transition to future owners someday. The Leviton is one of the few that I could find.

Spezisaweakmale	31	12hka1y	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12hka1y/does_anyone_know_of_any_grocery_inventory/	"I have a picture in my mind of managing my groceries by scanning the barcodes, which go into a database on my home server, and having a tablet that loads the frontend ui for managing groceries, food recipes and expired or about to expire foods. 

So when I buy groceries I can use a barcode scanner to inventory them and keep track of my household groceries.

Does anyone know of anything like this? It could be cloud based, just need help getting pointed in the right direction. From my googling I'm only finding enterprise grocery store POS and inventory management software."	39	"[""Sorry_Sorry_Everyone: I know spending 12 hours developing a solution to save 4 seconds is kinda the premise of this whole subreddit, but this concept seems insane to me. You want to scan barcodes of every single grocery item you buy and then be forced to manually update inventory levels every time you use an ingredient? I don't think barcodes are going to be storing expiration dates (which rarely actually reflect the time the food goes bad) so you're going to be manually inputting that data. Also, the foods most at-risk of expiration (produce, dairy, meats) don't always come with good dates or a barcode so you'll often just be manually inputting some random guess.\n\nI think the idea of this type of inventory management is good in theory but will almost immediately become completely out of date unless you are a wildly disciplined person. \n\nI would instead recommend quick inventory reviews on a regular basis (Weekly for refrigerated items like produce, meat, and dairy; every 3-6 months for frozen items, every 6 months for canned/boxed/jarred items).

6. no DIY (prefered). I don't want to spend days debugging or figuring out how to update without the first party app/bridge (also learned this the hard way ...).

Shouldn't be that challenging right? Well ...

Matter was announced as that next big thing but yet in 2023 it still not there. Phillips Hue has delayed their update till further notice and otherwise you have to guess. 

So the best answer there might be in 2023 is still home assistant.  So let's see what this means:

\- Raspberry Pi can't be bought (business first policy of the pi foundation so no units are avaible for the end user). Meaning Proxmox VM it is. This should allow some fail over and automated backups in case the PC dies or maintance.

\- Little DIY as possible so I will use with the first party hubs instead of the CC2652 or flashing Tasmota.

\- legacy Phillips hue setup so I propably have to continue using this bridge (1.). None of the new lights have E27 bulbs and the other hue lamps are designed to be hue bridge exclusive violating the should work if bridge is down rule.

\- Sonoff switch to convert the dumb light switch into a smart one. Requiring a sonoff bridge (2.) and home assistant addon. 

\- As I am now in the sonoff system I might as well use other sonoff sensors, etc. Not all devices are compatible meaning you have to check  if it is listed as lan/offline compatible.

\- Wait. What about heater thermostat? There is no sonoff option. Looking at what is avaible I find Hama Zigbee. No idea what this but the website has a home assistent guide and meantions tuya. Let's see. Looking at tuya local no word about the zigbee bridge. So I assume it works and just buy it? I assume it doesn't work and look for an alternative? I don't know!

\- What about my legacy xaiomi devices? Either scrap them or use custom firmware which is labled as beta. Yeah ...

\- This isn't the end. For example fire alarm: Instead of hunting down the one beeping device get a low battery notification on your phone/app with the option to let it blink or make noise to find it.  This is the next bridge (4.).

...

\- Assuming one of the manefactureres goes bust and you search Amazon for replacements: Have you ever heared of Luminea, Nedis, Aquara, Aoetec or Moes? I didn't. Searching for \[brand\] \[sensor\] homeasistant propably wouldn't result in answers. So once more you are rying to figure out how to connect the ""smart"" devices or even need to buy another bridge.

Btw. For a complete noob using home assistant wouldn't work either. First they have no idea how to even use a raspberry pi. Second most people want a it just works solution. So the best I could think of is using iOS devices with HomeKit.

Btw. None of those devices support 1000V isolation measurements meaning if this needs to be done all of the smart home devices have to be removed and installed again."	103	"['noslab: Personally I use home assistant and a zigbee2mqtt instance.

It is not a particularly robust ecosystem, but neither is KNX.\n\nI went with zwave and Homeseer. \n\nZwave has multiple manufacturers, is owned/managed by a non-profit, is fully local, 900mhz so no wifi interference, all devices go through 3rd party standards compliance & security tests,  doesn\'t use IP so there\'s zero chance of malware/trojans/botnets/etc and it is backstopped by the security system industry where zwave is used by Vivint, Ring, Honeywell, Alarm.com, etc to control lights, thermostats, pumps, water valves, locks, etc.\n\nI personally own zwave devices for switches, dimmers, smart plugs, smoke/CO detectors, thermostat, motion/temp/light/humidity sensors, garage door controller, door tilt sensor, plugs, power strips, appliance modules (1500w), heavy appliance switch (220v/40A), door sensors, water sensors, RGBW led controllers, door locks, glass break sensors, in-wall controls, remotes, a power monitor, doorbell, siren, NO/NC dry contact relays, and micro double-relays that go behind switches or in wall boxes.  They come from I-have-no-idea-how‐many manufacturers but it\'s at least 2 dozen.  And they all worked. \n\nThere is no zwave app. You pick a zwave hub and use an app that talks to that hub. \n\nI chose homeseer because they have been around 20yrs. In those two decades they make their own zwave dongles, light switches, sensors, etc, giving them more engineering experience than almost anyone else. I can use their standard app, get their custom UI designer to essentially design my own app, or use a 3rd party app of my choice. All automations are local and I can install it on my hardware or buy prebuilt. (Their G3Pi controller is in stock and $134USD right now)  \n\nEven if you aren\'t in the US, their Zwave modules have firmware to change regions so that one controller can work in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, India, Israel, Russia, China, Japan and Korea.

You would lose the free cloud features when the asteroid vaporizes their data center but you could set up your own VPN to maintain remote access until you migrate to a new zwave controller, meaning your device investment isn\'t lost and the system isn\'t bricked.\n\nBut you don\'t know about HomeSeer because it isn\'t Google or Apple, or a kickstarter funded project. Those are the new ""Web3.0 hawtness"", which sucks up all the media attention.\n\nAnd fwiw, I use zwave because it was a one-stop shop.  Do you like knx? Homeseer can run that. Zigbee? That too. If you get the jowihue plugin it can control hue bridges directly, even the 1.0 hub Hue abandoned (assuming Hue didn\'t poison the firmware, of course). Did you buy a non-zigbee sonoff device? It probably uses MQTT and hey, there\'s a plugin for that. \n\nNow, Tuya/Smartlife stuff? Yeah, it has no local API. All cloud interfaces. Homeseer can do that too.  Could tuya shut that down?

Pretty affordable. \n\n> 2. offline: no cloud, no problem\n\nThis is actually why I chose the HomeKit ecosystem. I want all logic to run locally. Hubitat is the same.

1681095326.0	09-Apr-2023 19:55:26	I'm looking for a cheap wifi audio receiver to convert powered speakers into wifi speakers. Does it exist?	esperalegant	9	12h4v63	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12h4v63/im_looking_for_a_cheap_wifi_audio_receiver_to/	"I have a bunch of powered speakers and I want to use them for background music for our cafe. However, I don't want to run audio cables all over the building. There's enough power cables to connect in the speakers so I figured, why not stream audio over the wifi network? 

The problem is, all the solutions I've been able to find are in the range of $100+ per speaker, and since I already have the speakers this is way over budget. I expected to be able to find small cheap wifi modules that I can simply plug into the back of each speaker. But it seems like these don't exist. I know the actual tech, like the wifi and audio chips, should be available for just $10-20 or so if it was a bare circuit board. But I can't find anything like that. Am I looking for an impossible product for some reason? 

Notes: 

* There are several expensive options that involve buying into a brand - Sonos is the obvious one but I'd be looking at about $10k to wire up our cafe since there are several floors. 
* There are also receivers like the [OAW4 Wireless ](https://outlawaudio.com/shop/accessories/39-oaw4-wireless-audio-system.html) but it's $130 to receive the signal for just two speakers. I'd need like ten of them. 
* I would rather do the actual streaming through something I can plug into Home Assistant, but Chromecast is fine too. 
* I'm also open to buying cheap wifi connected speakers and selling off our current batch of speakers. Budget would be about $50 per speaker (it's only playing light classical background music). I can find literally thousands of Bluetooth speakers in the range. I cannot find any wifi speakers.

No response on Hue app even after re-adding to app and changing the zig bee channel (all other lights working normally). I *think* my version of the lightstrip plus is v1. Including a photo of the control box, which has a soldered on power cable going to the power supply and a 6 pin connector to the lightstrip. My first question is how can I know if it’s the lightstrip or control box that has gone caput? I’m pretty sure it’s the control box as I am getting no response when trying to add in the app. Second question is if it is the control box, how can I get a replacement that will work with my existing light strips so I don’t have to spend a fortune replacing everything? I know Phillips doesn’t sell replacement boxes and I can’t seem to find any for sale on eBay or elsewhere. Is one of the more recent versions of the control box compatible with this 6 pin lightstrip that I could switch out? Including a couple photos of the current box and lightstrip connector. Thanks!

Searching on eBay for an exact model was next to none with the closest match being sent from China. YMMV. What I ended up doing was buying a similar Philips plug, same voltage/amp/etc but the plug size was slightly different (most likely from v1 to v2) and since it came with an extension cable, I just cut the end of the v1 with the tailing end of the extension cable, and heat shrink the ends together.\n\nGood luck!']

1681074987.0	09-Apr-2023 14:16:27	The search for the definitive DIY photo frame software	EmotionsAreGay	35	12gw1vi	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12gw1vi/the_search_for_the_definitive_diy_photo_frame/	"I have a large library of art that I would love to use as decoration. Instead of buying expensive prints for a few of my favorites how about setting up a digital photo frame? Seems perfect! Adds variety, lets me see my entire catalogue, even new pieces.

Retail art/photo frames (especially large ones) are [really expensive](https://canvia.art/products/smart-art-digital-frame). The solution? DIY! Raspberry Pi single board computers are very cheap and should be powerful enough to display images on whatever monitor you want. Perfect!

Unfortunately, I've run into quite a stumbling block trying to find quality software.

#Openframe

[Openframe](https://openframe.io/), the photo frame software I found the most about, is as far as I can tell down. Attempting to run it on my pi runs into [ERROR: The server is not available](https://github.com/OpenframeProject/Openframe/issues/93). And the solution would be to rewrite some of the code yourself which kinda defeats the purpose and does not bode well for the project going forward.

#Dynaframe

The next most recommended option I found was [Dynaframe](https://github.com/Geektoolkit/Dynaframe3). While it seems pretty nice, it has a few issues.

1. It seems the newest version is [proprietary software](https://www.patreon.com/Geektoolkit).

2. The [free software version](https://github.com/Geektoolkit/Dynaframe3) is missing [one of the files needed for install](https://github.com/Geektoolkit/Dynaframe3/releases/download/$version/Dynaframe2.zip). Which both means that it's not in a state that is installable currently, and even if it were added back it still suggests this project isn't going to be well supported going forward.

3. It requires a Raspberry Pi 4 to run well, which for one seems excessive for the simplicity of the project and for two good luck finding a Raspberry Pi 4 right now.

#Homebrew

The final option seems to be basically homebrewing a solution using a program like [MagicMirror](https://magicmirror.builders/) and local image files installed on the pi. There quite a [few](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/raspberry-pi-photo-frame) [guides](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-photo-frame/) [out](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Raspberry-Pi-24-Digital-Picture-Photo-Frame/) there on different ways to do this. But

1. This type of solution is going to be by its nature pretty rudimentary, and lacking some of the nicer features one would hope a dedicated piece of software would have

2. Is reinventing the wheel every time someone wants to make a project like this really the best we can do?

3. You'll need to update yourself whenever necessary


#My Holy Grail

So far I've only talked about just getting the thing to work, but for something like this aesthetics is very important. Unfortunately the programs I've seen tent to be rudimentary in that department. My ideal is something like...

[Origami slideshow](https://imgur.com/a/gWyXrgm), which is a preset screen saver style in Mac OS. This is basically my white whale. To my eye, this is the most aesthetically pleasing slideshow I have seen by far. Everything about it speaks to me.

- It uses up the entire screen real estate. Origami does not like to leave space blank, so when images do not exactly align with the space it wants to fill, it resizes and cuts off a bit of the edge of the image rather than leave space blank. IMO this looks a lot better than the alternative.

- It allows for displaying portrait oriented images on a landscape display seamlessly. Most programs would represent a portrait image on a landscape monitor as just a thin slice in the middle, wasting most of the screen. Origami fills that space with other images.

- It has a beautiful (but not too flashy) transition that doesn't distract from the art being displayed

- It's usually displaying multiple images next to each other, which looks really nice, especially on large screens

At this point I'm even considering buying an old Mac mini in order to have this slideshow program, but it just seems like such overkill to buy an entire pc just to run a slideshow.


#Conclusion

It seems options are limited since the major photoframe software packages are less than functional and less than ideal even if they were. Which leaves only homebrew solutions or something drastic like buying old refurbished mac minis.

As far as homebrews go, it seems like Magic Mirror is the best program for this sort of thing and the best way to manage photo libraries on each device is probably writing some sort of sftp script to copy a dictory of image to each device automatically every so often.

I've noticed the C315 has some kind of functionality as a doorbell and intercom.  
For example, it looks like it can integrate with exterior doorbell panels like the Akuvox R20A and serve as a chime with video and 2-way audio communications.

On page 2 of the manual, I see the C315 has connections for an external doorbell push-button as well as an internal relay for gate control. My question is - how does it communicate over ethernet with the R20A? Is there a standard for handling 2-way audio intercom over IP?

The cameras are powered and I have 120v AC easily within reach of all 4 cameras.  Cameras feed to a central DVR that records 24/7. 

It seems there’s been a huge shift since I installed this system and there is not really a direct replacement available. I am trying to understand what to go for for a comparable system.  It seems systems are either mostly POE or full wireless now.  POE isn’t really an option for me as I don’t want to run wires and I’d rather avoid full wireless as I don’t want to deal with batteries and recordings dependent on motion sensors.

I am looking for a zwave ""dimmer"" for my 1500W electric water heater. The idea is to reduce the power consumption of the heater when the surplus from the solar system goes down.

It would be like a light dimmer, but supporting a heavier duty. I have found some manual power regulators but not with automation capabilities.

Any idea where to find one?

Thanks!"	12	"['Zealousideal-Low1448: Obviously more expensive, but there are devices that do this already.

By ""dimming"" the power, you might turn those off or just make the unit not work at all. You\'d want to actually splice is right at the connection to the heater coil itself, not the whole water heater. Then you are just regulating the power to the coil and leaving the safety/monitoring untouched. Having said that, going Z-wave to controlling power output to a high load isn\'t straight forward. You\'d be better off getting a VFD and sending a 4-20mA signal or 0-10V to it.  Now it\'s rather easy to turn a dimmer into a 4-20mA source. You\'ll need to rectify it, and then use some resistors. So then you can use your Z-wave dimmer to control the VFD. VFD will cost ~$50-60, 4-20mA circuit will be $10, and the Z-wave dimmer is your choice but probably $50.', 'ddm2k: Set the temperature lower on the water heater…', ""neonturbo: Your can't dim a water heater, and I don't think there are any dimmers large enough.

I have Mitsubishi hi heat mini splits with various head units using IR remote controls, 5 total in my house, and it’s infuriating walking around the whole house with a remote control individually turning them on and off and adjusting temperatures all day long.

Additionally, this is probably a fault of the head unit itself but the internal thermostats seem faulty, if it’s set to 70F heat, it will just heat all day long up to 78F+ at which point I just manually turn the thing off and let the room cool down to 66F or so and then turn them back on and the cycle starts again.

I can give plenty more detail but, any ideas off the top of your head for the best way to automate this?

Hi all, I have just recently wired up my Nest Thermostat to my old Braemar TH3. 

As I don't have a C wire and have done a thesis amount of research, I bought a 24v transformer instead and wired it into C and R. The two wires from the Braemar have been wired into W and R (combined with the R wire from the transformer).  
Issue now is, that the Nest Thermostat throws an error n253 – 'W wire not detected' and continuously turns on the heater. When I unplug the 24v transformer, the Nest detects the W wire but not the R and C wires, so W wire is present. Does anyone know how to fix my issue? Are my thermostat wires too thin?

The original Bond Bridge worked, and thanks to a helpful coder who made a device driver, I was able to control the shades via my Hubitat.

The Bond Bridge also allowed for control via my Google home devices (voice)... mostly.

I have a small home (about 1200 sq ft), and setup motorized blinds on all 19 windows.

Here is the problem.  Sometimes the google voice command ""Open the master bedroom blinds"" worked (for example), and sometimes it did not.  The remote in the living room worked... but sometimes it ""missed"" one or two of the blinds.  ""Open the master bathroom blinds"" never worked.  You could tell the hub tried to open the shade, but nothing happened.  Sometimes, after multiple tries, it would work.

I got tired of the hit and miss, so I started looking for a better solution.  It turns out Bond offers a more powerful bridge, the **[Bond Bridge Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Motorized-Ceiling-Fireplaces-Ethernet-Compatible/dp/B095J7DDHK/)**.  If you can get past the price ($380), and have ""hit or miss"" results from a Bond Bridge (not pro), this may be a solution for you.

Since installing the Bond Bridge Pro, control over my blinds has been 100% both from Google home devices (via voice) and via the Hubitat hub.

Strangely enough, the remotes are still hit and miss LOL.  In short the Bond Pro works better than a remote in the same room!

Posting this just in case someone is looking for a ""hit and miss"" blind open/close solution."	1	['hmspain: The Bond Bridge Pro has two advantages to the Bond Bridge (as best I can tell);\n\n1. A stronger radio\n2. A physical ethernet connection (rather than relying on the built in wifi)']

Is there any reason to not go with Caseta? 

Nothing too complicated in terms of automation. Want my front porch lights to turn on when the ring doorbell senses motion. Want to have an automation at the end of the night where all my downstairs lights turn off and my stairway light going upstairs turns on. Need to install lamps in some rooms so would like to be able to make those smart too (one thing I saw was using a lamp with a smart plug and being able to use the pico remote which I'd mount at the door to control the lamp via the smart plug. 

I'm quite new to DIY, smart home, just moved into my first home \~6 weeks ago so still learning/slowly building out. Thanks!"	22	"['RiverMando: Lutron has been doing lighting control longer than anyone. That is my vote. They will be around to support the product', ""Windex4Floors: Both are great. I have the original caseta light switches and fan controllers around my house and have only had one problem with the fan controllers in the last 2ish years (a power cut on the switch solved the problem. I think they had an update that caused my controllers to be stuck off.)\n\nI recently purchased an inovelli zigbee switch and wow these things are great too. You get a ton, and I mean a TON, more information and customization from these switches. You have color LED lighting on the switch for notifications, you have a smart bulb mode, you can see the power draw for that light fixture, you can setup multitap actions (double tap, triple tap, hold, single tap, etc...) \n\nOne key difference that you might be interested in is that lutron uses a proprietary communication method for caseta. It's very reliable and it is local, but only lutron caseta stuff will work with lutron caseta stuff. Inovelli on the other hand uses zwave or zigbee and those are standard protocols that other devices in your smart home might use. That means that in the future if you decide to add more zigbee or zwave devices, you can use the existing network that the inovelli devices created to expand and strengthen your network. In my opinion this makes the inovelli more 'future proof' and the better option. \n\nSo far, both the inovelli and lutron have been super reliable and I'd say you can't go wrong with either.

HB2013	3	12dppm5	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12dppm5/any_consequence_in_connecting_a_24v_ac_adapter_to/	"**UPDATE: Connected 24v adapter, everything works great without issue including night vision.**

**As a side note, this camera actually doesn't have ""color night vision"" (as I mentioned below). It has a constant color mode that will have color instead of switching to black and white in low light image - but not with the IR LED on.**

**Nonetheless, regular night vision now works without the choppy image or camera rebooting.**

**Thanks again for the help from u/scottroberts79 and u/xxpor!!**

*Original post:*

**tldr;** Will connecting a 24v ac adapter to a standard 2-in-1 BNC cable to power a 12v/24v camera have any consequence to the cable or otherwise a bad idea?

___________

Longer version:

I own this Hikvision camera, (that is connected to a wired CCTV Hikvision DVR):

https://www.hikvision.com/en/products/Turbo-HD-Products/Turbo-HD-Cameras/Ultra-Series/DS-2CC12D9T-AIT3ZE/

It's now setup to run through the existing **12v power supply** and splitter through a standard 2-in-1 BNC/power cable:

https://www.zositech.com/products/60ft-18m-all-in-one-video-power-cable?variant=43109575000306

**It initially worked fine during the day/outside, but the night vision/IR light resulted in choppy image and camera constantly rebooting.** It apparently needs 24v for night vision.


**When I turned off the IR light function** in the camera menu, it turned out that between the camera's low light sensor and my downstairs neighbor's motion-activated flood light that the **night image is satisfactory and I technically could leave it as-is with a 12v connection**. 

**However**, after the first night's poor performance, I ordered a 24v power supply which is arriving next week.

Specs are: 
- Output Frequency: 50/60HZ 
- AMP: 1A
- Output Voltage: 24
- Input Voltage: 100V-240v

**The camera's specs state ""Power Supply
24 VAC/12 VDC ±30%/PoC.at""**. The power connection at the camera end is a bare wire to male 2.1mm then a female-to-female 2.1mm adapter rated for 12v/24v, connected to the cable's male power connector.

**Is there any consequence to connecting that 24v power supply to the power connection at the cable's DVR end in place of the 12v connection presently connected to the splitter?**

My concern I suppose is really about the BNC cable. Will it overheat or otherwise be a bad idea?

Everything is fine as-is with 12v, but **one of the features of the camera is color in low light** which would require the extra powe. I'd like to try if there is no harm in doing so.

Thanks for any help."	4	['ScottRoberts79: If anything using 24vac will result in less heat in the cables…..', 'HB2013: Thanks a lot  for the reply. \n\nWhy would 24v produce less heat in the cable than 12v?', 'xxpor: for constant power, higher voltage means less current. current is what causes heat (because of the inherent resistance of the wire)\n\nThis is why POE uses such high voltages', 'HB2013: Thank you for the explanation.']

I have an old automated garage door that is operated using a standard RF key fob. I have successfully cloned the signal onto additional learning key fobs but my biggest issue is changing the code.

According to the manufacturer this needs to be done using a master remote that has dip switches that can be used to generate a new code but I do not have this master remote. I cannot get a master remote so that option is out.

I do have a Broadlink RM4 Pro and Home Assistant. And I can import the RF key strings into Home Assistant.

Does anyone know how I might be able to generate a new code which can be sent using the RM4 to teach the garage door a new combination? 

Or can anyone point me to any resource that might show me how to manually edit a Hex code to create a new one?

I've moved into a very old house which has a hot water tank heating system. There's currently no way of knowing the water temperature inside the tank, and I want to be able to visualise this data and potentially have a graph display showing temperature over time.

I have a Raspberry Pi that I'm using as a Pihole server and for smart *heating* control via ZigBee, and would like to use it for this project as well. Only problem is that the hot water tank is in a different room to the Pi, so I would need this solution to be wireless at point of transmission.

My problems:

\- I don't know how that system (multi switch one light) is called so i don't know what to search

\- The switches are clicking and then they go back to the default state so it is something like a trigger button, but normal smart switches turn on and stay on.

From what you've said, it involves a latching relay located in the panel and remote momentary switches that trigger the relay to turn the lights on or off. \n\n\nIf your goal is to add a switch, then you would need to extend the wiring from one of your wall switches to another momentary switch and wire it in parallel with the others. \n\nIf you then want to make the system smart, you could replace the relay with a din rail smart relay that uses momentary switches as well as WiFi to control it. [Here is an example.](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mr9XrI8) look through the images in that device to see the wiring diagram and you will see what I am talking about. This variation is slightly different wiring at the panel than the image I first linked, but whatever device you go with you must follow the manufacturers diagrams. \n\nIf any of the switches close momentarily that will cause the latching relay in the panel to change state and stay that way. [A latching relay is a type of relay that remains in its last switched state after the control signal is removed.](https://youtu.be/CjiaPfmk2rE) Likewise with this device, a WiFi signal will act as a pulse just like the switches create and it will change the relay's state and therefore the lights. \n\nThat is my best interpretation of what you've posted.

We are currently in the second stage of our project, the   practice pitch, and need to gather data that supports our assumptions   and the business's viability, along with financial projections.

Our   survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete, so I would   appreciate anyone willing to support our project by participating in the   survey or even sharing it with others you know!

You’re focusing on the wrong things and teamwork means collaboration. \n\nHere’s a way to trim down and improve your data: \n* You don’t need to know gender; if you insist on having gender then please give a fill in option for “other”\n* Age: You cannot collect data from those under 18, this is an ethics violation and may be a violation of local laws \n* You don’t need to know relationship status, instead ask how many adults are living in the house and how many children are living in the house; if you insist on relationship status then please look at survey standards for this \n* Your salary question is too minute, instead take from tax brackets \n* Current living situation is worded too confusing.

And does it fulfill your needs? "". along with a follow-up question asking if someone who doesn\'t would consider it in the future.\n\nOnce again thank you for your feedback, I appreciate the advice you\'ve written here and the guide you provided. It was a bit tough making this survey, and I\'m sure if you saw the first version made by my teammates you would probably have a heart attack.

I’m more curious about IoT compatibility models and pricing of devices.\n\nYes, I\'d say what is being described is essentially a dashboard for HomeAssistant/Hubitat, etc and is what Amazon and Google have been spending/losing billions trying to do in various ways and haven\'t succeeded. \n\nAlso, for anyone with a decent awareness of smarthome ecosystem, they would give you a 1 on ""interest in becoming a customer"". Becoming a customer means I know what the product is and the price.  If the potential product was described in a lot more detail, they might be able to answer something generic like ""how interested would you be in this type of product"".   Also, and more importantly, some of the questions highlight that your team doesn\'t understand the current smart home ecosystem.  One of the biggest tells is saying that smarthome products ""normally refers to WiFi/Bluetooth based, "".   Talking about the electrical panel, down to the breaker, is a very uncommon and expensive to do, and you don\'t even mention one of the most common smart home items, smart lights or smart switches.', ""None: I appreciate you delving into our business concept, and asking such a robust question! I would like to preface this by stating that this is not a real business (and probably won't ever be) and as such we are not actually experts in the smart home technology industry. And although I am not qualified to answer your questions, I will do my best! (I only have experience working on/building houses, and am learning web development at the moment.)\n\n1. Customers would probably have to purchase the smart devices themselves, and depending on the type of device, either install it themselves or hire a contractor to do it for them.\n2. Upgrading an electrical system is indeed expensive, and I would never recommend anyone do so by themselves unless they are trained to do so. Same for other things such as a security system that would require a lot of skill to install. Other things like HVAC could be done by the user, especially if we make those smart devices easy to install and not as invasive (no need to wire directly into the panel).\n3. The IOT development platform would have to be paid for by our business. (I would prefer building an in-house platform.)\n4. I dislike closed ecosystems that don't let you escape, where the products you bought are useless if you don't like using the software made for it. I think open standards would be best, the customer is already paying for the smart device which we would hopefully make a profit on, but if they want to use a different ecosystem management software then they should be free to do so. Our software would have to have some proprietary features that others wouldn't have so that there is a reason to use our software in the first place though.\n5. I regret not having more questions in the survey, just making it was struggle in the first place considering none of my team members know how to make a survey (and a good one at that), and the complaints I got from them saying its too long (how do you expect us to get the data we need if we don't take it seriously and ask enough questions???). Also the survey primarily needs to determine the market, so that is why there are more demographic questions than about the product itself.\n\nThank you for the question though, I hope I was able to answer at least some of your questions to a satisfying degree. If you have anything else to ask I am more than happy to answer!"", ""None: Thanks for your question!\n\nOur project is required to have a survey that confirms our assumption that there is a market for our product. The survey is meant to determine:\n\n1. Is there a market for this product/service? (is there anyone to sell to?)\n2. Is there demand in that market for this product/service? (does anyone actually want this stuff?)\n3. Is there competition that is already established in this market? (is someone else already selling this stuff?)\n4. What are the demographics of our market? (we need to find the demographic of this market that is most likely to purchase/use our product/service, and by collecting more data points we can make better correlations and extrapolate more accurately.)\n5. How interested would people be in using our product/service? (can we actually find/get customers?)\n6. How much would people be willing to pay for our product/service? (can we actually make money off of this, and how much? also we need this to make our 3 year financial projections.)\n\nEssentially we need to understand how large the market is for our product/service and measure its future growth, along with whether the business can actually be viable and making financial projections which prove that.\n\nAnd I can understand people being weary about this kind of thing, as everyone should be. But we have disabled email collection and you are not required to sign in to take the survey. Also google is free and the easiest to use when it comes to making a form, our professor suggested it so we decided to use it.\n\nIf you have any other questions, I'm more than happy to answer!"", ""None: Thank you for your feedback as well! You are correct that not many would give more than a 1 when asking how interested they are in becoming a customer as I failed to really list out the products we are offering and the capabilities.

(Essentially, I want to be able to install two switches, on two separate circuits, but configure them so that they turn on the opposite circuit. Blame the builder for choosing odd switch positions...)

As I understand it, Matter can model this sort of thing with a device which implements the On/Off cluster as both a client and a server, essentially exposing the switch function and the relay function separately. The default binding would of course be from the device's client cluster (the physical switch) to its own server cluster (the relay connected to the circuit), but the flexibility to reconfigure that would be there.

Does anyone know of such a switch, or how to make one? My current best idea is to hack something up with Tasmota, but I'd much prefer an off-the-shelf solution. (An off-the-shelf Matter-compatible switch with reflashable open-source firmware would also work; I'd be happy just to have the ability to add the functionality myself.)"	2	"['Ninja128: Athom, CloudFree, and Martin Jerry all offer switches pre-flashed with Tasmota out of the box.', ""PoisonWaffle3: Ehh... There are a few ways to do this, but there are pros and cons. \n\nLet's get this out of the way first. My first priority when making anything smart is for it to still work when the network goes down. A smart switch can still be controlled manually, but a button controlling a remote relay can't. And that's what you're really asking for is a remote relay. So I personally wouldn't use this for primary lighting, only accent lighting. \n\nYou basically want to swap which switch controls which light between a pair of switches and lights. I'd personally try to rewire it if possible. Might be easy if one is a three way or if they're in the same junction box, otherwise it might get interesting. \n\nIf you do want to go the home automation route, know that any smart switch is, by default, going to control the circuit it's directly connected to. So what you're looking for is a pair of remotely controlled relays, which will almost certainly require a central hub of some sort to run the automations (I'd suggest HomeAssistant). I would personally look at Shelly brand relays (a Shelly One in each switch box would probably be fine), but skip wiring a switch to the input. Just use a ZigBee/Zwave button, a scene controller, or a smart switch that's only wired to power as an input to toggle the corresponding relay. \n\nI have a few places in my house where I do something similar for accent lighting (again, I would want something more reliable for primary lighting). For example, the pendants in my kitchen were wired to a dumb switch. I replaced the pendant bulbs with Lifx RGBW bulbs, replaced the dumb switch with a smart switch, but didn't wire the bulbs to the output of the switch. Instead, I hardwired the lights permanently on and configured the smart switch to toggle the pendants on and off (an automation in HA). I also set up an automation to turn the pendants on and off with the main kitchen lights, but I can still turn the pendants on and off independently if desired. You would basically wire this up twice, but use Shelly relays instead of smart bulbs (or use smart bulbs if it's only one or two, don't try to run more than a few smart bulbs as primary lighting, they are likely to eventually get out of sync or lag).""]"

Asked this on askanelectrician, crossposting here to see if anyone knows more.

Can't figure out how to get the ZBMINI-L smart switch working with 2-way switch in the UK with no neutral available (I believe this is called 3-way in the US)

The first image is how the light and switches are wired up, tested with multimeter.

I have purchased a couple of dumb switches and a lamp holder to build a simulation of this so I can attempt to get it working in principle without messing with the actual wiring.

Image 2 shows a working setup with my simulation, but the 2 wires in red would be problematic in the real circuit, as they are not available behind the switch where the smart switch would be going, I'd need to run additional cable in the wall, which would be more disruptive than I want this to be.

Is there any way to do this without running additional wires, or am I SOL, as I suspect?

N.B. I have experience with this model of smart switch, worked first time in another room with a 1-way switch.

If a guest won't be there, heat pump is off, but solar still runs to keep the pool warm for possible occupancy in the following days.\n\nFinally, you can add an additional condition that if the pool temp is below a threshold and you'll have guests in 4 days, start running the heat pump continuously. \n\nThis will program for reliability.

Csusko	5	12a9fnr	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12a9fnr/google_home_with_honeywell_security_zwave_and/	"I could use some advice on integrating a variety of IoT devices. My preferred platform is Google Home with Google Hubs as our main HMI. I’ve integrated Lorex WiFi based cameras and just picked up POE exterior cams with a Fusion NVR from Costco. The WiFi cams seems to work OK on the hubs with minimal glitches; going to install the NVR and POE cams after we get back from spring break. 

Here is where I need some help. Over the years I’ve collected a variety of Zwave products; mainly lighting and door locks. This past weekend, I upgraded the panels on an old Honeywell Vista 20P security system that was installed sometime around 2009. I went with the Resido/Honeywell Tuxedo models mainly because of the clean look and inexpensive upgrade buying open box on eBay. It also gave me the ability to use the already hardwired security system. I grabbed one TUXEDOW with Zwave and a 6290W for the secondary panel. It took me way too long to install these over the weekend…thanks only to a friendly Redditor on the security forum or I would have needed to call a pro. 

On to my questions. Can I use the TUXEDOW as a Zwave hub on Google? I can’t find any documentation to support it. My goal would be to avoid buying a bridge but I’m not against it. I ran out of time before I could add anything as I was still troubleshooting some bad security system loops.

It's a zoned ceiling heating/cooling fan setup, with a Siemens RDG100T (or possibly RDG160T, they look exactly alike and I have not yet removed the control unit from the mounting plate as it uses 230V). Sadly, even though these thermostats are advertised as ""smart"", that couldn't be further from the truth... In reality they're incredibly dumb with shitty ""special parameters"" to set up simple things like separate heating/cooling temperature regions, and even the reset function doesn't work perfectly (I've already woken up TWICE to the AC blasting on full at 2am, because the residual heat from below pushed the room into the misconfigured target cooling range).

So, I'd want to replace it with something smart, ideally something controlled from Home Assistant.

The mounting plate of this unit has the following wires:

* L/N for 230V operating voltage
* X1 and X2 multifunction switches (I believe these are not connected)
* M for measuring neutral for sensor and switch (no idea what this means, I'm guessing it's a calibration thing?)
* Q1, Q2 and Q3 - 230V pins for fan speed control (low, medium and high)
* Y1 and Y2 for controlling heating (or cooling?) - 230V
* Y3 and Y4 for controlling cooling (or heating?) - 230V

Google's Nest info sites are super confusing, so I can't really say if it will be compatible or not - some pages show a Heat Link device that has appropriate pins for controlling a single valve, some show it is good for two valves (but both are related to heating), and there's very little info about supporting three-speed fans besides ""call your local pro installer"".

Which smart thermostat would work best for my setup? My main needs are the connection to Home Assistant, and the ability to easily define a ""preferred temp range"" (e.g. ""start heating when it's below 18C, and start cooling when it's above 25C""), and preferably with a nice physical user interface."	3	"[""ProfitEnough825: Ecobee has good threshold controls, plays well with home assistant and is typically semi liked by the HVAC community.

I´m trying to control 5 dimmable puck lights on my camper van.

After some research I found that dismantling an Ikea Tradfri driver board from its power supply to work directly from 12v and pairing it Ikea Tradfri swich seemed to be the best option.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEtmT9ombFE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEtmT9ombFE)

Just prior to install on my campervan did a test with an old PC PSU12v and 1 puck light. I worked perfectly, on/off and dimmer.

 Yesterday I connected to 2 puck lights and plugged in to the van 12v 85Ah engine battery and the board exploded instantly. The chip named RSIM (highlighted on picture) seem to be the one that suffered the most.

What can be the cause? Is it possible to find any cheaper alternative to this dismantled boards compatible with Ikea switches? I read that are based on ZigBee.

I wanted to replace my 2way/3way ""dump"" light switches with smart ones. These smart switches are ones that work without neutral. I chose the Moes star.

The first image shows a ""dumb"" 3way connection. The 2way is the same without the intermediate switch (i.e., 2 wires go from the left switch to the right one). Notice that the left switch has the ""live"" wire while the right one is connected to the lamp.

The smart switch wiring that worked for me is the one in the second image for the 2way. One of the two wires running between the two switches is used to pass the ""live"" to the second switch. So, both of them have a ""live"" input. The second wire is used to connect the outputs of the two switches (L1).

The next step is to add both switches to the Smart Life app and then follow the instructions in the last figure to associate the two switches (once you turn one on, the other will turn on, and vice versa).

I recently started to rework my home network to be a bit more secure and of course, came the question of cameras.

I have 2 wansview Q6 cameras and as long as they had access to internet, everything was working well. I was also using their wansview app with ONVIF control ant it was quite responsive.

Then I started doing some traffic capture and notice that all my cameras traffic was going straight to alibaba cloud then streamed back on my phone app. Not very secure.

But before doing anything, I installed on my homelab Shinobi, to replace their wansview app. So I did and everything was working well as shinobi is getting rtsp flux directly from cameras and support ONVIF commands.   
Then I blocked internet traffic for cameras and things started to fall off.

\- Cameras timestamp are set to Epoch  
\- because of that ONVIF commands are not working anymore (dont know exactly why but from my tests, if camera is a bit desynchronise with current, ONVIF commands take more time to be executed)  
 when doing camera traffic capture, I didnt see any NTP request. I noticed that first thing they do is sendnig DNS request to google, them to some obscure chinese sever, then some TCP/TLS traffic and with that some IGMP request and some HTTP request (to  Host: [htpdate.ajcloud.net](https://htpdate.ajcloud.net) so no NTP, see below for the full request).  


Did anyone of you already played with that ? Any way to make them work offline ?  
If not, any references of ""cheap"" cameras with ONVIF support for offline usage ? (I dont need lot of features, rtsp flux, onvif support, 1080p and that's it as everything else is handle by shinobi)  


Thanks

Span is cloud based, although it does have a local API. Look for details in the home assistant forums. Schneider/Square D is built around the sense monitor, which is cloud based and only works by analyzing your data as compared to everyone else. AFAIK GE and Siemens have no smart options at all. I\'m pretty sure Lumin is also cloud based, although I haven\'t checked for sure, and their product is sort of a smart panel but also not. The only other possibility is Eaton. Eaton offers smart breakers, which have a local API. I don\'t know if they also have cloud functionality, but I would be surprised if they didn\'t. You could check them out, but they seem really expensive if you want to do a whole panel worth.\n\nWhy is everything cloud based? Because a cloud connection is necessary to provide ""virtual power plant"" or ""demand response"" type services to utilities. Everyone is still figuring out the details of how this will work, from both the technological and economic angles, but the basic idea is that we can get by with a smaller, cheaper, more renewable fleet of power plants if the grid operator has some control over the demand side, not just supply. Putting intelligence and internet connections into things that use power is a prerequisite. Who will pay whom how much for this kind of service is still being figured out. \n\nThis doesn\'t have to be disruptive. If done well, a grid operator could pause charging of a few thousand cars for a few  minutes when solar or wind output suddenly drops. Or pre-cool tens of thousands of homes in the morning of a hot day, so that they have less need to run the air conditioning after the sun goes down. \n\nOf course, it could also be done poorly.

I’m just building my HAOS based set up. The NUC has a conbee 2 zigbee stick and I’m just wondering whether it’s worth putting a couple of hue bulbs I have onto that network to facilitate complete house coverage for non hue devices rather than the hue bridge network

What do you think"	10	"['MikeDeansMustard: TL;DR: Only remove your Hue Bridge if:\n\n-\tYou experience interference resulting in delays or non-responsive devices; \n-\tYour Zigbee mesh is weak and you experience delays or non-responsive devices due to this weak signal\n-\tYour Hue Bridge is unreliable for some reason, or you don\'t have a complex network configuration that allows you to remove Internet access from it and you\'re concerned about privacy. \n\nThe Hue app is excellent, and the Bridge is a low-energy, very reliable appliance that enables a more favourable experience to guests or other housemates when directly compared to Home Assistant or another custom solution. \n\n---\n\nI\'ve done exactly this, and yes it greatly strengthened my Zigbee mesh, but for more reasons than just ""adding routers"". \n\nI have a small deployment of Zigbee devices at this stage: 2 thermostats for baseboard heaters upstairs, the hue lights, and a couple of switches and buttons. \n\nI live in an urban condo complex where neighbour RF noise from nearby access points and other IoT networks is moderate. If we look at my 2.4GHz deployment, I have my own APs, Zigbee, Philips Hue Bridge Zigbee, some Bluetooth, and the potential for future clutter if Thread takes off. Add that to whatever bleeds into my unit for the neighbours, and we\'ve got ourselves a recipe for disaster. \n\nI did an environmental analysis on the 2.4GHz space and found that WiFi noise was highest on channel 1. I configured my access points (2 total) to use channel 6 and 11 respectively, removed my Philips Hue Bridge (eliminating an entire Zigbee mesh in the 2.4GHz spectrum), and migrated those lights to my existing Zigbee dongle in Zigbee channel 25.\n\nThis design immediately **eliminated** any delays I previously experienced due to interference, but it also strengthened my Zigbee mesh to my upstairs thermostats and switches greatly.', 'nhorvath: Hue is zigbee so they should relay.', 'ianganderton: So does this mean the hue bridge network bulbs are on a seperate network to the other zigbee devices\n\nMy Hue bridge is hard wired into my router (UniFi UDR). It’s not yet on an IoT VLAN. I’m still in the process of learning about VLANS and planning exactly how I’m going to structure them. \n\nThe bridge should be pretty secure because it’s hardwired uptodate and behind the firewall\n\nMy aim is to have zigbee switches activating light options rather than folks having access to app control', 'MikeDeansMustard: The Zigbee network created by the Hue Bridge does not communicate with any other Zigbee network created by another coordinator. In the case of having a Conbee and Hue Bridge, that results in two completely separate Zigbee networks where the Hue bulbs only extend the Hue-originated Zigbee network, and the devices connected to the Conbee coordinator extend that Zigbee mesh.', 'MikeDeansMustard: >\tdoes this mean the hue bridge network bulbs are on a separate network to the other Zigbee devices?\n\nYes, it does. Your Hue Bridge is the equivalent of your Zigbee USB coordinator, but it\'s proprietary for Hue devices. No devices in the Hue ecosystem can communicate directly to other non-Hue devices without an environment like Apple HomeKit, Home Assistant, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, etc.\n\nIt also means that your Hue bulbs, when connected to the Bridge, do not extend the same Zigbee network that your coordinator-connected devices do.  \n\n>\tThe bridge should be pretty secure because it\'s hardwired up to date behind the firewall\n\nAgreed, but with an asterisk. Being hardwired does not inherently increase security. You have to trust that the software that Philips (or rather, Signify) deploy to the Bridges has no vulnerabilities as it is still a device that communicates to the Internet. That said, this is a tiny tiny risk - like I mentioned before, it\'s a super stable device. The ""privacy"" but I mentioned is entirely separate to this. \n\nRight now, your Hue Bridge has Internet access (with a capital I). This means that this device can receive software updates from the Internet, connect to the Philips Hue cloud service for added features, etc. what\'s this means is that Signify as a company also receives statistics and usage data for all of your activity. This means nothing in terms of security, but this could be seen as a privacy concern to you should you not want Signify to have any of your usage data; completely personal preference. \n\nNow, the Hue Bridge does ship with local control via an API, and this means you can, when you complete your network design, put your Hue Bridge on a non-Internet IoT VLAN and Home Assistant will still safely be able to control all of your Hue Lights via the Bridge and the Home Assistant\'s Hue Integration. \n\n>\tMy aim is to have Zigbee switches activating light options\n\nPerfect! The simplest way to do this:\n\n-\tInstall the Hue integration into Home Assistant. This communicates directly to your Hue Bridge and imports all of your scenes and bulbs without needing any further action. \n-\tIntegrate your switches with whatever means is appropriate, whether an integration, ZHA/Zigbee2MQTT entity, or whatever else. \n-\tCreate any automation you like! Ex. When *action* occurs on *entity*, activate *scene*.', ""nhorvath: Right sorry but if you put the hue bulbs in your normal zigbee network they do mesh with other devices. I think that's what op was asking about."", ""ianganderton: Thanks, really appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions.\n\nI think the hue bridge adds a little bit of useful functionality for the living area and my bedroom but other lights like the hall way, guest bedroom and office dont need it. I think I'll install these on the HAOS zigbee system directly as these will give my HAOS zigbee network good physical distribution\n\nVLANs\n\nWhat VLANS do you have set up for home automation devices?\n\nCan I just create one IoT VLAN then manage device exposure using rules in the UniFi console or is it easier to create separate VLANS for different categories. For instance an Android TV needs access in both directions plus devices on the trusted network might need to talk to it to cast but I'd rather a WIFI plug wasn't exposed at all.\n\nI have a couple of Tapo & kasa plugs I haven't managed/tried to connect yet. They are wifi. I've only used them via the app and in conjunction with Alexa. They were the first IoT devices I purchased. I'm tempted to just sell them to be honest and invest in locally controlled devices"", 'MikeDeansMustard: **Hue Bridge**: \n\nThe usefulness of the Hue Bridge 100% varies from household to household. Some people\'s spouses/other house mates like the use of the Hue app and that in itself is reason enough to keep it alive. That, and the Hue integration into Home Assistant is seamless. It does make managing a small deployment of bulbs simple. Also keep in mind that if you ever want to expand into other Philips Hue devices (like the Sync box), you\'ll have to make sure it\'s compatible with whichever method of integration you\'ve chosen. IIRC certain devices (not including any bulbs) aren\'t easy to incorporate into environments outside of the Hue Bridge.\n\n**VLANs**:\n\nIn terms of VLANs, this is absolutely up to personal preference. \n\n- You don\'t have to create *any* VLANs if you don\'t want to. You can have all of your IoT devices live on the same SSID (note: wireless network) as your computers, phones, etc. and it will all work just fine. This is the simplest setup that requires no advanced administration whatsoever.\n  - The problem with this setup is that it *does* introduce some security concern. If a WiFi-based IoT device has a vulnerability (whether a new vulnerability is discovered, or an IoT device has stopped being supported by the manufacturer because it\'s a previous generation device and now a new vulnerability has been found), this vulnerability now lives on your primary wireless network. If this device has any cloud presence, this makes your entire network the potential ""attack surface"". Any device on the same VLAN (i.e. network) can communicate directly between one another without passing through the firewall. \n  - It also means you cannot easily introduce any granular control to your devices. Does your light switch need to talk to the Internet, or does it just need to open and close your electrical circuit? If all of your IoT devices live on the same network that your phones, computers, televisions, and other Internet-required devices do, it becomes a bit tricky to block your light switch from connecting to the Internet while still allowing your other devices through. VLANs make this much simpler because you can define access rules for entire groups of devices. \n\n- A very common network design works as follows:\n  - **Primary home network**: This network contains your ""trusted"" devices. These are the devices you consider regular devices in your home that you want to have access to most things in your network. Your PC, your phone, maybe other housemates if they\'re going to be accessing IoT devices as well, etc.,\n  - **IoT Network**: This is a network where your IoT devices live. \n      - Your firewall would not allow traffic sourcing from this VLAN into your Home Network VLAN, but it may or may not allow these devices access to the Internet. \n      - You can always create an additional network that denies Internet access, and split your IoT devices between the two depending on which require Internet access for cloud connectivity. For example, my TP-Link Kasa Smart Plug lives in a non-Internet enabled IoT VLAN. Home Assistant has the ability to reach the plug, but the plug has absolutely no need to reach the Internet. The plug just needs to switch on and off, and Home Assistant can do this with local control.\n  - **Guest Network**: This is a network where guest devices connect to. This is the one you would give to friends that come over.\n      - This network **only** allows devices to connect to the Internet.

I just finished installing my level bolt on my main door. Two things, my door is 1 3/8 thick so a bit thinner than what's recommended and the rim cylinder gets blocked by the level lock mechanism, so it doesn't fit properly. I can't tight the screws or plate of my door or else the lock doesn't close or open, I need to let some loose. I posted some pics of the setup and rim cylinder.

So, my question is there a much smaller length of rim cylinder I can buy somewhere so that it fits flush with my door or there's a better system than the level lock? (I live in a condo where they don't allow you to change the configuration of the door, so I have to keep the plate as is)

Thanks

I'm wondering if anyone can provide any info on how to use z-wave-related products. A home that I have recently moved into has a light that I've been told can be dimmed via smartphone. 

I was unable to figure out exactly how to connect to it until I took apart the light and found that a Qubino ""Flush Dimmer 0-10v"" has been installed to it. Having searched this product it also states that I should be able to control it via smartphone, except that I need a z-wave hub. What exactly is the hub that I need to enable this? I have tried to research what I need and it seems there are several options but I already have Google Nest and Bell internet home systems, is it possible to do it through those?

Thanks!"	1	"[""cornellrwilliams: So Z-Wave Hubs require a Z-Wave Chip in them to be able to communicate with other Z-Wave devices.

This is the first place I look when I when I want to learn about Z-Wave product offerings or learn specific information about a device. After a quick search your devices are not listed in the catalogue. This means they don't have a Z-Wave chip in them so you won't be able to control the dimmer with those hubs. \n\nAs far as hub recommendations go there are several options. Here is the list of every Z-Wave Hub you can buy. [https://products.z-wavealliance.org/regions/2/categories/25/products](https://products.z-wavealliance.org/regions/2/categories/25/products). The option with the lowest cost of entry is Home Assistant. You just need a PC to run the software on and a $25 Z-Wave USB dongle like [this one](https://www.thesmartesthouse.com/collections/controllers/products/zooz-usb-700-series-z-wave-plus-s2-stick-zst10-700) to get started. The only downside to Home Assistant is that it may be difficult to setup depending on your skill level.\n\nIf you want a set it and forget solution your best bet would be to use something a Samsung Smart Things Hub or a Hubitat C8. The Hubitat C8 was just released last month so it has the latest a greatest Z-Wave Chip inside of it. I would get that if you plan on adding more devices.""]"

Hello,

So, simplify your setup significantly by unpairing the bulbs from the hue hub, unplug the hue hub and put it up on the shelf with the aeotec range extenders, and re-pair the bulbs directly to the zigbee dongle from within HA.

So, for example, 

\- I add a smart plug to a room

\- I add a remote to that same room

\- I want the remote to control the smart plug

To be more precise, Ikea shipped multiple remotes that all looked essentially the same, apart from the logos embossed on them, for lights, blinds, and sockets. But in old-style Tradfri Ikea you could only use a remote for its designated product class, even though technically there was no reason for this. One of the promises of Dirigera is that it ends this stupidity and you can use any remote where appropriate.

So I have a remote that was originally for Fyrtur blinds. I want to use it with a Tradfri plug. How do I get Ikea to do this? To add some data, 

(a) If you look at the remote in the Smart Home app, it specifically says ""can be used to control lights or plugs""...

(b) If I add a light (and remember this was originally a blinds remote) I CAN link the remote to the light. 

So looks to me like there is a bug in the app. How do I contact the app team to fix this?"	0	[]

Two other buildings isolated from anything else with 4 cameras each [2 inside 2 out].

20 cameras total and all buildings have wifi and a Lan line access. 

They want battery powered wifi cameras they can just switch out power.

POE will give best quality and not crush your existing wifi.\n\nA decent outdoor cam with 4k or higher quality will run you about $50-100 each. You can find wifi devices and POE in that range. If you go wifi, plan to add a handful of extra access points for those cameras. If you go POE, get 5 or 5e cable that is waterproof and UV resistant.', ""mgithens1: I have two Wyzee and four other cameras.

Here's the thing,  I already have almost the exact thing that I need.  I have a Reolink PoE doorbell that allows me to pre-record certain messages and send them out to the Doorbell's speaker from my phone, that works fine.  It also has a little alarm that I can trigger from my phone too, that's cool.  

However, I would like something just like that but for the back of my garage.  I live in a sketchy area and every now and then I will catch someone on my camera system behind the garage doing drugs or they bring prostitutes in their cars and get serviced right in front of my camera, or sometimes they just decide to go ahead and park right on front of my garage, because in this alley, my garage just happens to have the best parking to not block traffic.    


The doorbell thing would work fine for the most part, although something louder would be nice, and I certainly don't need an actual doorbell button.    


But I figured before I spend over $100 on another PoE doorbell, I'd ask here to see if there are maybe other better products already that would be able to manage this.  Ideally I'd like to be able to send a pre-recorded message,  be able to send a live message, be able to send an alarm.  If I could hear what they say, that is a plus, although my cameras already have audio, it's just not great.  

I do have some Blink outdoor cameras that I could technically do some of this with but the audio in those is never great.

I do have a Home Automation VM running in my Unraid server but I am not very familiar with it, currently I just set it up so I could control some lights with my iPhone that do not natively support the iPhone system. But if needed, that's available.

I'm looking to buying a few surveillance cameras, to be handled maybe by some centralized FOSS system, maybe Shinobi or similar. The cameras should not have direct internet access. Hence, I'm looking for cameras that can be compatible with ONVIF (is this a correct pathway?). These cameras are planned to be inside a couple areas inside a home. So ideally we'd like them to be able to move, and capture mic audio, maybe even have speaker function. Which cameras would you recommend for this task? I understand when some cameras such as Reolink are claimed to be ONVIF-compatible, this means they expose RTSP or similar so you can get the video feed, but not the additional controls, is this correct? How do you go about having full control on a non-propietary solution? Which other brands would you suggest? Are Chinese cheap off-brand advisable at all? They seem to offer also ONVIF compatibility, but not sure up to what level.	2	"[""BE_chems: Onvif is one of those terms you have to be careful with as it doesn't say much.\n\nFor indoor cameras, I went for Yi cameras cause they are super cheap, wifi and there is a hacked/custom firmware available for them.\n\nhttps://github.com/TheCrypt0/yi-hack-v4#supported-cameras\n\nThis was a few years ago tho so there may be other/newer custom firmware."", ""rpostwvu: I have Reolink and Amcrest and Dahua cameras.

What solutions have you come up with?"	38	"[""BreakfastBeerz: I use Google WiFi and have two mesh routers.  Right now there are 52 devices connected to it.  This includes 6 computers,  5 smart tvs, 5 cameras, 4 tablets, 3 phones and 2 video game consoles.  I've never had a problem with bandwidth.  Works just fine no matter how many of them are being used.\n\nSo my first inclination is that your network hardware just isn't capable enough to handle it, or, is poorly configured.\n\nThe second thing I'd add, is that on top of those 52 devices, I also have upwards of 40 other smart home devices that are other ZWave or ZigBee.  These two protocols are designed for home automation and are low power, low bandwidth devices that aren't using WiFi at all so they don't affect the network.  I know you said you would prefer not to change any devices, but it's something you may want to look into if you're serious about having a smart home and expect to continue to add more devices.  Wifi is designed for high data usage, there's no reason to tax it with low data devices."", 'kigmatzomat: I would start with diagnosing the root issue. Are the wifi connections dropping? is the router refusing to respond to specific devices?  Is it always the same devices? Is it the same parts of the home?  Does it affect multiple/all devices at a time? Is the router killing everything at the same time?  Does it seem fine for several days then ""just go bad""?\n\nAs for how people avoid this? Well, I have 80+ connected devices that are zwave so they don\'t touch the router because they build their own 900mhz mesh. That would involve replacing the lights, locks, smartplugs and thermostat so it\'s not an easy choice. On the other hand, putting in Ubiquiti hardware is also not an easy choice.', ""ChoiceFood: A cheaper solution is to just buy a better router assuming you already have a router if you don't and you're using your ISP modem/router combo then many routers are far, far better equipped to handle the network devices you have on your network. You could even get one second hand, all it takes is a call to your ISP to get them to switch the modem router into just modem mode (the newer ones you can do it yourself by clicking the option in the ip webpage).\n\nI personally use Orbi routers that are like 5 or more years old now. Usually have 30 devices connected at a time and it's fine.\n\nEdit: would like to add that I have had 51 devices connected at once and it was still fine.

A weekly restart helps by cleaning it up internally.\n\nAdd an old or low end router/AP close to some of your IoT devices.  It doesn't need to be too far from your main router.  A fixed channel separate from your main is a good choice.  Use a unique SSID on 2.4GHz, narrow band, no QoS, no DHCP.  Move 20 or so IoT devices to it so you know where they connect and so they can't jump to other APs on the mesh.\n\nMove all of your higher end devices (phones, pc/laptop, tablets, cameras that can) to 5GHz only unless you have range/coverage issues."", ""w0lfiesmith: Matter won't fix anything for you, it just means devices are more broadly compatible (basically, more HomeKit compatibility).

If you need more WiFi coverage than a single router can provide, you should look at Unifi, which separates out the access points from the controller/routing part.

Makes AP swapping in a mesh network faster. Not supported by Nest devices.

Disable if compatibility is a concern.*\n\n*MU-MiMo (Multi-user, multiple-input, multiple-output) - allows for simultaneous device comms during downlinking. (and in rare cases works for uplinking too on some wifi 6 bands)*\n\n*OFDMA (orthogonal frequency-division multiple access) - Another Wifi 6 tool for allowing multiple devices to communicate at the same time to an AP.*\n\n*Key Rotation - A security feature, maybe double it if you're finding wifi sputters while streaming?*\n\n*DTIM (Delivery Traffic Indication Message) - dtermines when your device is awake or asleep. Lowering it from 4 ro 3/2/1 consumes more power but makes things more snappy? (lower number hurts wireless device battery)*\n\n*Multicast Translation - Makes one-to-many packets better. Enable for better compatiblity.*\n\n*DFS ( Dynamic Frequency Selection) - Allows my wifi to use a range of 5ghz radio that's usually reserved for the feds. If the AP detects a DFS signal externally and your device is using DFS, it'll cut your device connection and switch the device. Potentially causing a 'service blip'.*\n\n*Channels and WoWLAN: Set to fixed (6 in this case) as you can't wake a device if your channel changes after device sleeps.*\n\n*WPA 1/2/3 (WiFi Protected Access) - wifi password levels of complexity and version. WPA 3 allows the longest and most complex passwords. NOT ideal for IoT smart home stuff.*\n\n(I put this list together overnight and so take it with a pinch of salt)"", ""bsancken: I would hope the ones acting as APs are actually set to work as APs.

Narrow band and spreading clients around SSIDs were the best for me.  WPA2 and N only when possible (most low end devices are this).  Disabling band steering and WMM helps.  Sometimes mesh systems can be a problem - IoT devices often don\'t always connect to the best AP and suffer from weak signal strength.\n\nThe net of it is that IoT devices use low end wifi chips that struggle with the speed/connectivity optimizations imposed by newer routers, often getting disconnected and failing to recover.  Dedicating an SSID and channel (or 2 or 3) to them with conservative settings doesn\'t impact your main network even if they overlap, and in many cases a dedicated wifi AP is cheaper and has a longer range than a zigbee hub with a sparse mesh.\n\nLikely the downvoter never tried it so really has no idea except for disinformation they\'ve read online...

Humidity:   Reduce fresh air intake during periods of extreme (high or low) humidity, for comfort, to avoid large changes to indoor humidity.  But not if CO2 is already high.\n3. Temperature:  Reduce fresh intake also during periods of extreme temperature, to avoid large indoor temperature swings and corresponding heating/cooling cost.  But, not if CO2 is already high.  \n\nThe Oxygen level is most important, since the O2 level is a safety thing, and the others are just for comfort and cost.  People and animals need a certain amount of oxygen.  Too little oxygen, or too much CO2, makes people sleepy.   Airborne disease (covid) transmission is also reduced by lots of fresh air (measured by low CO2 levels) because you are not inhaling air that someone else just exhaled.  \n\nA good controller should measure the CO2 level, and the humidity and temperature of the intake air, to keep all three within bounds.     \nMost residential thermostats do not measure all three variables. \n\nReading the manual for that Honeywell Home unit, it is wired in-between the thermostat and the fan control of the AC unit.  It does not measure O2, CO2, or the temperatures.

Maybe in an event hall where crowds gather or a building with an interior vehicle bay, would we monitor CO2 for ventilation control. I don't think this has anything to do with oxygen levels. High CO2 will be uncomfortable by its not aconcern for a residence.\n\n2. Outdoor air intake should be kept at a baseline. If it's cooler outside than in, you can increase outdoor air for free cooling often called economizer mode. It's possible to improve indoor humidity by increasing outdoor airflow but it's more often that you disable economizer based on outdoor air enthalpy to not bring in too much humidity. \n\n3.

quite sure, the question was asked in this or a similar way, but I couldn't find a thread.

Is it possible to get Tapo L900 LED Strip or Tapo bulbs working only on local WiFi?

Both devices are connected to the Tapo Cloud and when sending frequent signals (i.e. to create a flash effect manually), then the cloud is too slow - so commands are lost and therefore only the half of them are executed.  
At least the Strip has a separate WiFI controller in a small box, perhaps a reflashing is possible?

Unfortunately, the switch is near the garage door, so if I were coming from the backyard at night, then I'll have to traverse mostly in darkness to walk all the way to the front to flip the lights.

I think the proper physical way is to install a 3-way switch on near the back end (and convert the existing 2-way to a 3-way if necessary). But this also requires running a long electrical wire between the two switches.

[Left\/new switch would be in the back of the garage, and the middle\/old switch is in the front](https://preview.redd.it/pltiyqw1gxqa1.jpg?width=530&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=857e58ee6062452a86aa96a91405a6b3d8aa06ac)

Then I thought of an idea to upgrading the existing switch to smart switches, so I can simply yell at Alexa or Google to turn on the switch anywhere in the house. Here's what the switch looks like now:

[Current garage light switch](https://preview.redd.it/zdzq52oygxqa1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=49078458f502d6b013ada59db01e86f7241581a2)

However, I believe there are two issues:

1. The electrical box and cover are metal, so it'll significantly diminish wifi signals.
2. The box is probably too small to fit a smart switch (not enough depth?).

I don't care about code or atheistic that much, but obviously it should be still be safe.

So my main question is **what's the best box + cover to accommodate a smart light switch and replace this metal box in my garage?**

Lastly, I do want to mention that I'm totally willing to **combine these two switches into one** since 99% of the time, I flip both of them on at the same time.

Back then the brands I remember were X10, Radionics (which I think was bought out by Bosch), Control4, and Elan.

You want something that you can drop in and can be supported by the manufacturer.  Those DIY solutions, you're mostly on your own if there is a problem.  With the openness of the DIY solutions, there's a plethora of dark tangents of hair pulling to be done with those that will wipe out any of your profits quickly.\n\nIt might be worth your while to contact the big guys like Vivit and Guardian that you could do contract work with installing their systems instead of taking on the overhead of your own company?"", 'evit_cani: I’d say instead look into consulting (think similar to home design).

It\'s less about distance than number of walls, which eat low power radio signals. As for switch vs relay module , a switch is simpler to install but a relay lets you keep your existing switches.

Soon (well as soon as it's released) I will be switching from a Roomba S9 to a Roborock S8 Ultra. The only thing about the new robot that I find to be a downgrade is the lack of a bag full indicator like the Roomba has (iRobot owns the patents and won't share).

So, I am on a mission to create my own sensor. 

I currently use SmartThings to control many other aspects of my house. I also have a Raspberry Pi that I use as a media server, but could also use that if needed. I'm also open to looking at other systems.

My first thought is to buy a pressure sensor off of Amazon and then connect that to a simple open/close sensor that would ""close"" when pressure is detected as the bag fills up. In my simple mind, it seems this could work.

1680165455.0	30-Mar-2023 01:37:35	Need advice on choosing an energy-efficient smart pool heater.	evilcarrier701	20	126gs0z	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/126gs0z/need_advice_on_choosing_an_energyefficient_smart/	"Hey all,

&#x200B;

A year ago, I finally made my childhood dream come true and built a pool in my backyard. Unfortunately, I hardly get to use it as often as I'd like. To be honest, I doubt that I've swum more than fifty times since I had it, and the only ones fully enjoying my pool were my neighbors' kids. The weather is unpredictable where I live, and whenever I have free time to swim, the water temperature isn't the most pleasant, which ruins all the fun as I've never been a fan of cold showers.

&#x200B;

I hope I can find some guidance on this sub because one of the main features I'm interested in is being able to control the heater through my phone or other smart devices. I want a heating system that would allow me to turn on and off the heater quickly, adjust the temperature, and set schedules from my office or while on the go so that I don't have to wait long until the water is warm enough when I get home.

&#x200B;

Also, I'm particularly interested in a heater that is both energy-efficient and cost-effective. I don't want to spend a fortune on heating my pool, but at the same time, I want a heater that does its job fast and is reliable. From what I read about [solar pool heating cost](https://spheralsolar.com/solar-pool-heating-cost/), a system running on green energy seems to be the best option in the long run. Still, I'm open to heaters using gas or an electric heat pump as long as they do their job and don't cost me a kidney every month.

&#x200B;

I'd highly appreciate it if you could share what heating system you're using and if you're pleased with the settings and performance. Also, please let me know if any particular manufacturers or brands should be avoided. The last thing I want is to invest in something that will fail me in a short time.

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance for your help and recommendations."	27	"[""fredsam25: No matter what type of heating you go with, heat pump, solar thermal, or gas, it will not be fast. If you let your pool cool, depending on the size of pool, it'll take a day or a few to heat it up. And then it'll require you to keep heating it or it will cool. Putting a cover on it will DRASTICALLY reduce the heat requirements to keep it warm. That is where I recommend you invest your money, an automated pool cover. In terms of cost, using current natural gas prices, it'll cost $100-300 to heat a pool, depending on the pool size. Obviously, solar thermal will be the cheapest in terms of operating cost, but that will also cost you the most capital to install. It'll also be the slowest method to heat. Heat pump will be in-between gas and solar in terms of capital cost and possibly operating cost. It depends on what your electric costs are, if you have time of use rates/pv installed. \n\nIn summary, nothing will be cheap and fast for pool heating year round. If you install a pool cover that sits on the water, that will heat your pool partially for most of the year and keep it warm. Just get one that can easily be removed, because otherwise you won't use the pool over the hassle."", 'ezfrag2016: I have [one of these on my roof](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/solar-water-heaters) and it is insanely efficient at heating water.

Even when there is no direct sunlight in winter it still manages to take the water temperature halfway to where it needs to be. The rest is topped up by an electric heat exchanger.\n\nI also have a pool and have been wondering about buying another one to heat it so we can extend the pool season. Maybe worth considering…', ""SirEDCaLot: I'd give you three suggestions.  \n\nFirst, as /u/ezfrag2016 suggested, is a solar heater.  This is not the same as you linked- this is a solar water heater, where sunlight directly heats water rather than generating electricity.  \n\nAn electric heat pump is probably the most efficient as far as 'pool heaters' go.  You could also get a gas-fired heater, make sure you get a condensing model (more expensive but also more efficient / less waste heat).  \n\nHowever what you should really consider is an AC refrigerant heat exchanger.  I'm only aware of one company that makes these, [here they are](https://www.hotspotenergy.com/pool-heater/).  Basically it uses the waste heat from your home's AC system to heat the pool.  This both improves the efficiency of your home AC, and also gives you 'free' pool heat (because you're gonna run the AC anyway in the summer)."", 'gillettw: The advice given so far in terms of gas vs heat pump vs solar is all correct. Heat pump and solar are best for maintaining a temperature as they are very slow to raise temperatures. \n\nYou should check out https://www.troublefreepool.com.

But this is all just theory from my point of view.', 'raidflex: The solar cover will have the single biggest impact on holding in the heat.

It is a solar heater.   The water just goes through the panels on the way back to the pool from the pump & filter.  We run a variable speed pump at low speed for extra hours each day, to take advantage of whatever sun is available. \n\nI bought the kit from [https://www.solardirect.com/solar-pool-heaters/](https://www.solardirect.com/solar-pool-heaters/)', ""CookieMons7er: Not sure if this is available in your location but I've been thinking about one of these wifi enabled heat pumps: https://www.zodiac-poolcare.co.uk/heating/heat-pumps/residential-pool-range"", 'PapaKraken: Have you looked into “solar pool heaters”.

That is *massive* thermal inertia. Typical pools range 30-75 cubic meters of water (aka 30.000-75.000 liters) and you want it to be heated, probably, at least a couple of degrees C warmer to call it heated. So you have to put, call it, 50.000 x 2 is 100.000 kilocalories aka 420.000 kilojoules into it. A typical natural gas heater for a very large badly insulated house might be as much as 40kW. Aka 40 kJ per second. So that’s 10.500 seconds of full output *just* to effect the change of 2C, or about three hours.\n\nKeep in mind that that’s burning roughly 25-30 bucks of gas (10 cubic meters aka 350 cubic feet) at current prices where I live.

The biggest North American house feeds I’ve heard of are 220V by 400 amps, aka 88 kW.\n\nIf you were flooring your car for those fifteen minutes, that’s about how much diesel or gasoline you’d be burning. Most cars would be a lot emptier than they started with after running that hard for a while.\n\nAnd then we’ve still only heated it by 2C (almost but not quite 4F).\n\n(I am waiting for someone to point out where I made the calculation error because it actually still *feels* like I’m underestimating the amount of energy by, like, a factor of ten.)', 'olderaccount: How much does it cost to run?

I have found that when it rains a solar cover does indeed help out.  An inch of rain water will usually cause the pool to lose a degree or so, and the solar cover will keep the rain above the pool for a while. When I finally roll up the solar cover the rain water on top will usually be warmer and I won't get the sudden change of temp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reminding me.""]"

Seems like both can be had with wi-fi or zwave. Aside from some small design/size differences, are there any other differences between the two? 

I have vivint (came with the home) and also use Google (thermostats). Since vivint works with Google, I can control thermostats with vivint. Question is do I need the zwave to control the smart lock with vivint, or can I get the lock with the wifi module, connect it to Google, and still be able to control with vivnt? 

Lastly, yale x google nest have their own version of a smart lock which looks similar - anyone know if that can be controlled using vivnt?

Ideally, I would like to be able to control the lock with both vivnt and Google.

There are three sections, and the goal is to have each section lit with it's own controller so that the shelf can have three lights in a theme. For example, the left shelves in Orange, middle in Green, right in Purple.

I've started with the following components:

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071SF1653](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071SF1653) \- LED extension

The wiring goes from the wall to the controller, from the controller to the splitter, one leg of the splitter goes to one LED strip, the other goes through an extension, and then to the other LED strip.

Where I ran into trouble is that once everything is connected, the LED refuses to show Blue. Red, Green, and white are fine, but no Blue.

If I connect each strip to the controller, they work fine.

If I connect the splitter to one LED (either side) it works fine.

If I connect the extension to one LED it works fine.

As soon as I connect the second LED to the splitter, no Blue.

I've swapped out the splitter, extension, and LED strips to make sure no single component is bad, but still got the same result.

I'm not sure what to try next, but this seems like it should work."	3	"['aaahh_wat_man: Have you tried a different extension?

So:

- Shelly dimmer in the last in line switch
- Momentary switches installed next to 3 switch locations for dimming, with a shelly i3 or similar behind (this can be used without a load I think!?)
- automations set to dim the lights using the shelly i3s, and the on off comes from the normal switching mechanisms.

If you had a 4-position switch, you could use the i3 to detect what position it is in, and automate accordingly, but then it would be “wrong” the minute someone changed the dimming from another location, which might be confusing. \n\nIf your wiring supports it (namely you have an always-on hot and neutral in each box) you should be able to install three smart dimmer switches, of which only one has the load, and use home assistant to synchronize their levels.

[A simple n8n sonos automation](https://preview.redd.it/sos7tz89hjqa1.png?width=1737&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3deadc4ff06fb59fab437cf2217094d9ec7ea232)

As I'm a Sonos user, software developer and home automation fan I created a plugin to control my Sonos system using n8n and the official Sonos API.

Possible use cases are:

* Every day at 10pm set the home theater to night mode and enhance dialogs, every morning switch back
* Every morning at 9 turn on TV, start TV playback, group the players and set volume to 30
* If a webhook gets called stop/start the music
* If I receive money on my paypal business account, group all players, set the volume to 50 and play a file from a URL
* many more

I let n8n run on my Synology NAS in a docker container without any issues for about a year, but different setup methods are possible as well.

I'm happy about feedback, pull requests or further ideas on nice automation ideas for your sonos system.

1680031895.0	28-Mar-2023 12:31:35	I'd like to automate the pool heater and pump while we're away for extended periods. Any ideas?	mini_juice	45	124zixo	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/124zixo	"Circuit breakers as follows:

29: Pool Heater
30: Pool Pump
2: House Water Heater

Pic #3 is the older house water heater on/off switch we usually use instead of the circuit breaker.

Pic #4 is stats for the water heater.

This house is in a warm climate. When we ""winterize"" it, we turn off the main water line, pool heater/pump, house water heater, and set the AC usually around 78 or so. When we arrive for a bit, the process reverses.

I can automate the main water line with Z-Wave components and Home Assistant, so what I'm looking for is a way to automate the on/off states of the 50A pool heat and pump circuits, with the 30A water heater being a bonus. I've never seen these breakers enter a tripped state, so based off that I believe the circuits are healthy.

Ideally I'd like to remotely turn on all the devices listed above a few hours before we arrive, then turn them off again when we leave. I have a Home Assistant instance running at another location, so I'm familiar with that, but just a quick glance at the wiring makes it seem like the easiest way to automate would be at the circuit breaker itself.

I'm searching for dimmable RGB LED ceiling panels with adjustable color temperature (CCT), which I can somehow control with MQTT, REST or similar.

Ideally the lamp would support Wifi, but I can also work with ZigBee or Bluetooth.

Does someone know of a panel I can use? Everyone I found so far could only be controlled via remote, proprietary app or Alexa, Google Assistant, etc.

I haven't had a chance to physically try this but I haven't found any posts online about using two Smart Switches/dimmers in a 3 way and maintaining full functionality on both ends. 
I started out converting a 3 way light into a single pole with a smart switch. So the auxiliary switch location becomes 'null' where the traveler is discarded and the other wire is twisted with the load to just pass on the power. 
What's stopping me from putting another smart switch in that null spot, undo the twisted wire, give it the line from the first location, give it the load, and power it up? It'd be a switch controlling power to a switch to a light, but then you'd disable local control of the original master switch in configuration so that the second one always receives power. Set an automation for the first switch to trigger the auxiliary switch. So you're never cutting power to the aux switch. Basically substituting a battery aux switch with a wired powered aux switch.

As I mentioned in the title, I would like to find out how to most sensibly solve the problem of one common smart home system for Siri and Alexa at the same time. The amount of information on the internet is overwhelming and I am not sure if I understood some of the issues correctly...

**Problem:**

I want to share my smart home, so devices, automations and custom commands (by that I mean for example Alexa, do some stuff - where ""do some stuff"" is something that I defined in the Alexa app, for example set volume and play Spotify) between Siri and Alexa at the same time, so from user perspective, I add something in one place and I can refer to that using both assistants. For example ""Siri, do X"" and ""Alexa, do X"".

**Possible solution:**

In my search for a solution, I came across two interesting topics. The first is Homebridge, which completely eliminates the issues of device compatibility, because almost everything can be connected to Alexa, and what cannot be connected to HomeKit will be handled by Homebridge. There are two issues left, automations and custom commands. I think automations are not a problem either because I can set them up in any assistant and everything will work because they are maintenance-free, and it doesn't matter if Siri or Alexa runs it in the background. So the question of custom commands remains, can it be done using Homebridge? **Can I think of Homebridge as a core smart home that will be responsible for managing everything and exposing data to Siri and Alexa? Or more like a tool to import non-HomeKit devices into Siri and nothing else?**

Another topic that seems interesting is the Matter standard. If I understood correctly, it allows you to integrate devices from any manufacturer to any smart system. Nevertheless, it seems to me that these devices must be adapted to this standard, and juxtaposing it with the capabilities of Homebridge, it is probably not something that gives me anything in this case.

Setup I plan to use is quite simple, just some basic stuff, like Hue lights, tv, apple devices, ps5, smart curtains, some tablet control panel, nothing crazy, I still have to reasearch if I can control my PC using VA but that's also a plan. So what would you recommend? I also wonder if using both assistants won't mess with some visual home dashboard, anyone has similar setup?

Thank you for your time"	3	['NorthernMan5: In my setup, I connected everything thru homebridge so I had complete control, and accessibility to my devices.  To achieve this I used homebridge-HomeKit-control for any HomeKit only devices, and everything else homebridge plugins.\n\nFor advanced automations and other custom features I use node-red, and HomeKit-bridged and homebridge-automation.\n\nI then used homebridge-Alexa to expose everything to Alexa.', 'cr0ft: Kinky.', 'randomHiker19: Here’s my setup to span those two ecosystems:\n\nI have a lot of devices that natively support both HomeKit and Alexa ecosystems (Lutron Caseta devices for lights, fans, etc). Anything that can connect directly to both ecosystems I connect.\n\nSecondly, I use Hubitat as my primary smart hub that is aware of all my devices, even those that HomeKit or Alexa do not know about natively. Through Hubitat I can expose devices to Alexa with a built-in app, and they just recently added the same capability for HomeKit. I’m still using Hoobs (based on homebridge) to expose Hubitat devices to HomeKit since I set that up prior to their newer software updates - I’ll look into switching soon.\n\nWith this setup my automations are on my Hubitat hub and if want to explicitly trigger one with say a voice command instead of motion or other events, then I would I would create a virtual button that I can invoke like turning on a switch in both ecosystems. Hubitat is setup to trigger an automation on that virtual button press. For example, I have my Alexa setup that if I tell it “bed time”, it will flip a virtual switch that will fire an automation that turns off most stuff in the house and lights a path to my bedroom, where the lights turn off behind me on motion events. That controls even my TV and Zwave devices that Alexa knows nothing about natively.\n\nOn matter, it is supposed to make it easier to find devices that work in your preferred ecosystem but rollout is uneven at this time (just getting started). You can associate a matter device with multiple ecosystems simultaneously from some YouTube videos I’ve seen. The Hubitat c8 hub just released is supposed to be adding thread/matter support soon according to them. Outside of that I don’t think any Alexa devices have support yet, but many Apple devices do.']

And I gotta say, the ideas were about as dry as the desert. All they had was a measly door sensor. So, I thought, why not breathe some life into that old thread with some new thoughts?

I decided to go with an ESP32 DevKitv1 and a magnetic reed switch for the door. But then I had a lightbulb moment - why not add an LED strip inside the safe and connect it to a solid-state relay? Now, Home Assistant can turn the strip on and off based on the state of the door switch. Talk about a gun safe that's lit!

Living in a high humidity area, I knew I needed to take extra precautions to protect my precious firearms. That's why I turned to my wise gun buddies, who recommended at least 2 heating rods to combat the moisture. And to make sure everything was just right, I threw in a DHT22 to monitor the temperature and humidity. And get this - my solid-state relay had not one, not two, but three switches on it. So I thought, why not be fancy and only turn on the heating rods when the humidity gets dangerously high? I mean, what's the point of having a smart gun safe if it can't also save your guns from a sauna?

But I'm always open to feedback, especially from the Reddit community. What do you think of my gun safe upgrades? What would you do differently? Let's open the door to some smart gun safe ideas!"	18	"['ComfyCome: 1. Set alert when opened. Duh!

It should be \'good enough\' for just sensing ""moist or not"" like this application, but AHT 20/21, HTU 21/31, or SHT C3/30/40 are all much better sensors, and about the same price as a DHT22.\n* The heating rods need to run constantly to work correctly. They don\'t actually remove humidity, they just heat the moist air and keep it moving within the safe using convection currents.

I am both new in reddit and home automation. Until now I just have an Amazon Echo (Gen 4) but I plan to automate my new apartment. I am considering to buy a Yale Assure Lock 2 but I have been reading there is a new communication protocol to be released (Matter) that would allow different brand devices to communicate with each other without complications. Should I buy the basic Yale Assure Lock 2 with Bluetooth without any module and wait for the Matter to be released or should I buy it with the Wifi Module?	15	"[""Ginge_Leader: Since you do not have any other smart home things, and you want a lock now, I would recommend getting the wifi module.\n\nIt will give you the full functionality of the smart features now and if you decide on a platform to manage it you may also be to control whatever features you want from the lock through that.\n\nWith the zwave (and the former zigbee) models you have no smart functionality of the lock directly and are dependent upon whatever hub/app you are using for the features.   I have the previous yale with the zwave module, working the Ring security system, and I only have the most basic lock and status functionality, with some additional lock-scheduling being enable through Alexa.   You can't set up codes or see use of different codes, no proximity unlock, etc.\n\nWith matter, we currently not only don't know how long you will have to wait, we have no idea what features you will get or miss vs. the wifi+bt.   Given Matter is extremely nascent, it will likely be even worse than the current zigbee/zwave functionality and that will be depended on what hub you pair it to.  So even if they release it in the next few months, you might be waiting another year or more to have the functionality that you would have been using the entire time if you had gotten the wifi+BT.    As the saying goes in tech: Never buy based on future promises, only buy if the value is there for you today.\n\nOnly real known downside is that you will have to replace batteries more frequently with wifi (than zigbee or zwave - and we assume Matter as it is basically zibgee+ but won't know for certain until the module is released)."", 'mishakhill: I’d get it bare and wait for the Matter module.

It is about several rooms, which are used regularly for a certain period of time and I was wondering if it is possible to implement thermostats for the heaters which can be linked to my Google Calendar. 

For example, when there is a Google Calendar entry with text ""Room  1"" in the title, the corresponding heater in room 1 will turn on about an hour before or so, so that the room will be warm to the time set in the calender - and of course will turn off again after the calendar entry. 

Another great option would be if the thermostat cannot be operated locally (it is locked for manual adjustements) and can only be adjusted via app or automatically.

Is something like this actually possible?

PC_Speaker	10	123wc6k	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/123wc6k/liftmaster_myq_garage_door_openers_manufactured/	"Does anybody know anything about this strange note on the Chamberlain / liftmaster website:

"" \*Within the US: The myQ Garage, Smart Garage Hub and Smart Garage Control are not intended for use with garage door openers in which the photoelectric sensors located near the bottom of the garage door change power mode (e.g., lights on the sensors turn off after the door is closed), **or any Chamberlain Group opener with a yellow learn button manufactured between 2010 and 2021**. ""

(my emphasis)

When I asked a live chat agent about compatibility, as soon as I gave them the model number the response was a stock paragraph of text about a patent lawsuit. the text also said that as a result, they could not give any advice about using my model of opener with any MyQ accessory but that it 'may' work.

What you quote does sound like they're the ones trying to avoid a patent, though.\n\nEdit, just in case anyone's still looking at this thread and curious about the patent case: Overhead (who makes Genie) got the ITC (which governs imports) to rule that Chamberlain's products infringe some of their patents, so the ITC ordered Chamberlain to stop importing those products. That case is on appeal, with argument scheduled for May '23. In the mean time, Chamberlain has redesigned their products and can import the new versions -- I can't tell from the case what those new versions are or what they changed, but that's probably why the old stuff has virtually disappeared from their website and is only available in the secondary market, and why they won't help set it up.\n\nAs for whether these actually work with those Chamberlain models, it's hard to be sure because Chamberlain's myQ accessory device lineup is a mess and keeps changing, but the products you are referring to are for connecting non-myQ openers to Chamberlain's myQ ecosystem. If you have a recent Chamberlain opener it should already be myQ-enabled, so you would need a different product, or may not need one at all if the opener already has wifi."", ""goj-145: If it has a wireless remote, it works.

Openers with myQ but not WiFi need a bridge to get online. I'm not sure if the products you mentioned do that, but it would be a separate feature from their ability to control non-myQ openers.

The first two mentioned are cheap (a TON of brands/models under $50) BUT can NOT save to local storage on the network that they are connected to (ie. NAS). In regards to storage, A & B can have a sim card or cloud storage (requires a subscription). Additionally, these models have 360 tilt rotation, night vision, and other features. Whereas C, the hardwired models that can save to a local drive but don't pan/tilt are at the minimum around 10x the price and by nature require quite a bit of manual labor to mount and run power to.

Tiwing	11	123pvc0	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/123pvc0/loving_my_new_tapo_c200_cameras/	"I'm totally loving my new Tapo C200 cameras. It's actually shocking the (apparent) quality and features that are built into these things for the measly $40 each (CDN) Amazon price. I spent a LONG time looking for cameras for inside the house - the had to be unobtrusive and had to be completely controllable by Home Assistant. They are a little bigger than I'd like, but perched on top of a bookcase or on top of the kitchen cabinets they fade into the background OK. Sure they are ""only"" 1080p but for short range interior cameras I can't imagine really needing more than that. A few features:

* Pan 360 degrees And 114 degrees Tilt
* Night Vision
* Motion tracking
* Privacy mode - physically shuts off the camera and microphone
* Works without cloud except for setup (still to be totally confirmed, haven't yet blocked internet access for these)
* 2 way voice communication (not yet working, but I think it's my network topology that's the issue)
* Streams RTSP low and high quality streams
* And the total deal-**maker** for me - EXCELLENT and full integration with Home Assistant

[https://www.tp-link.com/ca/home-networking/cloud-camera/tapo-c200/](https://www.tp-link.com/ca/home-networking/cloud-camera/tapo-c200/)

So far I have 3 of them running and a 4th to set up. Remember that these pan and tilt, if you set up stop points in the Tapo app (called ""Marks"" in the app), Home Assistant can send commands to the cameras through the Tapo: Cameras Control integration available in HACS to that point. A little fiddling with automation and scripts has the following working:

1. When alarm is armed ""home night"" or ""away"" the cameras privacy mode is turned off, the monitor LED is turned on, and the cameras move to the position I've called ""Look"". OR, when alarm is triggered, turn them on and go to ""Look"" preset. I've named the presets the same on each camera so it's easier to send commands to multiple cameras at once.
2. When alarm is disarmed, the cameras move to a set point I've called ""Look Away"" (which moves the camera lens so it can't be seen from the room and therefore obviously not taking video), and turns off the LED. A separate automation watches for the LEDs to be turned off and sets ""privacy mode"" one minute later. I'm sure there's a ton of other stuff that can be done, but so far I don't need it. I did it this way because automating privacy mode actually stops the camera from moving so that had to be properly sequenced in HA.
3. Dashboard only shows the camera when privacy mode is off so there isn't  big blank screen where an image should be - using conditional card based on the camera privacy switch.

Of course you can override any of this using the Tapo app if you like for individual control. And probably can directly through Home Assistant if you're creative enough to make a fancy dashboard.

I'm running all the  cameras though zoneminder NVR running in a docker on my unraid box, for now since they handle all of my current exterior cameras too.

Bandwidth usage is surprisingly low for the image quality. Since zoneminder is always getting an rtsp stream (low quality), that's what I see running through my access point on 2.4Ghz. Basement is an active stream, Kitchen and Living Room are set to privacy mode. Basement camera outbound is 182.6 kpbs.

Disclaimer, I've only had these running for a couple of days. But so far super impressed, especially for the price. Highly recommend taking a look at these if you're looking for interior cameras!

And - to whoever put together the TAPO integration for HA, MASSIVE THANK YOU!!!

Due to space limitations I'd like to use a sonoff mini R2 as a simple relay controlled by another device: the other device will provide 220AC live and neutral to the sonoff, that will simply relay one line turning itself on and off depending on the live of the device upstream. I would short the two connectors for the switch so when there's voltage upstream it will turn on and relay one line. When the device upstream doesn't send voltage the sonoff would turn off.

Would this ruin the sonoff? I know that it would be better to use a normal relay for this but it doesn't fit"	6	"['ras_the_elucidator: It’s a bad idea to switch a neutral.

I also have a few Phillips Wiz bulbs in that area as well (for ambient lighting). All of these bulbs are controlled by switches, as any light is. The issue is that my wife and kids like to use switches to turn the lights on and off. Obviously if the switch is in the off position I can’t have Alexa turn it on either via voice or preprogrammed routines. Also if the lights are on but someone (usually me) turns them off using voice commands the next person to try to turn them on (my non tech savvy wife and kids) will most likely use the light switch first. This will actually end up shutting the lights off and now they wont respond to voice commands so I’ll hear yelling from the basement “ALEXA!!! LIGHTS ON!!”

I’d make a bundle but the smart home stuff would be a pain in the ass - esp all the cameras.', 'isitallfromchina: About to go through this in about 5 months and it\'s simple for me.  I thought about this how far or indepth into the HA ecosystem I wanted to go, from an Automation perspective.  What I finally decided on is that I did not want to have a jettson\'s house, I wanted a house that made it comfortable for we who live here (real quality time with my family while I have it and not dail tinkering).  That being said, we knew we would get to a day to sell the house, so here is how I approached it.\n\n1. Everything HAS to be able to work without automation, nothing in the home is a must for automation (lights, alarm, HVAC, Garage, Sprinklers, A/V, Fridge, Washer/Dryer, dish washer, locks, doors) you name it.  It all had to function stand alone.\n2. The system needed to be logged in with generic user names and strong passwords.  Nothing in the cloud that did not need to be.  So every switch, relay that connected appliances, garage and other things, had to be local (MUST).\n3. Network equipment - there had to be a way to leave the existing router/wifi system in tact while changing ownership to the new owners (reconfigured all unify stuff with good nondescript names for changing ownership with strong password or the name itself).\n4. Determine the new tenants technical capabilities - I ask - yeah, I did that at my last home with SmartThings and the new owner wanted to take it over and we worked together for a week remotely turning everything over.  I let them know I will give them a 1 week technical transfer if they have the technical skills and want to to transfer everything to them, but then they are on their own.  Will do that this time as well\n\nThe problem with most people playing around with this stuff is that we become tinkerers.  Not bad, its just that we don\'t look at ""practical"" application of the automation\'s being developed and believe this is something everyone should want and that\'s just not the case.  That includes me, but I value having ""living automation\'s"" - I got past the wife acceptability and started focusing on those things that made sense.  For example:  Do I need to see the status of every darn thing in my house (what\'s the cpu temp of my computer, how many doors are open, list of all lights on a dashboard), graphs on top of graphs of stuff no one but the person developing wants to see.  To a new home owner, unless they are that deep into tech, they won\'t care either and will never want to take a system that looks like the dashboard of the star-trek Enterprise.\n\nBottom line, if I rip it out, the house still works and if I transfer it to someone new, I will show them the way, but it minimized.\n\nAnd as far as the thermostat (it\'s Zwave) so it\'s not tied to an account.  Focus on LOCAL, Minimized to the really true necessities (Like do you need a garage door on the second floor?  Some may want it, but can then later sell that home).\n\nEDIT:  I just had to add something about Dashboards.  I am not knocking those that want to have all the pretty colors, transitions from day to night, HACs, Nodered, custom Icons, but as part of the KISS method, I chose to stay solely with HA eco system, without major customization.  Yeah, I have a dashboard, but it does not rely on any non HA incorporated solution.  If all the stuff from HAC was added to HA, I\'d be right on board, but I just knew that for full acceptability, I had to keep the focus on out of the box solutions and I found it pretty simple with a little help from others.  KISS is always a life altering effort!!!', 'captnmr: I think you are overthinking this. This was my exit strategy...\n\n* Light switches work manually. The fact that they also have z-wave doesn\'t matter. The buyer knew and was excited about it though...\n* Ring doorbell. There\'s a QR code that the new homeowner can scan if they want to. Or not and it doesn\'t matter because you push the button and the doorbell goes ""Ding"". \n* Security cameras were left as is. I wrote the IP range and password for them for the new owner but it also didn\'t matter because they can always do a reset\n* Smart door locks? They also accept a key so don\'t care. New owner can look them up and reset or just remove the batteries if they are worried.\n* Smart Thermostat is the only tricky one. I personally took mine with me because it wasn\'t too old. I replaced it with a $20 7-day programmable thermostat that I didn\'t program. If I wanted to leave it at the house, I would probably create a ""house account"" like 123maintst@gmail. com and bind the thermostat to that account. Give the username/password to the homeowner and recommend they transfer it to their own email. I wouldn\'t set ANYTHING on that account; I\'d let it 100% on ""manual"".\n* Networking stuff. Left the ceiling-mounted access points because I didn\'t want to patch the ceiling. They terminate at a patch panel in the master walk-in closer where the rest of the house electronics were installed by the builder (Network, phone, alarm, cable, etc). I did factory reset them before we left but didn\'t have to. If the new owner wants to use them, they can reset them.\n\nWhen you buy a house, it\'s as-is.

I use HomeKit and was going to buy a new fan but all HomeKit fans I saw are 50 plus inches. Wife says that will be too big for bedroom. I’m looking for controllers to put in fan canopy but haven’t found any for HomeKit. I’m also looking for wall switches. The problem with that is that I don’t have a neutral wire and looks like they all need that. 

Don’t want to deal with home assistant or the likes. 

I do use Aqara so if I can find a work around with them it’s fine. 
My current thought is to just use a smart light switch to turn it off and on and use smart bulbs to control them separately. So we can turn it on when we walk in room for bed. And we get in bed ask Siri to turn off the lights. We have Phillips Hue bulbs , they remember their last state as power goes on and off so that may work as a workaround.

Water pump (450W) that's connected to a [water level switch](https://ibb.co/yFr7qcN) on the water tank—the level switch is a basic toggle switch with two live wires just like a light switch, it will turn the pump when the water level is low and off when high.

Recently, I [installed a new irrigation line](https://ibb.co/VLwZjP4) with [Tuya smart valve controller](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10000055519067.html) on the irrigation valve. I want the pump to operate as usual and also when the irrigation valve is opened/closed. Currently, I have to manually plug and unplug the water pump to another outlet to override the level switch when I water the plants.

I'm considering using a Sonoff DUALR3. I have [created a schematic](https://ibb.co/mvqxRHn) that shows how I plan to connect the Sonoff DUALR3 to the pump and the water level switch. However, I'm not sure if this is the best solution. I'm open to suggestions on other devices or methods that could achieve my goal more efficiently.

Only the media player in Home Assistant will turn off!\n\nAny idea what component is giving you the option? With some televisions you can turn off the TV via an integration and that’ll send the proper command to the AppleTV to shut down, but my particular TV doesn’t work correctly.\n\nIf yours works, I’d be curious to see exactly why. I’ve been trying to crack that nut for a while now and don’t really want to put the effort in for a janky mixture of IR retransmitters in three separate rooms to get it to work.', '400HPMustang: Well I know it’s the Apple TV integration that’s giving me the turn off option. That’s specifically giving me control of that device and nothing else.', 'Blitherakt: Gotcha. Yeah. The “Turn Off” option just pauses and mutes on all of my devices.\n\nAh, well.

I could replace every television with one that has proper support under HA _and_ is confirmed to properly pause/stop playback on the AppleTV devices for whatever show we were watching, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to not want to spend multiple thousands of dollars to work around Apple not exposing a feature that is _already present_ in their hardware.', 'Separate-Effective77: Why not just turn the TV off instead of the AppleTV? An IR hub or just a smart switch to kill power.', 'Blitherakt: I mentioned it in other parts of the thread, but explicitly stated: the behavior of the AppleTV is inconsistent when the “turn off” action doesn’t initiate with the AppleTV. I have one TV where everything works fine, and two others that just turn the television off without the AppleTV noticing.\n\nWhen you’re in the middle of watching an episode of something, the devices that don‘t communicate properly with AppleTV just keep playing whatever you had going when the TV was shut off. This can do anything from running through 8 hours of whatever current series you’re watching all the way to going multiple days through the “Watch Next” list and marking every single movie, series, episode, and documentary that you’ve been waiting to watch as watched already.\n\nIt’s annoying, and it’s a user experience problem I’d like to solve. Home automation should be unobtrusive and just Do What I Mean. The disconnect in actions means that I can never be sure it’s doing what I mean, and either have to do it manually (contrary to the goal of automating the home) or verify that it actually did what I mean (contrary to the “automation” part of home automation.)\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk. :)']

I recently rented an apartment with Somfy Smoove wall mounted switches to control the shutters. The previous tenant didn't leave any instructions, nor does the landlord.

Sometimes they just have a red light on and I ""reload"" the switch by holding the up and down buttons simultaneously. But what's driving me crazy is that after 1+ month they started to open/close automatically during the night! The timing seems random to me, but it is very annoying and I now have only one option—to shut it down with the kill switch every night.

I can see that the system is behaving incorrectly, but I can't find any reliable instructions for my model and I can't fix it myself. 

Do you have any ideas on how to set it up properly?

JustOneGreenGrape	17	122j4bk	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/122j4bk/just_starting_out_with_home_automation_have_made/	"Over the past couple of years I've bought Calex Smart bulbs, Calex camera's and 'TCP Smart' plugs.

It all works ok but I recently switched from BT to Virgin for internet and, of course, everything is cloud and everything stopped working.

**Are there any guides anywhere which will take someone through setting up an in-house home automation setup which does not use cloud based services?** Not talking about 'Here, read this 20 page document on ZigBee and then watch this 40 min video on top 5 smart cameras'. I don't want to be a smart home expert.

I have Alexa in most rooms but am happy to put another solution alongside it. I have a few spare laptops which can be repurposed to drive the solution. I'm happy to sell my current smart plugs, bulbs and camera and get something which will talk to an in-house system. 

So what I am looking for is:

What software/server do I have locally to run a smart home? 

What plugs do I use? Am I able to reflash the equipment I already have? I think Calex and TCP Smart use 'Tuya', does this mean anything?

What camera's can I get which do not need a cloud service to work? What is the best DVR software these days? (I had camera's years ago which you just put in their IP address and could see the feed. I also had some cheap software that I could give the IP address to and it would record and alert me. This was over 10 years ago. We have gone backwards!)"	17	"['Eyes_and_teeth: Trying to ""roll your own"" smart home automation network and trying to integrate equipment meant to run on a proprietary cloud setup kinda means you need to be willing to become a smart home expert enough to be willing to read a little bit and/or watch a few videos.', ""goj-145: There is zero reason why switching ISPs caused any change in your home network.

You can buy a prebuilt system from Homeseer or load it to your own laptop. You will likely need an external drive for video storage though.\n\nJustifications:\n\n* Zwave is a non-ip based mesh automation standard that is also used by security systems (ring, vivint, alarm.com, etc) with a variety of manufacturers. It is always local, never cloud, cannot contain malware or spyware. Devices are always certified to be compliant and meet security specs by the non-profit that manages the standard. It has the highest ""just works"" factor. If it didn\'t security systems wouldn\'t use it.\n* Homeseer has been around for more than 20 years and people are still using 10+ yr old HS2 systems. It has been built for reliability. It also scales, with people having hundreds of connected devices. (I have 80+on mine). It has plugins (drivers) for dozens of technologies and their zwave stack is one of the best, including a lot of management functions you just can\'t get elsewhere. Homeseer also designs their own Zwave radios and devices, so they have more engineering experience in-house than anyone else. Their software runs on windows or Linux, x86 or Pi/arm hosts. It supports basic camera functionality out of the box or plugins exist to link it to Blue Iris. It doesn\'t need the internet but it has plugins to Alexa, Google, iftt, etc so you can leverage those things. It has a standard mobile app, a web portal, and the option to use other apps. You can use them as kiosk tablets in your house or install HSTouch to make super-custom wall controls that can do...well...anything, if you have the time to learn the skills. Video matrices, displays, add a star trek skin, whatever. You will be the limit of what can be done in HSTouch.\n* BlueIris is one of the most popular camera management/video recording software packages out there. It has a ton of features like image recognition and it can be linked to automation systems (i.e. homeseer)\n\nBut seriously, read the wiki. http://reddit.com/r/HomeAutomation/wiki/index/', 'JustOneGreenGrape: Really appreciate the time people have spent replying to this, thank you.

The software moves reasonably fast. eg: Matter just came out, and is everything is starting to change from that.\n\n2. Everything is very hardware-focused, which means it is at the whims of vendors. Sometimes vendors have a local API they kill, making their product go from a solid recommendation to a ""don\'t buy"". Products get discontinued, or have availability problems, or price hikes. New, better products come out that totally obsolete last year\'s ""best"".\n\n3. There is no one ""how to smart home"". Everyone\'s needs are different. House layout, age and wiring, plus your (and co-occupants\') lifestyle and preferences all mean everyone has different requirements and priorities.\n\n3. Writing a guide for this is a _ton_ of work, and because of the above, it\'s outdated within a year or two, at best.\n\nThere\'s not much motivation for writing this, I think, for the people that are capable.

\- Be notified when someone arrives at home. Just haven't yet got around to getting one. Interested in the new Aqara G4 but no RTSP feed or connection to Home Assistant.

**2). Would like to automate but can't (yet)....**

\- Monitor our LPG use. We get our gas via a tank in our garden. It doesn't appear that I can automate monitoring the use of that tank from the research I've done.

\- Create a food list when we throw something away (or get close to being empty on products) I'd like to be able to create an online shopping list.

What was nice is that if the light was off and the module was off, simply turning on the switch would then activate the module to on.  Does anyone know if that still exists or if the z-wave, zigbee or other format will perform the same?  I’ve tried the lamp modules from Mineston but you can only control them through whatever controller you are using and not at the light.  Thanks for the insight.	3	['400HPMustang: I don’t think anything like that exists for a lamp. Smart relays like Shelly and some others allow for physical control of switched lights along with control via the relay but that’s because they have a neutral wire keeping power to the relay.', 'sryan2k1: The insteon plug in modules do this.', 'cornellrwilliams: Yes this feature is available in the Z-Wave Ecosystem. The technical term is called Associations. You can only set up associations once both devices are included into a hub. However once you set them up they will work even if the hub is down.

I am just getting into home automation and I have researched about HomeAssistant and Tuya a bit. I understand that HA is a self-hosted option, but I am not quite sure how Tuya works. Further the more important question I have is that do the devices(bulbs, switches etc.) do either or are you restricted by the technology you choose when you first set it up? I have heard of things like Zigbee, ZWave but I am not quite sure what they are and how to use them

My requirement (for now):

1. I don't want to be constrained in what IOT devices I buy
2. I want to automate my existing devices etc. without having to change them out for new devices
3. I would also like to keep everything local as in no access via the Internet because I have a Wireguard & an OpenVPN server setup that I can connect to and then access everything on my network
4. As of now, the first thing I want to do is automate the garage door to close after 5 mins if it has been left open and it does not sense anything in its way. Also the ability to open and close the door via the phone app.
5. I want to change the switches that control the lights rather than change all bulbs, because I have multiple can lights in pretty much every room and they are controlled via 1 dimmer switch in each room. So it would be cheaper to change 8-10 IOT enabled switches rather than changes 70+ LED bulbs across all rooms and chandeliers.
6. 5 mins after I turn off the TV, I would like the power outlet to be completely ""disconnected"" which could save power draw when devices are still connected to the outlet.

Any recommendations on what products are available to achieve #4, #5 & #6?

I know HA can be installed even on a Raspberry Pi. But I want to install it on a VM or a LXC container because I already have Proxmox and PBS setup which would make it easier for backups etc.  

Questions:

1. The consensus seems to use VM rather than an LXC container although, I wasn't exactly clear why.  Can someone elaborate a little?
2. If I go the VM route, should I use the Linux HA version  or the Generic HA version? What's the difference between the two?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance"	6	"['kigmatzomat: First read the wiki. Will provide a lot of context. \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/HomeAutomation/wiki/index/\n\nNext, you have number of conflicting requests. ""Keep everything local"" is at odds with ""I don\'t want to be constrained in what IOT devices I buy"".  IoT, pretty much by definition, wants to be on the Internet.\n\n* Not all IoT is set up for use in integrated home automation \nMany, if not most, IoT is designed to link back to a cloud server, often intended to be vertically integrated only with other products from the same manufacturer.  Tuya Smartlife wifi devices are all cloud-based with no local API, all automations go through their cloud.\n\nKeep in mind ""wifi"" is only half the stack. You need the APIs & security. Homekit is wifi, tplink is wifi, Matter is wifi, Wemo is wifi, MQTT/Tasmota is wifi, Tuya Smartlife is wifi but none of them communicate with each other except via cloud translators. \n\n\n* Not all home automation is IoT\nZwave, Zigbee, Insteon are not IP based and only operate locally. They are full stack solutions, with everything from the radios to the network security to the command APIs predefined. Sure, they need a hub/controller but *everything* needs a controller. Anything that says it is ""hubless"" means a cloud server where you don\'t own the cloud and the device can be bricked when it goes offline.\n\nAs for garage door & light switches, you have plenty of options once you pick a technology base.', 'PKune2: See /r/homeassistant', ""inxsible_: Thanks for your reply.\n\nI went through some of the articles in the Wiki. Really helpful.\n\nFrom your explanation, maybe then I don't want IOT devices, but rather smart devices that I can control locally. I don't want them directly connecting to any cloud or anything like that. I would just like it to be controllable via the HomeAssistant (or any other) software installed on my Proxmox server. I guess I need to look into ZWave, Zigbee and Insteon then, huh?\n\nLet me read up on those and see what's involved."", 'inxsible_: I will, but the point of the question here was whether there were alternatives to homeassistant or is HA the only thing that can satisfy my requirements.', ""kigmatzomat: The basics of those is get a usb radio/modem you connect to some computer running automation software. That can be a prebuilt hub (e.g. HomeSeer (my favorite), Hubitat, UDI, Insteon, Zooz, Fibaro) or your own pi/PC/server running HomeSeer/HomeAssistant/Openhab/Domitics.\n\nTruth is, until you add cameras or have several dozen devices, you don't need more than any recent Pi. Cameras need more IO than most Pis can provide. And while each connected device doesn't cause that much traffic, once you get several dozen there is constant chatter that can result in lag when the cpu gets behind.\n\nI have Homeseer running on a Win10 celeron SFF pc with 80+ zwave devices and it could go to a few hundred and/or support cameras. Win10 is a bit better for camera than Linux because of Blue Iris, which is probably the best CMS for automation as it can report out motion/person detection.\n\nMost home automation platforms can run multiple technologies. Matter of fact, there is a combined zwave/zigbee USB radio that does both at once. A good controller gives you options to expand. Having said that, nothing works with everything or has a universal level of competence so there are controllers that are better for one tech than another. \n\nI am all-in on zwave, so HomeSeer is a clear leader. They have made their own zwave radios, sensors, lights and zwave software for years, which means they have far more expertise than anyone else. They have been around for more than 20 years. They have become well known for large-scale installs as even their smallest Pi based controller can handle a full 230 zwave devices."", ""PKune2: You are technical enough to tinker with HA to do anything you want. It's the most open and extensible smart home system today, so you won't regret it. \n\nMy setup is a proxmox running HA as a full VM to leverage the add-ons for a simple update management. I also have a LXC container running Portainer with a number of docker containers for other random stuff that require some extra device forwarding (e.g. Coral TPU for Frigate).""]"

I'm planning on putting a recessed outlet box in the wall behind the tablet, and hoping to pair it with an outlet with USB jacks in it. Whichever route I go, the automations will be handled through HomeAssistant. 

I'm in the US with 120V service. 

Ideally my workflow would look like this:  
120V main wiring -> relay -> Outlet with USB 

Alternatively, I could direct wire a charging cable to a 120V/5V converter, and put the relay between the converter and pigtail. 

Ideally, I'd prefer to go with a zigbee or Zwave relay rather than Wifi, but it seems as if Shelly is the only company to make a relay that can handle the 15A load required by code (I'm aware I won't even approach that limit charging a tablet and could undersize my relay, but I'd rather not have that liability if someone unknowingly does something different in the future)

&#x200B;

Any advice?"	2	"['greenskycity: as an electrician and automation enthusiast, my advice is to forgo the relay.  I am assuming this project is for battery maintenance.

The catch, it's a big metal box and the ducting is all foil coated. My basic physics tells me zigbee doesn't work through metal boxes. The box also needs to stay airtight, as that's critical for proper functioning.

Has anybody dealt with this situation before?

I suspect I could probably find a way to get a thin wire through and keep it sealed, but I'm not sure how that helps me, as range extenders need to mesh upstream.

I should note my soldering/DIY stills are limited, so would rather an off the shelf solution, but also wanting to keep cost down and most importantly energy usage to a minimum (this is designed to save energy, pointless expending more on monitoring).

Say you have two thresholds for relative humidity, 40% and 60%, in a bathroom:\n\nRH < 40% = don't run HRV (or run it at minimum speed to keep circulating air)\n\n40% < RH < 60% = run HRV at normal speed\n\nRH > 60% (eg. after taking a shower) = run HRV in boost mode\n\nDuring the heat exchange, the excess moisture in the inside air is condensed and discharged into a drain. The above logic works fine as long as the inside air is warmer or damper than the outside air, because it doesn't account for RH and dew point of the outside air.\n\nRunning HRV in a cool home on a damp summer day will raise the inside RH instead of decreasing it. So an improvement to the control logic described above would be to add outside sensors and compare inside and outside dew point temperatures, to inhibit (or reduce the speed) of the HRV in certain conditions."", '400HPMustang: I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how well it works.

In this post, I will use the therm ""addon"" as a synonym of ""integration"" or ""plugin"".


## Introduction
I've been hostage to my master's thesis advisor for months now. As a little (big) step to get out of this situation (hopefully), I need some suggestion to develop a simple addon for a Smart Home Gateway.


## Constraints
This addon should be something not very complex that could break something in the Smart Home system if not developed carefully.
The error in the code of the addon should be something that could be easily fixed once noticed, but not so easy to catch at a first glance or without debugging. A mistake that a novice programmer could do. Hence, the addon should seem to make its job correctly, but there should be something wrong-ish under the hood.


## Example
The following example is meant to just give an idea of ""how to think"". Of course, unfortunately it does not suit the requirements above.
* An addon that turns a light on and off repeatedly, with a certain rate, until stopped. A possible error here coul be that the addon does not stop when it should or that the rate is not the one specified.
Problems with this idea:
  - This addon could break incandescent bulbs after a decent amount of time. However, do they still exist? lol I don't think that smart bulbs are incandescent bulbs, but led ones.
  - Why such an addon should behave like this? Unjustifiable.
  - How to introduce a wrong rate as a non-evident mistake?
  - If it does not stop, hence the addon is evidently not working correctly"	4	"['ankole_watusi: Do you have a question?', 'ninosanta: I would appreciate any suggestions/ideas about what could be any possible add-on that respects those requirements', 'ankole_watusi: Remote fireplace starter.

Rather than use usb sticks, mqtt, etc its all pretty simple in comparison (the ui is not the most friendly but neither is home assistant too)\n\nI have a mix of automations in both, i find hubitat to be easier/more functional but that's just my personal opinion"", 'ras_the_elucidator: I’ve had HE (Hubitat) C5 and C7. C7 was a major improvement for stability; I’d imagine C8 will w even better. I like the phone app to monitor the temperature and humidity when I’m on the road so my house doesn’t get musty and my instruments don’t dry out. They automations are powerful but sometimes I end up making a scene that contradicts to other processes that I hadn’t considered. For me, I keep things simple and use the hub to augment my automation than give it total control.\n\nThe one thing I’ve figured out is if you don’t want to be dealing with a bunch of glitchy open source code that it’s best to stick to the supported device list that Hubitat provides in their documentation. Some manufacturers make fussy devices; doing searches in the Hubitat user forums will save you time. Idea bunch of people say there’s a major problem with some devices there’s probably some truth to it. \n\nI had issues with the networks when I first started building because I didn’t have enough zigbee and zwave routers on mains power. I got a few Ring repeaters (that also report mains power glitches as a side benefit) and zigbee outlets as needed. The battery life of devices went up and the network issues went down.\n\nThe toughest part is figuring out a good pattern for adding devices (factory reset, exclude, include) to make sure I didn’t have to mess with it over and over. Sometimes it’s also better just to add something as a generic device, create a virtual device, then run automations based on that virtual device.\n\nSetting up your dashboards is really janky with Hubitat. They make it out to be drag and drop WYSIWYG but it’s not intuitive at first. I will say once you get a color scheme and button sizes you like for the interface, take screenshots of those settings to be used for all of your dashboards and also in the event you have to do a rebuild. You can get into the JSON/CSS code depending on your skill level but it’s not necessary.

And because HA is just software, you can very easily upgrade to a new raspberry pi in the future, by simply removing the SD card from one raspberry and putting it in the next one. That's how I upgraded from a 4Gb Raspberry to my current 8 Gb one.\n\nAnd Home Assistant offers a mobile app, which gives you the option to forward ALL the phone's sensors and data, for use in automations. For example, I have an automation for an artificial sunrise, which uses the time of my next alarm as a trigger. That time is automatically forwarded to it by the phone app.\n\nI could never find a way to do that in HE and believe me I tried.""]"

Max-LTV	5	12069mx	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/12069mx/electronic_locks_and_intercom_for_a_big_house/	"I'm somewhat lost in trying to figure out options for a new build. It's a large private house with a home office and a guest suite (not rental, used by visiting family/friends). The house networking and video cameras are Unifi, and the automation platform for lights/sound/climate/shades/etc. is Crestron. The main requirements are as follows:

* No physical keys, except for backup. Main residents open doors with phone (ideal) or access cards/fobs (second best).
* Access logs
* Intercom for main door and guest suite with the ability to answer video calls via mobile device.
* Simpler access readers for some other doors, like office, storage etc.
* Ability to issue temporary pass codes to visitors (so keypads for several doors).
* Simple digital locks for bedrooms, ideally integrated with the rest of the locks. 
* (optional) ideally, garage doors would be controlled by the same system

&#x200B;

The initial plan was to use Unifi door access system everywhere just for the simplicity of one system for everything. But Unifi seems to be retiring the current door access products and the new ones are unproven and unavailable. Also, it does not integrate with Crestron, at least there are no mentions of it that I could find (not sure if that's important. So the integrator is pushing for 2N system, mostly because it integrates with Crestron and they are familiar with it.   


Some things about 2N seem suboptimal, though - for example, they don't have readers that combine Bluetooth and keypad forcing to choose either/or for lesser doors. And for the main intercoms that would mean 3 module versions (camera, keypad, Bluetooth), which are huge. They also do not have simpler digital door locks like Unifi motorized deadbolt option, nethier they have a garage solution. And their intercom apps for mobile devices have very poor reviews, with most reviewers suggesting never buying anything from 2N, which is not confidence-inspiring. Their licensing also leaves a bad taste in the mouth because there are multiple levels of nickel-diming (but that seems typical for the industry).   


I tried looking at other options, but it's so hard to figure out what exactly they can do and what they charge for. Also, most are optimized for multi-tenant apartment complexes, with lots of irrelevant stuff like tenant directories and per-apartment fees.  


It seems like the requirements are closer to the office system than to the multi-unit apartment building.   


Is 2N ok? What else should I consider? Is ""crestron integration"" a big deal/worth it? I do not envision using Crestron native tablets for anything - everything will be done via mobile devices. Unifi access is very compelling on paper but there is no real installation of their new stuff and their current stuff had issues."	1	"[""AffectionateAir2856: IMO, if you have a crestron integrator that knows their stuff then it's a good idea to follow their advice, purely because if something goes wrong and it's not integrated with the Crestron then it can involve a lot of going around the houses before the fault can identitied.\n\n That said there are lots of door entry brands that would work in your situation (Comelit, Elvox, BPT etc)\n\nIf you're UK based, I work for a distributor and can probably advise on an alternative to 2N to hit your features.""]"

I've never installed a light switch before and I've done a ton of research but this part stumps me.

I have a two-gang switch in my bathroom. The left switch turns on the light and fan. The right switch turns on the heater. 

I bought the TOPGREENER Humidity Switch, Motion Sensor Switch. 

My switch that controls the light and fan only has a yellow and black wire. Please see the attached pictures."	5	"['Vlad_the_Homeowner: What\'s your question, how to wire it up?\n\nBased on the photos it looks like you have two hot wires in the box (assuming both the blacks), one on the fan and one on the light, and they\'re not tied together.  It looks like the yellow wire then goes to the fan and the blue wire to the light.  It looks like the red wire just passes through (isn\'t connected to anything in the box).  All that correct?\n\nGet a multimeter, they\'re like $20.  Confirm both the hot wires (it could be that the blue and yellow are hot and the blacks are the traveler to the light/fan).  And check to confirm they\'re on different circuits.  Not sure why they did that.  The switch diagram shows two wires connecting to hot, is that correct?  If so, wire each one independently.  If not, pick one and cap off the other.  Neither of these are big loads, not sure why they had to run two separate circuits.\n\nThe red ""light"" wire on the new switch goes to the blue wire on the current light switch, and the brown ""fan"" wire goes to the yellow wire on the current switch.\n\nGet a \\~6"" piece of white wire and add it into the bunch with other whites.

What's your end goal, to have the light and fan come on by both motion and humidity?  \n\nI've never used that switch but I'd assume the light turns on by motion sensor, and the fan by humidity (or manually, for both).  Since your light and fan are on the same wire you can't separate them.  So you need to determine how you want to control the combo.  It'd probably be best to get a simple motion detector switch instead, but obviously that doesn't work for humidity.  \n\nI wouldn't risk connecting both the fan and light wires on the switch to the yellow, unless you confirm it with the manufacturer.  In theory it'd work to turn both the fan and light on any time it detected motion, or high humidity, or either manual button.  But it'd mean you're applying a voltage to the other wire even when the switch doesn't think it's on (e.g. if it turned on the fan for humidity, you'd be putting 120V on the light leg of the switch as well.  It could be totally fine, or it could damage the switch.""]"

I'm not super concerned with controlling speed remotely, but that would be a nice to have. 

It's currently controlled by light switch connected to a timer switch (which no longer counts down, it just stays on all the time once you turn it past 10 mins).  It can also be toggled off via the light switch.  I have no idea what the fan is rated for, all the stickers that indicated the properties of the fan have faded or been ripped off.  

Speed is controlled by a pull chain attached to the fan motor.

The 2.4GHz channels are 11 for Zigbee and 10 for WiFi, so minimal overlap there.\n\nSome Aqara sensors keep dropping off the Zigbee network, along with intermittent availability of two of the Sonoff routing plugs. Apparently most Aqara and Xiaomi sensors do not implement the full Zigbee protocol, meaning that they cannot dynamically switch routers as the these become unavailable; an Aqara sensor will only ever use the same router or coordinator to which it was originally bound.

I wasn't ever disappointed with the performance of SmartThings, I thought the execution time was fine but now experiencing everything local through HE it's completely different. I also appreciate the full web interface as an option that SmartThings didn't provide. Also, I definitely don't miss the excruciatingly slow ST app.

I liked the value Ikea smart devices have, but was always bummed about how often the hub would stop responding. With Dirigera everything is available and responds instantly even through HomeKit.

* Streams its video via RTSP
* Outdoor rated

What are the opinions and maybe also recommendations on that?"	8	"[""i8beef: D-Shape did seem to get corners a bit better, but still not perfect... but the amount of frustration it'll cause you as it gets caught literally everywhere every single day are simply not worth it.\n\nGo round.\n\nEdit: Also Neato is terrible."", 'Rydeg: I have a big house and the D3 never gets stuck actually now I wanted to upgrade.', 'lifereinspired: I have to agree with all of this.\n\nWe had Neato back when they were more of a leading company at the time and bought the hype about the D shaped vac. It probably did a little better job in some areas. \n\nBut we have a small apartment and never once did it finish vacuuming the place. It would get caught on something and lost EVERY.SINGLE.TIME. We never knew where it was and it was a damn chore to try to find. We did everything we could to make it work but it was far more frustrating than it was helpful. They just aren’t as good as some of the other options out there now - in lots of ways.\n\nGo for something else and don’t worry that it’s round. There are plenty that will do a good job. Roborock generally has really good reviews and there are many others, too.', 'Rydeg: Thanks, the thing is I have a big house and need a robot with a big dust tank. And no mop. That is also a reason O was looking for a neato. \n\nDo you maybe have other cheap recommendations that are vacum robot only with a large dustbin?', 'lifereinspired: I don’t really know of any other inexpensive options with a larger dustbin. TBH, I wouldn’t get a Neato for the large dustbin. In our smaller 2br apartment, the Neato would be filled to capacity in one pass so I don’t see it being a good option for a larger place. We did have a non-shedding doodle dog at the time but given her type of hair, that was not a major contributor. \n\nHonestly, I’d take a look at self emptying options. We tried an early model of these about three years ago and while it had some issues with the design of the auto-empty feature (where it would kind of get plugged up when trying to extract from the dustbin if it got too full), it was still a transformative experience. I’m not sure their current price but if you’re looking for vac only and less expensive, the Shark was getting fairly decent reviews a year or two ago. They were promising to bring “no go lines” to their app at the time but I don’t know whether that happened or not. Basically, I’m not considering a robot vac without self emptying at this point. Otherwise, it’s not really hands-off. You still have to emptying at least after every vac (and with a large place, perhaps more). The self-emptying option will just go and empty itself when needed and then finish up vacuuming, if it gets full before it completes. I do know a lot of companies have been bringing out less expensive self emptying vacs. \n\nThat’s probably not what you were wanting to hear. Sorry about that. I just know how frustrated I became having to empty the bin so often in our place. With your larger house, it will be greatly amplified.', ""Rydeg: First of all thanks for the extensiv review. At the moment I have the Neato D3 with a 0,7L Dustbin and a great app. But this model doesn't have a turning Side-Brush.\n\nI personally think I would then have to clean 2 separate Things if I have a auto empty feature. The large bin and sometime the robot itself and it's filter. I actually found a very good option the Roborock Q7 with a 0,75L bin. But it is round and then we are back to the main problem. \n\nMany reviews say round is better many say D-Shape is better and for the same reasons. \n\nAt the moment my favorite is the Roborock Q7, but there are no resellers in Germany."", 'lifereinspired: No problem. :) \n\nCheck out some YT reviews. One channel I’ve found quite helpful is Vacuum Wars. (I’m not affiliated with it in any way but I’ve watched many of his reviews.) He really works to make the reviews as unbiased as he can and I think he does about as good a job as one could on this. I’m only saying this because I think you’re worrying too much about the round vs D-shape. If there was *that* much of a difference, more companies would be making D-shape.\n\nI didn’t find the self-emptying more to clean. The filter in the vac itself doesn’t have to be cleaned out/washed/changed that often. So, it’s literally just emptying the bin around once a month (on average). But you know what you’re looking for.\n\nHonestly, Roborock has been very highly rated for awhile now. They’ve put a lot of R&D in and their app and navigation has been top for years now. I’ve used both D-shape and round and I cannot say that the D-shape cleaned better in corners, etc than the round one did.\n\nAnyway, I hope you’re able to find a great vac that will do what you’re wanting it to. :)', 'Rydeg: Thank you very much I will have a look into everything and think about it again. :)']"

A few pointers about how to proceed?	flying-benedictus	0	11zaap9	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/11zaap9/running_a_pythonjava_script_in_a_pc_to_turn_onoff/	"I want to make a simple web crawler that reads electricity prices in a public website and turns on/off my electric water boiler to save some energy. I know Python/Java and how to do the web crawling part, but I am a total newbie with home automation. I guess I can buy one of these wireless 220V switches and some kind of gateway that actually bridges to the wifi. What kind  of platform and devices do you recommend for this? Could you give me some pointers? There's so much info about this and I am a bit overwhelmed by info overload, so a few pointers that prune the search tree in this early stage would be really appreciated.

Googling a bit around I kind a lot of stuff that uses raspberry pis etc, but because I need something parsing websites, and I already have a low power fanless PC for torrents and other light stuff, I would rather the logic to run on it (it can run Linux or Windows).

I already have a few IKEA Tradfri bulbs and switches (without gateway) so I lean slightly towards buying one of these IKEA gateways (but they have many: TRÅDFRI gateway, DIRIGERA Hub...) and their wireless switch, so I can reuse what I have if I keep growing the whole thing, but of course, only if it's also a sensible choice wrt what I have in mind.

I've heard that IKEA uses ZigBee behind, which seems to be one of the two big protocols/systems/whatever. But I have read mixed info about whether IKEA stuff is compatible with other ZigBee non-IKEA stuff. 

At least where I live (Denmark), I have a record with non-electronic IKEA products of wanting to buy more of something and finding out it's discontinued, which is very frustrating--I don't know if this can be extrapolated to home automation stuff.

I am in general a bit afraid of spending money on stuff that will lock me into a tech that ends up being dead in a few years, I would like to minimize that risk. I'm also kind of a frugal guy (hence why I am trying to cut the energy bill with this).

If this goes well, I may consider fancier additions such as some kind of IR unit that can control my heatpump, notifications/control from my phone, random lights when away, and more stuff if things go well, but these are longer-term goals. However, if a certain choice for platform/devices makes these extensions easier, I would like to factor it in."	8	"[""cvr24: Home Assistant with the Multiscrape add on could do this.

Are you planning on mainly streaming movies and music from streaming vendors, will you subscribe to cable TV, do you use a streaming box like Apple TV or an Nvidia Shield, do you have a library of CDs, records, Blu-ray?  Your mix of those may change the recommendations.\n\nFor whole home audio including home theater that is not an AV integrator install (eg Crestron Control4), and your planned installation is large enough that it may not be a bad option, you really have Sonos, BlueOS, HEOS and Play-Fi.\n\nIf those four, HEOS and Play-Fi have lagged behind in some ways.  Perfectly serviceable, but not what I would choose.  Sonos has a great app and the best selection of third party streaming integration, but their insistence on home theater being soundbars / virtual Atmos, and their high price for options that are not smart speakers make them less desirable for large whole home installations and more robust home theater systems.\n\nThat leaves BlueOS that can do competent whole home audio with a real home theater setup.  Upfront, it does not have as slick of an app as Sonos, and the app does not have the same integrations with as many streaming vendors that Sonos has, but it does have Airplay2 integration and can be controlled by multiple voice assistants (though IMHO the Sonos voice assistant integrations are much nicer than BlueSounds).  It does support 24bit 192khz hi-res lossless if you subscribe to the right steaming sources, whereas Sonos supports the same bitrate, but if you use the slick Sonos app, I think it will top out at 24bit 48khz.  Not that almost anyone will be able to tell the difference between 48khz and 192khz listening from ceiling speakers though.\n\nFor the Home Theater and Family Room, I would look at a an AV amp/preamp like NAD T 758 V3i.  It has BlueOS integration, so you get your 5.1.4 or 7.2.4 or whatever and you still have integration for whole home audio.  You can also use the zone2 output of the living room T 758 V3i and hook it up to an inexpensive amp to drive the Kitchen ceiling speakers.  A Topping PA3S would suffice for ceiling speakers at ambient listening volumes (and it can still go to levels loud enough to be too loud for a lot of people if you have an efficient ceiling speaker).\n\nThat leaves 4 zones.  I would run the low voltage speaker cables to a central AV / IT closet somewhere (probably the basement), then feed the 4 zones using a NAD CI 580 V2 as the source, and get an inexpensive 8 channel amp of some kind.  On the low end it can range from something like a Dayton Audio MA1260 Multi-Zone 12 Channel Amplifier 60WPC in the $800 range for good ambient listening volumes to a Hypex NC502MP Amplifier, 8-channel in the $2,300 range that would get you to ""reference"" 0 dB volumes easily.\n\nIf you choose to go the Sonos route, then the home theater and family room / kitchen is largely the same, but you would add a Sonos Port to each AV amp/preamp.  For the rest of the zones get 4 Sonos AMPs.', ""addiktion: Here are some alternative solutions that no one has mentioned for their stereo ceiling needs:\n\nAmpliPi, Monoprice 6 zone audio controller. Both of these seem to work great in Home Assistant from what I've read.\n\nIn essence you ceiling speakers will need at least 6 zones. However your theater zone will require a dedicated amplifier and receiver given the amount of channels. How these two intermingle is what you need to figure out. Keeping them separate might make the most sense though but that doesn't mean you cannot push the same sound into both. Your wife and kids can use the panels to play music in the ceiling and you can control the theater portion separate. Most receivers support 2 zones these days but that isn't enough for your needs so having a dedicated amplifier to tie all those ceiling speakers is a good goal. \n\nIf you decide to go the expensive Sonos route you can add Sonos amplifiers to each room for those ceiling speakers. Then you can use their excellent Sonos app that everyone raves about."", 'mackadoo: I did pretty much exactly this about 10 years ago.

Each surround amp is connected to an Nvidia shield and each pair of speakers is connected to a Chromecast audio (connected to the whole house amp). The groupings are done in Google home.\n\nAs others have said, the Google home infrastructure has been a shit show lately so if I want to move, I buy some wiim pros or whatever else is on the market but I don\'t have to buy new amps, which is a substantial difference in cost.

The Lync 6 drives 6 normal stereo zones throughout the house plus an additional 'sub zone' that uses a distinct amp to drive a pair of outdoor speakers on my porch. My primary source for music is a Mac Mini. This outputs 2 channel audio via toslink. I split this off between the Mac Mini and the Lync system and also feed it to each of two home theater systems (each with their own AVR) in the house. These systems, in turn, feed back into the Lync 6 as inputs. \n\nOn the plus side, this allows the 6+1 Lync zones plus both HT zones to play the same stereo audio feed. I run the main HT AVR output back into the Lync system as an input so that it can also play throughout the house.

It also allows a turntable connected to the AVR in one of the HT zones to play everywhere. \n\nUsing toslink for the longer runs between the centrally located Mac Mini and the HT zones means I don't get the sort of interference an  analog signal over wire might pick up. I have bluetooth inputs into the HTD system as well, though they honestly don't get used much.\n\nI like that the infrastructure for this system is pretty flexible. If the HTD gear died today, I'd really just need to replace the amps and switching system. All my speakers and wiring would still work fine. The HTD app works well enough, it is a bit clunky, but allows me to turn zones on and off, adjust volumes and inputs relatively easily.\n\nTheir is some work in sorting out the bi directional bit of getting the signals between the HT zones and the HTD system. I had to use a couple toslink splitters and run an extra DAC between the HT AVR and the Lync to make it all work.

He wants to continue living independently in their condo, which is owned and maintained by my parents, so we can make modifications to the inside. I already worked with my parents to install wifi cameras in all the non-bathroom areas. My mom checks on him every hour via the cameras, and we can see if he forgets to turn off the kitchen sink or the stove or the oven just from the cameras. That being said we do not want to put cameras in the two bathrooms. My mom is still concerned that he may leave the water running, which he has already done recently. So does anyone here know of some kind of standalone, wifi enabled, water flow sensor we can install to the water lines under the sink that can send an alert if the water is running for too long? In my own home I have a Flume strapped to the meter, but we do not have access to the water meter for this condo. I know there are other products that can detect continuous flow at the point where the water goes into the home, installed in the main water line, but again I do not think we have access to that either. All of the water is managed by the HOA, which has been difficult to deal with in the past. I would like to avoid any hubs or setting up a home assistant server, but if the only options require that I can pitch it to my parents and see what they say.


EDIT: Wow thank you everyone for so many responses and different ideas, I have a lot of things to pass on to my parents and I will also stop by the condo to do some exploration on where the shutoff is located. To address those that are concerned with my grandpa's safety, thank you I do appreciate your concerns. He still wants to live independently and is of sound mind so we can't force him to live with relatives, on a practical and legal level. I assure you he does not have dementia, he's just hard of hearing and going through a rough time right now. We have family that visit him every day, and he has close friends who also visit often to socialize and check up on him, he is not alone all the time. My mom just checks up on him so often due to her own worry and anxiety. She too is having a rough time after losing her mother.

Please note - I don't own a Razberry 7 and have never done this, so take what I say here accordingly.\n\n The RaZberry 7 communicates over a 3.3V UART serial connection so hardware-wise it should be compatible, although you'd have to figure out which pin does what on the RaZberry (may be published somewhere, or you could figure it out from the pins it's supposed to connect to on a raspberry pi.) \n\nSoftware wise - you may be able to use ESPHome and this [external component](https://github.com/oxan/esphome-stream-server) to forward the serial data to Home Assistant.

Bedroom right -> bedroom light

Bedroom left -> empty (in sync with bathroom right through home assistant)

So that I can turn on/off each room lights from other room's switch.

The apartment has Vertilux blinds installed throughout. The blinds use a Somfy motor however it is not the standard 433.42Hz motor that works with the Somfy Connnexoon. 

Instead, the blinds have a different Somfy motor (MOTWV02RG) that works on 433.92Hz. I bought a Connexoon and it didn’t work. I’ve tried speaking to both Vertilux (no help) and Somfy (confirmed that the blinds I have will not work with the Connexoon). There doesn’t appear to be any other off the shelf product that will support automation. 

Does anyone have any ideas on how I could automate these blinds?

I'm on the market for a house (in a large Canadian city) and I'm wondering about home automation stuff. These houses are pretty old and would probably require some work. 

What type of things would you look for and what things would you do to a house before moving in and then while living in it?

Some info about houses I've seen so far:

\- Pretty old, some from 1850. 

\- Heating in some of them is with radiators (that I'm not particularly fun of) and in others is with heating baseboards.

Making a wifi signal struggle to penetrate and expand your coverage.

Think of your doorbell and whether you should run an IP based wiring of low voltage with transformer or both ?\n\nIn many homes window covering are a must, so what will you do ?  Venetian, roller shades, or the big bulky traditional plantation type.  Can either of them be automated ?

I have a Zigbee network with 12 devices (coordinator + 10 Aqara/Ikea sensors + 1 Sonoff Mini R2 ZB). All worked great until I added a new Sonoff Mini R2 ZB near my Wifi Router. In the past I setted the Wifi Channel to 1 and the Zigbee Channel to 20 to avoid interference and all worked great. Last week I added a new Sonoff Mini ZB 1 meter close the WiFi router. After this, all wifi devices started to have problem to obtain an IP and connect to wifi router, with smart plugs that didn't work and my phone with a poor wifi internet connection. I changed the wifi channel to 6 and all wifi devices started to work normally. My router is a little buggy, so every 48h, despite my settings, wifi channel return to be 1 with all problems. I readed some articles about Wifi and Zigbee Interference and set Wifi to 1 and Zigbee to 20 should not have problems, but it is not my case. I have a doubt about the new Sonoff Mini R2 ZB that I added that it use a different channel on Zigbee network. I searched and I didn't find a setting to manage the wifi channel of a zigbee router. Someone can explain how to change the channel of a zb router to set the same of the coordinator?"	6	"[""MikeP001: First thing I'd have done would be to power cycle my network components - as you've noticed, many will behave inconsistently esp after being on for a while.  If the problem remained I'd have been tempted to remove the new device first to confirm it really is causing a problem, again followed by a network components power cycle.\n\nIf the problem was gone it could be attributed to the new component, but frankly I'm skeptical - zigbee typically isn't strong enough to affect wifi, and unless your wifi is transmitting a lot of data it would be unlikely to interfere with your zigbee devices (neither protocol uses a carrier nor transmits continuously).\n\nI suspect you're chasing your tail a bit playing with the signal channels and may make problems worse by changing the settings.  But if you insist, double check your router wifi settings - almost every router lets you pick a channel rather than leaving the selection automatic.  Also, zigbee client devices don't decide the channel, the zigbee controller picks it and the clients connect to it."", 'tarzan_nojane: Here is a [link to an older subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/kd1z08/determinechange_zha_channel/) of how to do this using ZHA.', ""giuscond: When I change the WiFi channel from 1 to 6 all works great. My router firmware have a bug that reset the wifi channel every 24h to 1, I don't know why. So I can resolve my problem with the channel 6. My doubt is about it: channel 6 wifi is in the same range of frequency of channel 20 zigbee, so my zigbee should be instable, but in this condition all works great. Otherwhise, the only reason of this strange behavior could be that some neighbourn change something and use the channel 1. But if I scan WiFi channels with different app and devices, they show all the same: channel 1 is empty (should be full to have interferences) and channel 6 is full with 9 ssid (that if I set up all works greats). It's a mystery"", ""MikeP001: What model router do you have that has a bug of setting a fixed wifi channel but ignores it every 24 hours?  Might as well name and shame it.  It really sounds like you've left the channel selection to automatic and it reselects the quietest channel occasionally - according to what you've said 1 would be the best choice.\n\nUnfortunately there's a lot of published nonsense about wifi interference - it's seldom an issue.   Scanning can be very misleading - just because there's other APs using a particular channel doesn't mean they're interfering - your own closer APs & clients are going to swamp out any interference from neighbors.  And changing channels can fix things for other reasons - typically because it's a buggy router and changing channels causes it to restart.  Try changing to 6 then putting it back to 1 immediately if you still suspect it's the channel.\n\nSpeculation can be a big waste of time.  If you suspect the new zigbee device unhook it to see if it fixes the problem - if it doesn't, you're on the wrong track.  I doubt 6 or 1 are full.  Zigbee 20 does NOT overlap with 6, it's at the edge of 11.  You could force it to fail if you want to try to confirm - force your router to channel 11 to check.  Better to validate your assumptions rather than jump around with guesses if you want to get to the bottom of the issues."", ""giuscond: It's a  **ZTE H389Q** branded WindTre, an Italian operator. I think I received some buggy firmware (in Italy the operators update the modems remotely without ask anythings) because some months ago I changed the channel correctly.\n\nNow I think it is not a zigbee problem, but some kind of WiFi interference: I try to set channel to auto and it switched to channel 4: more problems than channel 1."", ""MikeP001: A wifi problem does sound more likely than zigbee interference.  Could just be the router has more than one bug as interference would be more likely to come from a broken microwave or old wireless phone.   Maybe you could put it into bridge mode or disable it's wifi and run a wired alternate router?  ISP supplied routers are usually cheap/buggy/terrible (it being a ZTE seems to suggest that's the case here too).""]"

Thanks"	3	['JuiceEis: Possible? For sure!\n\n~~But I dont know if there are any small form factor development boards available like for the esp32 chip.~~ The esp32-c6 seems to support thread and is a relatively small formfactor.

So maybe both or only esp32-H2 can be used.  \n\n\nThe thread site has an extensive list of (all/many?) thread capable devices including microcontrollers. So if you are able to create a development board from the ground up based on these microcontrollers you can create DIY Thread devices:[https://www.threadgroup.org/What-is-Thread/Thread-Benefits](https://www.threadgroup.org/What-is-Thread/Thread-Benefits)\n\nOne example from the list is the STM32WB series of chips which seem to have Nucleo Development Boards. So you could start by purchasing on of these, test your software and hardware requirements and validate your code. Afterwards if you need more and or a smaller formfactor you can reference the provided schematics of the nucleo board to create your own development board.\n\nAdditionally, unlike the basic tcp/ip network connection from the esp32, you need a thread border router to connect your devices with your home-network:[https://openthread.io/guides/border-router](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router)\n\nSo I would suggest to look up the hardware requirements for using Thread devices and the whole principle of Thread networks in general.

We noticed a big delay when using voice to turn off and on the lights. So we decided for a change.

I plan to use zwave products and still keep my google home to do the voice activation. Is it faster? If so, how? My understanding is:

Wifi switches: voice command --> google home --> google server --> google home --> light switch. Where the server and back n forth is why there is a delay.

Zwave switches: voice command --> google home --> smart home hub of choice --> light switch. Where the ""server"" is now the home hub doing all the processing is because it is physically closer, its faster (less ping, less latency). If this is the case, does google home not try to process your command via their servers? How does it know i want it to process it through the smart home hub?

Thanks! Im a big noobie on this matter."	6	"[""emarkd: Google Home is cloud based. No getting around the network latency. Local control is faster, but there are no local voice control solutions. You can have both though, with a dedicated hub. Hubitat is easy, fast and very powerful. And it integrates well with Google Home.

And also have voice control through Google..with a touch more latency.\n\nThat's just one example though. There are others."", ""HSA_626845: I think this is unlikely to be faster since the round trip out to Google and back still exists.  It's unlikely that there is a compute delay on Google's infrastructure.

But it won't really be a noticeable difference.  Unless you have really poor internet latency at your location the bulk of the time is spent with voice recognition and processing to send the commands to the next hop, and if you do have bad latency a hub won't help.\n\nYou \\*might\\* get an advantage with the amazon voice hubs that parse voice locally to send local commands - I think it works best with zigbee devices.

I’m using home assistant and have it set up so google servers talk directly to my hub.\n\nWith this setup the flow would be:\nHome -> google -> hub -> light switch.\n\nBut google home also has a “local device api” which I’m not sure if home assistant implements. If they did it would be even faster:\n\nHome (realizes device is local) -> Hub -> light switch.\n\nSometimes it’s so fast that my lights turn on before google assistant replies with the “turning on <lightswitch>” speech.\n\nBut mainly why I think it could potentially be faster is if you have it setup so google talks to your hub instead of another cloud provider. While it’s true that the round trip to google is likely necessary, avoiding cloud based switches (such as tp link kasas etc) means one less dependency on a potentially slow provider.\n\nOne modification to your Wi-Fi switch flow:\n\nVoice -> home -> google -> provider (tplink kasa as an example) -> home -> switch\n\nUsing zwave and your own hub could potentially swap the “provider” with your hub. This would avoid any potential cloud provider issues. Example: if everyone using tplink kasa switches decides to all turn on their lights at the same time, the tplink kasa servers might not be able to handle all of the requests at once which thereby introduces latency.', ""fuzzyballzy: I have a Google Home and Hubitat hub.  \nI don't understand why but voice control is at least as fast as using a web based dashboard for controlling z-wave switches (Zooz switches, with 1G fiber internet ISP)""]"

I'm looking for something that I feel should exist, and I'm just not searching the correct thing. Basically, I just want a wireless solenoid relay, where when a 24V signal is picked up on a wire at one end of my house, the solenoid flips position on the other end of my house to close a circuit. When the signal drops, the solenoid should flip back open. Super simple, no need to monitor it over time: just open and close a circuit based on the signal from a wire (with reference to ground).

The background: I've got an ecobee thermostat, and I want to hook up my fresh air damper and fan up to the accessory port on it so that I can use free cooling. However, only 5 wires were run from my furnace to the thermostat, and all are in use. I could run another wire, but if I could just hook up a switch to that accessory location and bridge the timer it's currently on, that achieves the same effect and I get that satisfaction in my belly of outwitting my appliances."	1	['luciusn: Sounds like a Shelly one device.

DiligentWord4157	2	11wwud0	homeautomation	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/11wwud0/need_sizing_information_for_yoolax_blinds/	"I am looking at purchasing Yoolax blinds with the Zigbee motor to work with my Hubitat controller.  I have two windows that are in the corner of the bathroom one on each side of the corner wall.  The blinds will have to be mounted outside of the window frame.  According to Yoolax measuring instructions, they instruct you to measure the outside of the window frame and they will build the blind and add 3 inches on each side of the blind.  This extra width will be too big for the blinds with valences to fit into the corner. 

So my question or clarification for those that have purchased these for outside mount: 

1) Can you confirm that the shade is overall 6 inches wider than the dimensions you gave them? 

2) How much wider is the valence vs the shade fabric?

3) Was the dimension you provided plus 6 inches (assuming assumption 1 is correct) the width of the valence or the width of the shade fabric?

*TLDR: 3 cameras. 1 inside, 2 outside. I want to run them all locally, completely disconnected from the internet day-to-day, but with the ability to connect them to the internet for remote access when I'm outside the house for extended periods of time. (movement notifications desired)*

I'd like to have one camera at the front of the house (outside), and one at the back of the house (outside), and in the basement (inside). I'd like all cameras to be accessible from a home computer/monitor only, completely detached from the internet. But at a moments notice, I'd like to be able connect the hub to the internet (by some physical switch/keyboard command in the house, I don't mean once I've already left) so that I can view all the camera's remotely, and then upon arrival back at the house completely disconnect it from the internet again (by pressing the same switch).

I'm constantly worried about someone breaking in, so I'm just trying to put that to bed by getting a decent security system that isn't tethered through some sketchy company's cloud servers. The less involved other companies are the better. Notifications for when a camera detects movement is desired but not necessary.

I added a few display units, too. But where they were more advanced than Alexa when they first came out, I’ve seen no measurable improvements over time and in many ways, they regressed. It often fails to perform the simplest of tasks and talks back…A LOT. So, I’ve gradually moved away from it over time.

My nest battery doorbell needs a different app than my nest hello doorbell. That seems logical... right? I hate the Alexa platform and I\'m not an Apple guy, so Google because it sucks less.

I absolutely cannot believe that someone thought it was a good plan to release Nest cams that aren’t compatible with each other and have Nest doorbells that don’t use the same app. I mean this is BASIC stuff! It’s also entirely antithetical to the direction of the smart home industry right now. I mean, hello: Matter! The idea of Matter is exciting to people because it means not having the products they want to use split across multiple (non-compatible) apps. And Google knows this or they wouldn’t be one of the founding members of the Matter consortium.\n\nMy experience has been so similar to yours. I just can’t express how excited I was when Google was finally releasing the GA and the OG Google Home. I knew they’d bring their web search experience to things like answering questions and that they’d leapfrog where Alexa was at the time. What I had absolutely no expectation of was that initial launch time and the next year or so would basically be the best GA would be. From then on, it was downhill. \n\nI totally agree with you about Alexa. We were also early adopters in that ecosystem before GA came out and hated it. We ended up selling our OG Alexa devices. I wasn’t comfortable with their privacy and it just didn’t work well. \n\nWe have also had so many weird things happen with GA. As you said, can’t do simple things, won’t respond at all. You’ll see the request on screen being transcribed (so you know it heard what you asked) and then…nothing. We’ve had it sass talk us and chide us. Anything it deems as a question about politics or even mildly controversial, it won’t answer at all (and I mean something like “how tall is Senator XYZ”…not exactly something that people would fight over). We’ve also had it do things like you said “turn on the lights” and something else random happens. It’s started playing music when we didn’t ask it anything, it always plays ads when playing music…even though we have YT Premium - which is super infuriating. I think what happened is that they built the ecosystem so they wouldn’t be left behind but then they haven’t really figured out how to monetize it yet. So, I think they’ve slowed their efforts on it because they don’t know how to make it a revenue stream. But I don’t understand why it’s actively getting worse. OK, so you don’t add features. But why/how are they breaking things that used to work? I can’t tell you how many times we’d ask a really simple question and get the response “Here are some web results”. It then shows a whole Google search page on a 7” screen. I can’t read that from across the room. Why? I think they’re trying to find a way to get their ads in front of people and switching this to a web search accomplishes this. It also makes their users really, really frustrated. \n\nAnyway, I was very anti-Apple for years but tried an iPad in 2018 and our family slowly moved over. Honestly, it was Google’s privacy issues (like tracking your movement in Google Maps even when you turned off that feature) and similar things that began to concern me. And as much as I was against them for years, I’ve really enjoyed the Apple ecosystem. So, I’m glad we decided to migrate over. HomeKit is quite good. Not perfect. Nothing is. But overall, I’m happy with it.']"
