SirBramLordOfButts	2	13c617n	Govee	https://www.reddit.com/r/Govee/comments/13c617n/how_to_get_my_govee_tv_backlight_to_start_up_on/	I just got and installed my first Govee light strip and wow!! The colors are amazing. However, while messing around with the different setups in the app, I selected the “Crossing” mode before finding a color scheme I really enjoy. Now when the tv turns off and back on it starts the “Crossing” mode, instead of the color it was when it turned off. How can I make a default color?	0	[]

I built some shelves and run the lights on top of them. Want to use RGBIC lights because I have Dreamview for my TV and my PC, and I want to be able to sync them up.

I am debating between two options, both with pitfalls.

Option 1 - I use two 16.4 strings, this option will not wrap around all 3 walls to cover everything, and worried this would look bad.

Option 2 - Use 3 16.4 strings, one on each wall (not doing back wall). The problem with this option is one each string I will have left over strip on each wall. I've heard problems of cutting the strings to size, and want to avoid cutting if possible. 

(also had a one string go bad to mysterious causes after I cut it. Can't confirm the cut broke it, or being clumsy in my putting the lights down, but it's def broken).

What do I do with the excess string? Wrap it up? Drill a hole in the wall and just let the excess hang in the cavity (is this safe?)? Other options.

I've had some setbacks, and def in the ""I am overthinking this"" part of the process. Any help would be grateful."	0	[]

Today, whilst replying to another redditor's question regarding colour accuracy, I started thinking how I don't actually like what the last firmware update (1.00.14) has brought. 

I feel that, although there's been improvement on emphasizing some of the picture highlights, some of other details have been lost, and I don't like it. 

As an example, the picture I've attached shows clearly a green florest on the left and right side, and whilst I could live without the right side being reproduced, as the image is a bit darke and blueish, the fact that it's also not picking up on the left is disappointing to say the least.

In some moments the colors are very accurate but in other moments not so much. The biggest issue is when there is a scene/image that shows the sun, the backlight is very red.

To just put you in context, I currently have 3 Nanoleaf bulbs in a group which uses color scenes where each bulb uses a different color and changes colors in gradation according to the scene and the effect is simply wow.  

However, the choice being very limited, I decided to try the Govee to possibly have several types of lighting.  

The application is not super easy to find options other than basic, but I managed to find the groups and assign a scene to my bulbs.  

However, it doesn't seem possible to use a scene where each bulb plays its separate role in the scene, they all do the same thing at the same time.  

Is there a way to use scenes a bit more like in Nanoleaf?  

I found how to choose a distinct color on each group of bulbs, but only statically, which makes it a little less interesting... 

Thanks!"	0	[]

Additionally, H6008 has red/blue tones in the advertised picture, while H6005 has lighter cyan/yellow.

TLDR: why is H6008 cheaper then H6005 if it seemingly has more capabilities?"	1	['raven-nevermore-rva: H6008 just appears to be on sale honestly. Govee typically runs sales on different products all the time. I have seen the T2 go on sale cheaper than the T1 before. Not because the product isn’t better, just running a sale. Other than that, I would say definitely go with the h6008 as the wifi capability gives you the ability to control it when not in range of it. I use mine all the time, I turn lights on and off when out of town and my pet sitter arrives knowing they don’t have access to control most of the lights themselves. Great product!']

&#x200B;

I have a Govee TV LED strip on the back of my TV. I can use the Govee App to control it, but my Insignia Fire TV Remote seems to be on the same IR frequency. 

Every time I press volume, channel, or the select button, it changes the color scheme of my LED strip. 

The LED strip has a little sensor coming off of the main control unit that I am assuming is for IR frequencies. It is not removable. Is there a way I can cover the sensor to prevent it from picking up signals from my remote? Even when I have it shoved behind my TV, it still catches the signal. I was going to just wrap it in a half mile of electrical tape, but I figured that the denizens of Reddit would know a better way to do this.

I've built a garage gym that needs to be more fun for my early morning workouts. I am contemplating diving into Govee lights to illuminate and create effects across the garage gym. Obviously the scenarios are endless, but the best test case I want to do that should mean all other ideas/preferences are possible is this:

42inch TV is ceiling mounted in the center of the Gym wall of the garage with a chromecast. I want to have that screen playing a continual “hyperspace” loop from Star Wars (big blue space tunnel when they travel at lightspeed). I want that effect washed onto most of the long 22’ wall behind the tv. Basically just a shimmery blue. Could I use multiple of the camera synced light bars to do this? Can they all run off 1 camera? 

I also want some controllable lights that would provide illumination to the workout area but also slightly match the theme and maybe music sync through the music sync puck.

After almost 2 weeks of headache i think I've found the optimal compromise for me personally. I've tested this in a perfectly dark room with 0 light and 0 reflections. Also tested on all kinds of content, regular TV, dark movies, bright movies, dark video games like Diablo, bright video games like AC Valhalla and something in between like Elden Ring and Hogwarts Legacy. 

Also tested in several single color screens on YouTube with every color possible, from pale peach to cherry red!

Compromises need to be made between colorful effect in darker movies and accuracy in brighter content so here are my settings:

- Brightness: 100
- relative Brightness: 1
- Saturation: 10
- White Balance: From middle 2 into red
- Movie Mode always (not game!)
- Part (never All)

I think white balance is individual for everyone but I'd suggest to adjust it in real content instead of a white screen. But try both for sure!

Most importantly is saturation. The T2 struggles a bit with Orange when at 1% saturation. You start to get a punchy orange at 10%, regarding content. But at 10% you already have a stronger tone on pale peach, 5% would be the sweat spot here but then you'd lose accuracy in stronger orange tones. Probably 7-8% would be the most accurate but my inner monk doesn't allow me to do so, so i chose 10%.

If you really feel funky go up to 15% but i personally notice a big off in content with lots of pale colors (mainly because i play video games) but if you watch mostly darker movies you can go for 15% as well! I really wouldn't go beyond this though.

That's it so far, i really hope this is helpful to you and saves you time as well as headache. Enjoy your T2 because it's really doing an amazing job for the value!

You could for example have a square WALL of LED’s to produce brighter colors around a dimly lit orange LED and perceive it as brown.

Turn off the LEDS and all the room lights, pause the screen on a real world example like this then go to the camera calibration settings to see that the camera sees. You’ll probably see that the colors are closer to what the lights are displaying than what you see head on from the TV. This is a limitation of using a camera to capture the image. You may be able to get a more accurate representation of the colors by moving the camera below the tv a few inches (maybe resting on your stand) and forward about 10 inches in front of the tv, and then tilt it forward a bit toward the screen. Don’t be afraid to move the camera with the screen paused and see how the colors change. They change a lot by changing the angle of the camera and distance from the TV by even a half inch or so. Tiny movements change the colors dramatically. Play around with it. It’ll never be perfect or even close to perfect. One color might be spot on and then others will be off.

I’m essentially wanting a plug and play (after initial setup) backlight syncing system for our living room TV. I’m really early in the process of research of these, however the T1 and T2 seem a lot more affordable than the Phillips HUE. Are these both essentially plug and play? I’m really not wanting something I have to fight and adjust each night when turning on the tv. 

Thanks!"	5	"['crowsaboveme: So, what I found out is that you really have to temper your expectations. This system doesn\'t extend the light from the edges and isn\'t perfect. What is does is provide a more immersive experience without sacrificing picture quality from an HDMI 2.0 sync box at a very affordable price. It takes the most prominent colors on the screen and extends those to the viewing map (see Govee app). I chose Govee because I knew I was going to add more TV ""dreamview\' lights as well as smart lights in my home and I wanted them all on one ecosystem as well as being completely compatible with Alexa and of course didn\'t want to invest thousands for the same capability with the Hue system. It is important to remember that the T2 only supports an additional 5 devices besides the TV backlight. As far as plug and play. For the most part it is besides the calibration. It does take a bit to figure out what works best for your environment as well as getting the camera angle right, but all in all, I don\'t regret my investment into the ecosystem at all.

Plus the shelves will be made to fit the strip sections perfectly and the walls will be hollow to hide the unused sections.

Wondering if I put a light strip behind an on/off switch (a real one, like pulling out the power plug) and make the light red for example. 
Then switch off. And a day later on again. Will the light start with the chosen color again (i. e. red)?

Heu lightstrips do that.

Drm5145	1	12s5rzo	Govee	https://www.reddit.com/r/Govee/comments/12s5rzo/is_red_the_normal_default_color_for_dreamview/	"I have my dream view finally set up, I have the P1 bars to the sides of the TV as well as the neon TV backlight on the back of the TV when I put the test video on YouTube on the TV it is perfectly lined up and the colors go around the screen in almost perfect synchronization which is really cool !! But I noticed when I'm watching or playing things there's a lot of red back there, is this normal? Is this like the default color if there's dark colors on the screen? For example, if I turn the TV off and the screen is just black, I get a mostly reddish orange color.  Is this the same for others ?  Is there a way for me to change the default color at all?  Any other calibration tips are appreciated. 

One thing I noticed which was weird is in the instructions it tells you to turn the TV off when you put the orange squares on the TV as well as turn the lights up in the room . A hell of a time for days trying to calibrate it because I couldn't see the TV through the camera very well, last night I made sure all the lights were off in the living room and turned the TV on and I could see the whole screen and it was so much easier to calibrate lol.  
I have to say ; the govee glide lively bars on my wall behind the couch opposite side of the room that the TV is on one of the coolest things I've ever had when it comes to lights or LEDs...



Thanks for any help provided. I love this group , it has been invaluable for me getting everything setup !"	0	[]

1: 8m strip and a 3.5m strip ( not sure how to sync these two to have continuous or symmetrical effects)
2. 2x. 6 m strips, but got about 50cm of extra strip
I need to hide
3. 10m strip with breaks in the middle requiring soldering and wire extensions.  (3, 4, 3)

Am I missing anything?

Should I get music sync device?

I’m sure these questions have been answered before but I’m new so hope I’m not buggin.
I’m a big fan of govee,  between trial and error (everything from Walmart dollar bin lights to Phillips hue), and YouTube…I feel I’ve landed at Govee as my favorite all around light product company. I’ve utilized products including regular RGB lights, RGBIC lights, led rope lights, and most recently Govee Glide (amazing product btw just a bit of a pricey one).

Anyways onto my questions. I’m helping a friend setup some lighting for their apartment and trying to be thorough but budget friendly since they can’t spend what I would spend on lighting. The friend wants some interconnectivity like he sees in my home (Amazon Alexa integration), and would like segmenting and customizing ability. This makes things a bit more simple because it’s pretty easy to set up some RGBIC strips inside some diffuser channels and get him an Echo Dot. However this has caused me to find some nuances I didn’t know about.

1. Coated versus bare led strips
- is one better than the other (lighting brightness, density of leds, colors, etc.)?

2. If I choose uncoated (slightly cheaper option) does utilizing a channel diffuser (will be doing so regardless) make up for the loss of coating?

3. Outside of the M1 strips I find very little info about led density (example: 30 led/m or 60 led/m). I know that the more led dense a strip, the more expensive. However, I’m trying to find a happy medium between quality, brightness, customization, budget, and usability. Example: H618F offers the RGBIC lighting, Bluetooth-WiFi, customization, Alexa integration, and budget with current rate of 100ft for ~$50. However, am I sacrificing too much LED density for this model if I’m going to make this length of strip traverse a studio apartment and could be customized to use for a bedroom segment, living room segment, kitchen segment - and this be primary source of “traditional” lighting and mood lighting?

Thanks for anyone’s help!"	1	[]

Putting two on one power brick that is originally intended for one, would make the strip in its entirety not get enough power all the way down. So the further down the strip it could be dim or dull or not even light up at all. \n\nLastly to answer your question no it would not connect to the app, seeing it as one.

This was a bit a go, and could and most likely been adjusted for and fixed. However this is something to look into. If you can, my rule of thumb has been dont go over the 32 ft size if you can help it. Your lights illumination will always be better and less issues can happen.

CryptoTrips	5	12p4ihg	Govee	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/12p4ihg	"Recently installed an H605B immersion kit (55-65”) on a 75” TCL 5 series. I’m more than happy with the coverage and brightness given that there is no bars and strip kit for a 75. I’m still figuring out camera placement, so it’s currently sitting on the entertainment center producing the best results so far. I currently have the light bars placed behind the entertainment center. Nothing is finalized so excuse all the wires showing, it’s a work in progress lol.

Calibration woes aside, I decided to test it on solid single colors and I realized my light bars are considerably warmer when displaying the “same” color. I would say the light bars are actually displaying the requested color and the strip is certainly not. 

The first two pics are supposed to be a warm-ish white which I want for general bias lighting, around 3000k. I set this by selecting both the strips and bars and the color white and then turning the warmness slider down. As you can see I get nice warm white from the bars but an ugly magenta tinted light from the strips. Pretty much anything that’s not a pure 255 red, green, or blue causes mismatched colors from the strips and bars.

Pic 3 is the green color “Jolly 2”. Pic 4 is (supposed to be) the red color “Aggravated 2”. As you can see in both cases the tv strip just does not match.

I’ve tried resetting the whole thing by deleting it from the app and re-pairing. If I can’t get colors to match I’m returning this. It’s not really acceptable to me. Bad thing is I got it for $105 with a coupon on Amazon and now the deal is gone so I’d have to contact someone directly to see if they’d send a replacement. Hopefully I’m just dumb and am missing a really obvious setting or toggle. 

tl;dr: my strips and lights are an AIO kit both working off one control box but the colors never match. Light bars seem to display the requested color fine and the problem I think is the strip. Reds and whites show as pink or magenta, and greens are more blue than they should be."	6	"['Pale_Smoke_2170: It could honestly be an issue with the placement of your camera. If at any time that camera shows or catches any light reflection, or if it sees any of the light reflection from behind your entertainment center as well it will mess with your colors big time. You also have to play with your saturation along with your brightness. I would always try putting the camera up top. See if you get a better picture that way if not, I would definitely change up how close you have it or how far away, and I would also take down the brightness of all the other lights, and see if that helps you out.', ""Life_Meringue_9304: My 2 cents : ~~try permuting  the usb-c plugs for strip and bars ?~~ Edit : can't be this ... the bars use 1 wire for L and 1 wire for R where strip use only 1 for all the length.

FurSkyrimXB1	1	12mx7zl	Govee	https://www.reddit.com/r/Govee/comments/12mx7zl/relative_brightness_in_t2/	"Am i missing something or does this setting make no sense at all in regular movie mode? Wouldn't it mean that if i have a main strip that i can adjust those other 3 strips in terms of how bright they get compared to the main strip? Also especially in movie mode it darkens and brightens automatically according to the content so i don't get this function at all. 

Someone might want to explain what it does on T2 and what's a recommended setting? Currently i have my brightness at 20, relative brightness at 100, saturation at 15 and white balance done in a white screen (2 notches to the right from the middle)."	9	"[""xH0LLYW000Dx: You want to set relative brightness at the lowest possible number, because its basically the lower the number the less bright the LEDs are when there is no on screen color/light or tv is off...\n\nSoo at 100 your going to still see the strips as being on when your tv is off, where as if the number was lower then they will appear off depending on the strips(usually the one behind the tv still look like there on but very dim when tv is off).. \n\nBrightness should be any where from 20 to what ever you feel depending on your rooms actual Brightness & time of day. So 20 would be find for a dark room or at night and higher during the day depending on how bright your room is?\n\nsaturation should be usually set to 1 because it give more accurate on screen colors from the lights, but you can expirament to see what better feels right to you..\n\nAnd white blance basically set to what ever white color brightness you prefer for the color balance is to your liking? Usually 1 or 2 notchs to either side or middle...\n\nRight now with my T1 i have it set to for movie/tv veiwing setting listed below.\n\n100% for back of tv strip\n\n100% for Neon rope light behind tv\n\n20% for 50 foot(25 foot each side) led lights running around the top of my room at night & usually 50% to 100% during the day depending on how much light is in my room..\n\nSaturation is set to 1%\n\nRelative brightnes is set to 25% because that's what i find works for my setup.(T1 strips still glow when off & nothing on screen but i like the effect) the neon rope & 50 foot leds actually are off when nothings on screen or no colors are on l..\n\nAnd for using game mode/movie, i have it set to game since i find it actually seems to mirror on screen colors and light movements better depending on what your watching to me..\n\nHope this helps 🤔"", ""FurSkyrimXB1: Firstly thank you for your comment. Sharing experience is always appreciated!! I think that it's all dependent on your personal set up so there is no right or wrong (excepts for white balance obviously). I'm currently waiting until it finally gets dark outside so I can calibrate it. Since i never use it on daytime I'm going to tweak the settings once and leave it there."", ""xH0LLYW000Dx: Yeah, white balance is usually up to the users liking 🤷\u200d♂️ and as for setting it once after tweaking and leaving it alone from there, good luck 🤣\n\nYou'll always want to go back a tweak it to see if you can make it better. I really wish dreamview had a snapshot setting so you can save different loads outs..\n\nAnd yeah, you want to first set up everything when it's dark so you can better calibrate everything to your liking & then work your way from there if you do decide to use them during the day/afternoon when there is light in the room you have everything setup in..."", ""FurSkyrimXB1: Done with my calibration now. My brightness is at 100, relative brightness at 1, saturation also at 1 and white balance still at 2 notches to the right. \n\nI was afraid that brightness 100 would be way too much but that is surprisingly not the case since real content varies a lot in brightness and the strip adjusts to it pretty well. Also really surprised that color accuracy is best at saturation 1 - no pale or washed out colors at all.\n\nReally hope I can leave it as it is now since I'm exactly that type of guy who wants to make it better every time.."", ""xH0LLYW000Dx: I'm glad you got it set up, and good luck with not touching those settings again 😅\n\nYeah, brightness depends on content & with relative brightness set at 1, it should be fine .."", ""FurSkyrimXB1: Just one more thing. Relative brightness does not influence if your strip is on while on black screen. In order to get my strip to turn off on black screen i need to set the brightness to 46. At 47 it's already on and you see a light on black screen. This is also not a LCD tv issue since i have an OLED. But leaving the brightness at 46 and adjusting the relative brightness accordingly gets me a worse result all the time and it doesn't really bother me that there is a small light in complete black areas."", ""xH0LLYW000Dx: Yeah, that's the best you're going to get even on an OLED, since for some reason, the LEDs on the back of the TV always appear faintly on, even on a black screen.\n\nWhere as ever other LED connected to the dreamview on my setup goes completely off.

This video, beginning at the time stamp, describes a potential workaround for the limitations that come with using HDMI 2.0 and having the box function as a passthrough device that you have to use as your new PC input. If you have the extra ports, it looks like he is able to plug in an HDMI cable into the box as the input, and then instead of using another HDMI cable to output to his PC, he simply plugs in a DP cable from his GPU to his monitor, then duplicates the displays (not sure if done through actual settings or if he means the display is duplicated as the HDMI output to the box should be the same as the output from the DP cable.)

It seems to work in the video, as he shows his monitor running a 4k resolution at 160 Hz Refresh Rate.

Is there any reason that this wouldn't work? If it does work, it seems like it could be what makes this an actually usable product for a legitimate PC gaming set up. I would buy this in an instant, which I admittedly did as I have been searching for a gaming backlight solution that doesn't rely on a camera (T2 on my TV is great but definitely has huge room for improvement). When my excitement died down and I saw that it was limited to HDMI 2.0 I immediately returned the product. 

This would be a game changer if it worked!!! I have to be sure that this would work before making a second purchase and further embarrassing myself if I need to return it.

If anyone has any input on the viability of this, it would be greatly appreciated!"	5	"[""sarhoshamiral: There is no reason why it wouldn't work since the box would be getting a similar image. \n\nHowever a duplicated display by default has to have the same resolution and refresh rate so you would still be limited to HDMI 2.0 specs really.

I have a 50 inch TV and I know they are coming out with a tv version but it will be for greater than 55 inches. I tried a 55 inch kit before and it was a mess. I figure this covers a 32 inch square. So if it is set super bright especially with the 2 side bars it might be work.  I hate they leave out 50 inch TVs.  Oh well, I guess I can always get a cut to length one from AliExpress	12	"['strunker: many people have already used this on a TV. obviously the ai features dont work with TV and the led strip is too small to fit anything larger than \\~40 inches..

The AI sync expects a certain number of light segments for a 40” monitor and a 65” T2 has twice~~ as many - so this is the results\n\nThe box is likely expecting a set number of ICs, and it\'s unlikely any third party USB-C light strip will have the correct number of ICs for your length.\n\nI\'ve seen enough people complain about 50"" TVs I feel like someone should accommodate them.

By the looks of it though, it uses to independent RBGIC Strips that are cut to length which allows for my 50"" (49-55 Kit).. With an adapter, I can go from USB-A to Type C easily.

1680817053.0	06-Apr-2023 14:37:33	Adding a remote sensor probe to a Govee Water Detector	ziebelje	3	12dywvq	Govee	https://www.reddit.com/r/Govee/comments/12dywvq/adding_a_remote_sensor_probe_to_a_govee_water/	"I've been working on my sump and sewage pit recently, and wanted to finish off the project with some water sensors to notify me if there are any pump failures. Govee checked most of the boxes:

☑ Cheap  
☑ Local Siren  
☑ Remote Notification  
☐ Remote Probe

The main issue I had was that placing these on the surface outside of a sump or sewage pit wouldn't notify me of a problem until it's too late. Most of the sensors that do this were overly expensive, didn't have remote notifications, or were not highly reviewed.

So I picked up a couple of these Govee sensors and got to work. The first thing I did was take apart the sensor. The two sets of contacts are redundant. The left two are wired together and the right two are wired together. The surface drip contacts are separate.

I soldered on some 2 conductor 22AWG wire to two of the contacts, ran 5 feet of wire to some [cheap probes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L94MMP7), and I was done. I was initially worried that the contacts wouldn't take well to solder, but they are wired up that way internally and they did just fine. I used a bit of hot glue to secure the wires down further.

/u/clh42 did something [similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Govee/comments/zxvblm/govee_water_sensors_i_designed_a_wiring_harness/) a few months ago, but opted for a 3D printed harness that you just set the sensor in and pray that the surface contact is good enough. I'm sure that probably works OK for a while, but I needed something more reliable.

Here's a few photos of the finished product: [https://imgur.com/a/KClkF0N](https://imgur.com/a/KClkF0N)

You do not have to take apart the sensor to do this, but obviously this voids the warranty. It's probably still waterproof, but the heat from the soldering does affect the plastic slightly, so don't bet your life on it.

Just wanted to put this out there since I hadn't seen this anywhere else. I tested these several times each and both alert just the same as they used to. I can now dangle the probes wherever I want for a little extra peace of mind. Enjoy!"	5	"['cowboy_shaman: Cool project.  Wouldn’t water short out the exposed leads on the bottom of the sensor.

However, after a long time of working more or less perfectly, lately, Google fails to control most of the devices, most of the time.

I have all my govee and other “smart” home devices connected to a 2.4ghz guest network on my Asus router, like they have been for years at this point, and none of the devices from other brands have been having any problems, which led me to start wondering if Govee devices are just having communication problems in general."	8	"[""InterstellarDeathPur: No probs for me.

I'm a pretty recent Govee addict. I'm running a T1 Pro w/ Bars(605B), a Neon TV Strip(H61B2), two Lyras(H6072) and a couple of 1200w bulbs(H6009) pointed upward ""painting"" the ceiling, side walls, and ever so slightly the viewing area. I've experimented with the bulbs in several positions, directions, and diffusions. This has by far been the best use for them.

After a ton of camera moves, recalibrations, saturation tests, relative brightness tweaks, fiddling with the TV's Color Saturation and 2 points white balance - I'm really happy with color accuracy... at least for the moment. I still haven't quite nailed down where to assign the segments for the neon tv strip. On my 65"" it creates two segments on the side kind of leaving me in no man's land. Currently, I have the bottom of the rope bent in.

\--

I added the Lyra's a couple of weeks after getting the T1 Pro at a sweet discount. With the lamps on the side, I'd like to move my flow bars beneath the tv stand to bring up the lighting beneath a bit.

I'm pretty sure it's a no, but is it possible to have the pro flow bars in whole bar mode while in Movie Dreamview mode? Currently, the top and middle segments are overpowering the bottom segment and throwing the sync off.

I have a silly question. My wife surprised me with some hexa on the wall and i can't add the layout in the app. At some point there is one hexa leading to two hexas, one left (dead end) and one right (where there are more queued hexas). In the app it looks like we can only chain the hexas one to one.

Am I doing it wrong ? What did I miss ?

Thanks.

For anyone looking on how to switch the battery on the h5704 - pop the back plastic cap off, then on the bigger piece containing the battery and chip, if you push gently with your thumb on the wider side of the battery cage that connects to the chip, towards the opposite side of the case with the least amount of room from the corner of the case, the entire battery, battery case, and attached chip will come out of the white plastic casing. 

In my case I did NOT need to use very much force at all to do this, they come out pretty easily.  Maybe a little wiggling was needed for a couple. Be mindful there's little thin tabs that hold the chip and battery into the white case. 

Once the chip is out of the case, the battery can slide right out of the side of one side of the battery holder. Replace with a new battery, CR2477 - all set.

Allow a minute or two for the govee to reset and it will connect to the app via bluetooth just fine."	0	[]

1680374614.0	01-Apr-2023 11:43:34	Connecting multiple strips	I_Am_JoKe	2	128uvwe	Govee	https://www.reddit.com/r/Govee/comments/128uvwe/connecting_multiple_strips/	"Hey all. Let me preface this by saying that, although I've admired and understood RGB (LED) lighting for a while, there are some things I don't understand or can't find information for

I am going to be redecorating a room in the next few weeks and plan on adding some decent lighting to freshen it up. I'd like to add some lighting to the ceiling, aswell as around some furniture. I've measured the room and I'd require about 14m to cover the entire room perimeter. There'd also need to be about 5m to cover the desired area around the furniture

Although I'd love to use the M1 kit for all of this, I don't have / am not willing to spend £400 to cover this job. The current idea would be to get the RGBIC Basic Wi-Fi- + Bluetooth kit in a 10m roll (H618C) and 5m roll (H618A) to cover the ceiling as it's not in direct view. And then the M1 kit (H61E1) should cover the extra necessary for the furniture as it's more visible

My question is in connecting the 10m and 5m rolls together and having it function correctly. Would it be possible to connect the extra 4m necessary, to the 10m strip, and have it all function correctly and in unison? I would like to be able to control the entire 14m with one control & power module, without any interuption. I could then simply have two ""zones"" to control (1 ceiling, 1 furniture), rather than three (2 ceiling, 1 furniture). Would this be possible at all? Or would I have to have the two sets of controllers etc, and manually sync them up?

I've searched online and via Govee themselves, but I can't get a definitive answer. So I guess first up is, is it possible in terms of power? I'm thinking the single power connector for essentially 1.5x what it comes with may not be enough. Now, if that's possible, could I have control of the 14m as if it's one unit or not? I've seen demonstration videos that indicate a 10m strip can tell if it has been cut and will adjust the settings in the app to reflect this. So, is the same apparent if I were to add more instead of taking some away?

Next question is more of a personal preference kinda one. Would you guys do this, or just go for the cheaper (but more jank imo) option? This would look like getting 2 x 10m rolls, joining 7m from each around the ceiling to have a more even split, and joining 2.5m from each left over to create a 5m strip and use a single controller for that (assuming it's possible)? Also working from this, is it possible to buy a seperate controller / power module without getting an extra roll? As with this alternative, I'd need 3 total but would only have 2

Thanks in advance!"	2	"[""Mysecretpassphrase: With the rgbs you can cut and splice. The rgbic strip controllers need to know how many lights there are in order to perform all the functions that we all love. There's no way to reprogram them that I'm aware of to do what you're asking.\n\nAlso, what the hell is a meter? 😁"", ""I_Am_JoKe: Makes total sense! Can't control what it doesn't know is there. Ok so essentially, I'd have to get the 3 sets at minimum, and manually sync the 2 sets going on the ceiling? And do you know if I can get a separate controller to link up to the excess or not? If so, I could further reduce the cost by only having to get two 10m rolls, and a 3rd controller. Otherwise, it would mean getting the 10m roll and two 5m rolls\n\nLol. It's a unit of measurement used by us better English folk haha /s""]"

After the 99% IPA tip, do you recommend the Phrozen Sonic Mini 4K?', 'Toysoldier34: I would highly recommend the Phrozen Sonic Mini 4k and the Anycubic Wash & Cure, these are what I use, and love them both. When I was looking into buying a resin printer quality was my top priority as I was using it to print miniatures to paint for D&D and for just fun stuff to print and paint. I personally can\'t stand the print lines from FDM printers when the part isn\'t just purely functional. At the time I was looking into buying, the Sonic Mini 4k came out within a month or so and was the best option on the market at the time so I waited a few weeks and got that. It prints minis with higher detail than anything I\'ve been able to buy in stores.\n\nThat said, while the Sonic Mini is still great, they have come out with newer versions that have a larger print size or higher quality which I would recommend over the Sonic Mini 4k at this point. Phrozen now has some 8k printers well worth considering. You won\'t go wrong with the Mini 4k but bring their newer stuff into consideration as well and figure out which of them would be the right price, size, and quality ratio for you. I haven\'t kept up with the new releases in detail after buying mine to give you a specific recommendation but I have seen a few that are upgrades to mine that are tempting.\n\nSince you have the Ender 3 you know 3D printing some. I would say resin printing is a bit easier all around, aside from the handling of toxic resin aspect requiring gloves/mask. It is way quicker and easier to remove support material with fewer marks on the print left behind. They are also significantly less error-prone in my experience once you have the settings right. Fortunately, since they are all the same you can just look up the ideal settings for the resin printer model and you\'re set, very plug-and-play in that regard. No risk of coming back to see the FDM printer screwed up at some point and you have a bird\'s nest of plastic waste. That isn\'t to say there aren\'t ways a resin printer can fail, but that is more down to having the settings right or not for the print and its weight/size. Whereas I feel FDM printers can/will have failed prints from time to time despite the correct settings.\n\nAt this point, the primary advantage of FDM vs resin is the size vs quality balance for the same price points, so unless large prints are needed I generally recommend resin these days. You can print resin pieces in multiple parts and can glue them together like FDM, but you can also use the same liquid resin you printed with like glue by brushing it on the joints and around the seams then using a UV flashlight to cure just the seam and it now all hardens together as one solid piece pretty much like it all came from the printer like that. You can think of it like ""welding"" two pieces of ice together by wetting the seam and refreezing it, the same concept. Then a bit of sanding to clean up excess depending on how clean it was and you end up with a perfect-looking print that no one would know was printed in multiple parts. You can print things like helmets this way despite the small size limitation of the Sonic Mini 4k and have a smooth round Iron Man helmet that looks like a printer 10x the cost made it with very little effort and the glue/seam is just as strong as the rest of the piece similar to welding metal. Other good FDM cases are for a wider range of materials if people need to make very durable stuff, though resin has some strong resins as well and is used sometimes in dentistry to print things for the mouth with specific resin types for that situation.']"

I am developing an app which allows users to login with their Govee account, then connect to my app and offer light control.

  
I wonder if anyone knows how its possible to connect to their API for multiple users?  The only method i can see is by requesting an API token but this is done in their app and on a per user basis.  Unfortunately this will not work for me

&#x200B;

I waited forever for these lights to be in stock and I finally received them and put them up. It took a long time on a hot day but I was so proud of my installation. I had tested them prior to installing them and they seemed fine but once installed, I noticed this odd Green light that they produced towards the end of the light projection. I've attached 3 pictures I took to help showcase the issue. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed as the green somewhat ruins the immersion of the Cool White light I was going for when not showcasing holiday themed colors. I reached out to the support team and they told me that its a phenomenon that happens?? I've seen plenty of other post and their photos don't seem to show the same ""phenomenon"". Any advice?

If you have like a Raspberry Pi lying around, you could probably use Home Assistant which is mutually recommended or HOOBs if you just want lights to work with HomeKit.\n\nThere are many ways to share and connect Govee lights. If needed, you could make yourself a program for others to download that can send JSON requests to your accounts API. Govee has an open API you can use for this matter, and they’ll give you the documentation of all the main things you need to know (thermometers and sensors, I’m unsure about.

SecAbove	3	1224k39	Govee	https://i.redd.it/b395qn9ap0qa1.jpg		6	['COLONELmab: Looks like just something left on during production.  All of my RGBIC H61... kits have been cut and none of them have ever had that.', 'SecAbove: After watching couple “yes you can cut RGBIC” videos I tried to insert 5 m wire into the single run of 10 m RGBIC strip. First I was doing fine - the strip was fully functional after initial cut with 10 cm 4 pin connector installed. But then I did something wrong, perhaps forgot to unplug while pulling the connector off and killed the second half of the strip. \n\nThe first half of about 5 m is still working fine. If I want to salvage it, do I need to reattach this something from the tail? Or can I just use it as is (like sealing the end with glue gun and leaving)\n\nWhat is this? Is this some type of capacitor?', 'SecAbove: What is success ratio of your RGBIC cuts and extensions? Am I just very unlucky with my fist attempt?\n\nLooks like capacitor is to compensate for electricity drop.\nThis is Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Film Capacitor. And  I found some explanations here:\n“You need a capacitor because while the led color change can cause a large voltage drop due to resistance, inductance, power supply quality, etc, the problem lies in that these smart leds have a small microcontroller in them, that is sensitive to brown outs (dips in the input voltage). Once they brown out, they reset in unpredictable ways. The capacitor is to help prevent that from happening, by buffering the voltage drops seen close to the capacitor, and therefore the first led.”\n\nhttps://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/374922/why-would-i-need-a-capacitor-in-front-of-a-led-strip', 'COLONELmab: Very cool.  But I think the capacitor is just used for testing the strips probably in production.  They make lengths and solder them together at different lengths so the capacitor is probably for flashing the controller or something.  \n\nFirst.  I don’t understand cutting 5m for one 10m strip.  The strips have a set length.  You can go below that, but not above it.  As in, if you buy two 10m kits, you can not join them to make one single 20m length. You can cut 10m to two smaller strips. \n\nFor cutting my rules are:\n-turn on strip and make every segment a different color, mark segments with tape or similar.  \n-UNPLUG the strip\n-cut where needed.  You can only cut between segments. \n-connect segments as needed\n-test. \n\nIf you change the overall length to shorter, depending on the model, you might just have a ‘gap’ in scrolling style modes (because the controller is still trying to scroll the color 10m even though you only have 5m). \n\nJust fyi the unplugging part is essential.  I have forgotten to unplug when cutting twice, both times fried my controllers.\n\nEdit to add, my success when doing my steps is about 95% on the first try.  5% or so needed the splicing connector to be swapped or adjusted. So just considering the end result, following those steps, 100% success.', 'SecAbove: Mate, thank you very much for sharing your cutting and splicing experience. Inspired by the feedback I cut off 50 cm from both sides close to my cut (the part on the controller side and the dead second half). Reattached and RGBIC is working fine again. Looks like the fault was on the strip somewhere near to my cursed cut. \n\nP. S. The initial goal was to transform the single 10 meter run into 4 meters light, then 4 meter gap and then the remaining 6 meters of light strip. To recover the strip to working condition I lost 1 meter (two 50cm) but it is still close to initial plan.', 'COLONELmab: Gotcah, glad it worked out for you.  I have all sorts of strange splices going on.  It was only like a year or so ago that RGBIC was not an option and it was all or none for RGB.  So, I took 2 RGB strips, cut them into three foot segments, then spliced them with 3ft of wire.  so, basically, I staggered two strips.  Then I would, for example, put one on purple and one on orange for halloween.  Or on on strobe and the other on a solid color.  Then, less than a few months later, I found RGBIC was affordable and in stock....made my days worth of splicing pointless haha.']

I have installed node and home bridge on my mac and have gotten to where my Govee lights can be turned off/on via home bridge and have their brightness adjusted. However i cannot get the colour to change from HomeKit, it will only show the last colour i set it to via the Govee app. Any ideas?

I have tried:
-Re installing all software home bridge etc,
-Trying different plugs
-2 separate wifi Govee products, same issue
-Reviewing logs. No obvious errors or problems
-disconnecting and reconnecting the lights to govee app
-playing with settings on homebridge, api key etc

One day it crapped out. When I tried to remedy it the bulbs started flickering.

Attempted calibration and I only the right camera was working. I did the hard reset, un plugging the power source for 10min. I even had govee delete the T2 dream view so I could Uninstall and reinstall. (You can't delete a device when it's the sync. Center) 

After all of that it didn't fix my issue. Then I remembered that I had another T2. Traded out the camera and the, we'll call it a button box. 

T2 was back in the game. Now for the life of me I can't get the h6008 bulbs to work with the Dream view feature. I've un installed them and reinstalled a few times. Nothing changes when I turn on dream view after I have mapped them.


Also, my Bluetooth connection keeps dropping and won't connect unless it's right next to the device. 


I absolutely love these products I don't care if Xi ping is listening to me blow the back out of my tinderdate. This is the first big roadblock I've hit with these devices. Everything else was fixable. 

Have you guys ran in to any of these problems? If so how did you fix them?

And if the screen is white, it's yellow. So what is the issue? It drives me bananas.

[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/ORF5vms) a crappy drawing of what I had in mind. Powered from the center for each 16 ft strip, I'll run the strip lights around the ceiling in a rectangle and meet in the center on the other side. It seems like solder wouldn't hold up well over time so I'd prefer good connectors with heat shrink over them. 

Does this seem workable? What reliable 90 degree connectors can I use, if any? I'd like these to dim pretty low, are these a good choice for that? WiZ was an option I looked at but they seem too bright for my preference.

Of course you will be able to dim them but here is my recommendation. Use smaller strips to create zones. Here is how I have my RV set up:\n\nLiving room- 1 strip the length of my slide out on the ceiling.  I promise you… this is PLENTY of lighting in most daily situations. You don’t need to go around all 4 walls. \n \nTV- 1 strip on all 4 edges for tv backlighting\n\nOffice- 1 strip the length of the window\ninside the slide out on the ceiling\n\nBath room- 1 under cabinet strip\n\nKitchen- 1 under cabinet strip\n\nBedroom- 1 under cabinet above the head of the bed\n\n\nExtra GE Cync smart plugs:\nCoffee pot- I can start my coffee remotely\n\nRouter- I can reset my TMobile internet router at any time.\n \nOffice power- I can turn off my entire home office \n\nZones make it so much better so that you can turn on just the amount of lights needed. All managed through the GE Cync app.  The best part of the app is you can set “moods”. So at 6pm my “day lighting” dims and my under cabinet lighting turns on. At 10pm the over the bed lighting comes on.  Coffee starts itself at 6am. \n\nYour plan is all or nothing.  Zones are a pro considering what I mentioned above, but costs a ton more than a simple single strip option. \n\nEither way- once you put in one smart light the addiction will set in for more for sure!\n\n*edit for additional comments and easier read formatting', 'Vast_Deference: It sounds like you have a great setup in your RV! And I like the idea but I have the ceiling set up where the LED strips will hide a few imperfections. Routing is also a concern as drilling more holes in the fiberglass is less than ideal. \n\nMaybe just running 2 strips from the center long side (Left) to start? That way I could scale it as needed for dim levels.']

Also the TV is only a 48” I’ve seen others modify the lights to work for smaller TV, has anyone had luck doing that?	joshuafischer18	3	11ngvo8	Govee	https://i.redd.it/xiyyyxnbbwma1.jpg		1	"[""Madmac05: I don't think the corner is an actual issue, however the fact that you have fireplace bricks on one side, and furniture above and below, will probably not give you the same kind of results as a white wall would. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/n2LTsZ6geRE - although not exactly the same conditions, equipment and brick style, I think it will give you an idea of how it might look. \n\nRegarding the size of the strips, I think some people glue them to the back of the TV as a wave instead of a straight line. This might lead to some inaccuracies in terms of colour positioning... If you have 2/3 the screen red and 1/3 blue, then the Govee will assign 2/3 of the leds to be red and 1/3 blue, but, if your 2/3 of the led strip doesn't exactly match 2/3 of your screen, then it might look a bit out of phase.  I don't really think you will notice it unless it's very specific scenes or you are focusing on that particularly. \n\nMy personal experience is that in the first few times you use a T2, you'll tend to focus on how the leds are performing, if the colour is accurate, if the transitions are on time, etc, etc... After a while, you go back to focus on the TV and the image it's displaying and the background effect becomes part of the image without you focusing on it.""]"

* Reset modem & Router (Also disabled 5ghz band)
* Delete and added G1 to Govee Home
* Changed network (used a mobile hotspot)
* Tried accessing and adding/deleting with another phone.

So far, today I have had no luck.Earlier in the week, after a few attempts I just noticed the calibration option work.I know that these devices are very finnicky with wifi, however I don't think that may be the problemThe possibly exists that the camera may be faulty, but I would like to hope this isn't the case.

Anyone experienced anything similar and has a fix?

A friend of mine has the exact same firmware, hardware, and model as mine and we bought it a few days apart and he has the function but hasn’t updated the app.

I've been having this annoying issue for a while now....to be exactly when I switched to a new router my Govee T2 doesn't want to connect to the 2.4Ghz band I set up for my IoT.

The Router is set 1,5 meter from the TV where the T2 is installed and I'm having no other connective issues.

I'm planning a crown molding project and want to add some LED strips to create an indirect lighting effect pointing toward the wall at a 45-degree angle - I guess it's the best angle. I was wondering if anyone has any advice on the best type of LED strips to use for this. I've been looking at the Govee M1 LED strip and wondering if that would be a good choice. I was also thinking about Neon. 

If I choose M1, I'm still unsure whether I should use a diffuser or not. I was thinking that if the strip is hidden and won't be looked at directly, it might be fine to skip the diffuser.

My wall is 630 cm long and the M1 is 500 cm. I'm planning to leave around 65 cm on each side without LEDs. Do you think this will create a good enough effect of fading out gradient or should I consider extending the LED strips further?

Any advice would be much appreciated!

One day, out of the blue, my m1 strip and my bars showed up, but only the m1 strip had chroma options. I was super excited! At least one of them worked……. but alas, enabling the option did nothing. I couldn’t believe it. Then they updated the desktop software, and none of my lights were detected. This went on for weeks. Then, again, out of nowhere, the m1 strip got another firmware update.

When it showed up on the dream view I was confused because there's no reason to be making a DIY with major minor colors on a movie view. I asked and the official response was that on the dream view, the relative brightness slider refers to the ambient brightness of the room (which makes zero sense at all). If they maybe call it white balance it might make more sense than calling it the same exact goddamn thing with a reverse meaning on the DIYs. 

So here, from the company itself... Relative brightness on the dream view movie watching environment has to do with the brightness overall in the room AKA ambient environment. Same company relative brightness on the DIY has to do with brightness of the secondary color relevant to the main color.

Two terms officially defined to have nothing to do with each other. Maybe it's just language barrier or maybe it displays complete lack of understanding of the customer.

Imo the only way to make the dream view unbeatable is to have a dynamic white balance adjustment. It must be more difficult than I imagine"	1	"['brigyda: I\'m a little confused here\n\nWhen you say ""If they maybe call it white balance it might make more sense"", I\'m confused as to what you consider what white balance is? Because generally, white balance refers to the temperature of the whites--warm whites or cool whites, which also affects the temperature of all the colors.\n\nIt\'s true that using ""relative brightness"" for settings that operate differently is confusing, but the name of the setting is technically accurate since the settings are relative--one is just relative to one rule, while the other is relative to a different rule. The DIY isn\'t operating on the same conditions as the Dreamview, so the conditions for their relative brightness settings are also not going to operate the same.\n\nUnder the conditions of the Dreamview, the white balance settings and the relative brightness settings work as intended, at least in the conditions I have for my TV setup.']"

I've struggled with led strips in the past, and just am a bit overwhelmed by all of the options out there. I was curious if anyone had some general guide or could recommend some good baseline options for lighting based on my needs/wants. I already have 2 philips hues that I was gifted, but for strips and panels I thought govee would be the better path to go down since it's just so much cheaper.

I'd like the light to actually illuminate the room to a decent degree, though am not expecting a lot of light. I'm looking to backlight my desk (70"") and tv (50""). I think a LED light strip could suit both purposes, and was thinking then of getting \[this\]([https://us.govee.com/products/rgbic-smart-led-strip-lights](https://us.govee.com/products/rgbic-smart-led-strip-lights)). I also thought wanted something more and was debating getting either light panels or a LED strip, as I'm unsure if the strip light will give me enough actual light to feel the room is illuminated. For light strips & all products, as long as I can control them via app I'm happy.

I was also curious if anyone had recommendations for positions and lighting placement & general recommendations. For instance, if there is backlighting against a wall, would putting panel lights or a strip on said wall generally clash or result in diminishing returns, or if dreamview lightbars would suit my needs better than an led strip for backlighting.

I apologize for the rather long post with multiple questions, I just find getting into lighting like this to be a bit overwhelming and would appreciate any and all help!

Just depends on your preperence.\n\n> For an LED strip, do you need to diffuse it if it\'s behind a desk and acting as back lighting?\n\nFrom reviews like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I8EZ-ifMN8) I don\'t really see the backlight hotspotting so I would think you\'d be ok without a diffuser. \n\n> For the envision kit, this one says it recommends a tv 45"" or smaller, but im not seeing a govee bar that works for 50"", will it still look okay?\n\nThe main issue with the bar kits is that you\'ll only light up 2 sides of your TV. You might want to add the Neon LED Light Kit for TVs and link it up with the camera that comes with the P1. There\'s a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsURatEaby0) that talks about this at around 1:30 in. I would think the same could be done with the RGBIC Pro strip behind a TV as well, but they offer a neon rope package with 48-55 size TVs in mind.']"

If you connect it to an incorrect way, this may result to either the strip not working properly, or even completely breaking the components itself, even the controller by chance.\n\nIn case if you are extending the strip, you CANNOT do this, since it’s technically “hardware” setting for the total amount of ICs on the chip.

I have a set of four floods and a set of two, and I can barely even sync those together using the exact same scene.', ""blueraz1: Second question is can i cut the cord between two of the T's so i can feed it through an obstruction in my run? Dont need to extend it, just cut it so i can fish it through a hole. The T wont fit."", ""blueraz1: Interestingly enough they will all link to music Dreamview and use the same color scheme but not much else. I can create a DIY scheme and set both the strips and the flood lights to it but can't group them all together to work in unison"", 'Brendan_D: Yeah, it’s a shortcoming for sure. Scenes are particularly weird. The “thunderstorm” scene on my floods (4) is totally different from the “thunderstorm” scene on my floods (2). They’re just not designed to work together.

And they look totally different.\n\nBut I appreciate I am a use-case of one. Your intention seems like a much more common request.\n\nAre you trying to sync them, or group them? I’d have thought grouping them is doable. You’ve tried going to home > groups > + > basic group control?\n\nFrom there I can turn on and off the whole group of different models, and apply very basic settings (brightness, color). But I can’t apply scenes even when that scene is available across all the devices.', 'Brendan_D: I do have a possible work-around for you. Govee plays really well with Alexa (and probably other similar hubs) so I’ve created an Alexa routine that turns on various Govee and non-Govee devices, then sets the scenes for each. Even supports DIY scenes. It’s remarkably powerful. You can set you own custom voice activation phrases, or you can just hit the routine trigger button in the Alexa app. Also Echos are cheap and regularly on sale, so if you don’t have one it’s easy to put one in the room.', 'Brendan_D: The Govee app has an automations section, which is weird. You can create a sequence of actions, eg set all your devices the way you want them. But you have to have a trigger. It can be one of the devices turning on, but that is a bit limited. You can also get the Govee two-button remote, but again, that’s pretty limited - to two states, eg on and off.', 'blueraz1: Just reread your comment. Looks like I am able to group them all under basic. That will be good enough for me. Thank you so much.', 'blueraz1: Yeah by saying sync i guess my actual intention was to group them so i could set them to the same scene. They arent compatible. There are a few limited scenes available.  I am able to use the same diy scene on all devices but I have to initiate the flood light group and strip group separately. Its not the end of the world, but a little frustrating.', 'Brendan_D: Yeah see my Alexa suggestion above… that’s my solution. Works great. If you have an Echo.', 'blueraz1: I appreciate your help. All my lights are in my bar which is in a separate outbuilding so i will be testing everything tomorrow.

I'm coming from a regular T1 model from about a year and a half ago. Loved it, but now I'm moving with a whole new setup. Will have an 65 inch LG C2 (wall-mounted), and don't know which one to choose. They are both around the same price, but the T1 Pro comes with the light bars that I can put on my TV desk/stand, but I hear the T2 has better and brighter color accuracy and such. So not sure which one to choose and need to make the purchase today. Also, is it possible in the future to add light bars to the T2 and if so is it as good? I feel like the bars would make a great addon to the original lights I had so if it's not a big upgrade/difference, or NOT being able to add any light bars to the T2, then I'll probably go with the T1. Just need any opinions or experiences people had with both. Thank you in advance :)

I just haven't seen the T1 to compare."", ""Thin_Mission2518: The T2 has a lot of issues right now. With the right TV in the right dark room with the camera PERFECTLY placed and calibrated it looks only a tiny bit better then t1. But not enough for the upgrade not yet. Breaking it up into two cameras is a bad idea. It messes the calibration up and your TV might look slightly different on one side then the other if not done oerfectly which is a deal breaker. The T1 on the other hand has been perfected. The calibration is a breeze and it's always accurate if you do it the way it says. Only one camera to see so everything is uniform. But the bars don't add much to immersion imo. The T1 is what I would go with but take into account the bars are visible on either side of your TV and it's obvious they are shining light and it doesn't feel like an extention of the TV itself but more of a add on. If you like that that's great but if you want to feel like the TV itself is lighting up behind it then I'd not get the bars and just get the regular T1. Plus if you want the bars afterwards you can buy them and add them to the dreamview and make them either match the TV or do their own thing. If you buy the T1 set with the bars you can't use them for anything but that T1 and it has a special box that they all plug into so your limited on how far out you can put them. I'd say get the T1 and the bars separate if you want and then you can do whatever your want."", ""MrConmasterx7: Alright thank you! So that's crazy that the T2 came out awhile ago and still not good.

I don't get it honestly. If they released the T2 with one camera it would sell like hotcakes.

I'm waiting for that to come out and just stick with my T1 until then."", ""Mysecretpassphrase: My observations and experience differs from the other well-informed poster. I do not have the light bars set up but I have upgraded from the t1 to the t2. The increased LED density on the t2 definitely adds to the experience. I do not notice any difference with color matching between the two versions when it is set up correctly for specific lighting conditions. What I mean by that is regardless of which model you have when you get it perfect and you're so happy, you will only be perfectly happy with those exact lighting conditions. Open a curtain turn on another light well you got to do it all over mostly with the white balance. Additionally, if you have your smart TV set to adaptive brightness it will never be exactly the same!\nThe dream view environment has much to be improved upon but it's still adds to the television watching experience regardless of the model. I have the t1 sitting in a box and the t2 on my favorite TV so that should tell you something."", ""MrConmasterx7: Would you think the Philips hue setup (strips+box) would be worth it compared to govee at about $250-300?

It's a fun effect for the 100 bucks but the Phillips hue is a entire system you need more then just the strips and a box. You need like a handful of things and it's very expensive. The strips alone are as much as the entire govee. It looks moderately better and more responsive but not for 5 times the price. Because that's what it would be you walk into best buy and get everything you need to mimic what govee does it's going to be 500 bucks easy."", 'MrConmasterx7: Fair enough.

On the other devices that have relative brightness I had understood it to mean the relative brightness to the background color on a DIY/scene. Pretty darn certain I was correct until this slider so I asked them specifically to explain it because there is no reason to create a DIY on the dream view actually you can't even do it so why the feature right? I think this is the language barrier issue because it should definitely have been named differently given their description. They step on their own feet all the time mostly with their documentation I wish they'd hire someone to prove it in different languages.

My plan is to stick a 5m strip around a wooden slat (circumferential length = 2.70m, can still be shortened), which then I want to attach to the wall and screw some stuff onto it so it's backlit. I want to use the RGBIC technology cause of the effects. The problems I have are descriped in the following ideas.

Idea 1:
I wrap it around the slat almost twice beginning with the end of the strip and stick the second round over the first like that 2,3m are covered because it´s stated that you shouldn´t cut it off according to the manufacturer. Also covering it with insulating tape or something similar, but then you have about 2.30m of the end piece which still get enlighten and with it a supposed delay in some effects generated. Would be cool if you could then hide the last segments via the app, so that the technical end is after 2.70m (according to the segments, that would even be perfect after the 9th, because 9 * 0.3m = 2.7m) and then jumps immediately to the beginning after the 9th segment. Is this possible or does the controller still control the diodes that are not switched on via app and does not skip them, i.e. you can clearly see a delay?

Idea 2:
I've read here that the tape can be cut at the copper connections and even better if you do it at every 0.3m cause of the segmented lights. I'm only tied to the 2.7m dimension, I could only shorten it a bit. Can someone tell me whether the copper connections are to be cut at about 2.7 m on the tape? I guess I can play with around 10cm. And is that perhaps also after the 9th segment? Then you could control at least nine segments perfectly or are there problems with the effects? Like a delay descriped in ""Idea 1"". 

All in all it would be cool if the effects start at the beginning of segment one, run until the end of nine and start again at segment one. If it´s not possible, maybe you guys have some other ideas for me. 

Thanks. 🙂"	4	"['The_Techy1: How large is your budget? They make one RGBIC lights rip which can be cut and then adjusts the effects automatically. It’s expensive though, it’s called the Govee M1 if you want to check it out', 'Maddinlicious: Oh yeah, I have seen it but in my area it´s 100€ on amazon and I was like nope!\nI´m a student and thought maybe something is possible with the 30€ variant. Maybe you have some ideas with it. I could order the normal RGBIC and test it without cutting it so I can ship it back if it doesn´t work but I wanted to give it a shot here first. So back to my questions; how does the ""turn off the segments"" mechanic work? How does it affect the effects?', 'The_Techy1: Unfortunately, there’s no way to fix the effects after it’s been cut. Turning off segments only works with static colors. I would probably just wrap it round twice, though depending on your application, it might look better just to cut it.']"

But plugged it in and it connected perfectly like normal. It seems this model has the whole thing internal.

Another improvement: the cable now properly comes out the same direction as the light, that is, in the back, facing the wall.

The assembly of the metal stick was also improved, using just 2 types of segments instead of 3.

The model number is identical to the old one, but the manual seems to be made out of a more plastic paper.

Very happy. I enjoyed these lights enough to overlook these issues, but seems I don't have to!

The dark side of this is of course that there is no way to tell which version you will get when buying one online. 3rd party stores are sure to offer the original on sales etc. My best suggestion would be to order directly from govee."	1	['The_Techy1: Yup, heard about this with the aura too.

I have a light bar to each side of the TV (left and right) - both light bars light up the same way - is there any way to make them independent?  Have the right one match the right side of the TV and the left one match the left side of the TV?  That would make the most sense.

1676259532.0	12-Feb-2023 19:38:52	Anyone else having issues with their LED bulb H6008 staying connected/responding?	ForceOf_Bman	3	110ye8z	Govee	https://www.reddit.com/r/Govee/comments/110ye8z/anyone_else_having_issues_with_their_led_bulb/	Ive been working on setting up hotkeys to control my Govee lights through my Stream Deck + and for the most part they work but after about 10 minutes of them being on some of the lights stop responding or the hotkeys don't even work at all. The Stream Deck is registering the task complete but the lights stay the same. anyone have a similar issue? The Govee app is also having to constantly reconnect the lights via bluetooth or wifi.	1	"[""Toysoldier34: Contact support and this, you could have had bulbs or something else they could help you fix. I had issues where one of the same model bulb was turning itself on randomly. I knew it was just this bulb because it was in a 3 bulb fixture with 2 others from the same pack and they didn't have the same problem so I knew it was internal to the bulb. They ended up sending out a replacement after we tried some troubleshooting like swapping around which bulbs were in each socket. The replacement hasn't had issues and it's been replaced for a couple of months now. \n\nIn hopes of salvaging the bad bulb I tried it in a different room putting it into a ceiling fan single bulb fixture. So far it hasn't been having the randomly turn on issue but the wall switch is also turned off more often and not digitally setting it to off which does skew things a bit. That said, it does seem to only respond to voice commands about half the time while the Govee floor lamp in the room it is paired with does respond regularly to the room wide commands for power and color changes. Somehow it's slightly better but still has issues, just bad luck that they should replace or help set straight for OP or anyone else reading this in the future, I found their support responsive and helpful enough. I also had to have one of their Lyra lights replaced as it died after about a month and that was a about process as well aside from the effort of assembling it again. \n\nFor more context I have about 10 of the H6008 bulbs, 2(3/w broken lamp) Lyra lamps next to TV for Dreamview, 3 of the black standing floor lamps, and the T2 camera and light strip for Dreamview. So the success rate is acceptable overall but not impressive at around 11% failure rate in my experience over just under 6 months now. and I bought all of it during Black Friday sales. \n\nAs some feedback to /u/GoverOfficial if possible through a software/firmware update it would be great to be able to have a lower minimum brightness on most of the devices. I found the H6008 bulbs too bright even at 1% brightness to use them with Dreamview as they became more distracting than improving the experience so I ended up excluding them from the group. This is also specific with my setup and the ceiling light being right above the couch, if the lights were in a place where they weren't in any direct view of peripheral vision they would be fine, but as is I would like to be able to readd them if I could set them dimmer. The same goes for the T2 light strip as sections of it never fully turn off even when the TV and all other lights in the room are off, it still has a faint glow sometimes only on half the strip at best, but usually it is all on brighter than it should be when it should be fully black/off instead. To add to that, we need more options to customize Dreamview and the color accuracy with the cameras in the least to help balance it with more control to help offset for things like different color walls as brightness and white balance alone don't cut it. Personally my green color is often pretty weak for most shades of green and most yellow colors display as red on the backlight. We need an option to set the low light threshold for how much light at a minimum is needed for the backlights to actually turn on, I would much prefer they stay off in most dark scenes so that the black of the OLED can be appreciated better with it blending into the black wall behind it. Instead the outline shape of the TV is always highlighted due to a faint white glow at all times despite it being a fully black or mostly black, at least at the edges, screen. Govee I like your products and would like to recommend them more but some simple issues like these need addressing as I don't like having to choose where I compromise the TV picture quality in dark scenes for the benefits of the backlight screen extension during bright and colorful scenes.""]"

Just bought the H6178 for my sons TV and he has a 40” Panasonic (4 years old) 4K - HDR Tv he uses for his Xbox in his bedroom.

USB
Now on testing with the plug that came - all worked but in each of TVs USBs they flicker 
I  guessing this isn’t getting the right power - but the cable is too short. 
I’ve got a USB 3 extender (1m) and that only works if I pull the USB out 2mm! And the Govee supplied power supply does not work on the extender, So had to use a higher powered Anker one which does! Seems the extender weakens the power!!??

ALEXA
This works but when I use the app, it jumps into Bluetooth mode & disables the wifi & I have to remove & re-connect it to the Govee app. Not all the time, seems intermittent.
Then when I ask Alexa to turn the lights off - it dims it - then I have to ask again. Needs to be time twice to turn off!!!!!

Also can’t get custom colours like a proper orange via Alexa - any advice on voice commands will be appreciated.

EERO
Now not sure if these work fully with Eero Mesh kits. I’ve set up the guest wifi and it only works when on that!!!

Also I swapped the whole thing with Govee and it’s the same on both !

Spoke to Govee and there answer : but a new TV that USB works!!!!!! Errrrr no! Not yet anyway!

Is this LED poorly supported as it’s the more basic one.

Any help is appreciated!!!!!"	2	['AdieJAM: https://preview.redd.it/jaamlc6mtkha1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ef5d0a76b189f0f290d5cef305b268b3a75ac485\n\nHere is the set up', 'AdieJAM: Still got the same issues!']

What about HUE?	peter-withaparka	2	10zgq8h	Govee	https://www.reddit.com/r/Govee/comments/10zgq8h/colour_differences_between_different_led_strip/	"I’m currently looking for an alternative to my HUE led strips, as they are just too expensive.

I bought one Govee WiFi led strip (model H6110)  but I’m not as pleased with the colours as I‘m with HUE. It seems that HUE produces better and more colours and tones and also manages to hit the transition between two colours way better. For example, HUE‘s orange tone is orange and not a weird yellow tone as it is with Govee.

Thus, I was wondering if there are any other or better products from Govee that produce nicer colour tones than the standard WiFi Led strip (H6110). Can you guys recommend a specific strip? I really don’t want to spend too much on the HUE products anymore, but they seem to be the better ones in the end."	1	"[""Mysecretpassphrase: I agree. I started out with Philips hue devices. The colors are better the transitions are better. The devices are more expensive and less flexible. I have a whole box full of Phillips hue stuff if you want to purchase them for an incredible discount.

So IMO yes the hue stuff is better at some things and worse than others. Choose your poison the people here have chosen theirs""]"

I already deleted and reinstalled the app and deleted and re-added bulbs in the app, no luck. 

I've tried disabling wifi b and ax, universal and explicit beamforming, tx bursting and airtime fairness, changed the modulation modes, ipv6 turned off or on, all with no change. Google home can see that the bulbs are on but cannot control.

The bulbs worked perfectly when they were new but after a while they wouldn't work on wifi unless I went into the app and re-saved the wifi settings, which worked for a few minutes then disconnected eventually. 

I really like the govee products, when it worked with google assistant was awesome and I would be buying 20 downlights for my whole house if I could get this to work reliably.

One dimmer switch controls six can lights. I slowly replaced them but when I got to number 6 all of them were glitching out and blinking. I replaced the bulb number one in the circuit with a GE LED. Suddenly I can dim the lights again and control it perfectly.... I'm so happy I got lucky and discovered this! Let me know if this is common knowledge or if it helped you out or pass along to somebody who needs it!	4	['sarhoshamiral: If I understand you right, your Govee smart bulbs are going to have very short lifespans as they are not designed to be installed with dimmers. LED dimmer switches work by turning on/off the circuit very quickly and while dimmable LEDs can handle that a smart bulb with wifi circuity will not react as well. \n\nI am guessing your GE LED is buffering out the sudden voltage drops somehow but it is still not a good idea to rely on it.\n\nOne way to have dimmable switches with smart lights is to have a smart dimmable switch (like Inovelli Red series) where you can set it to provide power to circuit regardless of the switch state and then have the dimmer, on/off commands mirrored to smart lights.', 'Revolver_45: Good to know should be an easy replacement.

I've came to the conclusion that my light strip not connecting to WiFi isn't a software-related issue, it is the hardware. Something in the light strip probably is dead and that is what controls the wireless stuff. Now is there anyway to really fix a hardware issue besides getting a new light strip? I've had this thing for a while and apparently it just stopped connecting to WiFi at some point when that part died... and I never realized it until now when I am actually trying to build a smart home 🤷‍♂️. If it is possible to fix it without getting a new light strip, that would be great.	2	"['BronxSmash: I have a wifi enabled light strip that this has  recently happened to I thought it was my network but this makes more sense than all my other govee products are working just fine', ""Mysecretpassphrase: Well unless you're an electrical engineer I doubt there's any way to fix that sucker""]"

Scarablu-	6	10ush02	Govee	https://www.reddit.com/r/Govee/comments/10ush02/adhesive_for_hex_lights_are_weak_recommendations/	"I bought the Govee Hex Lights a few months ago and almost all of them are falling off despite me following instructions to a T. When performing the installation, I'd hold it down for over 60 seconds to ensure they stay nice and snug. Regardless of my best efforts, i have like 5 of the lights falling off consistently. 

I reached out to Govee, and they want me to find some 3M double sided tape on Amazon (or another distributor since I don't like buying from Amazon) and they'd reimburse me. How come they aren't just sending me replacement adhesive? Do they not have any more? 

In addition, I'm unsure of what I need to be searching for. Searching for 3M Double Sided Tape yields exactly that: Rolls of double sided tape on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=3m+double+sided+tape&i=tools&crid=1K5YVAYP5ICDM&sprefix=3m+double+sided+tape%2Ctools%2C122&ref=nb_sb_noss_1) and on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1312&_nkw=3m+double+sided+tape&_sacat=0).

This is a $200 set of lights and they could not bother to put a modern Wifi chip in it, or at least make the desktop app work with Bluetooth, WTF.

Obviously routers can figure out the connection most of the time, with proper hardware setup, so I have to think they got cheap with their Wifi chips or something when making the lights or there is a piece of software missing. My guess is that anyone with a cheap router that is missing a lot of the smart features would be ok, but of the router tries to be smart that creates the issues, especially if the connection was not negotiated correctly. \n\nHonestly it all feels a bit weird since 5ghz has been around since 2009 and this is still a problem with these devices, so much so that there are 100s of posts and it is specifically mentioned in the setup app, I feel like there is something that can be done about that in the firmware or something."", 'carcossa_: Good to hear but can you explain hoe?\nI have my lights connected  to a WiFi router (2.4 and 5ghz) \nAnd my phone as well\nNow I want to see my lights on my desktop pc via the app via lan cable\nI have selected the lab option in all light devices and in the app \n\nThanks in advance!', 'BlueCreek_: You need to call your internet provider to move the network your phone connects to?', ""mrfrankvegas: I don't really care that it doesn't have support for 5ghz, the issue is that it cant negotiate that with a router that has smart switching turned on.

I can't find an answer for this.   


I have underglow on my car, but there's no physical switch to turn it off or on, so I have to use the app,  which is unideal while driving, or the remote on my keys (which are normally in my bag).    


So I was thinking about getting Amazon Auto anyway, and since it controls all my house lights, seems like it'd also be a solid solution to control underglow lights while driving, but there's no mention one way or the other.  They are bluetooth controlled so it seems like it shouldn't be an issue.  


Anyway, if anyone has any insights I'd appreciate it!"	1	"['strunker: No it wouldnt be able to. Alexa can only control devices, for the most part outside of zigbee devices, over the internet. The car lights have no internet connection and thus would not be controllable. Maybe you could setup some type of iffft integration for alexa that turns them on via bluetooth or something when you say something to alexa? Not sure, but there wouldnt be like a ""native"" way to accomplish this, you would need something third party or custom work to do it.']"

The thing about these Govee immersion lights is that they’re not going to be 100% accurate. This used to bother me as well, since I am naturally a pretty finicky person.

(That being said: HDMI 2.1 is not easy to implement so we probably won’t see that for quite some time.)\n\nThe colors aren’t going to be matched from the very edge of the screen. There’s actually a 4 inch gap starting from the edge of the screen that the system isn’t going to capture. Why it does that we don’t know—my theory is to compensate for some media being in letterbox or widescreen form so that the black bars don’t hinder the color matching in any way. \n\nAnd it’s also important to remember that these LEDs aren’t going to be able to replicate every single color available. It’s why gray might look purple, why light skin tones might look orange, pink, or red. If there are LED strips that could replicate much more colors, it would undoubtedly cost a lot more.', ""Jerome_Fz: Yes I didn't reset my box but the relative brightness just showed up the other day !   \nI agree with what you said about sync boxes, even with HDMI2.1 it's just another possible point of malfunction to add something in the way of the display.. and I don't even know how you can switch between sources with multiple input sync boxes."", 'brigyda: That’s great!

I already have dreamview working fine on my TV, with a t1 and 2 floor lamps.

Now, I am very close to my home theatre being completed and I want some LED strips around the dropped ceiling. Purpose made coving is going to be use to direct the light upwards.

My plan is to get the new sync box when it comes out as I'm using a projector. Plus light bars behind the drop down screen.

I need 12m(ish) of LEDs in the ceiling.
Most of the strips seem to be either 10m or 5m. However they do an RGB basic strip that has BT+Wifi, that's 30m (two 15m). 
I don't think I'd really require rgbic in the ceiling as the dreamview options on show 2 lights in that area. Plus the be fairly dimmed to not cause issues with the projector. 
Any ideas what the best option would be?"	0	[]

Strips is connected to wifi
Lan mode is enabled
Have made firewall exceptions (public, private, inbound, outbound, ports, .exe)
Have tried two different routers
Strip and pc are in one network
Have tried with laptop so both devices sit on wifi

If you contact the company they're probably going to tell you to do these things first.. first unplug the strip for at least 10 minutes and try again.

It does usually fix my problems. It does not delete the configuration in the app so the next thing to try is doing that.\nCouple of things to check. Are you using DHCP and could that address have been previously attached to something with which you had a problem and had to restrict it maybe? I've had a device or two that would not let go of its IP on its own even when I dedicated to Port profile to a specific VLAN. So it was sitting on the network my router could see it but it had an IP address for a different VLAN so couldn't get anywhere. \nOne other thought is there a chance that you have two ssids with the same name one serving 2.4 or one serving 5g and it's causing confusion?

Using one of those YouTube tests where a coloured ball floats around the edge of the screen, the further the ball moves from the camera, the less colour matching and brightness the lights give in that area where the ball is.  


I have fiddled with the camera calibration to move the marker points less at the edge of the screen but it doesn't make much difference.

The issue is that even if I crank down the brightness, the color is still there. Or going to the color wheel, there is no black. So no matter what I do, it appears that a color diode has to be on at all times. 

You *can* select the RGB colors and make them ""white"" as well, but it's not actually white if you're making half the diodes white via RGB, and the others white via the WW.

I managed to get pretty good results after 2 days of usage. Want to share with you if you are interested. I’ll also include demo video, so you can decide if it’s good enough for you. Unfortunately, colors often too saturated. There is no way around it. Hopefully Govee will release software update to decrease saturation even more. 

So basically I used a YouTube video to calibrate the camera and its positioning was pretty important in my case. Make sure it’s around 90 degree angle and in the center. 

Calibration video: https://youtu.be/lR_Pxd8hrd4

Then I used Govee video to calibrate colors. Make sure you use grey screen to correct white balance. Otherwise white will be white, but grey will be very green. 

Color calibration: https://youtu.be/2ZPEXzUgwZM

And I’ll also include screenshots of my settings:

I'll explain : I have a govee immersion T1 with camera fixed on my wall, around 10meters cable far from the strip light box. I changed the lens of the camera to have a tighten field of view (works well) and a 10m usb extension cable to connect the camera. Unfortunately the camera won't connect if I use the usb extension.

&#x200B;

I measured the tension on the camera with extention : 5V. Ampere 1,5A. Same value if the camera is directly connected to the light strip box so I'm quit sure this is not related to the power provided by the USB extension. If I use another camera (or usb device that need some power) with extension everything work.

Nevertheless it seems that Govee Camera are protected by some prioritary license (you cannot use another camera or connect govee camera to a computer) so I do not know what to do.

USB electronics are quit simple: ground, data-, data+, 5v. I cannot understand why it does not work.

&#x200B;

Has someone else tried to use extension ? Do you have recommanded product to use ? or have you electronical knowledge to understand what is missing ?

While they could provide an option for users to turn on the wake from no power into ""powered off"" mode it can lead to more negative experiences with people being unsure if they are working, forcing the app/voice commands to be required for basic functions, and just more general issues with troubleshooting. They made the call that reducing issues caused from the feature is more important than the smaller number of cases where people would want to use them this way. \n\nPersonally, it would be nice to have the option.

But, for $60, I could put up with it (and wait for a future where HDMI reader strips are the norm).\n\nNow I wish I could just figure out why my T2 reads the top of the screen as brighter and always outputs more light on the top.

However, we all come up with interesting ways to use these products.. would love to hear yours and here's something I do that's kind of neat.

I live in a big farmhouse very rural neighbors are all welcome to come in and out as they please of all our homes. My den is on the second floor quite a distance away from the kitchen which is the most frequently used door. I'd like to know when somebody comes in that door. Yes I could use a ring doorbell video camera etc but sure here's just a different solution.

I have some Wi-Fi door open and close sensors on each door. I've used my Amazon echo /Alexa routines feature to give me different types of alerts when that door is opened depending on time of day. People are coming in all day long neighbors workers, horse hands cleaners etc I would just like to know when somebody walks through the door. 

Daytime.... Alexa turns all the lights on in the rooms where I'm likely to be color red 100% brightness. She also announces that the back door just opened on my tablet which is usually with me. So even if the TV is up very loud or the stereo whatever I'll see the color change. It's really nice! Overnight she announces a little bit more excitedly the same thing in my bedroom turns on my nightstand low red so I keep my night vision. She also announces on the echo in the kitchen about an intruder alert and turns kitchen lights on super bright to fuck up whoever it is night vision. I have time to close and lock my bedroom door, rack my shotgun and call the popo.

Yes, the argument to lock the door is always going to win the discussion, but please don't make that the point.

Apologies in advance if this is answered, I had a look around here and the internet generally and I can't find a solution to my problem.
This is what I want/can't figure out.
6:15am yellowish light comes on at 1% and over 15 minutes it turns into a yellow/whitish light at 100%.  
I have these installed on my window with curtains covering most of them so when the light comes on it will look like a real sunrise coming through the window.
I know there is a sunrise thing in the app somewhere but it's red and the light starts off too bright. I have also seen a good morning thing but it phases too quickly, seems more like an alarm but I will say that the colors used in good morning are what I'm looking for.
I've also tried the diy but I don't see a way to dim the light.

One is people forget about them. Think about this. A bunch of folks in the '70s wrote some applications to support a government program of some type in like Cobol maybe. Pick your own chosen development language. It does what it does perfectly and it doesn't really need any maintenance. Every time I'm just going to say IBM puts out what they called PTFs, program temporary fixes which is a fancy name for bug fixes, they know they can support stuff that ran on older versions. No problem. They do this for years. The guy that wrote that software well he moved on or he died or he retired or he's working somewhere else. IBM becomes too expensive so they move to the Amazon AWS cloud. Nobody even remembered that one piece of software so nobody could test it in validation before it went live. When it didn't work welp.. there's one example.\nSame thing like you have an old version of word perfect on your Windows laptop. It needed some special libraries that Microsoft supported forever. Microsoft can possibly test every single app that everyone runs on there devices with windows so they do the best based on whatever parameters they decide. Somebody decided one of those libraries was a security issue so they stopped including it. Your app no longer works and nobody cares bc nobody's making any money on it. So with 200,000 devices where a third of them are replaced every year for technological upgrades we still have 130,000 old machines and now we have to hope everything works with those new machines. Nobody can possibly know everything everyone's doing with that large of a user base so they do their best. Sometimes you are the engineer and you are the beta tester. Make any sense? My career spanned mainframe only, the start of the personal computer, the very first shared resources/ local networks. 56k ISDN newville Network tcp/ipx, spx, ipv4 v6, single points of failure dual networks, cloud computing token ring, ethernet, wireless,... Honestly it's amazing anything works!"", ""Toysoldier34: A common thing software developers do isn't so much reinventing stuff every time, often it is just piecing together prepackaged code others wrote and the effort is making it all work together. Due to how connected code is like this almost everything beyond the simplest of websites likely uses code written by others and it only takes one part of that to get abandoned to have a cascading effect through other programs. Something with the web or Windows for instance may get updated in a way that breaks that abandoned code library and now everything that used it now is broken too. This results often in someone making an updated replacement and slowly word trickles out and people change over to the replacement, or it just never gets fixed. When it never gets fixed you often just have to retire stuff, take out the broken feature bits and salvage the program, or rework your program to not rely on the broken abandoned code. \n\nThis is just one common way something can end up broken without anything within it changing directly as the rest of the code running around it is constantly changing between the OS code that runs your device to the code that runs with the internet.\n\nOnce the code breaks even when it can be updated and fixed whoever is in charge of that code may not feel it is worth the effort and it just remains that way forever. Due to the ever-changing nature of tech, it is hard to keep code that lives forever."", 'Thraex_Exile: Huh, I hadn’t though about it that way. So often times it’s not that the program is flawed but rather the program was being propped up by other services, softwares, etc. that we’re phased out? Basically making the program useless, even if nothing’s been changed in the past 50 years? \n\nIt’s great getting feedback on this stuff, bc most my tech knowledge is purely based on critical understanding. Absolutely zero understanding of the coding space, so if it isn’t analogous to real-world concerns I don’t understand it. I worked in Rhino 5 in college for architecture, and the closest I came to coding was using the Grasshopper attachment to create unique forms through coding rather than a actually CAR or BIM based drafting. Super cool to design skyscrapers w/o having to draw more than a handful of lines, but it was an eye-opener to see how much I could screw up my design with just a single new parameter. \n\nGlad there’s folks who enjoy speaking code language.

Thanks for u/Crackracket for the initial suggestion and noticing the common issue with dreamview."	46	"[""Mysecretpassphrase: CRITICAL POINTS TO UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM..\n\nThe dream view environment does not and will not replicate the colors at the edges of the screen. In fact it's design is to recreate regional colors not replicate exact colors. If Govee made this more widely understood it would save us users countless hours of frustration. In fact the system will not even attempt to duplicate the colors at the very edges of the screen. If you take a more critical look at your environment you will probably see that it does a good job of replicating regional colors and that should be your expectation. \n\nCALIBRATION The single focus of the calibration process is to define the edges of your television relative to the camera. It is not critical at all to make sure you hit the very outside edges of those little red squares. The system doesn't even attempt to replicate the colors on the first couple inches of the screen. You can prove this to yourself by looking for some screen test color test videos on YouTube. The first color bar in from the edge doesn't register any color on the LEDs and not until you move in about 4 in on my 75 in TV doesn't start to replicate the screen. Just get your pointers somewhere in the vicinity and you'll be fine. The calibration process does not set the white balance, saturation, nor the brightness.\n\nSATURATION, BRIGHTNESS, WHITE BALANCE The SATURATION settings do interplay with the white balance. What that means is that you'll have to play with both of them until you're almost satisfied. For some reason my environment looks best with a 1% saturation value. The BRIGHTNESS setting is more about your personal preferences than it is about making the color correct. Some people like to have a really bright ambient background, others just want to make the screen look a little bigger. Me, I like the brightness on the edges to be approximately the same brightness as the television screen. This one's up to you. WHITE BALANCE is the most frustrating setting in my opinion. Here's why.. the camera is extremely sensitive to the room lighting conditions. It can even be thrown off by reflections of artwork on the walls behind above and objects underneath the TV like a receiver. Many users have a little yellow spot on the screen where it should be white and it is usually a reflection from something else changing the color temperature that the camera sees. I had to remove some artwork from the wall above and behind my TV because it was putting out too much blue took the artwork down boom fixed it. Now, the most frustrating part... All your efforts at getting the color replication correct are only good for the exact environment in which you determined your preferred settings. WHAT? Yep. For example, if you got your settings perfectly in your room at night with the shades drawn and some other source of light like a table lamp, and they're perfect. You're so happy you took a video and uploaded it on the app and here on Reddit! You go to bed feeling fulfilled accomplished at peace with yourself because you know you got those colors correct. The next morning you turn the TV on again but the sunlight is coming in from outside you don't have the same table lamp on and your computer monitor is throwing out all kinds of blue... ALL OF YOUR WONDERFUL COLOR MATCHING EFFORTS WENT RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW. This system is very sensitive to ambient lighting conditions and cannot dynamically adjust for them. What do you do? Mostly you will only have to adjust the white balance for ambient lighting condition changes. Mostly. I have made peace with this by performing the color match under various lighting conditions morning afternoon evening and movie watching. I save each one as a snapshot and then it's as easy as pushing the right snapshot button. It's pretty clean solution actually until they come up with dynamic white balance. You can easily prove all this to yourself if you doubt. TIP: Examine the light sources near your television. Make note of the angle at which they will emit light that hits your screen. If that light bounces off your screen into the camera it will record it as if it's the screen. The closer other light sources are to the camera the more prevalent this will be. Also related, if you're one of those folks like me that who likes to experiment and you have moved your camera from the default the further away you move it out from the screen the more likely the camera will be impacted by other light sources. \n\nIn my opinion the best way to not experience disappointment with the dream view is to keep in mind that is not designed to replicate specific colors at the edges of the screen. If you drop back and look at how it's doing with the colors in that region you will probably be a little more satisfied. The company is very responsive to suggestions and with support but I think they could have done a much better job managing our expectations by pointing out the regional color matching I think all our expectations were for better performance right at the edges. Dynamic lighting and white balance would be a wonderful product enhancement that I wish everyone of us would write in and suggest.\n\nI have a high-end 75 inch Samsung of some sort with a T2. It replaced a t1 and is a dramatically improved product. I'm totally OCD and this dream view environment is suited perfectly to me obsessing over it so I have conducted extensive tests just because I'm a freak. Hopefully this has helped a little bit and if you think I can help more drop me a line.\n\nMysecretpassphrase"", 'Zhaopow: If you have setup your dreamview system but you are getting only one colour around the edge of your TV and not multiple colours you need to change the setting from ""All"" to ""Part"".\n\n\\- u/Crackracket', 'Mysecretpassphrase: Replied in a post asking where to find a test pattern I used in one of my videos posted here a while back.

I also own a particularly good, high CRI (color rendering index) white LED strip with no controller. It's great for doing color sensitive work though.

I really just want to be able to control the brightness, on and off on this white strip.

If I just soldered this white strip to say, the RED channel on a color RGBIC controller, could I just control my white strips' power and brightness by increasing and decreasing the red channel?

Even if govee sells a white wifi one, I doubt it's as high of a CRI. Though it might be easier to solder, I couldn't find one, they just had one with a remote, or a motion sensor.

EDIT: Instead of RGBIC I suppose it would make more sense to try it with the RGB basic, then solder the white to just one channel. Still, unsure if it would actually work, and I would rather not waste a whole strip just to try it."	0	[]

I'm after some advice - my tv is in a corner, not wallmounted (this isn't an option).

1673909106.0	16-Jan-2023 14:45:06	Dreamview brain dump.. also added to the faq	Mysecretpassphrase	9	10duzt3	Govee	https://www.reddit.com/r/Govee/comments/10duzt3/dreamview_brain_dump_also_added_to_the_faq/	"CRITICAL POINTS TO UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM..

The dream view environment does not and will not replicate the colors at the edges of the screen. In fact it's design is to recreate regional colors not replicate exact colors. If Govee made this more widely understood it would save us users countless hours of frustration. In fact the system will not even attempt to duplicate the colors at the very edges of the screen. If you take a more critical look at your environment you will probably see that it does a good job of replicating regional colors and that should be your expectation. 

CALIBRATION
The single focus of the calibration process is to define the edges of your television relative to the camera. It is not critical at all to make sure you hit the very outside edges of those little red squares. The system doesn't even attempt to replicate the colors on the first couple inches of the screen. You can prove this to yourself by looking for some screen test color test videos on YouTube. The first color bar in from the edge doesn't register any color on the LEDs and not until you move in about 4 in on my 75 in TV doesn't start to replicate the screen. Just get your pointers somewhere in the vicinity and you'll be fine.
The calibration process does not set the white balance, saturation, nor the brightness.

SATURATION, BRIGHTNESS, WHITE BALANCE
The SATURATION settings do interplay with the white balance. What that means is that you'll have to play with both of them until you're almost satisfied. For some reason my environment looks best with a 1% saturation value.
The BRIGHTNESS setting is more about your personal preferences than it is about making the color correct. Some people like to have a really bright ambient background, others just want to make the screen look a little bigger. Me, I like the brightness on the edges to be approximately the same brightness as the television screen. This one's up to you.
WHITE BALANCE is the most frustrating setting in my opinion. Here's why.. the camera is extremely sensitive to the room lighting conditions. It can even be thrown off by reflections of artwork on the walls behind above and objects underneath the TV like a receiver. Many users have a little yellow spot on the screen where it should be white and it is usually a reflection from something else changing the color temperature that the camera sees. I had to remove some artwork from the wall above and behind my TV because it was putting out too much blue took the artwork down boom fixed it.
Now, the most frustrating part... All your efforts at getting the color replication correct are only good for the exact environment in which you determined your preferred settings. WHAT? Yep. For example, if you got your settings perfectly in your room at night with the shades drawn and some other source of light like a table lamp, and they're perfect.  You're so happy you took a video and uploaded it on the app and here on Reddit! You go to bed feeling fulfilled accomplished at peace with yourself because you know you got those colors correct. The next morning you turn the TV on again but the sunlight is coming in from outside you don't have the same table lamp on and your computer monitor is throwing out all kinds of blue... ALL OF YOUR WONDERFUL COLOR MATCHING EFFORTS WENT RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW. This system is very sensitive to ambient lighting conditions and cannot dynamically adjust for them. What do you do? Mostly you will only have to adjust the white balance for ambient lighting condition changes. Mostly. I have made peace with this by performing the color match under various lighting conditions morning afternoon evening and movie watching. I save each one as a snapshot and then it's as easy as pushing the right snapshot button. It's pretty clean solution actually until they come up with dynamic white balance. You can easily prove all this to yourself if you doubt.
TIP: Examine the light sources near your television. Make note of the angle at which they will emit light that hits your screen. If that light bounces off your screen into the camera it will record it as if it's the screen. The closer other light sources are to the camera the more prevalent this will be. Also related, if you're one of those folks like me that who likes to experiment and you have moved your camera from the default the further away you move it out from the screen the more likely the camera will be impacted by other light sources. 

In my opinion the best way to not experience disappointment with the dream view is to keep in mind that is not designed to replicate specific colors at the edges of the screen. If you drop back and look at how it's doing with the colors in that region you will probably be a little more satisfied. The company is very responsive to suggestions and with support but I think they could have done a much better job managing our expectations by pointing out the regional color matching I think all our expectations were for better performance right at the edges. Dynamic lighting and white balance would be a wonderful product enhancement that I wish everyone of us would write in and suggest.

I have a high-end 75 inch Samsung of some sort with a T2. It replaced a t1 and is a dramatically improved product. I'm totally OCD and this dream view environment is suited perfectly to me obsessing over it so I have conducted extensive tests just because I'm a freak. Hopefully this has helped a little bit and if you think I can help more drop me a line.

I believe that many of us me included forget that there are a ton of color related controls for our televisions that can affect the dream view color matching process. In your quest for the perfect color matching add to your arsenal some of the following ideas. \n\n- These days all of our TVs come with various viewing modes, for example movie mode, sports, theater mode, dynamic, standard, knight, filmmaker, etc. All these roads are simply presets for brightness contrast color etc. Rotate through them to see if any of the settings improve your color matching. If not, go further into your settings and look at the various color options including RGB, color space, tint, colortone, WHITE BALANCE, etc to see if you can make some positive changes without destroying your viewing experience.', 'accursedvenom: I have a t1 and I could not get it to replicate correctly.

I am very happy with the product but I have two small drawbacks.

The second problem is that the yellow and orange colours come out mostly red, I've tried several camera positions and different calibrations but nothing works.
I have already adjusted the white balance and I have whites that match very well with what my screen produces. The saturation is at 1% and if I increase it the reds are even worse.

I have been browsing this subreddit over the past few days looking for the best option to solve my calibration and colour issue. I figured I may as well make a post to try and compile all the best ideas in one place. 

For context, I previously had the T1 55-65'' (12.5 foot) set-up on a ~2013 Samsung 1080p TV and had absolutely no issues with the calibration or colour. The camera was top mounted and after the first or second calibration, I never had to touch it again.

I have recently upgraded to a 75"" Sony X85k (4K HDR/LED) and I did not like the way the 12.5 foot LED strip looked on the back of the TV - the lights were either not projecting colours in the correct location or I had to spread out the LEDs to the very edge of the TV causing black voids in all 4 corners. Additionally, the camera from the 12.5 foot LED strip had trouble reaching all 4 corners of the TV during the calibration process.

I decided to purchase the 16.4 foot (75-85'' TV) T1 and the LED strips fit perfectly all the way around the edge of the TV. I have tried: top mount, bottom mount, lights on and off during calibration, the orange calibration cubes, the black and white calibrations videos on YouTube, and for some reason I cannot for the life of me get accurate colours

Skin tones are dark red or orange, blues are teal or purple, greens are yellow, etc. There is also a patch of lights (right above the camera if mounted on the bottom and below the camera if mounted on top) that seem to be consistently off-colour all the time. I have my brightness set to 20-30%, Saturation at 1%, and white balance pretty much dead center between cool and warm. The TV is mounted on a basement wall and 90% of the time I watch TV with the pot lights dimmed low or completely off. There is no ambient/natural light and there is nothing reflective on my fireplace/stand. The calibration itself seems to be correct, minus the issue above/below the camera. When I play a Hue light test on Youtube, the movement is fine, the colours are just not quite right.

From what I have gathered reading around, the TV itself (backlight etc.) is obviously older/different than the 2013 Samsung I have and the angle of which the camera is picking up the screen may be effecting the colour accuracy. One method could be mounting the camera a little further away from the screen on the bottom somewhere with a more head-on view of the TV screen. I have also read about ND filters, but it seems like the the views on those are either great or terrible. It seems to really depend on the TV's setup, ambient/natural light etc.  

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."	7	"[""Forsaken-Thought: Try adjusting the brightness to about 65%, saturation to 50% and play around with the white balance. Put a hue color test video from YouTube on and as it's playing make small adjustments to white balance until it gets as close to the colors as possible, then make further minor adjustments to the saturation levels and you should get pretty damn accurate"", ""Mysecretpassphrase: As an experiment rid that room of any other light temporarily than the TV and the DV. See if you can get the saturation brightness and white balance configured in a pleasing manner. Very high probability of success here. Remember what you were watching when you were tuning.\nPut your room back in its normal lighting situation. Replay that scene that you managed to get so perfectly color matched. The brightness will be off, the white balance will be off. Do it now again and then turn the lights off and you'll throw an expletive or two.\n\nI have a 75 inch high-end Samsung can't remember the model and the t2. I've done probably a hundred different experiments with extraneous lighting, brightness and contrast settings on the TVs etc. If a light source could bounce off your screen and up into your camera it will change how it perceives those colors in the screen.\n\nBy the way, calibration doesn't have to go all the way to the corners. The dream view looks at regional colors along the border. I have done a test though that shows the dream view doesn't even pick up any colors from the first four or five inches from my TVs edge. Talked to their engineers and they said yep I think that's when they made up the quote regional colors thing...\n\nHope that gives you something to look for and let us know what happened.\n\nEdit.. I didn't mention my saturation setting because it is always at 1%. No matter what I throw at it 1% looks the best."", ""Kubasratzka: Saturation 1% and relative brightness to around 22-32%, does WONDERS and dark scenes don't  blast weird colors on full brightness! 😁"", 'oh-NEE-ders: Thank you for your suggestions I’ll try them soon as I’m home!', 'BadBadUncleDad: Any update?', 'oh-NEE-ders: Yes! \n\nSo I experimented a ton and found that the top or bottom mounting was not picking the the screen’s colours, or even the screen itself correctly. Either the top corners were not calibrating correctly or wherever the camera was located, there would be a section that the camera couldn’t pick up either right below or right above the camera and it caused a completely off coloured projection on the very middle of the top/bottom of the TV\n\nI ended up securing my camera on my fireplace/media console below the screen using some double sided tape right behind my center speaker. Actually, the Center speaker also works as a ambient light blocker as I have a pot light about 6 feet away from the tv which impacted the camera when I originally tried to mount it on the bottom of the TV. This setup allows the camera to capture the screen entirely. The colours weren’t what they were on my previous set up on the 55 inch but they are a lot better.\n\nBrightness - 30%\nSaturation - 1%\nWhite Balance - 3 ticks from all the way blue. (I found anything, especially live sports, was way off with the balance in the middle(\n\nRelative Brightness is the only setting I still tend to play around a bit depending what I’m watching.', 'BadBadUncleDad: Nice! I just ordered a new TV and also these lights. First time using backlights. Excited to get it all set up.']"

65"" for shelves

20"" for cove above shelves

I have been looking that the  H619E1D1 (65 feet) for the shelves because it looks like I can run off of one power supply. I would like to pair it with  H619C1D1 (32 feet) for the cove lights. 

How do I add an additional string for the coves? 

Is there a power supply I can get that will run all of the light strings together or am I left with two inverters? (one for shelves and one for cove)

Can I group the light strings together? Can they also be run independently (like just the above shelf cove lights)?

I have multiple govee light products in my office.  Three light bulbs, light bars and the G1 monitor backlight.  Within the Govee Home app, I have them all set up in the same room.

What I am looking to do is have three separate light configurations that displays each of the lights differently.  They are as follows

1. **Work light - early morning:**  1 light bulb turned on with color White (warm light), G1 Monitor back light turned on with color white (warm light) ... The two other bulbs and light bars off
2. **Work light - day**:  *Same configuration as #1 above, but changing the white warm light to white cold light*
3. **Gaming:**  All lights on, all RGB colors.

Is it possible to save my lights into a configuration like what I mentioned above, and if so, do so in a manner that I can switch between them quickly (press of a button)?

*Note, my question isn't about how to set up the colors I mentioned or even saving the configurations with the exact names I provided above ... but just on how to configure all of the lights in my office each with specific settings and saved in separate configurations so I can quickly switch between them.  Right now, when I want to change the configuration, I'm manually going into each light setting and changing the color settings one at a time, and it's a little laborious.*"	1	"['drbroccoli00: Set the lights how you want for one scenario and then for each light press the ""Snapshot"" button (shows up as a floating icon on the right side that looks like a polaroid camera when viewing a single device).

The thing is the Govee Desktop will not see the light strip, and it does not seem to have a bluetooth option. I'm guessing that this means that the Govee Desktop is for Ethernet only. 

So my questions are : 

\- How do you tell if a light device is Bluetooth only , or if it has Ethernet capability? The box that the H617A comes in says Bluetooth and App on the front of it, but it seems that the Desktop app does not support bluetooth. 

\- Are there alternatives to the given apps / desktop software? 

\- Is there a hard wired Ethernet option, or is it only WiFi? 

\- Should I have picked a better model than the 617A? It seemed cheap entry level as I get to know the system.

I hope they allow greater ability for expansion, like being able to connect more than 10 hexagons together to be used as one unit.

And i want the ability to make a playlist of presets. I’m aware there is an autorun feature but i often use these lights where there is no wifi so the only way to change modes is manually.

does anybody know if there are plans to raise the rate limit of the Govee-API?

Any solutions on this, as I am pretty sure I cant put more than one color change within one request. DIY and such things aren't sill available as I can see in the documentation at
