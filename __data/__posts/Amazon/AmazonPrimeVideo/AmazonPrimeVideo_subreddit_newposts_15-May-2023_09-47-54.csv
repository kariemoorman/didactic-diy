Hibiscus02	1	13ideeh	AmazonPrimeVideo	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/13ideeh/why_do_some_episodes_not_have_cc/	"I've been watching Law & Order SVU recently on prime video (the later seasons that they bothered to make available in my country at least) and I'm having this issue often. I have Auditory Processing Disorder, and english also isn't my first language, so I watch with closed captions on, but some episodes will just randomly not have them available??? 

Without mentioning the fact that some of the captions are really bad even when they do work, like having two words not being spaced, skipping entire lines of dialogue and in some parts either going too slow or too fast to match what's being said. I just turn the volume up and do my best when it happens, but I can't imagine how much this would suck if you're hard of hearing or deaf. I've had to skip some episodes before where I just couldn't understand what was happening."	1	"[""o0CYV3R0o: Amazon has a affliction to putting subtitles in the content unless its newer content or their own exclusive content.\n\nAt least this seems to have been the case for the many years I've been a subscriber in my region.\n\nI suspect a part from the mentioned new and exclusive content the rest is a after thought for Amazon probably because it's part of a package which people subscribe to mainly for the free deliveries.""]"

For Example in ""The Walking Dead"" season 4, episode 6 at around 29:00 a character says in the context of chess pieces:

""It's a pawn""

But the subtitle said ""It's a farmer"".

And this is just one example. It's in nearly every dialogue throughout the series. I saw the same also for example in Fargo seasons 3 and 4.

It looks like the English subtitles are automatic translations of subtitles from a different language, or something like that. Which seems unlikely for such shows which are clearly made with English as the first language.

&#x200B;

Any ideas what is happening here?"	5	"['Fun-Investigator3256: The answer is because the subtitles and the dub are both translated from the same source, usually by different people. These translations end up being different as phrases can be translated in different ways, and different translators will speak differently.', 'koala7: But all those examples are not dubbed. English is the original audio language.', ""Fun-Investigator3256: It’s because the subtitler's goal is to convey the meaning of the dialogue in as few words as possible so the audience is watching the film rather than reading a long footnote. That’s why it’s often paraphrased.\n\nThere are also films with word by word captions. And there are also films with both options. It depends on your preference."", ""koala7: Thanks for the reply. While I can see that happening, I really don't think this is the case here.\n\nThe replacements are neither shorter, nor easier to grasp. Often it's simply paraphrasing the content, sometimes resulting in unnatural sentences, and sometimes like in the chess example they get plain wrong/confusing.\n\nI really looks like a back and forth translation or something like that."", 'Fun-Investigator3256: Gotta file a complaint to Amazon Prime. \U0001faf6']"

Amazons FreeVee adds another level of older content in a shortened commecial format that is not irritating. Thursday Night Football is also ernjoyable and I make use of the variety of broadcasting formats Amazon makes available. While it's nice that Amazon offers the addition of other streaming services to their feed, I do not take advantage of them as I can usually find deals offered by the streamers themselves that I don't see matched by Amazon. As an example, I get Max free from my ISP, and Paramount+ free from my phone service provider. Overall, I would say that of all my streaming services I use Amazon Prime Video the most.

1680177689.0	30-Mar-2023 05:01:29	What up with the online interface changes?	fatesrider	2	126kvy6	AmazonPrimeVideo	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/126kvy6/what_up_with_the_online_interface_changes/	"I haven't been watching Prime Video for a while and thought I'd check in to see what new things were being offered.  For the sake of clarity, I never watch movies on any hand-held device.  This is accessing Prime Video through a web browser.  I was (at the least) dismayed by the new user interface.  Actually, it pissed me off to no end.

The number of selections was cut by 75% to make the selection boxes bigger.  There are fewer rows to see at a glance because of this.  It's now so big, I got a text from an astronaut friend on the ISS asking me to move the selection down so they could see what other movies were there as they were passing in orbit overhead.

I may be old, but I am NOT blind.  

I don't understand why they'd make each selection so huge, and not allow the user to shrink the screen down (without making EVERYTHING on Amazon microscopic by comparison).  At most, I can only see five options across, and at most, three rows.  I USED to be able to see seven rows and at least nine options per row.  It shows 15 at most now.  It used to show 63 at most.  And that ""best case"" for the new user interface makes everything else in my screen harder to read.

What's worse, the stupid options are basically billboards with whatever font of the time the graphic artist decided to use after inhaling a blunt and a significant number of the damned show titles can't be easily read, even with the placards they're displayed on four times bigger than they were.

But the stupid LIVE events category has perfectly legible titles in identical font added to them

And where is the ""free to me"" option?  I don't pay for Prime to BUY videos or shows or episodes.  Nor do I want to see ads from a streaming service I already PAY FOR.   Why the hell do they think people cut the cord in the first place?

But that  option seems to have been removed, making FINDING something to watch 1000% more difficult (both in time and selection) because I have to slog through ad-filled, paid-for and other ""not free to me"" crap to find the stuff my money should already pay to view.

I've always hated the Amazon Prime user interface.  It's bulky, useless, time-consuming and straight up aggravating.  But IMHO, they've gone and made it WORSE.

I think the user should have more options in customizing their UI so they can spend less time raking out the drek they DON'T want and more time exploring what's available. 

1.  Even with the engorged, wall to wall selections, letting the user add to or remove categories on the main Prime Video page would immensely help them.  They'd at least see things in categories they want to look at instead of having to constantly scroll past dozens of categories they don't want to look at.  
2. Standardizing a title font for each offering instead of relying on the often questionable decisions of the graphic artist who made the titling for the poster would save much aggravation, and allow the posters to be SMALLER without needing a magnifying glass to see the titles in them.
3. Dump the ""Shows we think you'll like"" option - they haven't gotten anything in there right in the more than ten years I've had Prime.
4. For the browser, make a click mandatory to activate anything, not just a cursor hover over.  There's so little room to put the mouse on the screen without some window enlarging and blocking everything else it's a horrific experience to brows titles.  The newly ginormous title windows themselves make that horrific experience completely intolerable now.

This is a service WE PAY FOR.  WE, the customers, should have some say in how that service is presented to us.  Amazon added Prime Video along the way, but I've always thought Amazon treated it like a bastard step-child with respect to providing a good user experience.  This giant leap backward is the most egregiously anti-customer step Amazon has taken recently, but it's not the only one where Prime itself has become far less attractive to continue to pay for (Fresh delivery charges anyone?).

So, Amazon, stop screwing around with things making them demonstrably worse for your customers, or you will lose a LOT of customers, and, more importantly to your sensibilities, a lot of revenue as well.  You're setting yourself up to be replaced by someone who does it better (not a high bar to clear with the tons and tons of ""delayed deliveries"" lately) and with a much more pleasant customer experience.

Given the trend Amazon has taken in removing features and making the user experience that much worse, I'm about to cancel my Prime subscription.  I don't suspect I'm alone in that thought, either.  

Two stars out of five, Amazon.  Prime has very poor service compared to how it used to be, it offers much fewer options than before, and the experience is becoming increasingly poor.  Each of those have cost you a star.  

I cancel at one star.   I highly recommend you listen to your customers instead of your accountants."	1	"['prozacgod: Noticed this today on my amazon prime in the browser,  ""Free to Me"" is missing.\n\nThey just want people to pirate videos at this point... NOBODY really wants midrolled ads.']"

As well as some other randoms I’d like to check out. IF this is explainable. Why would the majority of their movies be leaving if the MGM company own the movies? 
And it seems to be basically every single movie in their popular section or atleast every one I’ve wanted to watch.  Now is this just something that shows up for no reason and they won’t really leave because I’d rather take my time with these movies and not keep trying to rush as many as I can with work and all. If they are leaving then does anyone know the reason for this? 
Sorry if I’m being slow here"	3	['gingersnappie: With the splintering of streaming services comes things jumping platforms constantly.  It’s hard to keep track of for sure.  End of month is a standard time for things to expire and it seems that is what is happening with the titles here.\n\nAs far as ownership goes, sometimes services pay extra to be the exclusive streamer.  Another service could have something like that with the movies here, so MGM has to rotate those titles off.  Other things come into play as well, like additional costs due to shared rights (MGM may not be sole owner) and/or monies due to music rights/performers/crew/misc.  All those can mean that even if the streamer owns the title, they still have costs to pay in order to offer it on their platform.  They weigh the costs of titles v subscribers as a part of their metrics on what to offer each month.  If they want to shift budget to other titles, they’ll shuffle things around as needed.', 'M05B: Aw man so they remove basically their whole catalogue 😢 as far as I see there are like 2 movies not leaving.

With Prime Music you don't get a whole album of anything, the available catalog is much less than what is pitched to you, the volume is messed up, and there's constant playback issues (e.g., the song skips around).

I realised these would fall under the specific sub-genre ‘Fantasy Comedy.’ Fantasy Comedy is not as popularly defined as ‘dramedy’ for example, so I see redditors struggling to express what they mean when asking for recommendations. Fantasy Comedy is becoming more and more popular but doesn’t have a dedicated space for discussion and recommendation.

So I made [r/FantasyComedy](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyComedy/)

Come join if you, too, are a fan of this sub-genre, and would like to discuss and give/receive recommendations for funny and fantastical TV series, movies and books. It’s a place to chat about speculative fiction which makes us laugh. If you’re drawn into hilarious stories which question things like “how would vampires/zombies survive in this day and age?”, “what happens when we die?” or “what would happen if we all had superpowers?” then [r/FantasyComedy](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyComedy/) is the place for you!"	2	"['AutoModerator: This looks like it is a technical or account support request.

Anyway, not sure where to ask this question (I tried asking Paramount ages ago, but got no reply/help).

I was wondering why certain shows on certain channel such as Paramount+ are not in HD when viewed via Paramount+ Amazon Channel? Here is an example (it's mostly older shows)  [https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/macgyver](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/macgyver) the quality is much better when viewing through Paramount directly and also on Roku Amazon Channel, but the Paramount channel only has the original lower quality SD version (I can definitely confirm this, as the video quality was closer to an upgraded/remastered HD when I was viewing through Paramount+ directly last year when I had a subscription, but when I try and watch it now via Paramount+ Amazon Channel it's low quality SD - Just like what Justwatch reflects on the page of the show)."	6	"[""Deadpool-fan-466: This sub covers all versions of Prime Video.\n\nThe issue you're facing is not uncommon.

1. After noticing the signature their first priority should be to make the fake bills unusable in market. When you know what's the difference between the fake and original bill it would just be a matter of a small update to CT-600 software and make 12000cr useless(big defeat to crime organization). Instead, they plan to catch the person who made the notes. If it can be drawn by hand and noticed by eye, surely a software can detect it too.
2. If you (Megha) identified that the 500 note and 2000 note had the same signature and the same person designed them, then logically instead of trying to catch him in a trap through minister, she should go back to her list of 11 printing press in Mumbai and try to narrow down on them.
3. Why would they give a normal bank officer (whose only strength btw is knowing the difference between original and counterfeit) so much priority on a field mission that she gets out of the car to look for the criminal? (Her exact words, ""f\*\*\* it, I am getting out""). Are you kidding me, that too on your first field mission? Why would they even take her on the mission?? (maybe to sabotage the mission)
4. No person who is the mastermind of such a big crime organization would ever replace his right hand with a two-day-old acquaintance whose only skill is he can draw the exact replica of notes. No experience of the crime world, routes of distribution, or even holding a gun is now the right hand, talk about exponential growth.
5. The mole in Mansoor's team giving information to Bilal could easily give the names of Sunny, Firoz to Bilal too. By now everyone is calling him Sunny not ARTIST.
6. Michael and team make a mess of every mission they are on. Why wouldn't you put handcuffs on Mansoor Dalal when you caught him in Kathmandu? They are walking out with him on street like friends going out to eat momos.
7. The lady (Shaira) who intimidates Mansoor Dalal, says something along the lines of ""you hurried in this operation, you should have taken more time. Then while leaving gives him an ultimatum to get the money in market as soon as possible"" I mean, what??
8. Why is the Mansoor Dalal and team worried about media showing 12000cr counterfeit money in market, how does that hurt them? Isnt't that their goal to get the money in market. Whats the need to panic and rush things.
9. And last, who the f\*\*\* sleeps with a person without having no clue about their profession."	0	[]

This is really useful when you want to know an actor in a movie, which other films they have been in, and with a press of a button being able to launch a found movie on the fly, or simply return to the paused movie being viewed without skipping  a beat.  

Freevee, formerly IMDb TV, formerly Free Drive, owned by Amazon, does not have the X-Ray service in the Freevee app/interface.  While watching a movie (it's paused right now), I pressed the up-arrow on the remote and only saw the standard playback controls - no X-Ray feature.  Knowing the relationship between the Prime Video and Freevee app data, I suspected that if I stop the video in Freevee, switch to the Amazon Prime Video app, and then search for and resume the same movie from within Prime Video, there was a chance that being a Prime member might pay off again by providing X-Ray information, and voila! there it was -- In Scene, Cast, and Characters for this movie title.  Previous observations showed me that, like Prime Video as well, not all titles include the X-Ray feature, but this workaround for Prime members is worth the few remote clicks to watch that movie on Freevee from the Prime Video app instead.

Just wanted to share one of the little known tricks I stumbled upon, and both the Prime member and Amazon could benefit, as this may be just one more reason to become a Prime member if you've been undecided as whether to purchase Prime membership or not.  Happy viewing!"	0	[]

I wanted to watch the series everybody hates chris on prime but I noticed that you get alot of ads on prime so I searched for a way to fix that and I found a solution:

You just need to deinstall the prime app and reinstall the app. Your first startup will give you endless streams without ads. After you restarted the app you will have ads again.

When you have autologin enabled it takes less than 30 seconds to do so.

This was tested on an Android device (Android 12) with the prime app version: 3.0.339.11547

&#x200B;

So before they fix this just get your hands on the .apk so you can perform this trick in the future aswell ;)

If you use different versions or iOS devices please tell us if it works for you aswell."	4	"[""Bossdad4life442: In your post title you talked about freevee prime without ads.

It feels like a kind of discrimination, that as a Prime Video subscriber, I'm being treated differently simply because of the region I'm in.

HBO Max too isn't available for people in Asia but the outdated/now-deprecated HBO Go, is. Americans and Europeans get to enjoy the newer one while we Asians get the old stuff.

I wanted to do a test to see which had more ads/ is better.

So first, I’d recommend a free app called JustWatch (also a website JustWatch.com) to find the shows you want to watch and see which service it’s on.

Okay. So Hulu’s With Ads plan in $7.99 a month where Prime’s freevee is free to everyone.

Hulu had 17 ads that were around 15-30 seconds in length normally 3-4 at a time.

Prime’s FreeVee had 8 ads around 15 seconds in length at 2 at a time.

There is things I like about the services that others don’t have, like example, Hulu has the movie for Burn Notice in the right place, at the end of Season 4. But Prime if you wanna know a person’s name in the show you can look easily.

Which is better for the with ads…. Prime. Not only is it free but has so much less ads. Hulu charges 8USD and has 17 ads.

Either Hulu is being really scummy with it or Prime is being really generous. I’m gonna go with Hulu being scummy. If I was the primary subscriber I’d unsubscribe from Hulu and save myself $8.

Edit for clarification:

I watched 1 episode on each service but still with that Hulu should of been better because you pay for it.

Also I like that Prime you can skip the intro and recap. Just seems more clean."	14	"['LeoIrish: I do like Freevee - and they are putting out some solid content as well.', 'ChuckNorrisOhNo: I hate both of them.

I’m not good at that but I’ll do my best. Long story short, there’s 8 teenage girls from all over the US that get sent by their parents/caregivers on a retreat to take care of their mental health, because they all got issues. Along the way, their plane crashes and they land on a deserted island where they must survive. Each episode cuts between the group’s life on the island and the events that lead up to each of them being sent on the therapeutic retreat. There’s also a twist; the girls start to realize that the plane crash may not have been a horrific accident, but that it might have been orchestrated on purpose for some reason.

The show got cancelled after Season 2. I was so sad. I seriously loved this show. I thought I found this hidden gem when it first came out, and I honestly thought it was going to be lame when I first clicked to watch it. I was just bored and wanted to find something new to watch. Boy was I wrong. I got so invested in the characters. I was in my early 20’s when it first came out and wanted to see a coming-of-age kinda show. What drew me to picking it was that it was an all woman cast, which I LOVED. Plus I love survivalist kind of shows. It’s also an LGBTQIA+ show, but even though I’m straight/cis, I still liked it just for being an all woman show and for young adults and being survivalist. 

If you haven’t seen it yet, I highly recommend if that sounds like your kinda flavor. Also, apparently there’s a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/save-the-wilds) being signed by fans to bring the show back for another season, since it got dropped so abruptly. I’m just another fan and just stumbled across the petition, but if you happen to love the show, maybe we can get enough signatures for another network to pick up the show for another season?"	4	"['abroadsui1: You’d like Yellowjackets on Showtime!

You don’t have to switch from app to app to watch what you want. \n* Sometimes the functionality of standalone apps suck, while the Prime app is more reliable. \n* Most of your streaming charges can come through one provider.\n* Some of the smaller services don’t have apps available on other platforms, like on some smart TVs.\n* With Prime you get 6 profiles, so you can separate content by profile if desired.\n\n\n*CONS:*    \n* SOME services will allow you to login to the standalone app AND via Prime, while others do not. Half the time it seems totally arbitrary.     \n* Your subscription to a Prime channel does not allow login to a standalone app on Firestick.    \n* Sometimes the standalone apps provide free bundled programming, while Amazon does not offer it. For example, Paramount plus now allows direct access to Showtime content free of charge, which Amazon isn’t participating in. It’s not that it’s a perk only for standalone customers, Amazon just isn’t providing that access because they already have a Showtime channel with subscribers.     \n* Amazon redesigned their UI last year, but it’s still a mess in terms of organization. It’s better than some standalone apps, but the design does not account for/accommodate the fact that it’s an aggregate service with 10x the content volume of a single standalone streamer. There’s a whole new “My List” menu,and it’s only organized by  4 categories: Movies or TV, Purchased vs via subscription.

I think it’s something like 4% of users but don’t quote me on that.

HFR needs to be a feature on streaming outside YouTube/Twitch	HydraSpectre1138	4	107ky5q	AmazonPrimeVideo	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/107ky5q/annoyed_that_older_shows_are_improperly/	"So, I know Paramount+ operates on Amazon’s infrastructure.

I love watching older shows on streaming, but what always bothered me was that these old 50i/60i shows are deinterlaced with half the framerate.

Interlacing basically flickers with half-frames to somehow fit 50fps or 60fps content in a 25fps/30fps signal, and it only natively works on CRTs.

Interlaced content and signals need to be deinterlaced to be properly viewed on flat panels. Proper deinterlacing should provide a 50fps or 60fps experience. But most streaming services top out at 30fps.

This really hurts when watching sports documentaries too, since they are intended to be seen in HFR.

This is the main issue (alongside missing a handful of episodes) of why I wish the old Nick show Clarissa Explains It All gets a DVD release in the proper interlaced 60fps presentation with all episodes. Season 1 got a now-OOP DVD but it had borked colours and no later seasons. I just want the complete Clarissa series in proper 60fps HFR and no missing episodes.

But the documentary series My Life in Gaming is only 30fps on Prime Video, and has to be viewed on YouTube for the intended 60fps.

I am hoping that Avatar: The Way of Water would popularise HFR on streaming. Blu-ray doesn’t support 48fps yet but streaming can. So I hope Avatar 2’s streaming debut on Disney+ would inspire copycats for HFR features."	6	"[""o0CYV3R0o: Amazon doesn't give a @#£% sadly a lot of their older films have all sorts of issues another being unwatchable high contrast!\n\nMany have commented and I've even contacted them about it and was told they'd look into the issue and years later nothing has been done.\n\nAmazon Prime Video is only a after thought for them they only care about their market place."", ""Davikins: I'm with you so far as the option should exist.

anyone figure anything out yet? thank you."	3	"['TrackFittyTwo: Same here. Still out of sync.', 'VaderSaidNoooooo: I\'m running a very old roku 3 and even on my old roku 4 ultra (2016) I have the same problem. Both the audio is out of sync and it seems to have a slight pause or stutter when playing video every 5-7 seconds or so when watching a live game. I am running wired 100mb connection. If I try to make a buffer and rewind it five minutes so I am not watching live it still does it. But I did find a fix for it that has been working so far even tonight for the season and it is this...\n\nI go to the back of my roku and unplug the ethernet cable and wait. It will show the spinning thing in the middle of the screen then it will pull up a error screen showing a few options, I ignore both and keep the ethernet cable unplugged. Then it will finally show a error screen saying ""something went wrong"" please try again later...etc. After I get that error screen I then plug in the ethernet cord right away and wait and I do not touch the remote to say ""ok"" just leave it and then when it starts playing again it works without the stuttering or audio sync issues.\n\nThe only thing I got to work on wireless was to reboot my router while watching the game on the roku and that worked. but I had to turn off my router and then turn it back on. Nobody complained or noticed but then it did start playing like it was supposed to after that. It\'s not an ideal fix and I should not have to do that for it to work . These two methods have worked for me all season so far even on both of my old roku\'s to fix the audio and stuttering.\n\nSo good luck as these ""fixes"" are not really that but they do get it to work so I can enjoy the game so the audio is in sync and it does not stutter anymore. These problems only show up while watching the live games and all the movies I watch are fine even though the devices I am using are old.\n\nHopefully this might work to help someone else with this problem, sorry that it\'s so much to read and I hope it makes sense. And please if anyone else knows anything else or any other secrets please speak up cause this problem is quite the annoying thing. thank you.']"

If Amazon Prime would pick this up and partner up with wizards of the coast and a decent amount of budget would be involved. \n\nMagic the gathering story and lore starting from the Thran novel depicts an ancient race of technologically advanced artificers or people who specialize in inventing or creating artifacts and automatons with the use of power stones in a world where magic and advanced technology thrive. It would be cool to see constructs and floating artifacts/ornithopters and automatons powers stones and one of the main protagonist/antagonist who is a charismatic eugenicist yawgmoth who conducts morally questionable experiments to help a city being ravaged by a plague caused by power stones infection which is caused by the heavy reliance and utilization of powerstones by the thran civilization. Because of this Yawgmoth capitalizes on this and presents himself as a saviour to propel himself polictically and rise to power. This also has a great war where different races engage in and are wiped out by a device. It has lots of themes of political intrigue/plotting/advanced technology and concepts of exploitation of resources and manipulation  and war love and plague. There is also a discovery of a new plane of existence which holds a promise for treatment of those afflicted by the disease caused by power stone usage. It\'s an interesting novel for anyone who\'s interested it\'s author is J Robert King and it\'s title is the The Thran. (Plus there are cool hoover chairs and floating citadel in the Thran)\n\nAnd another TV adapation could be the sequel to this which is called the Artifact Cyle The Brothers War which is about 2 artificers prodigy urza and mishra who had a falling out which eventually led to a war with both brothers rising to power and leading opposing sides/forces that changed their continent forever ushering the Ice Age. These are some amazing high concept fanstasy/sci-fi / political intrigue/drama tv series and could introduce the concept of planeswalking a power/ability of powerful planeswalkers whos ""spark"" has awakened opening up to possibilities and opening up the multiverse on developing more spin off series on the various planes and story arcs and legendary characters of Magic the Gathering.', 'Deadpool-fan-466: So ""what if..."" situations are allowed here now?', 'boundless888: I guess']"

If Amazon Prime would pick this up and partner up with wizards of the coast and a decent amount of budget would be involved. 

Magic the gathering story and lore starting from the Thran novel depicts an ancient race of technologically advanced artificers or people who specialize in inventing or creating artifacts and automatons with the use of power stones in a world where magic and advanced technology thrive. It would be cool to see constructs and floating artifacts/ornithopters and automatons powers stones and one of the main protagonist/antagonist who is a charismatic eugenicist yawgmoth who conducts morally questionable experiments to help a city being ravaged by a plague caused by power stones infection which is caused by the heavy reliance and utilization of powerstones by the thran civilization. Because of this Yawgmoth capitalizes on this and presents himself as a saviour to propel himself polictically and rise to power. This also has a great war where different races engage in and are wiped out by a device. It has lots of themes of political intrigue/plotting/advanced technology and concepts of exploitation of resources and manipulation  and war love and plague. There is also a discovery of a new plane of existence which holds a promise for treatment of those afflicted by the disease caused by power stone usage. It's an interesting novel for anyone who's interested it's author is J Robert King and it's title is the The Thran. (Plus there are cool hoover chairs and floating citadel in the Thran)

And another TV adapation could be the sequel to this which is called the Artifact Cyle The Brothers War which is about 2 artificers prodigy urza and mishra who had a falling out which eventually led to a war with both brothers rising to power and leading opposing sides/forces that changed their continent forever ushering the Ice Age. These are some amazing high concept fanstasy/sci-fi / political intrigue/drama tv series and could introduce the concept of planeswalking a power/ability of powerful planeswalkers whos ""spark"" has awakened opening up to possibilities and opening up the multiverse on developing more spin off series on the various planes and story arcs and legendary characters of Magic the Gathering."	0	[]

Also, it'd be nice to be able to come in late and start watching TNF from the beginning instead of having to wait until Friday to watch the replay. Ph, and are you ever going to integrate seasons like every other service?

How is it a multi-billion dollar company doesn't seem to have the money to build a decent streaming interface? My Tablo lets me time shift live OTA TV, and when the recording is done it provides thumbnails so I can skip to the exact spot I want. It also understands sometimes I pause to look at something on the screen rather than grab a snack (which also doesn't need the transport graphics), so it removes the graphics after a few seconds.

TheNumber152003	0	zm9hut	AmazonPrimeVideo	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/zm9hut/is_the_koala_brothers_in_169_on_prime_video/	"""The Koala Brothers"" is a show that used to air on Playhouse Disney/Disney Junior. And since it's not on Disney Plus, Prime Video is the only service where you can watch it. And you have to buy the episodes. Not watch it freely. The show did used to be on Netflix, but it got removed from there sometime in the mid or late 2010's.

The original aspect ratio for the show is 16:9, but when it was broadcast on Playhouse Disney and Disney Junior, it was cropped to 4:3. The episodes uploaded on the official The Koala Brothers YouTube channel use the show's original 16:9 aspect ratio, but some of the episodes that are not from there are in 4:3. (most likely the episodes that were ripped from DVD prints) So I would like to know if the show is presented in its original 16:9 aspect ratio or just 4:3 cropped like the Disney broadcasts for anyone who bought the episodes. But we didn't buy them."	6	"[""Deadpool-fan-466: Plenty of shows in the early to mid-2000s had 16:9 aspect ratio, but were broadcast in 4:3 because the transition to 16:9 wasn't completed then.\n\nI didn't buy the show either, but looks like the episodes are in 16:9.\n\nYou can try asking at r/amazonprime"", ""TheNumber152003: What about iTunes?

I think the show started broadcasting in 16:9 starting with Season 4. Tickle U on Cartoon Network also aired Peppa Pig 4:3 cropped. But, when you watch her on Prime Video, the Season 1-3 episodes are in original 16:9 instead of 4:3 cropped. \n\nThe same also goes for Lazytown, Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! and Yo Gabba Gabba. They were all produced in 16:9 just like The Koala Brothers and Peppa Pig, but they were broadcast on Nick Jr. in 4:3 cropped. (I think Yo Gabba Gabba started broadcasting in original 16:9 starting in 2011, and when Lazytown moved to Sprout in 2011, the 2004-2007 episodes were broadcast in original 16:9) And... The Wiggles Show marked The Wiggles transition to 16:9, but Playhouse Disney cropped it to 4:3 when they aired it. \n\nEdit: Wait, The Wiggles actually switched to 16:9 in 2002 (Lights, Camera Action, Wiggles), not The Wiggles Show in 2005!\n\nOther shows that were produced in 16:9 but broadcast in 4:3 are Charlie and Lola on Playhouse Disney/Disney Junior, 3rd and Bird on Disney Junior, and Growing Up Creepie on Discovery Kids.

Every night I fall asleep to it, so the next night I need to back up an episode or so.   But amazon can't deal with that at all:

* amazon starts any episode with where the progress ended, so you always start at the end of a rewatched episode.  No way to start an episode from the beginning.
* trying to rewatch an episode already at its end will cause amazon to skip that episode.  So,  amazon will flip through ""watched"" episodes until it gets to content that hasn't been watched.
* the progress bars on ""watched"" episodes don't make sense.. why are they 2/3rds?
* there's no way to tell what episode you're watching, because when paused, it now only tells you the series title and not the episode number/title
* different people trying to watch the same series out of sync:  forget it.

Better Call Saul
The Sopranos
Lost
The Wire
Rome
Gomorrah
Game of Thrones
House of the Dragon
Boardwalk Empire
The Handmaid’s Tale
Stranger Things

Banshee

Summary

Director Michael Grandage develops the story with sobriety, fluency and delicacy, but at the same time, without concessions and without the false modesty typical of a certain oily quality English cinema, supported by an outstanding leading sextet. A film that is also very relevant a few days before the World Cup is held in a country like Qatar, which in the middle of 2022 criminally represses homosexuality, like the England of the 50s where most of the story takes place.

FalleenFan	1	yslrc2	AmazonPrimeVideo	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/yslrc2/any_way_to_know_which_rentals_are_original_hd/	"I often look for HD versions of movies. I will see that many movies were only ever released physically on DVD with no Blu-ray release, so only Standard Definition.

Prime Video will often for those films advertise an HD rental. I *assume* that this is merely scaling the SD content to HD resolution, rather than Amazon (and other similar services) having magical access to a ""original HD"" version of the movie.

1. Can anybody verify that these situations are scaled-up versions, and
2. Is there any way at all to know when an actual HD source is feeding the HD stream versus when it's just a blown-up SD file?

Thanks all!"	1	"['Deadpool-fan-466: ""Many movies were only ever released physically on DVD"" seems like an over-exaggeration, since most of those movies are now available either on Blu-ray or streaming/rental.\n\nWhen a ""DVD-only"" movie/series shows up as ""HD"" (or higher) in streaming/rental, it usually means one of two things:\n\n* The streaming/rental service did an ""upscale"" of their own. It\'s better than the DVD version, but doesn\'t look as good as ""native"" HD.\n* The studio did the remaster & then gave it to the streaming/rental service. It\'s much better than the DVD version.\n\nTo answer your question, you can go to [blu-ray.com](https://blu-ray.com) & search for the movie.

I haven't seen any other commentary or investigation on Kyrie's explanation besides this article:

[https://netswire.usatoday.com/2022/10/29/kyrie-irving-full-explanation-for-why-he-promoted-an-antisemitic-filmkyrie-irvings-full-explanation-for-why-he-promoted-an-antisemitic-film/](https://netswire.usatoday.com/2022/10/29/kyrie-irving-full-explanation-for-why-he-promoted-an-antisemitic-filmkyrie-irvings-full-explanation-for-why-he-promoted-an-antisemitic-film/)

Kyrie's quote:

""***So, that day particularly, I went home and I was on Google. Of course people love that search engine, but I wasn’t looking for any antisemitic stuff, or any thing specifically going at any other race of people. I looked up my name and what it means, and it’s a title given to Christ. Philippians 2:11. And my name translates into Hebrew language as Yahweh.***

***So I went on to Amazon Prime, and I was like ‘you know what? Let me see if there are any documentaries on Yahweh.’ So, went in the search bar, typed in ‘Yahweh,’ that came up. Went out, shared it on my platform… that was my night.""***

First, could there be anything more narcissistic than googling your own name to find something to watch? In my own investigation, I looked up ""Kyrie"" translations. It is not a Hebrew name. It's Greek, and translates to ""Lord"". I suppose that's close enough to Yahweh, but there is a distinction. In fact, Philippians 2:11 (which Kyrie referenced) highlights this distinction: ""... and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."" It's unclear to me how Kyrie could have used google to conclude that his Hebrew name is ""Yahweh"". Unless... does Kyrie think that he is God? Like actually God??

I also did some Amazon prime video searches using ""Yahweh"", ""Yhwh"", ""Yahweh documentary"", or ""Yhwh documentary"" as key words. The documentary ""Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America"" does not show up in any of these searches. What gives? Also what else do you think is on Kyrie's amazon prime video search history?"	0	[]

It was to the point where I literally could not make out what was going on. I looked at my TV settings, changed some things around but nothing worked. Could this be a creative choice the movie I was watching made? Turns out, no. Another user on here mentioned the same thing. And another. I decided to rent the movie on Youtube just to see if there was a difference, and voila! There was! It was much brighter and extremely clear to see those darker scenes. So this begs the question, is Amazon compressing or doing some sort of post processing to all of their videos like this??? I've been renting movies through Amazon for years and this is the first time it's been an issue. Is there a way to get a refund? I assume no based on my recent searches.

Great, I'll be able to catch the game when I get off work awesome!

After I did everything I could find to do through searching, added to watchlist, made sure it said recording enabled, ect. Then I got off work and was pumped to watch my home team in KC play.

Got off work about 11p EDT and started watching the game and saw about the first 7 mins of game time and then the steam cut off and wouldn't let me watch anymore as the game had ended.

Reached out to support and the overall response that I got was that you can only watch the recording while the game is live and after the game ends, that's at, can't watch any more of the game.

This brings me to the point of my discussion; why caller it recording in the first place and also what is the actual point of this feature? I feel like at best it should be called enhanced playback or something along those lines and also if this is that restricted, it should be more clearly stated somewhere and not have to go through support to find out there is no actual recording going on to speak of.

TLDR: Recording feature doesn't actually record the game and allow later playback after game has ended. Should be called something else and restrictions more clearly stated."	3	['DARKCYD: Yeah, I couldn’t figure that out either.\nI do most of prime watching through TiVo, and works pretty good as an interface.\nWatch all my sportsings on a typical 30 minute delay to haul through commercials and halftime.\nHit “Record” a little after 7pm to do….. never even saw a way to go back and rewatch a play once it started.

I could accept the snake ring with a friggin stone in it. I could accept Rand tossing his bow on the ground. I could accept Egwene being shoved off a cliff as a coming of age thingy. I could accept Moraine in pants... modern audience, creative license, film is not writing. Different medium, differences are necessary.

It got harder and harder to accept... Perrin married and owning the forge... Mat using vulgar language in town in the inn, where Nyneave or a counsel member might hear it... 

Then you cast Mat's dad as a slovenly womanizing cheater and his mom as a drunk? His sisters as dirty children wondering is mommy is sick again? 

It can't get better from here. Can't do it. Kudos on the set and the wardrobe. This was already a story, already a well established well loved story. And seeing it live action would have been a joy even if it was word for word the books. Can't do it. Won't do it. This is beyond creative license. Taking a beloved series and rewriting it to suit your own needs is just an insult to the people who would have loved it."	3	"[""turkeypants: The showrunner described it as a different turning of the wheel. You know how in the books they say there are seven ages on the wheel of time and each has its turn and passes and later comes again - well he says this is a different turning of the same age. That's just figurative and it's a cop out to basically justify all the things they're doing differently. He's trying to pre-stave off the usual inevitable changes from the source material. \n\nBut yeah, there's a lot that's different in ways that sometimes don't feel necessary. Mat was a great character, a fan favorite, and they just made him be someone else for some reason. It's a good enough character but just not the same. I think Perrin is a dope and a bad actor. Lan isn't Lan, just some nice guy with the same name and title, easily cowed by Nynaeve. Loial looks like someone's sassy great aunt who acts like retired Santa Claus. The Tuatha-an look like dirty mishmash hippies outside a music festival. The Ways don't make sense in regard to the One Power. The Tar Valon set looks like some stale soap opera piece. Some of the trolloc CGI is bad. The fight at Tarwin's Gap was silly. There's some CW dramatic love triangle stuff. Min is too old and bitter. Yadda yadda yadda.\n\nThere are upsides. Moiraine is great and very Moiraine. The main bad guy Whitecloak to date, Valda but an apparent amalgam of him and another from the books, is excellent. Thom is a more plausible Tom to be out there on the road alone than white haired wiry old man book Thom. Nynaeve is still an ass but a somewhat more believable ass than ridiculous book Nynaeve. Rand and Egwene are just fine IMO. \n\nCan't remember the rest but I'm watching it in salvage mode to get what I can get. The overall tone and approach and depth aren't what I had hoped for and that's sad, but I'll see where they take it in season 2. We won't get another shot at this so I hope it improves."", 'cassigayle: It is an absolute cop out.\n\n\nI hear that a lot about the Nynaeve character from the books and... i resonated with that character so hard. I am a stubborn strong willed know-it-all at heart and it took sooo many years to see it in myself and stop getting in my own way. \n\nI think i loved how genuinely flawed they all were. Even especially Nynaeve and Mat.']"

And is there a way to block all types of videos on topic or keyword?  I mean, I like international videos, but I don't want to be bothered with the immense amount of Indian videos that keep coming up in International since I'm never going to watch them.

All too often, Amazon has too much poor functionality in between the rare good shows.  It's really disappointing.

GordonNewtron	21	v0d62c	AmazonPrimeVideo	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/v0d62c/amazon_shows_that_go_nowhere/	"I've watched two Amazon shows, Night Sky and Outer Range, which both teased some interesting concepts/plots, but dear lord these shows meander into a lot of empty episodes. 

Strong cast on both shows and high level of production, but both shows insist on making sure that characters don't communicate in any way and Jesus it draws out. The scripts seem a bit too *first drafty* and expect the viewer to be okay with that same type of monotonous dialogue for episodes on end. 

The marriage dynamics were good in Night Sky."	23	"['Edmdad48: I actually find that\'s the case with so many average series on Prime and Netflix.

At least skies had something in episode 8, but after watching I think 8 episodes of outer range with one weak twist and nothing but what I can only assume is build up I don't watch to watch more. I mean I already wasted 8 hours of my life on the show and I've gotten nothing from it. Brolin was really the only thing keeping me watching, none of the other characters really add anything.

Is this an issue where streaming it through a browser is causing this and I need to use the app? only windows app seems to be on the microsoft store, is there a non ms store version of the application available?

the UI is also stupidly large, why does the pause/forward/back take up the entire screen and take forever to fade out, can this be adjusted? I can't seem to find any settings.

About ""The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power"" Amazon Studios’ forthcoming series brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien’s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.

Browser: Chrome, Version 99.0.4844.84 (Official Build) (x86\_64)

Country: USA

Steps Taken: 

* Restarted laptop
* Verified browser is up to date
* Verified MacOS is on latest possible version for the laptop in question.
* Disabled uBlock Origin for the Amazon Prime site
* Tried logging into my account in Firefox (version 98.0.2) and can watch video in that browser
* I've searched in this Reddit sub as well as elsewhere online and on Amazon's site for a solution

I'd rather watch in Chrome but this doesn't seem possible. I keep getting an error 7031. Looking through Amazon's help page for that error, I don't think that anything that I haven't listed applies. I'm not on a VPN. My internet connection is functioning properly since I've been working from home and using my laptop for other sites.

Any ideas why Chrome won't work? I keep getting the same 7031 error.

Thank you!"	0	[]

Garbage for a company making money hand over fist and managing to pay nothing in taxes. What trash	Osaella24	9	tnq16x	AmazonPrimeVideo	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/tnq16x/amazon_prime_video_ui_is_an_unnavigable_garbage/	Edit:  since everyone is complaining about my slightly hyperbolic comparison to the quality of old VHS tapes made during the height of a moment of frustration,  let me clarify.  The picture quality on my latest gen Apple TV with fiber internet is consistently pixelated with low resolution and audio/video syncing problems ranging from timing being out of sync to video freezing while audio continues to video dropping entirely while audio continues.  This is legitimately a consistent problem.  I have very poor quality video more often than good quality.	18	"[""zitsky: You can't honestly compare the video quality to a VHS tape.  Come on!

My Prime Video keeps telling me I'm behind a VPN even though I'm not. I've called amazon a million times and they tell me it's an issue with my ISP.

I ask because I have a slow internet connection and haven't switched to fiber yet.  I can watch HD movies just fine but 4K movies don't always work properly.
